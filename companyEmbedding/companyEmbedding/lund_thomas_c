                     Predrilled holes in truck needed to be cleaned up. Once that was done brackets went on easily and adjustment channels made it easy to get treads in the right position. Very functional and are attractive to the appearance of my 2010 Silverado Crew Cab.

                     Ordering the Bars was a nightmare to say the least. They sent the wrong ones two times and they are not exactly light when you have to return them to a FedX store.  Box was badly labeled so of course I was under the truck trying to figure them out when I realized they were wrong. When I finally got the right ones they went on easy and they looked great. Worth the money but not the aggrevation.  Lund was the main problem since they were shipped from their factory.  Bad business LUND.

                     I ordered the 5" oval composite chrome bars but was a little leary about how they would look compared to the SS polished.  The finish looks great, they are very functional, and they were a cinch to install.  I'm very happy with my purchase.  The customer service staff was great to work with... the best I've experienced in a long time.

                     I ordered the steps on March 29 and received them on April 2. Very quick turnaround. The guy who helped me out on the phone when ordering was great. The steps were easy to put on after watching the video on you tube. In box instructions were very vague. I would definitely order from autoanything again.

                     The Lund 5" Oval Nerf Bars are a great addition to my truck. The chrome brings some enhancement to the overall look of the truck. They fit perfect and the 5" were definitely the way to go. The price were the best I found online.

                     I love these Nerf bars for several good reasons. They stick out far enough to stop a lot of "door dings". Very solid platform to stand on. Polish up nicely.

                     The Lund nerf bars are a great addition to my Z71. They are wide enough for everyone ya have a safe step into the truck. And they look great

                     These nerf bars look great on my 2014 chevy silverado crew cab, installation was very easy, it only took around 45 minutes, the price was unbeatable, the bars shipped very fast, and they came packed very neatly.

                     My install only took about 1.5hrs by myself. After I installed the bars I took a scissors and cut off about 1/4in off of the rubber grommets then reinstalled them back on the truck frame to help keep dirt, salt ect... out of the frame. These nerf bars look great on my 2012 Silverado!

                     These are great. Wicked easy to install. My 
4 year old helped me and both installed in 45
Minutes. They look awesome too. Only con
Is that they sound hollow and are loud going 
Through puddles. No worries though.

His privately held company, Customer Development Corporation (CDC), specialized in database management and marketing for financial institutions and other various companies around the world. In 1987, CDC was honored by Inc. Magazine as the 8th fastest growing privately held company in the country. Tom, who is credited worldwide with many technical and creative innovations in the database marketing industry, also received the coveted “High-Tech Entrepreneur of the Year” award by Entrepreneur Magazine.

Tom then established Lund Capital Group, a private commercial real estate company that has holdings in various regions across the United States.
In addition to Tom’s business interests, he and his wife Carol are very active philanthropists. The Lunds founded the Praise and Leadership Schools (“PALS”), based in Peoria, IL. The schools strive to deliver education in a manner that makes learning fun and engaging and helps to discover the unique gifts that each child possesses. The Lunds are pleased to be able to continue their commitment of helping children with the time and resources they devote to the Naples Winter Wine Festival which was founded to benefit local children’s charities. The Lunds were among the founding members whose commitment made the Naples Winter Wine Festival, now in it’s twelfth year, one of the top charity wine auctions in the world. The festival has raised $140 million to date for children’s charities in Collier County. The Lunds continue to serve as Trustees for the Naples Winter Wine Festival. Carol is currently on the Board of Directors for the Golisano Children’s Museum of Naples, is a former member of the Board of Trustees at Seacrest Country Day School, has served on the Naples Winter Wine Festival Grant Committee, and continues to be active in St. John’s Church Education.
