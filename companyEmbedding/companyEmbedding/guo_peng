The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Research Fellow
The University of Auckland: Auckland Bioengineering Institute


Biography
Peng finished his PhD at the University of Canterbury, focused on quantifying nurse workload in ICU by developing a novel tracking system, and study the correlation between nurse workload and patient acuity level, to optimized allocate nurse resource to the right patient. Thesis Title: Analysing Nursing Workload in Intensive Care Unit by Using a Novel Objective Tracking System. Previously he worked as a mechatronic engineer in product design field for 2 years in China.
Now he is working in Auckland Bioengineering Institute (Auckland University) as a Research Fellow, focusing on developing a novel eye tracking system to precisely identify optokinetic nystagmus (involuntary eye movement) for adults and children, to identify eye disease and cure them. 
He will keep on working in bio-engineering field, using research and engineering skills to develop novel practical product that can help patients and ease their pain.


Research  | Current
His work focus on developing a novel eye tracking system to accurately detect optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) for adults and children, to help test visual acuity and identify eye disease. In addition, he focuses on develop tracking systems into a readily portable mobile device (Tablet and smart phone), that will help improve public health.


Responsibilities
Research
·         Lead the development and validation of eye tracking system (algorithms and hardware) for identifying and processing of eye movement (the optokinetic reflex).
Teaching / Supervision
·         Supervise the research activities of graduate students (BME, ME & PhD students)


Areas of expertise
 

Image processing using Matlab, C/C++ and OpenCV
Signal processing of the resulting data, including shape recognition and tracking
Working in a clinical environment
Communicating with nursing and medical staff
SolidWorks, AutoCAD
Mechanical product design
