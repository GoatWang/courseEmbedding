Micro Focus International plc is a multinational software and information technology business based in Newbury, Berkshire, England. The firm provides software and consultancy services for clients updating legacy systems to more modern platforms. The company is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.
On September 7, 2016, a merger was announced between Micro Focus and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, where Micro Focus would acquire software assets of HPE, and HPE shareholders would own 50.1 percent of the merged company. The resultant company would retain its current name and listing on the London Stock Exchange.[2]

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1976,[3] and in its early years, concentrated on COBOL products. In 1981, it became the first company to win the Queen's Award for Industry purely for developing a software product. The product was CIS COBOL, a standard-compliant COBOL implementation for microcomputers.[4]





The Micro Focus logo circa 1985.


In 1998, the company acquired Intersolv Inc, an applications enablement business, for US$534 million[5] and the combined business was renamed Merant.[3] In 2001 the business was demerged from Merant with help from Golden Gate Capital Partners and once again became Micro Focus.[6] It was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2005.[7]
On June 2008, the company acquired the Israeli NASDAQ listed software company NetManage for US$73.3 million.[8]
In July 2009, the company acquired Borland, a developer of application lifecycle management tools, as well as the Quality Solutions (including automation tool Test Partner) part of Compuware.[9]
In 2011, the company alleged that the New South Wales Police Force and other agencies were using 16,500 copies of its ViewNow software on various computers when police and other agencies were only ever entitled to 6,500 licences. The group initially alleged A$10 million in damages but later increased this to A$12 million after reviewing the results of a court-ordered audit of the police force's computer systems. The police force maintained during the court proceedings that it had paid for a site licence that entitled it to unlimited installations of the software for all of its officers. Despite this, it settled the matter out of court in 2012, for an undisclosed sum. The other agencies previously settled the matter out of court, also for undisclosed sums.[10]
In December 2013, Micro Focus acquired the Orbix, Orbacus and Artix software product lines from Progress Software. These market-leading implementations of the CORBA standard were originally developed by IONA Technologies.[11]
On 15 September 2014, Micro Focus announced that it would acquire The Attachmate Group for US$1.2 billion in shares, which will give it ownership of the Attachmate, NetIQ, Novell, and SUSE product lines. Attachmate's parent company Wizard Parent LLC—consisting of the investment groups Elliott Management Corporation, Francisco Partners, Golden Gate Capital, and Thoma Bravo, will hold a 40% stake in Micro Focus post-acquisition.[12][13]
On 2015, Micro Focus acquired Authasas, which produces authentication middleware.[14]
On 22 March 2016, Micro Focus announced its intent to acquire Serena Software, then valued at $540 million.[15] The acquisition was completed on 2 May, 2016.[16]
On 7 September 2016, Micro Focus announced its intent to merge with Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s software business segment.[17][18]
Operations[edit]
The product areas consist of Visual COBOL, mainframe products and services, and Borland.[19]

On September 7, 2016, a merger was announced between Micro Focus and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, where Micro Focus would acquire software assets of HPE, and HPE shareholders would own 50.1 percent of the merged company. The resultant company would retain its current name and listing on the London Stock Exchange.[2]

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1976,[3] and in its early years, concentrated on COBOL products. In 1981, it became the first company to win the Queen's Award for Industry purely for developing a software product. The product was CIS COBOL, a standard-compliant COBOL implementation for microcomputers.[4]





The Micro Focus logo circa 1985.


In 1998, the company acquired Intersolv Inc, an applications enablement business, for US$534 million[5] and the combined business was renamed Merant.[3] In 2001 the business was demerged from Merant with help from Golden Gate Capital Partners and once again became Micro Focus.[6] It was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2005.[7]
On June 2008, the company acquired the Israeli NASDAQ listed software company NetManage for US$73.3 million.[8]
In July 2009, the company acquired Borland, a developer of application lifecycle management tools, as well as the Quality Solutions (including automation tool Test Partner) part of Compuware.[9]
In 2011, the company alleged that the New South Wales Police Force and other agencies were using 16,500 copies of its ViewNow software on various computers when police and other agencies were only ever entitled to 6,500 licences. The group initially alleged A$10 million in damages but later increased this to A$12 million after reviewing the results of a court-ordered audit of the police force's computer systems. The police force maintained during the court proceedings that it had paid for a site licence that entitled it to unlimited installations of the software for all of its officers. Despite this, it settled the matter out of court in 2012, for an undisclosed sum. The other agencies previously settled the matter out of court, also for undisclosed sums.[10]
In December 2013, Micro Focus acquired the Orbix, Orbacus and Artix software product lines from Progress Software. These market-leading implementations of the CORBA standard were originally developed by IONA Technologies.[11]
On 15 September 2014, Micro Focus announced that it would acquire The Attachmate Group for US$1.2 billion in shares, which will give it ownership of the Attachmate, NetIQ, Novell, and SUSE product lines. Attachmate's parent company Wizard Parent LLC—consisting of the investment groups Elliott Management Corporation, Francisco Partners, Golden Gate Capital, and Thoma Bravo, will hold a 40% stake in Micro Focus post-acquisition.[12][13]
On 2015, Micro Focus acquired Authasas, which produces authentication middleware.[14]
On 22 March 2016, Micro Focus announced its intent to acquire Serena Software, then valued at $540 million.[15] The acquisition was completed on 2 May, 2016.[16]
On 7 September 2016, Micro Focus announced its intent to merge with Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s software business segment.[17][18]
Operations[edit]
The product areas consist of Visual COBOL, mainframe products and services, and Borland.[19]

While a Director of IT oversees all IT operations, a CTO oversees all customer-facing applications development as well as related internal IT tasks. A Chief Architect also handles client-side applications architecture.

Internally, the company has divisions including Applications Development, Solutions Delivery, Support Services, and IT Technology Services. Applications Development largely handles the development of internal business applications that the company purchases from others, while Solutions Delivery focuses on IT project management. Support Services provides IT help desk services, while IT Technology Services handles all internal IT infrastructure tasks, including database administration, data center management, server management, and network operations. Each division provides for its own IT security needs rather than having the company establish an entirely separate division.

                                   Micro Focus:
    Our History
                                











                    The 40-year Micro Focus story is part history, part legend, part tale.
                

                    Sure, as with any good storytelling it might have been embellished a bit here and there,
    but there’s no doubt that it’s a chronicle of great success, great challenges,
    and dogged determination; of breathless chutzpah and calculated risks.
    And studded throughout the chapters are the colorful characters who give it flair, nuance, and depth.
    In other words, a very entertaining read.

        In 1977, Micro Focus landed its first original equipment manufacturer (OEM) contract.
        Dataskil, a software arm of ICL, tasked them with developing a COBOL compiler for an
        early Singer microcomputer. Compilers—programs that ‘translate’ source code from one
        programming language into machine code—were unwieldy and too big for one machine.
        COBOL played a significant part in the company’s rapid expansion during that year
        and was a major milestone in the road to where we are today.
    

        By mid 1984, Micro Focus had flourished from a private company with a staff of 70 to
        a public company with 220 employees and a worldwide customer base. And it was just
        the beginning. We opened offices in Munich and Washington; moved into larger offices
        in Philadelphia, and expanded our Japanese market. We started our strategy of
        acquisition with the purchase of Softwright and we launched Professional COBOL.
    

        And as was de rigueur of any hot IT company at the time, the infrastructure and
        staff payroll included a fleet of chauffeured cars, and a helicopter and two pilots.
        It was a period of fabled corporate excess and indulgence. And it couldn’t last.

        It was to be the beginning of some dark days—rather years. In 1989, the company’s
        center of gravity shifted to California and Brian, Paul, and Stewart took turns
        working from a new office in Palo Alto. Tremors ran through the company and employees
        were left feeling adrift and abandoned. But the show must go on.
    

        Acquisitions started to come thick and fast in the form of XDB Systems, Stingray
        Software, Innovative Solutions Inc., Burl, and Creative Systems Interface.
    

        What followed was a series of changing leadership checkered with brilliant and
        beleaguered alike. These were tricky times for Micro Focus. The longstanding culture
        of family values and shared passion was extinguished. Sadly, but perhaps unsurprisingly,
        Micro Focus disappeared from view in February 1999, subsumed into the new corporate
        identity and rebranded Merant.
    

        Yet, despite its ignoble circumstances and bleak outlook, plans were afoot within
        Merant to liberate Micro Focus’ heritage.

        buyout, and CFO Richard Lloyd, rang the bell at the LSE on behalf of the company.
    

        We continued to expand, investing in Orbix, the world’s most widely deployed enterprise
        COBRA solution. This put Micro Focus products in the business-critical IT systems of
        three quarters of the world’s largest financial institutions. It also put us on the
        financial IT support map.
    

        Of all the mergers and acquisitions Micro Focus was involved in until that point, it
        was the 2014 acquisition of The Attachment Group (TAG) that was truly transformational.
        The TAG acquisition added the Attachmate®, Novell®, NetIQ® and SUSE® brands—and 3,300
        people with deep knowledge of their sector—to the Micro Focus stable of market-leading
        enterprise IT solutions.

The company profile grows to include enterprise authentication solutions. 















        In 2016, we acquired Serena®, a pioneer in the processes and technologies that deliver
        enterprise DevOps solutions. This moved us into another key industry space, and
        welcomed many people and technologies back into the family from Serena, originally
        spun out from the dissolution of Merant. The year also saw Stephen Murdoch, who was
        appointed COO of Micro Focus in 2014, become CEO. At the same time, Nils Brauckmann
        was appointed CEO of the now highly focused SUSE business. Both joined the board of
        Micro Focus in February.
    

        A few busy months followed. In September 2016, we announced our intention to merge
        with HP Enterprise’s (HPE) software, in a transaction valued at around US$8.8 billion.
        Subject to standard closing conditions, the deal is expected to close in Q3 2017.
        Later that month, we also acquired GWAVA, Inc., welcoming a worldwide leader in
        Enterprise Information Archiving into the family.
    

        What a remarkable journey it’s been so far. It’s a fast-moving world where, as
        they say, change is the only constant. Regardless of how they came to be part of the
        Micro Focus family, all our people and technologies have seen, driven, and lived four
        decades of change. While on paper our company is about providing innovative technology
        solutions, it’s actually about people.
    

        So, a sincere and heartfelt “thank you” to everyone who has contributed to Micro
        Focus’s remarkable journey so far.

Micro Focus International plc is a multinational software and information technology business based in Newbury, Berkshire, England. The firm provides software and consultancy services for clients updating legacy systems to more modern platforms. The company is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.
On September 7, 2016, a merger was announced between Micro Focus and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, where Micro Focus would acquire software assets of HPE, and HPE shareholders would own 50.1 percent of the merged company. The resultant company would retain its current name and listing on the London Stock Exchange.[2]

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1976,[3] and in its early years, concentrated on COBOL products. In 1981, it became the first company to win the Queen's Award for Industry purely for developing a software product. The product was CIS COBOL, a standard-compliant COBOL implementation for microcomputers.[4]





The Micro Focus logo circa 1985.


In 1998, the company acquired Intersolv Inc, an applications enablement business, for US$534 million[5] and the combined business was renamed Merant.[3] In 2001 the business was demerged from Merant with help from Golden Gate Capital Partners and once again became Micro Focus.[6] It was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2005.[7]
On June 2008, the company acquired the Israeli NASDAQ listed software company NetManage for US$73.3 million.[8]
In July 2009, the company acquired Borland, a developer of application lifecycle management tools, as well as the Quality Solutions (including automation tool Test Partner) part of Compuware.[9]
In 2011, the company alleged that the New South Wales Police Force and other agencies were using 16,500 copies of its ViewNow software on various computers when police and other agencies were only ever entitled to 6,500 licences. The group initially alleged A$10 million in damages but later increased this to A$12 million after reviewing the results of a court-ordered audit of the police force's computer systems. The police force maintained during the court proceedings that it had paid for a site licence that entitled it to unlimited installations of the software for all of its officers. Despite this, it settled the matter out of court in 2012, for an undisclosed sum. The other agencies previously settled the matter out of court, also for undisclosed sums.[10]
In December 2013, Micro Focus acquired the Orbix, Orbacus and Artix software product lines from Progress Software. These market-leading implementations of the CORBA standard were originally developed by IONA Technologies.[11]
On 15 September 2014, Micro Focus announced that it would acquire The Attachmate Group for US$1.2 billion in shares, which will give it ownership of the Attachmate, NetIQ, Novell, and SUSE product lines. Attachmate's parent company Wizard Parent LLC—consisting of the investment groups Elliott Management Corporation, Francisco Partners, Golden Gate Capital, and Thoma Bravo, will hold a 40% stake in Micro Focus post-acquisition.[12][13]
On 2015, Micro Focus acquired Authasas, which produces authentication middleware.[14]
On 22 March 2016, Micro Focus announced its intent to acquire Serena Software, then valued at $540 million.[15] The acquisition was completed on 2 May, 2016.[16]
On 7 September 2016, Micro Focus announced its intent to merge with Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s software business segment.[17][18]
Operations[edit]
The product areas consist of Visual COBOL, mainframe products and services, and Borland.[19]

Micro Focus International plc is a multinational software and information technology business based in Newbury, Berkshire, England. The firm provides software and consultancy services for clients updating legacy systems to more modern platforms. The company is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.
On September 7, 2016, a merger was announced between Micro Focus and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, where Micro Focus would acquire software assets of HPE, and HPE shareholders would own 50.1 percent of the merged company. The resultant company would retain its current name and listing on the London Stock Exchange.[2]

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1976,[3] and in its early years, concentrated on COBOL products. In 1981, it became the first company to win the Queen's Award for Industry purely for developing a software product. The product was CIS COBOL, a standard-compliant COBOL implementation for microcomputers.[4]





The Micro Focus logo circa 1985.


In 1998, the company acquired Intersolv Inc, an applications enablement business, for US$534 million[5] and the combined business was renamed Merant.[3] In 2001 the business was demerged from Merant with help from Golden Gate Capital Partners and once again became Micro Focus.[6] It was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2005.[7]
On June 2008, the company acquired the Israeli NASDAQ listed software company NetManage for US$73.3 million.[8]
In July 2009, the company acquired Borland, a developer of application lifecycle management tools, as well as the Quality Solutions (including automation tool Test Partner) part of Compuware.[9]
In 2011, the company alleged that the New South Wales Police Force and other agencies were using 16,500 copies of its ViewNow software on various computers when police and other agencies were only ever entitled to 6,500 licences. The group initially alleged A$10 million in damages but later increased this to A$12 million after reviewing the results of a court-ordered audit of the police force's computer systems. The police force maintained during the court proceedings that it had paid for a site licence that entitled it to unlimited installations of the software for all of its officers. Despite this, it settled the matter out of court in 2012, for an undisclosed sum. The other agencies previously settled the matter out of court, also for undisclosed sums.[10]
In December 2013, Micro Focus acquired the Orbix, Orbacus and Artix software product lines from Progress Software. These market-leading implementations of the CORBA standard were originally developed by IONA Technologies.[11]
On 15 September 2014, Micro Focus announced that it would acquire The Attachmate Group for US$1.2 billion in shares, which will give it ownership of the Attachmate, NetIQ, Novell, and SUSE product lines. Attachmate's parent company Wizard Parent LLC—consisting of the investment groups Elliott Management Corporation, Francisco Partners, Golden Gate Capital, and Thoma Bravo, will hold a 40% stake in Micro Focus post-acquisition.[12][13]
On 2015, Micro Focus acquired Authasas, which produces authentication middleware.[14]
On 22 March 2016, Micro Focus announced its intent to acquire Serena Software, then valued at $540 million.[15] The acquisition was completed on 2 May, 2016.[16]
On 7 September 2016, Micro Focus announced its intent to merge with Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s software business segment.[17][18]
Operations[edit]
The product areas consist of Visual COBOL, mainframe products and services, and Borland.[19]
