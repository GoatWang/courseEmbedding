Icahn was raised in the Far Rockaway, Queens section of New York City, where he attended Far Rockaway High School.[5] His family was Jewish.[6][7] His father, an atheist,[8] was a cantor, and later a substitute teacher. His mother also worked as a schoolteacher.[9] Carl graduated from Princeton University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy in 1957 and then entered New York University School of Medicine, but he dropped out after two years to join the army reserves.[8][10][11]
Investment career[edit]
Early career and 'corporate raider' years: 1961–2005[edit]




This aircraft had originally been built in 1999 for TWA, as part of its last-minute fleet renewal, but due to Icahn's hostile take over was sold to American Airlines, instead.


Icahn began his career on Wall Street as a stockbroker in 1961; in 1968, he formed Icahn & Co., a securities firm that focused on risk arbitrage and options trading.[12] In 1978, he began taking controlling positions in individual companies.[5] Icahn developed a reputation as a "corporate raider" after his hostile takeover of Trans World Airlines in 1985.[1] Icahn systematically sold TWA's assets to repay the money he borrowed to purchase the company, which was described as "asset stripping." In 1988, Icahn took TWA private, gaining a personal profit of $469 million, and leaving TWA with a debt of $540 million. In 1991, he sold TWA's London routes to American Airlines for $445 million.[2] He formed lowestfares.com to sell TWA tickets and acquired portions of Global Leisure Travel from Ramy El-Batrawi to merge into it.[13]
Icahn launched an unsuccessful $7 billion hostile takeover for 89% of U.S. Steel in late 1986.[14]
In July 2001 Icahn’s Riverdale, LLC loaned Genesisintermedia $100 million in exchange for an option to purchase 2 million shares of the company.[15][16]
In 2004, after Mylan Laboratories had announced a deal to acquire King Pharmaceuticals, Icahn purchased a large block of stock and threatened a proxy fight over the acquisition. Mylan later gave up its efforts to acquire King.
Take over offers and pharmaceutical holdings: 2005–2010[edit]
In 2005, XO Holding announced its intention to sell the wired part of its business for $700 million to its majority shareholder and chairman Icahn; the money would be used to pay back its debts and to buy back its preferred stock for about $600 million from Icahn. Icahn would have then owned the wired business outright, and still own his 60% stake in XO. In spite of Icahn's majority ownership and the board of directors declaring the deal to be in the best interest of shareholders, R2 and other minority shareholders defeated the attempt through the Delaware Court in 2008, which awarded penalties for damages to the business caused by Icahn's self-dealing and/or conflict of interest.
In February 2006, a group led by Icahn (with 3.3% of the stock) and Lazard Frères CEO Bruce Wasserstein proposed the breakup of Time Warner into four companies and stock buybacks totaling approximately $20 billion; they agreed not to contest the re-election of Time Warner's slate of board members at the 2006 shareholders meeting if Time Warner would buy back up $20 billion of stock, nominate more independent members to the board of directors, cut $1 billion of costs by 2007, and continue discussions with the group on the future of Time Warner Cable. In August 2006, he bought stock in the video game publisher Take-Two Interactive, and later increased his holdings to 11.3% in 2009, becoming the company's second largest shareholder.[17]
In January 2007, he purchased a 9.2% stake in Telik, a biotech company engaged in cancer research. By that time he was also the beneficial owner of 6.1 million shares, of WCI Communities. He also owned about 33.5 million shares of Motorola, but in May was refused a seat on its Board of Directors. On February 9, 2007, Lear Corporation's board of directors accepted a $2.3 billion takeover offer from Icahn.[18][19] That month he also invested $50 million in Motricity, a North Carolina-based provider of mobile content delivery technology. In 2007, Icahn and his affiliates also owned majority positions in ACF Industries, American Railcar Industries, Philip Services, and NYSE-listed Icahn Enterprises, By September he also owned of 8.5% of the business software company BEA Systems. He increased his holdings to 13% in October,[20] two months before Oracle Corporation announced it was purchasing BEA Systems.[21] Beginning in 2007, Icahn gradually increased his stake in biotechnology company Biogen Idec.[22][23]
Icahn sold his casino interests in Nevada in February 2008, including the Stratosphere, Arizona Charlie's Boulder, Arizona Charlie's Decatur, and Aquarius Casino Resort which were operated through American Entertainment Properties, a subsidiary of Icahn Enterprises. The sale price of $1.3 billion was roughly $1 billion more than he paid for the properties. In March 2008, Icahn sued Motorola as part of his effort to gain four seats on Motorola's board and force a sale of its mobile business.[24] That month, a story about Icahn aired on American news program, 60 Minutes, with reporter Lesley Stahl and he also appeared on Nightly Business Report and discussed his views on proxy fights.[25] In May that year Icahn purchased a large block of shares in Yahoo, and shortly thereafter threatened to start a proxy fight to remove Yahoo's board of directors in response to their rejection of Microsoft's takeover bid.[26] Instead, he forced an agreement to expand Yahoo's board to eleven members, including Icahn and two others of his choice.[27] In June 2008, Icahn launched The Icahn Report, which hosts United Shareholders of America where individual investors can sign up and campaign for shareholder rights. In September/October 2008 Icahn was involved in the rejected attempted purchase of Imclone by Bristol Myers Squibb and in the eventual sale of Imclone to Eli Lilly in an all-cash deal valued at $6.5 billion.[28] In December that year he filed suit against Realogy over a proposed debt swap.[29]
In April 2009, Icahn engaged in a proxy battle for Amylin.[30] In September he offered to buy the shares of XO he did not already own for 55 cents each. He later raised his offer to 80 cents, but it expired. In October he resigned from the board of directors at Yahoo!,[31] and by the following February had reduced his equity stake from a one-time high of 75 million shares to 12 million shares.[32]
Icahn was a director of Blockbuster until January 2010 and the chairman of Imclone, Icahn Enterprises, XO Communications, WestPoint Home, Cadus, and American Railcar Industries. He is a beneficial owner of Adventrx Pharmaceuticals, and Vector Group. Icahn also tried to take over Marvel Comics.[33] Icahn, through a subsidiary of his Icahn Enterprises LP, acquired the Fontainebleau property in Las Vegas for about $150 million in February 2010. In March he was one of a group of lenders who purchased Tropicana Casino and Resort Atlantic City, bringing the company out of bankruptcy for $200 million. Also in March he conducted a failed takeover bid of Lionsgate Films.[34] In May he announced ownership of about 12% of Hain Celestial Group Inc.,[35] and the purchase of an 8.54% stake in Lawson Software,[36]
Proxy battles and technology positions: 2010–2015[edit]

In January 2011, Icahn once more made a bid to purchase the remaining shares of the XO Holder common stock.[38] By February he had accumulated a 9.08% stake in The Clorox Company (CLX).[39] On March 15, 2011, Mentor's board issued a strong warning to its shareholders against a proxy action by Icahn.[40]
In October 2012, Icahn purchased a 10% stake in Netflix.[41][42] In November he was involved in a proxy battle over control of the Oshkosh Corp. board of directors.
In February 2013, Forbes listed Icahn as one of the 40 Highest-Earning hedge fund managers.[43] By April he had accumulated a 9.2% stake in Nuance Communications, Inc.[44] On August 2, 2013, Icahn sued computer giant Dell and its board in an attempt to derail a $24.4 billion buyout bid by the CEO, Michael Dell, in favor of his own rumored forthcoming bid.[45] In 2013 Icahn was an outspoken proponent of Apple;[46][47] In October that year he held a 4.7 million share position.[48] In October 2013, Icahn acquired around 61 million shares in Talisman Energy prompting shares in the ailing Canadian oil producer to surge.[49] Also that month he sold about 50% of his shares in Netflix for a profit in excess of 800 million in less than one year. In November he acquired a 12.5% interest in Hologic, a medical device and diagnostics manufacturer.
In January, 2014, Icahn bought another half-billion worth of Apple Inc. shares, stating they're "very cheap."[50] Also in January, Icahn proposed to eBay to spin off PayPal, an e-commerce business. This started a proxy fight which was settled by April.[51] By June 2014, had acquired a 9.4 percent stake in Family Dollar. Now the biggest shareholder, he becomes involved in a deal whereby Family Dollar is bought by Dollar Tree for $8.5 billion. He then disposed of about a third of his stake. In October 2014, Icahn took a stake in Canadian energy company Talisman Energy. The company's stock price went down by 71% and he sold his shares two months later.[52]
Lyft, PayPal, & other pursuits: 2015–present[edit]
On May 15, 2015, Icahn made a $100 million investment in the ride-sharing service Lyft.[53] In November 2015, Icahn hired CBRE Group Inc. to market the unfinished resort Fontainebleau Las Vegas to potential buyers.[54] That month he swapped his stake of eBay for the same number of shares in PayPal Holdings.[55] At that time Icahn held a 7.13% stake in Xerox; he was the second-largest investor after The Vanguard Group.[56] In December 2015 Icahn made a qualifying offer to purchase the auto-parts and maintenance chain Pep Boys for $15.50 a share.[57] He also raised his stake in the Houston-based energy company Cheniere Energy to 13.8, making him its largest shareholder.[58]
In January 2016, Icahn held a 4.66% stake in Gannett Co. Inc.,[59] and also held shares in Cheniere Energy and Freeport-McMoRan, both of which declined in value.[52] Icahn sold his Apple shares in April 2016, citing concerns about Apple's relationship with China.[60] In August of that year he purchased 10 percent ownership of Herbalife; his holdings in the company were about 19 million shares by October.[61] Also in October Icahn closed the Trump Taj Mahal Casino in Atlantic City, citing a $350 million USD loss over a few years as well as being unable to reach a negotiation deal with union workers on strike. Nearly 3,000 workers lost their jobs.[62][63] That year he also increased his holdings in the car rental company Hertz, after the company's stock price had declined significantly.[64]
Personal life[edit]
In 1979, Icahn married Liba Trejbal, a ballerina from the former Czechoslovakia.[65][66][67] They separated in 1993 and divorced in 1999 after years of litigation during which Liba sought to invalidate a prenuptial agreement she had signed prior to their marriage, claiming duress as she was pregnant at the time.[68] Liba originally fought Icahn's offer of roughly $1.5 million a year because he was worth billions at the time and eventually settled for an undisclosed amount.[67][69] They have two children, one of whom is Brett Icahn.[65]
In 1999, Icahn married his longtime assistant and former broker, Gail Golden.[67] She has two children from a prior marriage.[65]
Political and economic views[edit]
Icahn endorsed Donald Trump for the 2016 U.S. presidential election. He also announced the formation of a super PAC pledging $150 million to push for corporate tax reform, in particular of inversions, which occur when corporations leave the U.S. to take advantage of lower tax rates elsewhere.[70]
Upon becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Trump announced that he would nominate Icahn for Treasury Secretary.[71] However, this position went to Steve Mnuchin instead. [72] [73]
Bernie Sanders criticized Icahn's investment operations in Atlantic City. Icahn disputed Sanders' remarks acknowledging the general income inequality issue.[74][75]
On December 21, 2016, it was announced that Icahn would serve as Special Advisor to the President on Regulatory Reform under President Donald Trump.[76] CNBC reported that Icahn would aid Trump in an "individual capacity" rather than as a federal employee, and that he would not have "specific duties" and therefore would not have to relinquish his business interests while serving as an advisor to Trump.[77]
When the President had Icahn interview Scott Pruitt during consideration of his nomination as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Icahn specifically asked Pruitt about his position on the EPA's Renewable Fuel Standard.[78] Icahn has also spoken directly to President Trump and to Gary Cohn about his proposed changes to the ethanol rule.[78] CVR Energy, in which Icahn has 82% ownership, would save $205.9 million a year if Icahn's proposal is adopted.[78]The Sugar Land, Texas oil refinery benefited when President Trump made an exception to his regulation freeze to expand the tax advantage of master limited partnerships.[78] CVR Energy’s stock doubled after President Trump's election, increasing $455 million in value.[78]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]




The Carl C. Icahn Center for Science at Choate Rosemary Hall


According to Forbes Magazine, Icahn has a net worth of $16.6 billion USD making him the 26th wealthiest person on the Forbes 400, and the 5th wealthiest hedge fund manager as of February 2017.[3]
Icahn Stadium on Randall's Island in New York City is named after him, as is the Carl C. Icahn Center for Science and Icahn Scholar Program at Choate Rosemary Hall, a prep school in Connecticut. This organization pays for tuition, room and board, books, and supplies for 10 students every year for four years (freshman-senior), an expense that adds up to about $160,000 per student.
Icahn made a substantial contribution to his alma mater, Princeton University, to fund a genomics laboratory which bears his name, the Carl C. Icahn Laboratory at the University's Institute for Integrated Genomics. He also made large contributions to Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, of which he is a trustee, which in return not only named a building the Icahn Medical Institute designed by Davis Brody Bond, but also, in 2013, renamed the Mount Sinai School of Medicine as the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. The genomics institute led by Eric Schadt was also renamed and is now the Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology.




The Carl C. Icahn Laboratory at Princeton University


His foundation, the Children's Rescue Fund, built Icahn House in The Bronx, a 65-unit complex for homeless families consisting of single pregnant women and single women with children, and operates Icahn House East and Icahn House West, both of which are homeless shelters located in New York City.
Icahn has received a number of awards, including the Starlight Foundation's Founders Award and its 1990 Man of the Year Award. He was also named Guardian Angel 2001 Man of the Year. In 2004, he was honored by the Center for Educational Innovation –  Public Education Association for his work with charter schools. In 2006, he was honored with the 100 Women in Hedge Funds Effecting Change Award for his outstanding contributions to improving education.
In 2010, Icahn joined the Giving Pledge list, pledging to give away more than half his fortune, yet has not decided on the specific beneficiaries.[79][80]
On January 30, 2016, Icahn donated $1 million for US veterans groups at a Des Moines, Iowa, fundraiser held by Donald Trump.[81]
Thoroughbred horse racing[edit]
In 1985 Icahn established Foxfield Thoroughbreds, a horse breeding operation. At that year's Newstead Farm Trust sale run by Fasig-Tipton, he paid $4 million for Larida, a 6-year-old mare and a record $7 million for the 4-year-old bay mare Miss Oceana who was in foal to champion sire, Northern Dancer.[82]
Icahn's Meadow Star won the 1990 Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies and was voted the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Two-Year-Old Filly. In 1992, Foxfield ended its racing operation and became a commercial breeder. Having bred more than 140 stakes horses, in 2004 Icahn shut down Foxfield, selling all his mares and weanlings without reserve at the Keeneland Sales November breeding stock auction.[83]

Early life and education[edit]
Icahn was raised in the Far Rockaway, Queens section of New York City, where he attended Far Rockaway High School.[5] His family was Jewish.[6][7] His father, an atheist,[8] was a cantor, and later a substitute teacher. His mother also worked as a schoolteacher.[9] Carl graduated from Princeton University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy in 1957 and then entered New York University School of Medicine, but he dropped out after two years to join the army reserves.[8][10][11]
Investment career[edit]
Early career and 'corporate raider' years: 1961–2005[edit]




This aircraft had originally been built in 1999 for TWA, as part of its last-minute fleet renewal, but due to Icahn's hostile take over was sold to American Airlines, instead.


Icahn began his career on Wall Street as a stockbroker in 1961; in 1968, he formed Icahn & Co., a securities firm that focused on risk arbitrage and options trading.[12] In 1978, he began taking controlling positions in individual companies.[5] Icahn developed a reputation as a "corporate raider" after his hostile takeover of Trans World Airlines in 1985.[1] Icahn systematically sold TWA's assets to repay the money he borrowed to purchase the company, which was described as "asset stripping." In 1988, Icahn took TWA private, gaining a personal profit of $469 million, and leaving TWA with a debt of $540 million. In 1991, he sold TWA's London routes to American Airlines for $445 million.[2] He formed lowestfares.com to sell TWA tickets and acquired portions of Global Leisure Travel from Ramy El-Batrawi to merge into it.[13]
Icahn launched an unsuccessful $7 billion hostile takeover for 89% of U.S. Steel in late 1986.[14]
In July 2001 Icahn’s Riverdale, LLC loaned Genesisintermedia $100 million in exchange for an option to purchase 2 million shares of the company.[15][16]
In 2004, after Mylan Laboratories had announced a deal to acquire King Pharmaceuticals, Icahn purchased a large block of stock and threatened a proxy fight over the acquisition. Mylan later gave up its efforts to acquire King.
Take over offers and pharmaceutical holdings: 2005–2010[edit]
In 2005, XO Holding announced its intention to sell the wired part of its business for $700 million to its majority shareholder and chairman Icahn; the money would be used to pay back its debts and to buy back its preferred stock for about $600 million from Icahn. Icahn would have then owned the wired business outright, and still own his 60% stake in XO. In spite of Icahn's majority ownership and the board of directors declaring the deal to be in the best interest of shareholders, R2 and other minority shareholders defeated the attempt through the Delaware Court in 2008, which awarded penalties for damages to the business caused by Icahn's self-dealing and/or conflict of interest.
In February 2006, a group led by Icahn (with 3.3% of the stock) and Lazard Frères CEO Bruce Wasserstein proposed the breakup of Time Warner into four companies and stock buybacks totaling approximately $20 billion; they agreed not to contest the re-election of Time Warner's slate of board members at the 2006 shareholders meeting if Time Warner would buy back up $20 billion of stock, nominate more independent members to the board of directors, cut $1 billion of costs by 2007, and continue discussions with the group on the future of Time Warner Cable. In August 2006, he bought stock in the video game publisher Take-Two Interactive, and later increased his holdings to 11.3% in 2009, becoming the company's second largest shareholder.[17]
In January 2007, he purchased a 9.2% stake in Telik, a biotech company engaged in cancer research. By that time he was also the beneficial owner of 6.1 million shares, of WCI Communities. He also owned about 33.5 million shares of Motorola, but in May was refused a seat on its Board of Directors. On February 9, 2007, Lear Corporation's board of directors accepted a $2.3 billion takeover offer from Icahn.[18][19] That month he also invested $50 million in Motricity, a North Carolina-based provider of mobile content delivery technology. In 2007, Icahn and his affiliates also owned majority positions in ACF Industries, American Railcar Industries, Philip Services, and NYSE-listed Icahn Enterprises, By September he also owned of 8.5% of the business software company BEA Systems. He increased his holdings to 13% in October,[20] two months before Oracle Corporation announced it was purchasing BEA Systems.[21] Beginning in 2007, Icahn gradually increased his stake in biotechnology company Biogen Idec.[22][23]
Icahn sold his casino interests in Nevada in February 2008, including the Stratosphere, Arizona Charlie's Boulder, Arizona Charlie's Decatur, and Aquarius Casino Resort which were operated through American Entertainment Properties, a subsidiary of Icahn Enterprises. The sale price of $1.3 billion was roughly $1 billion more than he paid for the properties. In March 2008, Icahn sued Motorola as part of his effort to gain four seats on Motorola's board and force a sale of its mobile business.[24] That month, a story about Icahn aired on American news program, 60 Minutes, with reporter Lesley Stahl and he also appeared on Nightly Business Report and discussed his views on proxy fights.[25] In May that year Icahn purchased a large block of shares in Yahoo, and shortly thereafter threatened to start a proxy fight to remove Yahoo's board of directors in response to their rejection of Microsoft's takeover bid.[26] Instead, he forced an agreement to expand Yahoo's board to eleven members, including Icahn and two others of his choice.[27] In June 2008, Icahn launched The Icahn Report, which hosts United Shareholders of America where individual investors can sign up and campaign for shareholder rights. In September/October 2008 Icahn was involved in the rejected attempted purchase of Imclone by Bristol Myers Squibb and in the eventual sale of Imclone to Eli Lilly in an all-cash deal valued at $6.5 billion.[28] In December that year he filed suit against Realogy over a proposed debt swap.[29]
In April 2009, Icahn engaged in a proxy battle for Amylin.[30] In September he offered to buy the shares of XO he did not already own for 55 cents each. He later raised his offer to 80 cents, but it expired. In October he resigned from the board of directors at Yahoo!,[31] and by the following February had reduced his equity stake from a one-time high of 75 million shares to 12 million shares.[32]
Icahn was a director of Blockbuster until January 2010 and the chairman of Imclone, Icahn Enterprises, XO Communications, WestPoint Home, Cadus, and American Railcar Industries. He is a beneficial owner of Adventrx Pharmaceuticals, and Vector Group. Icahn also tried to take over Marvel Comics.[33] Icahn, through a subsidiary of his Icahn Enterprises LP, acquired the Fontainebleau property in Las Vegas for about $150 million in February 2010. In March he was one of a group of lenders who purchased Tropicana Casino and Resort Atlantic City, bringing the company out of bankruptcy for $200 million. Also in March he conducted a failed takeover bid of Lionsgate Films.[34] In May he announced ownership of about 12% of Hain Celestial Group Inc.,[35] and the purchase of an 8.54% stake in Lawson Software,[36]
Proxy battles and technology positions: 2010–2015[edit]
In May 2010 Icahn held 6.9% stake in Mentor Graphics;[37] in July he acquired a 14 percent stake in the company; Mentor then signed a poison-pill provision. In February 2011 Icahn made an offer to buy the company for about $1.86 billion in cash.
In January 2011, Icahn once more made a bid to purchase the remaining shares of the XO Holder common stock.[38] By February he had accumulated a 9.08% stake in The Clorox Company (CLX).[39] On March 15, 2011, Mentor's board issued a strong warning to its shareholders against a proxy action by Icahn.[40]
In October 2012, Icahn purchased a 10% stake in Netflix.[41][42] In November he was involved in a proxy battle over control of the Oshkosh Corp. board of directors.
In February 2013, Forbes listed Icahn as one of the 40 Highest-Earning hedge fund managers.[43] By April he had accumulated a 9.2% stake in Nuance Communications, Inc.[44] On August 2, 2013, Icahn sued computer giant Dell and its board in an attempt to derail a $24.4 billion buyout bid by the CEO, Michael Dell, in favor of his own rumored forthcoming bid.[45] In 2013 Icahn was an outspoken proponent of Apple;[46][47] In October that year he held a 4.7 million share position.[48] In October 2013, Icahn acquired around 61 million shares in Talisman Energy prompting shares in the ailing Canadian oil producer to surge.[49] Also that month he sold about 50% of his shares in Netflix for a profit in excess of 800 million in less than one year. In November he acquired a 12.5% interest in Hologic, a medical device and diagnostics manufacturer.
In January, 2014, Icahn bought another half-billion worth of Apple Inc. shares, stating they're "very cheap."[50] Also in January, Icahn proposed to eBay to spin off PayPal, an e-commerce business. This started a proxy fight which was settled by April.[51] By June 2014, had acquired a 9.4 percent stake in Family Dollar. Now the biggest shareholder, he becomes involved in a deal whereby Family Dollar is bought by Dollar Tree for $8.5 billion. He then disposed of about a third of his stake. In October 2014, Icahn took a stake in Canadian energy company Talisman Energy. The company's stock price went down by 71% and he sold his shares two months later.[52]
Lyft, PayPal, & other pursuits: 2015–present[edit]
On May 15, 2015, Icahn made a $100 million investment in the ride-sharing service Lyft.[53] In November 2015, Icahn hired CBRE Group Inc. to market the unfinished resort Fontainebleau Las Vegas to potential buyers.[54] That month he swapped his stake of eBay for the same number of shares in PayPal Holdings.[55] At that time Icahn held a 7.13% stake in Xerox; he was the second-largest investor after The Vanguard Group.[56] In December 2015 Icahn made a qualifying offer to purchase the auto-parts and maintenance chain Pep Boys for $15.50 a share.[57] He also raised his stake in the Houston-based energy company Cheniere Energy to 13.8, making him its largest shareholder.[58]
In January 2016, Icahn held a 4.66% stake in Gannett Co. Inc.,[59] and also held shares in Cheniere Energy and Freeport-McMoRan, both of which declined in value.[52] Icahn sold his Apple shares in April 2016, citing concerns about Apple's relationship with China.[60] In August of that year he purchased 10 percent ownership of Herbalife; his holdings in the company were about 19 million shares by October.[61] Also in October Icahn closed the Trump Taj Mahal Casino in Atlantic City, citing a $350 million USD loss over a few years as well as being unable to reach a negotiation deal with union workers on strike. Nearly 3,000 workers lost their jobs.[62][63] That year he also increased his holdings in the car rental company Hertz, after the company's stock price had declined significantly.[64]
Personal life[edit]
In 1979, Icahn married Liba Trejbal, a ballerina from the former Czechoslovakia.[65][66][67] They separated in 1993 and divorced in 1999 after years of litigation during which Liba sought to invalidate a prenuptial agreement she had signed prior to their marriage, claiming duress as she was pregnant at the time.[68] Liba originally fought Icahn's offer of roughly $1.5 million a year because he was worth billions at the time and eventually settled for an undisclosed amount.[67][69] They have two children, one of whom is Brett Icahn.[65]
In 1999, Icahn married his longtime assistant and former broker, Gail Golden.[67] She has two children from a prior marriage.[65]
Political and economic views[edit]
Icahn endorsed Donald Trump for the 2016 U.S. presidential election. He also announced the formation of a super PAC pledging $150 million to push for corporate tax reform, in particular of inversions, which occur when corporations leave the U.S. to take advantage of lower tax rates elsewhere.[70]
Upon becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Trump announced that he would nominate Icahn for Treasury Secretary.[71] However, this position went to Steve Mnuchin instead. [72] [73]
Bernie Sanders criticized Icahn's investment operations in Atlantic City. Icahn disputed Sanders' remarks acknowledging the general income inequality issue.[74][75]
On December 21, 2016, it was announced that Icahn would serve as Special Advisor to the President on Regulatory Reform under President Donald Trump.[76] CNBC reported that Icahn would aid Trump in an "individual capacity" rather than as a federal employee, and that he would not have "specific duties" and therefore would not have to relinquish his business interests while serving as an advisor to Trump.[77]
When the President had Icahn interview Scott Pruitt during consideration of his nomination as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Icahn specifically asked Pruitt about his position on the EPA's Renewable Fuel Standard.[78] Icahn has also spoken directly to President Trump and to Gary Cohn about his proposed changes to the ethanol rule.[78] CVR Energy, in which Icahn has 82% ownership, would save $205.9 million a year if Icahn's proposal is adopted.[78]The Sugar Land, Texas oil refinery benefited when President Trump made an exception to his regulation freeze to expand the tax advantage of master limited partnerships.[78] CVR Energy’s stock doubled after President Trump's election, increasing $455 million in value.[78]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]




The Carl C. Icahn Center for Science at Choate Rosemary Hall


According to Forbes Magazine, Icahn has a net worth of $16.6 billion USD making him the 26th wealthiest person on the Forbes 400, and the 5th wealthiest hedge fund manager as of February 2017.[3]
Icahn Stadium on Randall's Island in New York City is named after him, as is the Carl C. Icahn Center for Science and Icahn Scholar Program at Choate Rosemary Hall, a prep school in Connecticut. This organization pays for tuition, room and board, books, and supplies for 10 students every year for four years (freshman-senior), an expense that adds up to about $160,000 per student.
Icahn made a substantial contribution to his alma mater, Princeton University, to fund a genomics laboratory which bears his name, the Carl C. Icahn Laboratory at the University's Institute for Integrated Genomics. He also made large contributions to Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, of which he is a trustee, which in return not only named a building the Icahn Medical Institute designed by Davis Brody Bond, but also, in 2013, renamed the Mount Sinai School of Medicine as the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. The genomics institute led by Eric Schadt was also renamed and is now the Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology.




The Carl C. Icahn Laboratory at Princeton University


His foundation, the Children's Rescue Fund, built Icahn House in The Bronx, a 65-unit complex for homeless families consisting of single pregnant women and single women with children, and operates Icahn House East and Icahn House West, both of which are homeless shelters located in New York City.
Icahn has received a number of awards, including the Starlight Foundation's Founders Award and its 1990 Man of the Year Award. He was also named Guardian Angel 2001 Man of the Year. In 2004, he was honored by the Center for Educational Innovation –  Public Education Association for his work with charter schools. In 2006, he was honored with the 100 Women in Hedge Funds Effecting Change Award for his outstanding contributions to improving education.
In 2010, Icahn joined the Giving Pledge list, pledging to give away more than half his fortune, yet has not decided on the specific beneficiaries.[79][80]
On January 30, 2016, Icahn donated $1 million for US veterans groups at a Des Moines, Iowa, fundraiser held by Donald Trump.[81]
Thoroughbred horse racing[edit]
In 1985 Icahn established Foxfield Thoroughbreds, a horse breeding operation. At that year's Newstead Farm Trust sale run by Fasig-Tipton, he paid $4 million for Larida, a 6-year-old mare and a record $7 million for the 4-year-old bay mare Miss Oceana who was in foal to champion sire, Northern Dancer.[82]
Icahn's Meadow Star won the 1990 Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies and was voted the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Two-Year-Old Filly. In 1992, Foxfield ended its racing operation and became a commercial breeder. Having bred more than 140 stakes horses, in 2004 Icahn shut down Foxfield, selling all his mares and weanlings without reserve at the Keeneland Sales November breeding stock auction.[83]

Carl Icahn ( Trades , Portfolio ), an investor known for effecting change at companies he invests in, today reported the product of his recent division of hardware company Xerox ( XRX ) - a haul of 19,806,00 shares of the new services company, Conduent ( CNDT ).Icahn had begun amassing his stake totaling 99,030,026 shares of Xerox in the fourth quarter of 2015. By Nov. 8, the company announced its decision to divide into two entities and issue to shareholders one share of Conduent for every five shares of Xerox. Icahn received his stake in Conduent, which is one-fifth of his stake in Xerox, in the distribution and effectively owns 9.77% of the new company.Conduent shares tumbled by 9.8% since they began trading on Jan. 3, priced at $13.44 at close Tuesday. Xerox's shares have risen 1% year to date, closing at $7.03.Conduent, a $2.59 billion company, the business services side of Xerox, offers customer care, transportation services, health care and digital payments. Xerox will still focus on digital print and technology services. Icahn also owns 9.77% of Xerox, after ramping up his holding through the first half of 2016.The separation represents the culmination of Icahn's efforts to unlock value at Xerox that began in late 2015. With the purchase of his stake, he also installed three members to its board.Xerox, a $7.09 billion company, had $11 billion in revenue in 2015, while Conduent, with a market value of $2.59 billion, had revenue of about $7 billion.Icahn gave his approbation of the separation in a series of tweets when it was announced last year.1/4 Happy to announce we reached an agreement with $XRX re: separation into two independent public companies: https://t.co/KoRmzNkzTb-- Carl Icahn (Trades, Portfolio) (@Carl_C_Icahn) January 29, 20162/4 We believe the separation will greatly enhance value for $XRX shareholders-- Carl Icahn (Trades, Portfolio) (@Carl_C_Icahn) January 29, 20163/4 I applaud and respect Ursula Burns for doing what she believes shareholders want - as @Donahoe_John did with $EBAY and $PYPL-- Carl Icahn (Trades, Portfolio) (@Carl_C_Icahn) January 29, 20164/4 I hope and believe the results will be just as good for $XRX shareholders-- Carl Icahn (Trades, Portfolio) (@Carl_C_Icahn) January 29, 2016Icahn, who has worked on Wall Street for almost for more than half a century, joined President Donald Trump's administration last month as special adviser to the president on regulatory reform.

Early life and education[edit]
Icahn was raised in the Far Rockaway, Queens section of New York City, where he attended Far Rockaway High School.[5] His family was Jewish.[6][7] His father, an atheist,[8] was a cantor, and later a substitute teacher. His mother also worked as a schoolteacher.[9] Carl graduated from Princeton University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy in 1957 and then entered New York University School of Medicine, but he dropped out after two years to join the army reserves.[8][10][11]
Investment career[edit]
Early career and 'corporate raider' years: 1961–2005[edit]




This aircraft had originally been built in 1999 for TWA, as part of its last-minute fleet renewal, but due to Icahn's hostile take over was sold to American Airlines, instead.


Icahn began his career on Wall Street as a stockbroker in 1961; in 1968, he formed Icahn & Co., a securities firm that focused on risk arbitrage and options trading.[12] In 1978, he began taking controlling positions in individual companies.[5] Icahn developed a reputation as a "corporate raider" after his hostile takeover of Trans World Airlines in 1985.[1] Icahn systematically sold TWA's assets to repay the money he borrowed to purchase the company, which was described as "asset stripping." In 1988, Icahn took TWA private, gaining a personal profit of $469 million, and leaving TWA with a debt of $540 million. In 1991, he sold TWA's London routes to American Airlines for $445 million.[2] He formed lowestfares.com to sell TWA tickets and acquired portions of Global Leisure Travel from Ramy El-Batrawi to merge into it.[13]
Icahn launched an unsuccessful $7 billion hostile takeover for 89% of U.S. Steel in late 1986.[14]
In July 2001 Icahn’s Riverdale, LLC loaned Genesisintermedia $100 million in exchange for an option to purchase 2 million shares of the company.[15][16]
In 2004, after Mylan Laboratories had announced a deal to acquire King Pharmaceuticals, Icahn purchased a large block of stock and threatened a proxy fight over the acquisition. Mylan later gave up its efforts to acquire King.
Take over offers and pharmaceutical holdings: 2005–2010[edit]
In 2005, XO Holding announced its intention to sell the wired part of its business for $700 million to its majority shareholder and chairman Icahn; the money would be used to pay back its debts and to buy back its preferred stock for about $600 million from Icahn. Icahn would have then owned the wired business outright, and still own his 60% stake in XO. In spite of Icahn's majority ownership and the board of directors declaring the deal to be in the best interest of shareholders, R2 and other minority shareholders defeated the attempt through the Delaware Court in 2008, which awarded penalties for damages to the business caused by Icahn's self-dealing and/or conflict of interest.
In February 2006, a group led by Icahn (with 3.3% of the stock) and Lazard Frères CEO Bruce Wasserstein proposed the breakup of Time Warner into four companies and stock buybacks totaling approximately $20 billion; they agreed not to contest the re-election of Time Warner's slate of board members at the 2006 shareholders meeting if Time Warner would buy back up $20 billion of stock, nominate more independent members to the board of directors, cut $1 billion of costs by 2007, and continue discussions with the group on the future of Time Warner Cable. In August 2006, he bought stock in the video game publisher Take-Two Interactive, and later increased his holdings to 11.3% in 2009, becoming the company's second largest shareholder.[17]
In January 2007, he purchased a 9.2% stake in Telik, a biotech company engaged in cancer research. By that time he was also the beneficial owner of 6.1 million shares, of WCI Communities. He also owned about 33.5 million shares of Motorola, but in May was refused a seat on its Board of Directors.

In September/October 2008 Icahn was involved in the rejected attempted purchase of Imclone by Bristol Myers Squibb and in the eventual sale of Imclone to Eli Lilly in an all-cash deal valued at $6.5 billion.[28] In December that year he filed suit against Realogy over a proposed debt swap.[29]

In November he acquired a 12.5% interest in Hologic, a medical device and diagnostics manufacturer.
In January, 2014, Icahn bought another half-billion worth of Apple Inc. shares, stating they're "very cheap."[50] Also in January, Icahn proposed to eBay to spin off PayPal, an e-commerce business. This started a proxy fight which was settled by April.[51] By June 2014, had acquired a 9.4 percent stake in Family Dollar.

On May 15, 2015, Icahn made a $100 million investment in the ride-sharing service Lyft.[53] In November 2015, Icahn hired CBRE Group Inc. to market the unfinished resort Fontainebleau Las Vegas to potential buyers.[54] That month he swapped his stake of eBay for the same number of shares in PayPal Holdings.[55] At that time Icahn held a 7.13% stake in Xerox; he was the second-largest investor after The Vanguard Group.[56] In December 2015 Icahn made a qualifying offer to purchase the auto-parts and maintenance chain Pep Boys for $15.50 a share.[57] He also raised his stake in the Houston-based energy company Cheniere Energy to 13.8, making him its largest shareholder.[58]
In January 2016, Icahn held a 4.66% stake in Gannett Co. Inc.,[59] and also held shares in Cheniere Energy and Freeport-McMoRan, both of which declined in value.[52] Icahn sold his Apple shares in April 2016, citing concerns about Apple's relationship with China.[60] In August of that year he purchased 10 percent ownership of Herbalife; his holdings in the company were about 19 million shares by October.[61] Also in October Icahn closed the Trump Taj Mahal Casino in Atlantic City, citing a $350 million USD loss over a few years as well as being unable to reach a negotiation deal with union workers on strike. Nearly 3,000 workers lost their jobs.[62][63] That year he also increased his holdings in the car rental company Hertz, after the company's stock price had declined significantly.[64]
Personal life[edit]
In 1979, Icahn married Liba Trejbal, a ballerina from the former Czechoslovakia.[65][66][67] They separated in 1993 and divorced in 1999 after years of litigation during which Liba sought to invalidate a prenuptial agreement she had signed prior to their marriage, claiming duress as she was pregnant at the time.[68] Liba originally fought Icahn's offer of roughly $1.5 million a year because he was worth billions at the time and eventually settled for an undisclosed amount.[67][69] They have two children, one of whom is Brett Icahn.[65]
In 1999, Icahn married his longtime assistant and former broker, Gail Golden.[67] She has two children from a prior marriage.[65]
Political and economic views[edit]
Icahn endorsed Donald Trump for the 2016 U.S. presidential election. He also announced the formation of a super PAC pledging $150 million to push for corporate tax reform, in particular of inversions, which occur when corporations leave the U.S. to take advantage of lower tax rates elsewhere.[70]
Upon becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Trump announced that he would nominate Icahn for Treasury Secretary.[71] However, this position went to Steve Mnuchin instead. [72] [73]
Bernie Sanders criticized Icahn's investment operations in Atlantic City. Icahn disputed Sanders' remarks acknowledging the general income inequality issue.[74][75]
On December 21, 2016, it was announced that Icahn would serve as Special Advisor to the President on Regulatory Reform under President Donald Trump.[76] CNBC reported that Icahn would aid Trump in an "individual capacity" rather than as a federal employee, and that he would not have "specific duties" and therefore would not have to relinquish his business interests while serving as an advisor to Trump.[77]
When the President had Icahn interview Scott Pruitt during consideration of his nomination as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Icahn specifically asked Pruitt about his position on the EPA's Renewable Fuel Standard.[78] Icahn has also spoken directly to President Trump and to Gary Cohn about his proposed changes to the ethanol rule.[78] CVR Energy, in which Icahn has 82% ownership, would save $205.9 million a year if Icahn's proposal is adopted.[78]The Sugar Land, Texas oil refinery benefited when President Trump made an exception to his regulation freeze to expand the tax advantage of master limited partnerships.[78] CVR Energy’s stock doubled after President Trump's election, increasing $455 million in value.[78]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]




The Carl C. Icahn Center for Science at Choate Rosemary Hall


According to Forbes Magazine, Icahn has a net worth of $16.6 billion USD making him the 26th wealthiest person on the Forbes 400, and the 5th wealthiest hedge fund manager as of February 2017.[3]
Icahn Stadium on Randall's Island in New York City is named after him, as is the Carl C. Icahn Center for Science and Icahn Scholar Program at Choate Rosemary Hall, a prep school in Connecticut. This organization pays for tuition, room and board, books, and supplies for 10 students every year for four years (freshman-senior), an expense that adds up to about $160,000 per student.
Icahn made a substantial contribution to his alma mater, Princeton University, to fund a genomics laboratory which bears his name, the Carl C. Icahn Laboratory at the University's Institute for Integrated Genomics. He also made large contributions to Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, of which he is a trustee, which in return not only named a building the Icahn Medical Institute designed by Davis Brody Bond, but also, in 2013, renamed the Mount Sinai School of Medicine as the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. The genomics institute led by Eric Schadt was also renamed and is now the Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology.




The Carl C. Icahn Laboratory at Princeton University


His foundation, the Children's Rescue Fund, built Icahn House in The Bronx, a 65-unit complex for homeless families consisting of single pregnant women and single women with children, and operates Icahn House East and Icahn House West, both of which are homeless shelters located in New York City.
Icahn has received a number of awards, including the Starlight Foundation's Founders Award and its 1990 Man of the Year Award. He was also named Guardian Angel 2001 Man of the Year. In 2004, he was honored by the Center for Educational Innovation –  Public Education Association for his work with charter schools. In 2006, he was honored with the 100 Women in Hedge Funds Effecting Change Award for his outstanding contributions to improving education.
In 2010, Icahn joined the Giving Pledge list, pledging to give away more than half his fortune, yet has not decided on the specific beneficiaries.[79][80]
On January 30, 2016, Icahn donated $1 million for US veterans groups at a Des Moines, Iowa, fundraiser held by Donald Trump.[81]
Thoroughbred horse racing[edit]
In 1985 Icahn established Foxfield Thoroughbreds, a horse breeding operation. At that year's Newstead Farm Trust sale run by Fasig-Tipton, he paid $4 million for Larida, a 6-year-old mare and a record $7 million for the 4-year-old bay mare Miss Oceana who was in foal to champion sire, Northern Dancer.[82]
Icahn's Meadow Star won the 1990 Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies and was voted the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Two-Year-Old Filly. In 1992, Foxfield ended its racing operation and became a commercial breeder. Having bred more than 140 stakes horses, in 2004 Icahn shut down Foxfield, selling all his mares and weanlings without reserve at the Keeneland Sales November breeding stock auction.[83]

Early life and education[edit]
Icahn was raised in the Far Rockaway, Queens section of New York City, where he attended Far Rockaway High School.[5] His family was Jewish.[6][7] His father, an atheist,[8] was a cantor, and later a substitute teacher. His mother also worked as a schoolteacher.[9] Carl graduated from Princeton University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy in 1957 and then entered New York University School of Medicine, but he dropped out after two years to join the army reserves.[8][10][11]
Investment career[edit]
Early career and 'corporate raider' years: 1961–2005[edit]




This aircraft had originally been built in 1999 for TWA, as part of its last-minute fleet renewal, but due to Icahn's hostile take over was sold to American Airlines, instead.


Icahn began his career on Wall Street as a stockbroker in 1961; in 1968, he formed Icahn & Co., a securities firm that focused on risk arbitrage and options trading.[12] In 1978, he began taking controlling positions in individual companies.[5] Icahn developed a reputation as a "corporate raider" after his hostile takeover of Trans World Airlines in 1985.[1] Icahn systematically sold TWA's assets to repay the money he borrowed to purchase the company, which was described as "asset stripping." In 1988, Icahn took TWA private, gaining a personal profit of $469 million, and leaving TWA with a debt of $540 million. In 1991, he sold TWA's London routes to American Airlines for $445 million.[2] He formed lowestfares.com to sell TWA tickets and acquired portions of Global Leisure Travel from Ramy El-Batrawi to merge into it.[13]
Icahn launched an unsuccessful $7 billion hostile takeover for 89% of U.S. Steel in late 1986.[14]
In July 2001 Icahn’s Riverdale, LLC loaned Genesisintermedia $100 million in exchange for an option to purchase 2 million shares of the company.[15][16]
In 2004, after Mylan Laboratories had announced a deal to acquire King Pharmaceuticals, Icahn purchased a large block of stock and threatened a proxy fight over the acquisition. Mylan later gave up its efforts to acquire King.
Take over offers and pharmaceutical holdings: 2005–2010[edit]
In 2005, XO Holding announced its intention to sell the wired part of its business for $700 million to its majority shareholder and chairman Icahn; the money would be used to pay back its debts and to buy back its preferred stock for about $600 million from Icahn. Icahn would have then owned the wired business outright, and still own his 60% stake in XO. In spite of Icahn's majority ownership and the board of directors declaring the deal to be in the best interest of shareholders, R2 and other minority shareholders defeated the attempt through the Delaware Court in 2008, which awarded penalties for damages to the business caused by Icahn's self-dealing and/or conflict of interest.
In February 2006, a group led by Icahn (with 3.3% of the stock) and Lazard Frères CEO Bruce Wasserstein proposed the breakup of Time Warner into four companies and stock buybacks totaling approximately $20 billion; they agreed not to contest the re-election of Time Warner's slate of board members at the 2006 shareholders meeting if Time Warner would buy back up $20 billion of stock, nominate more independent members to the board of directors, cut $1 billion of costs by 2007, and continue discussions with the group on the future of Time Warner Cable. In August 2006, he bought stock in the video game publisher Take-Two Interactive, and later increased his holdings to 11.3% in 2009, becoming the company's second largest shareholder.[17]
In January 2007, he purchased a 9.2% stake in Telik, a biotech company engaged in cancer research. By that time he was also the beneficial owner of 6.1 million shares, of WCI Communities. He also owned about 33.5 million shares of Motorola, but in May was refused a seat on its Board of Directors. On February 9, 2007, Lear Corporation's board of directors accepted a $2.3 billion takeover offer from Icahn.[18][19] That month he also invested $50 million in Motricity, a North Carolina-based provider of mobile content delivery technology. In 2007, Icahn and his affiliates also owned majority positions in ACF Industries, American Railcar Industries, Philip Services, and NYSE-listed Icahn Enterprises, By September he also owned of 8.5% of the business software company BEA Systems. He increased his holdings to 13% in October,[20] two months before Oracle Corporation announced it was purchasing BEA Systems.[21] Beginning in 2007, Icahn gradually increased his stake in biotechnology company Biogen Idec.[22][23]
Icahn sold his casino interests in Nevada in February 2008, including the Stratosphere, Arizona Charlie's Boulder, Arizona Charlie's Decatur, and Aquarius Casino Resort which were operated through American Entertainment Properties, a subsidiary of Icahn Enterprises. The sale price of $1.3 billion was roughly $1 billion more than he paid for the properties. In March 2008, Icahn sued Motorola as part of his effort to gain four seats on Motorola's board and force a sale of its mobile business.[24] That month, a story about Icahn aired on American news program, 60 Minutes, with reporter Lesley Stahl and he also appeared on Nightly Business Report and discussed his views on proxy fights.[25] In May that year Icahn purchased a large block of shares in Yahoo, and shortly thereafter threatened to start a proxy fight to remove Yahoo's board of directors in response to their rejection of Microsoft's takeover bid.[26] Instead, he forced an agreement to expand Yahoo's board to eleven members, including Icahn and two others of his choice.[27] In June 2008, Icahn launched The Icahn Report, which hosts United Shareholders of America where individual investors can sign up and campaign for shareholder rights. In September/October 2008 Icahn was involved in the rejected attempted purchase of Imclone by Bristol Myers Squibb and in the eventual sale of Imclone to Eli Lilly in an all-cash deal valued at $6.5 billion.[28] In December that year he filed suit against Realogy over a proposed debt swap.[29]
In April 2009, Icahn engaged in a proxy battle for Amylin.[30] In September he offered to buy the shares of XO he did not already own for 55 cents each. He later raised his offer to 80 cents, but it expired. In October he resigned from the board of directors at Yahoo!,[31] and by the following February had reduced his equity stake from a one-time high of 75 million shares to 12 million shares.[32]
Icahn was a director of Blockbuster until January 2010 and the chairman of Imclone, Icahn Enterprises, XO Communications, WestPoint Home, Cadus, and American Railcar Industries. He is a beneficial owner of Adventrx Pharmaceuticals, and Vector Group. Icahn also tried to take over Marvel Comics.[33] Icahn, through a subsidiary of his Icahn Enterprises LP, acquired the Fontainebleau property in Las Vegas for about $150 million in February 2010. In March he was one of a group of lenders who purchased Tropicana Casino and Resort Atlantic City, bringing the company out of bankruptcy for $200 million. Also in March he conducted a failed takeover bid of Lionsgate Films.[34] In May he announced ownership of about 12% of Hain Celestial Group Inc.,[35] and the purchase of an 8.54% stake in Lawson Software,[36]
Proxy battles and technology positions: 2010–2015[edit]
In May 2010 Icahn held 6.9% stake in Mentor Graphics;[37] in July he acquired a 14 percent stake in the company; Mentor then signed a poison-pill provision. In February 2011 Icahn made an offer to buy the company for about $1.86 billion in cash.
In January 2011, Icahn once more made a bid to purchase the remaining shares of the XO Holder common stock.[38] By February he had accumulated a 9.08% stake in The Clorox Company (CLX).[39] On March 15, 2011, Mentor's board issued a strong warning to its shareholders against a proxy action by Icahn.[40]
In October 2012, Icahn purchased a 10% stake in Netflix.[41][42] In November he was involved in a proxy battle over control of the Oshkosh Corp. board of directors.
In February 2013, Forbes listed Icahn as one of the 40 Highest-Earning hedge fund managers.[43] By April he had accumulated a 9.2% stake in Nuance Communications, Inc.[44] On August 2, 2013, Icahn sued computer giant Dell and its board in an attempt to derail a $24.4 billion buyout bid by the CEO, Michael Dell, in favor of his own rumored forthcoming bid.[45] In 2013 Icahn was an outspoken proponent of Apple;[46][47] In October that year he held a 4.7 million share position.[48] In October 2013, Icahn acquired around 61 million shares in Talisman Energy prompting shares in the ailing Canadian oil producer to surge.[49] Also that month he sold about 50% of his shares in Netflix for a profit in excess of 800 million in less than one year. In November he acquired a 12.5% interest in Hologic, a medical device and diagnostics manufacturer.
In January, 2014, Icahn bought another half-billion worth of Apple Inc. shares, stating they're "very cheap."[50] Also in January, Icahn proposed to eBay to spin off PayPal, an e-commerce business. This started a proxy fight which was settled by April.[51] By June 2014, had acquired a 9.4 percent stake in Family Dollar. Now the biggest shareholder, he becomes involved in a deal whereby Family Dollar is bought by Dollar Tree for $8.5 billion. He then disposed of about a third of his stake. In October 2014, Icahn took a stake in Canadian energy company Talisman Energy. The company's stock price went down by 71% and he sold his shares two months later.[52]
Lyft, PayPal, & other pursuits: 2015–present[edit]
On May 15, 2015, Icahn made a $100 million investment in the ride-sharing service Lyft.[53] In November 2015, Icahn hired CBRE Group Inc. to market the unfinished resort Fontainebleau Las Vegas to potential buyers.[54] That month he swapped his stake of eBay for the same number of shares in PayPal Holdings.[55] At that time Icahn held a 7.13% stake in Xerox; he was the second-largest investor after The Vanguard Group.[56] In December 2015 Icahn made a qualifying offer to purchase the auto-parts and maintenance chain Pep Boys for $15.50 a share.[57] He also raised his stake in the Houston-based energy company Cheniere Energy to 13.8, making him its largest shareholder.[58]
In January 2016, Icahn held a 4.66% stake in Gannett Co. Inc.,[59] and also held shares in Cheniere Energy and Freeport-McMoRan, both of which declined in value.[52] Icahn sold his Apple shares in April 2016, citing concerns about Apple's relationship with China.[60] In August of that year he purchased 10 percent ownership of Herbalife; his holdings in the company were about 19 million shares by October.[61] Also in October Icahn closed the Trump Taj Mahal Casino in Atlantic City, citing a $350 million USD loss over a few years as well as being unable to reach a negotiation deal with union workers on strike. Nearly 3,000 workers lost their jobs.[62][63] That year he also increased his holdings in the car rental company Hertz, after the company's stock price had declined significantly.[64]
Personal life[edit]
In 1979, Icahn married Liba Trejbal, a ballerina from the former Czechoslovakia.[65][66][67] They separated in 1993 and divorced in 1999 after years of litigation during which Liba sought to invalidate a prenuptial agreement she had signed prior to their marriage, claiming duress as she was pregnant at the time.[68] Liba originally fought Icahn's offer of roughly $1.5 million a year because he was worth billions at the time and eventually settled for an undisclosed amount.[67][69] They have two children, one of whom is Brett Icahn.[65]
In 1999, Icahn married his longtime assistant and former broker, Gail Golden.[67] She has two children from a prior marriage.[65]
Political and economic views[edit]
Icahn endorsed Donald Trump for the 2016 U.S. presidential election. He also announced the formation of a super PAC pledging $150 million to push for corporate tax reform, in particular of inversions, which occur when corporations leave the U.S. to take advantage of lower tax rates elsewhere.[70]
Upon becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Trump announced that he would nominate Icahn for Treasury Secretary.[71] However, this position went to Steve Mnuchin instead. [72] [73]
Bernie Sanders criticized Icahn's investment operations in Atlantic City. Icahn disputed Sanders' remarks acknowledging the general income inequality issue.[74][75]
On December 21, 2016, it was announced that Icahn would serve as Special Advisor to the President on Regulatory Reform under President Donald Trump.[76] CNBC reported that Icahn would aid Trump in an "individual capacity" rather than as a federal employee, and that he would not have "specific duties" and therefore would not have to relinquish his business interests while serving as an advisor to Trump.[77]
When the President had Icahn interview Scott Pruitt during consideration of his nomination as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Icahn specifically asked Pruitt about his position on the EPA's Renewable Fuel Standard.[78] Icahn has also spoken directly to President Trump and to Gary Cohn about his proposed changes to the ethanol rule.[78] CVR Energy, in which Icahn has 82% ownership, would save $205.9 million a year if Icahn's proposal is adopted.[78]The Sugar Land, Texas oil refinery benefited when President Trump made an exception to his regulation freeze to expand the tax advantage of master limited partnerships.[78] CVR Energy’s stock doubled after President Trump's election, increasing $455 million in value.[78]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]




The Carl C. Icahn Center for Science at Choate Rosemary Hall


According to Forbes Magazine, Icahn has a net worth of $16.6 billion USD making him the 26th wealthiest person on the Forbes 400, and the 5th wealthiest hedge fund manager as of February 2017.[3]
Icahn Stadium on Randall's Island in New York City is named after him, as is the Carl C. Icahn Center for Science and Icahn Scholar Program at Choate Rosemary Hall, a prep school in Connecticut. This organization pays for tuition, room and board, books, and supplies for 10 students every year for four years (freshman-senior), an expense that adds up to about $160,000 per student.
Icahn made a substantial contribution to his alma mater, Princeton University, to fund a genomics laboratory which bears his name, the Carl C. Icahn Laboratory at the University's Institute for Integrated Genomics. He also made large contributions to Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, of which he is a trustee, which in return not only named a building the Icahn Medical Institute designed by Davis Brody Bond, but also, in 2013, renamed the Mount Sinai School of Medicine as the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. The genomics institute led by Eric Schadt was also renamed and is now the Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology.




The Carl C. Icahn Laboratory at Princeton University


His foundation, the Children's Rescue Fund, built Icahn House in The Bronx, a 65-unit complex for homeless families consisting of single pregnant women and single women with children, and operates Icahn House East and Icahn House West, both of which are homeless shelters located in New York City.
Icahn has received a number of awards, including the Starlight Foundation's Founders Award and its 1990 Man of the Year Award. He was also named Guardian Angel 2001 Man of the Year. In 2004, he was honored by the Center for Educational Innovation –  Public Education Association for his work with charter schools. In 2006, he was honored with the 100 Women in Hedge Funds Effecting Change Award for his outstanding contributions to improving education.
In 2010, Icahn joined the Giving Pledge list, pledging to give away more than half his fortune, yet has not decided on the specific beneficiaries.[79][80]
On January 30, 2016, Icahn donated $1 million for US veterans groups at a Des Moines, Iowa, fundraiser held by Donald Trump.[81]
Thoroughbred horse racing[edit]
In 1985 Icahn established Foxfield Thoroughbreds, a horse breeding operation. At that year's Newstead Farm Trust sale run by Fasig-Tipton, he paid $4 million for Larida, a 6-year-old mare and a record $7 million for the 4-year-old bay mare Miss Oceana who was in foal to champion sire, Northern Dancer.[82]
Icahn's Meadow Star won the 1990 Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies and was voted the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Two-Year-Old Filly. In 1992, Foxfield ended its racing operation and became a commercial breeder. Having bred more than 140 stakes horses, in 2004 Icahn shut down Foxfield, selling all his mares and weanlings without reserve at the Keeneland Sales November breeding stock auction.[83]

Early life and education[edit]
Icahn was raised in the Far Rockaway, Queens section of New York City, where he attended Far Rockaway High School.[5] His family was Jewish.[6][7] His father, an atheist,[8] was a cantor, and later a substitute teacher. His mother also worked as a schoolteacher.[9] Carl graduated from Princeton University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy in 1957 and then entered New York University School of Medicine, but he dropped out after two years to join the army reserves.[8][10][11]
Investment career[edit]
Early career and 'corporate raider' years: 1961–2005[edit]




This aircraft had originally been built in 1999 for TWA, as part of its last-minute fleet renewal, but due to Icahn's hostile take over was sold to American Airlines, instead.


Icahn began his career on Wall Street as a stockbroker in 1961; in 1968, he formed Icahn & Co., a securities firm that focused on risk arbitrage and options trading.[12] In 1978, he began taking controlling positions in individual companies.[5] Icahn developed a reputation as a "corporate raider" after his hostile takeover of Trans World Airlines in 1985.[1] Icahn systematically sold TWA's assets to repay the money he borrowed to purchase the company, which was described as "asset stripping." In 1988, Icahn took TWA private, gaining a personal profit of $469 million, and leaving TWA with a debt of $540 million. In 1991, he sold TWA's London routes to American Airlines for $445 million.[2] He formed lowestfares.com to sell TWA tickets and acquired portions of Global Leisure Travel from Ramy El-Batrawi to merge into it.[13]
Icahn launched an unsuccessful $7 billion hostile takeover for 89% of U.S. Steel in late 1986.[14]
In July 2001 Icahn’s Riverdale, LLC loaned Genesisintermedia $100 million in exchange for an option to purchase 2 million shares of the company.[15][16]
In 2004, after Mylan Laboratories had announced a deal to acquire King Pharmaceuticals, Icahn purchased a large block of stock and threatened a proxy fight over the acquisition. Mylan later gave up its efforts to acquire King.
Take over offers and pharmaceutical holdings: 2005–2010[edit]
In 2005, XO Holding announced its intention to sell the wired part of its business for $700 million to its majority shareholder and chairman Icahn; the money would be used to pay back its debts and to buy back its preferred stock for about $600 million from Icahn. Icahn would have then owned the wired business outright, and still own his 60% stake in XO. In spite of Icahn's majority ownership and the board of directors declaring the deal to be in the best interest of shareholders, R2 and other minority shareholders defeated the attempt through the Delaware Court in 2008, which awarded penalties for damages to the business caused by Icahn's self-dealing and/or conflict of interest.
In February 2006, a group led by Icahn (with 3.3% of the stock) and Lazard Frères CEO Bruce Wasserstein proposed the breakup of Time Warner into four companies and stock buybacks totaling approximately $20 billion; they agreed not to contest the re-election of Time Warner's slate of board members at the 2006 shareholders meeting if Time Warner would buy back up $20 billion of stock, nominate more independent members to the board of directors, cut $1 billion of costs by 2007, and continue discussions with the group on the future of Time Warner Cable. In August 2006, he bought stock in the video game publisher Take-Two Interactive, and later increased his holdings to 11.3% in 2009, becoming the company's second largest shareholder.[17]
In January 2007, he purchased a 9.2% stake in Telik, a biotech company engaged in cancer research. By that time he was also the beneficial owner of 6.1 million shares, of WCI Communities. He also owned about 33.5 million shares of Motorola, but in May was refused a seat on its Board of Directors. On February 9, 2007, Lear Corporation's board of directors accepted a $2.3 billion takeover offer from Icahn.[18][19] That month he also invested $50 million in Motricity, a North Carolina-based provider of mobile content delivery technology. In 2007, Icahn and his affiliates also owned majority positions in ACF Industries, American Railcar Industries, Philip Services, and NYSE-listed Icahn Enterprises, By September he also owned of 8.5% of the business software company BEA Systems. He increased his holdings to 13% in October,[20] two months before Oracle Corporation announced it was purchasing BEA Systems.[21] Beginning in 2007, Icahn gradually increased his stake in biotechnology company Biogen Idec.[22][23]
Icahn sold his casino interests in Nevada in February 2008, including the Stratosphere, Arizona Charlie's Boulder, Arizona Charlie's Decatur, and Aquarius Casino Resort which were operated through American Entertainment Properties, a subsidiary of Icahn Enterprises. The sale price of $1.3 billion was roughly $1 billion more than he paid for the properties. In March 2008, Icahn sued Motorola as part of his effort to gain four seats on Motorola's board and force a sale of its mobile business.[24] That month, a story about Icahn aired on American news program, 60 Minutes, with reporter Lesley Stahl and he also appeared on Nightly Business Report and discussed his views on proxy fights.[25] In May that year Icahn purchased a large block of shares in Yahoo, and shortly thereafter threatened to start a proxy fight to remove Yahoo's board of directors in response to their rejection of Microsoft's takeover bid.[26] Instead, he forced an agreement to expand Yahoo's board to eleven members, including Icahn and two others of his choice.[27] In June 2008, Icahn launched The Icahn Report, which hosts United Shareholders of America where individual investors can sign up and campaign for shareholder rights. In September/October 2008 Icahn was involved in the rejected attempted purchase of Imclone by Bristol Myers Squibb and in the eventual sale of Imclone to Eli Lilly in an all-cash deal valued at $6.5 billion.[28] In December that year he filed suit against Realogy over a proposed debt swap.[29]
In April 2009, Icahn engaged in a proxy battle for Amylin.[30] In September he offered to buy the shares of XO he did not already own for 55 cents each. He later raised his offer to 80 cents, but it expired. In October he resigned from the board of directors at Yahoo!,[31] and by the following February had reduced his equity stake from a one-time high of 75 million shares to 12 million shares.[32]
Icahn was a director of Blockbuster until January 2010 and the chairman of Imclone, Icahn Enterprises, XO Communications, WestPoint Home, Cadus, and American Railcar Industries. He is a beneficial owner of Adventrx Pharmaceuticals, and Vector Group. Icahn also tried to take over Marvel Comics.[33] Icahn, through a subsidiary of his Icahn Enterprises LP, acquired the Fontainebleau property in Las Vegas for about $150 million in February 2010. In March he was one of a group of lenders who purchased Tropicana Casino and Resort Atlantic City, bringing the company out of bankruptcy for $200 million. Also in March he conducted a failed takeover bid of Lionsgate Films.[34] In May he announced ownership of about 12% of Hain Celestial Group Inc.,[35] and the purchase of an 8.54% stake in Lawson Software,[36]
Proxy battles and technology positions: 2010–2015[edit]
In May 2010 Icahn held 6.9% stake in Mentor Graphics;[37] in July he acquired a 14 percent stake in the company; Mentor then signed a poison-pill provision. In February 2011 Icahn made an offer to buy the company for about $1.86 billion in cash.
In January 2011, Icahn once more made a bid to purchase the remaining shares of the XO Holder common stock.[38] By February he had accumulated a 9.08% stake in The Clorox Company (CLX).[39] On March 15, 2011, Mentor's board issued a strong warning to its shareholders against a proxy action by Icahn.[40]
In October 2012, Icahn purchased a 10% stake in Netflix.[41][42] In November he was involved in a proxy battle over control of the Oshkosh Corp. board of directors.
In February 2013, Forbes listed Icahn as one of the 40 Highest-Earning hedge fund managers.[43] By April he had accumulated a 9.2% stake in Nuance Communications, Inc.[44] On August 2, 2013, Icahn sued computer giant Dell and its board in an attempt to derail a $24.4 billion buyout bid by the CEO, Michael Dell, in favor of his own rumored forthcoming bid.[45] In 2013 Icahn was an outspoken proponent of Apple;[46][47] In October that year he held a 4.7 million share position.[48] In October 2013, Icahn acquired around 61 million shares in Talisman Energy prompting shares in the ailing Canadian oil producer to surge.[49] Also that month he sold about 50% of his shares in Netflix for a profit in excess of 800 million in less than one year. In November he acquired a 12.5% interest in Hologic, a medical device and diagnostics manufacturer.
In January, 2014, Icahn bought another half-billion worth of Apple Inc. shares, stating they're "very cheap."[50] Also in January, Icahn proposed to eBay to spin off PayPal, an e-commerce business. This started a proxy fight which was settled by April.[51] By June 2014, had acquired a 9.4 percent stake in Family Dollar. Now the biggest shareholder, he becomes involved in a deal whereby Family Dollar is bought by Dollar Tree for $8.5 billion. He then disposed of about a third of his stake. In October 2014, Icahn took a stake in Canadian energy company Talisman Energy. The company's stock price went down by 71% and he sold his shares two months later.[52]
Lyft, PayPal, & other pursuits: 2015–present[edit]
On May 15, 2015, Icahn made a $100 million investment in the ride-sharing service Lyft.[53] In November 2015, Icahn hired CBRE Group Inc. to market the unfinished resort Fontainebleau Las Vegas to potential buyers.[54] That month he swapped his stake of eBay for the same number of shares in PayPal Holdings.[55] At that time Icahn held a 7.13% stake in Xerox; he was the second-largest investor after The Vanguard Group.[56] In December 2015 Icahn made a qualifying offer to purchase the auto-parts and maintenance chain Pep Boys for $15.50 a share.[57] He also raised his stake in the Houston-based energy company Cheniere Energy to 13.8, making him its largest shareholder.[58]
In January 2016, Icahn held a 4.66% stake in Gannett Co. Inc.,[59] and also held shares in Cheniere Energy and Freeport-McMoRan, both of which declined in value.[52] Icahn sold his Apple shares in April 2016, citing concerns about Apple's relationship with China.[60] In August of that year he purchased 10 percent ownership of Herbalife; his holdings in the company were about 19 million shares by October.[61] Also in October Icahn closed the Trump Taj Mahal Casino in Atlantic City, citing a $350 million USD loss over a few years as well as being unable to reach a negotiation deal with union workers on strike. Nearly 3,000 workers lost their jobs.[62][63] That year he also increased his holdings in the car rental company Hertz, after the company's stock price had declined significantly.[64]
Personal life[edit]
In 1979, Icahn married Liba Trejbal, a ballerina from the former Czechoslovakia.[65][66][67] They separated in 1993 and divorced in 1999 after years of litigation during which Liba sought to invalidate a prenuptial agreement she had signed prior to their marriage, claiming duress as she was pregnant at the time.[68] Liba originally fought Icahn's offer of roughly $1.5 million a year because he was worth billions at the time and eventually settled for an undisclosed amount.[67][69] They have two children, one of whom is Brett Icahn.[65]
In 1999, Icahn married his longtime assistant and former broker, Gail Golden.[67] She has two children from a prior marriage.[65]
Political and economic views[edit]
Icahn endorsed Donald Trump for the 2016 U.S. presidential election. He also announced the formation of a super PAC pledging $150 million to push for corporate tax reform, in particular of inversions, which occur when corporations leave the U.S. to take advantage of lower tax rates elsewhere.[70]
Upon becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Trump announced that he would nominate Icahn for Treasury Secretary.[71] However, this position went to Steve Mnuchin instead. [72] [73]
Bernie Sanders criticized Icahn's investment operations in Atlantic City. Icahn disputed Sanders' remarks acknowledging the general income inequality issue.[74][75]
On December 21, 2016, it was announced that Icahn would serve as Special Advisor to the President on Regulatory Reform under President Donald Trump.[76] CNBC reported that Icahn would aid Trump in an "individual capacity" rather than as a federal employee, and that he would not have "specific duties" and therefore would not have to relinquish his business interests while serving as an advisor to Trump.[77]
When the President had Icahn interview Scott Pruitt during consideration of his nomination as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Icahn specifically asked Pruitt about his position on the EPA's Renewable Fuel Standard.[78] Icahn has also spoken directly to President Trump and to Gary Cohn about his proposed changes to the ethanol rule.[78] CVR Energy, in which Icahn has 82% ownership, would save $205.9 million a year if Icahn's proposal is adopted.[78]The Sugar Land, Texas oil refinery benefited when President Trump made an exception to his regulation freeze to expand the tax advantage of master limited partnerships.[78] CVR Energy’s stock doubled after President Trump's election, increasing $455 million in value.[78]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]




The Carl C. Icahn Center for Science at Choate Rosemary Hall


According to Forbes Magazine, Icahn has a net worth of $16.6 billion USD making him the 26th wealthiest person on the Forbes 400, and the 5th wealthiest hedge fund manager as of February 2017.[3]
Icahn Stadium on Randall's Island in New York City is named after him, as is the Carl C. Icahn Center for Science and Icahn Scholar Program at Choate Rosemary Hall, a prep school in Connecticut. This organization pays for tuition, room and board, books, and supplies for 10 students every year for four years (freshman-senior), an expense that adds up to about $160,000 per student.
Icahn made a substantial contribution to his alma mater, Princeton University, to fund a genomics laboratory which bears his name, the Carl C. Icahn Laboratory at the University's Institute for Integrated Genomics. He also made large contributions to Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, of which he is a trustee, which in return not only named a building the Icahn Medical Institute designed by Davis Brody Bond, but also, in 2013, renamed the Mount Sinai School of Medicine as the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. The genomics institute led by Eric Schadt was also renamed and is now the Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology.




The Carl C. Icahn Laboratory at Princeton University


His foundation, the Children's Rescue Fund, built Icahn House in The Bronx, a 65-unit complex for homeless families consisting of single pregnant women and single women with children, and operates Icahn House East and Icahn House West, both of which are homeless shelters located in New York City.
Icahn has received a number of awards, including the Starlight Foundation's Founders Award and its 1990 Man of the Year Award. He was also named Guardian Angel 2001 Man of the Year. In 2004, he was honored by the Center for Educational Innovation –  Public Education Association for his work with charter schools. In 2006, he was honored with the 100 Women in Hedge Funds Effecting Change Award for his outstanding contributions to improving education.
In 2010, Icahn joined the Giving Pledge list, pledging to give away more than half his fortune, yet has not decided on the specific beneficiaries.[79][80]
On January 30, 2016, Icahn donated $1 million for US veterans groups at a Des Moines, Iowa, fundraiser held by Donald Trump.[81]
Thoroughbred horse racing[edit]
In 1985 Icahn established Foxfield Thoroughbreds, a horse breeding operation. At that year's Newstead Farm Trust sale run by Fasig-Tipton, he paid $4 million for Larida, a 6-year-old mare and a record $7 million for the 4-year-old bay mare Miss Oceana who was in foal to champion sire, Northern Dancer.[82]
Icahn's Meadow Star won the 1990 Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies and was voted the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Two-Year-Old Filly. In 1992, Foxfield ended its racing operation and became a commercial breeder. Having bred more than 140 stakes horses, in 2004 Icahn shut down Foxfield, selling all his mares and weanlings without reserve at the Keeneland Sales November breeding stock auction.[83]

Early life and education[edit]
Icahn was raised in the Far Rockaway, Queens section of New York City, where he attended Far Rockaway High School.[5] His family was Jewish.[6][7] His father, an atheist,[8] was a cantor, and later a substitute teacher. His mother also worked as a schoolteacher.[9] Carl graduated from Princeton University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy in 1957 and then entered New York University School of Medicine, but he dropped out after two years to join the army reserves.[8][10][11]
Investment career[edit]
Early career and 'corporate raider' years: 1961–2005[edit]




This aircraft had originally been built in 1999 for TWA, as part of its last-minute fleet renewal, but due to Icahn's hostile take over was sold to American Airlines, instead.


Icahn began his career on Wall Street as a stockbroker in 1961; in 1968, he formed Icahn & Co., a securities firm that focused on risk arbitrage and options trading.[12] In 1978, he began taking controlling positions in individual companies.[5] Icahn developed a reputation as a "corporate raider" after his hostile takeover of Trans World Airlines in 1985.[1] Icahn systematically sold TWA's assets to repay the money he borrowed to purchase the company, which was described as "asset stripping." In 1988, Icahn took TWA private, gaining a personal profit of $469 million, and leaving TWA with a debt of $540 million. In 1991, he sold TWA's London routes to American Airlines for $445 million.[2] He formed lowestfares.com to sell TWA tickets and acquired portions of Global Leisure Travel from Ramy El-Batrawi to merge into it.[13]
Icahn launched an unsuccessful $7 billion hostile takeover for 89% of U.S. Steel in late 1986.[14]
In July 2001 Icahn’s Riverdale, LLC loaned Genesisintermedia $100 million in exchange for an option to purchase 2 million shares of the company.[15][16]
In 2004, after Mylan Laboratories had announced a deal to acquire King Pharmaceuticals, Icahn purchased a large block of stock and threatened a proxy fight over the acquisition. Mylan later gave up its efforts to acquire King.
Take over offers and pharmaceutical holdings: 2005–2010[edit]
In 2005, XO Holding announced its intention to sell the wired part of its business for $700 million to its majority shareholder and chairman Icahn; the money would be used to pay back its debts and to buy back its preferred stock for about $600 million from Icahn. Icahn would have then owned the wired business outright, and still own his 60% stake in XO. In spite of Icahn's majority ownership and the board of directors declaring the deal to be in the best interest of shareholders, R2 and other minority shareholders defeated the attempt through the Delaware Court in 2008, which awarded penalties for damages to the business caused by Icahn's self-dealing and/or conflict of interest.
In February 2006, a group led by Icahn (with 3.3% of the stock) and Lazard Frères CEO Bruce Wasserstein proposed the breakup of Time Warner into four companies and stock buybacks totaling approximately $20 billion; they agreed not to contest the re-election of Time Warner's slate of board members at the 2006 shareholders meeting if Time Warner would buy back up $20 billion of stock, nominate more independent members to the board of directors, cut $1 billion of costs by 2007, and continue discussions with the group on the future of Time Warner Cable. In August 2006, he bought stock in the video game publisher Take-Two Interactive, and later increased his holdings to 11.3% in 2009, becoming the company's second largest shareholder.[17]
In January 2007, he purchased a 9.2% stake in Telik, a biotech company engaged in cancer research. By that time he was also the beneficial owner of 6.1 million shares, of WCI Communities. He also owned about 33.5 million shares of Motorola, but in May was refused a seat on its Board of Directors. On February 9, 2007, Lear Corporation's board of directors accepted a $2.3 billion takeover offer from Icahn.[18][19] That month he also invested $50 million in Motricity, a North Carolina-based provider of mobile content delivery technology. In 2007, Icahn and his affiliates also owned majority positions in ACF Industries, American Railcar Industries, Philip Services, and NYSE-listed Icahn Enterprises, By September he also owned of 8.5% of the business software company BEA Systems. He increased his holdings to 13% in October,[20] two months before Oracle Corporation announced it was purchasing BEA Systems.[21] Beginning in 2007, Icahn gradually increased his stake in biotechnology company Biogen Idec.[22][23]
Icahn sold his casino interests in Nevada in February 2008, including the Stratosphere, Arizona Charlie's Boulder, Arizona Charlie's Decatur, and Aquarius Casino Resort which were operated through American Entertainment Properties, a subsidiary of Icahn Enterprises. The sale price of $1.3 billion was roughly $1 billion more than he paid for the properties. In March 2008, Icahn sued Motorola as part of his effort to gain four seats on Motorola's board and force a sale of its mobile business.[24] That month, a story about Icahn aired on American news program, 60 Minutes, with reporter Lesley Stahl and he also appeared on Nightly Business Report and discussed his views on proxy fights.[25] In May that year Icahn purchased a large block of shares in Yahoo, and shortly thereafter threatened to start a proxy fight to remove Yahoo's board of directors in response to their rejection of Microsoft's takeover bid.[26] Instead, he forced an agreement to expand Yahoo's board to eleven members, including Icahn and two others of his choice.[27] In June 2008, Icahn launched The Icahn Report, which hosts United Shareholders of America where individual investors can sign up and campaign for shareholder rights. In September/October 2008 Icahn was involved in the rejected attempted purchase of Imclone by Bristol Myers Squibb and in the eventual sale of Imclone to Eli Lilly in an all-cash deal valued at $6.5 billion.[28] In December that year he filed suit against Realogy over a proposed debt swap.[29]
In April 2009, Icahn engaged in a proxy battle for Amylin.[30] In September he offered to buy the shares of XO he did not already own for 55 cents each. He later raised his offer to 80 cents, but it expired. In October he resigned from the board of directors at Yahoo!,[31] and by the following February had reduced his equity stake from a one-time high of 75 million shares to 12 million shares.[32]
Icahn was a director of Blockbuster until January 2010 and the chairman of Imclone, Icahn Enterprises, XO Communications, WestPoint Home, Cadus, and American Railcar Industries. He is a beneficial owner of Adventrx Pharmaceuticals, and Vector Group. Icahn also tried to take over Marvel Comics.[33] Icahn, through a subsidiary of his Icahn Enterprises LP, acquired the Fontainebleau property in Las Vegas for about $150 million in February 2010. In March he was one of a group of lenders who purchased Tropicana Casino and Resort Atlantic City, bringing the company out of bankruptcy for $200 million. Also in March he conducted a failed takeover bid of Lionsgate Films.[34] In May he announced ownership of about 12% of Hain Celestial Group Inc.,[35] and the purchase of an 8.54% stake in Lawson Software,[36]
Proxy battles and technology positions: 2010–2015[edit]
In May 2010 Icahn held 6.9% stake in Mentor Graphics;[37] in July he acquired a 14 percent stake in the company; Mentor then signed a poison-pill provision. In February 2011 Icahn made an offer to buy the company for about $1.86 billion in cash.
In January 2011, Icahn once more made a bid to purchase the remaining shares of the XO Holder common stock.[38] By February he had accumulated a 9.08% stake in The Clorox Company (CLX).[39] On March 15, 2011, Mentor's board issued a strong warning to its shareholders against a proxy action by Icahn.[40]
In October 2012, Icahn purchased a 10% stake in Netflix.[41][42] In November he was involved in a proxy battle over control of the Oshkosh Corp. board of directors.
In February 2013, Forbes listed Icahn as one of the 40 Highest-Earning hedge fund managers.[43] By April he had accumulated a 9.2% stake in Nuance Communications, Inc.[44] On August 2, 2013, Icahn sued computer giant Dell and its board in an attempt to derail a $24.4 billion buyout bid by the CEO, Michael Dell, in favor of his own rumored forthcoming bid.[45] In 2013 Icahn was an outspoken proponent of Apple;[46][47] In October that year he held a 4.7 million share position.[48] In October 2013, Icahn acquired around 61 million shares in Talisman Energy prompting shares in the ailing Canadian oil producer to surge.[49] Also that month he sold about 50% of his shares in Netflix for a profit in excess of 800 million in less than one year. In November he acquired a 12.5% interest in Hologic, a medical device and diagnostics manufacturer.
In January, 2014, Icahn bought another half-billion worth of Apple Inc. shares, stating they're "very cheap."[50] Also in January, Icahn proposed to eBay to spin off PayPal, an e-commerce business. This started a proxy fight which was settled by April.[51] By June 2014, had acquired a 9.4 percent stake in Family Dollar. Now the biggest shareholder, he becomes involved in a deal whereby Family Dollar is bought by Dollar Tree for $8.5 billion. He then disposed of about a third of his stake. In October 2014, Icahn took a stake in Canadian energy company Talisman Energy. The company's stock price went down by 71% and he sold his shares two months later.[52]

On May 15, 2015, Icahn made a $100 million investment in the ride-sharing service Lyft.[53] In November 2015, Icahn hired CBRE Group Inc. to market the unfinished resort Fontainebleau Las Vegas to potential buyers.[54] That month he swapped his stake of eBay for the same number of shares in PayPal Holdings.[55] At that time Icahn held a 7.13% stake in Xerox; he was the second-largest investor after The Vanguard Group.[56] In December 2015 Icahn made a qualifying offer to purchase the auto-parts and maintenance chain Pep Boys for $15.50 a share.[57] He also raised his stake in the Houston-based energy company Cheniere Energy to 13.8, making him its largest shareholder.[58]
In January 2016, Icahn held a 4.66% stake in Gannett Co. Inc.,[59] and also held shares in Cheniere Energy and Freeport-McMoRan, both of which declined in value.[52] Icahn sold his Apple shares in April 2016, citing concerns about Apple's relationship with China.[60] In August of that year he purchased 10 percent ownership of Herbalife; his holdings in the company were about 19 million shares by October.[61] Also in October Icahn closed the Trump Taj Mahal Casino in Atlantic City, citing a $350 million USD loss over a few years as well as being unable to reach a negotiation deal with union workers on strike. Nearly 3,000 workers lost their jobs.[62][63] That year he also increased his holdings in the car rental company Hertz, after the company's stock price had declined significantly.[64]
Personal life[edit]
In 1979, Icahn married Liba Trejbal, a ballerina from the former Czechoslovakia.[65][66][67] They separated in 1993 and divorced in 1999 after years of litigation during which Liba sought to invalidate a prenuptial agreement she had signed prior to their marriage, claiming duress as she was pregnant at the time.[68] Liba originally fought Icahn's offer of roughly $1.5 million a year because he was worth billions at the time and eventually settled for an undisclosed amount.[67][69] They have two children, one of whom is Brett Icahn.[65]
In 1999, Icahn married his longtime assistant and former broker, Gail Golden.[67] She has two children from a prior marriage.[65]
Political and economic views[edit]
Icahn endorsed Donald Trump for the 2016 U.S. presidential election. He also announced the formation of a super PAC pledging $150 million to push for corporate tax reform, in particular of inversions, which occur when corporations leave the U.S. to take advantage of lower tax rates elsewhere.[70]
Upon becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Trump announced that he would nominate Icahn for Treasury Secretary.[71] However, this position went to Steve Mnuchin instead. [72] [73]
Bernie Sanders criticized Icahn's investment operations in Atlantic City. Icahn disputed Sanders' remarks acknowledging the general income inequality issue.[74][75]
On December 21, 2016, it was announced that Icahn would serve as Special Advisor to the President on Regulatory Reform under President Donald Trump.[76] CNBC reported that Icahn would aid Trump in an "individual capacity" rather than as a federal employee, and that he would not have "specific duties" and therefore would not have to relinquish his business interests while serving as an advisor to Trump.[77]
When the President had Icahn interview Scott Pruitt during consideration of his nomination as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Icahn specifically asked Pruitt about his position on the EPA's Renewable Fuel Standard.[78] Icahn has also spoken directly to President Trump and to Gary Cohn about his proposed changes to the ethanol rule.[78] CVR Energy, in which Icahn has 82% ownership, would save $205.9 million a year if Icahn's proposal is adopted.[78]The Sugar Land, Texas oil refinery benefited when President Trump made an exception to his regulation freeze to expand the tax advantage of master limited partnerships.[78] CVR Energy’s stock doubled after President Trump's election, increasing $455 million in value.[78]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]




The Carl C. Icahn Center for Science at Choate Rosemary Hall


According to Forbes Magazine, Icahn has a net worth of $16.6 billion USD making him the 26th wealthiest person on the Forbes 400, and the 5th wealthiest hedge fund manager as of February 2017.[3]
Icahn Stadium on Randall's Island in New York City is named after him, as is the Carl C. Icahn Center for Science and Icahn Scholar Program at Choate Rosemary Hall, a prep school in Connecticut. This organization pays for tuition, room and board, books, and supplies for 10 students every year for four years (freshman-senior), an expense that adds up to about $160,000 per student.
Icahn made a substantial contribution to his alma mater, Princeton University, to fund a genomics laboratory which bears his name, the Carl C. Icahn Laboratory at the University's Institute for Integrated Genomics. He also made large contributions to Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, of which he is a trustee, which in return not only named a building the Icahn Medical Institute designed by Davis Brody Bond, but also, in 2013, renamed the Mount Sinai School of Medicine as the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. The genomics institute led by Eric Schadt was also renamed and is now the Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology.




The Carl C. Icahn Laboratory at Princeton University


His foundation, the Children's Rescue Fund, built Icahn House in The Bronx, a 65-unit complex for homeless families consisting of single pregnant women and single women with children, and operates Icahn House East and Icahn House West, both of which are homeless shelters located in New York City.
Icahn has received a number of awards, including the Starlight Foundation's Founders Award and its 1990 Man of the Year Award. He was also named Guardian Angel 2001 Man of the Year. In 2004, he was honored by the Center for Educational Innovation –  Public Education Association for his work with charter schools. In 2006, he was honored with the 100 Women in Hedge Funds Effecting Change Award for his outstanding contributions to improving education.
In 2010, Icahn joined the Giving Pledge list, pledging to give away more than half his fortune, yet has not decided on the specific beneficiaries.[79][80]
On January 30, 2016, Icahn donated $1 million for US veterans groups at a Des Moines, Iowa, fundraiser held by Donald Trump.[81]
Thoroughbred horse racing[edit]
In 1985 Icahn established Foxfield Thoroughbreds, a horse breeding operation. At that year's Newstead Farm Trust sale run by Fasig-Tipton, he paid $4 million for Larida, a 6-year-old mare and a record $7 million for the 4-year-old bay mare Miss Oceana who was in foal to champion sire, Northern Dancer.[82]
Icahn's Meadow Star won the 1990 Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies and was voted the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Two-Year-Old Filly. In 1992, Foxfield ended its racing operation and became a commercial breeder. Having bred more than 140 stakes horses, in 2004 Icahn shut down Foxfield, selling all his mares and weanlings without reserve at the Keeneland Sales November breeding stock auction.[83]

Another American corporate icon has decided that breaking up is the thing to do.Xerox, whose name has long been synonymous with office copiers, has agreed to spin off its services business to its shareholders by the end of the year, separating it from the legacy hardware side, according to a person briefed on the decision.A large part of the spinoff will incorporate Affiliated Computer Services, the business outsourcing company that Xerox bought for $6.4 billion in 2010, said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity before the plan was announced.The remaining company would be focused on office supply products like copiers, scanners and fax machines, the person said.The plan is expected to be announced when Xerox reports fourth-quarter financial results on Friday.Xerox, which was founded in Rochester in 1906, will be joining other big American corporations that have split apart or pared back in recent years, some driven by activist hedge funds seeking to increase returns on their shares.

Alcoa announced in September it would split in two, separating its commodities and metal products businesses. Hewlett-Packard decided to split in 2014. More recently, the chemical giants Dow Chemical and DuPont agreed to merge with the intent to split into three companies soon afterward.Carl C. Icahn, who successfully campaigned for the separation of PayPal from eBay last year, played a role in Xerox’s decision.Through his various investment funds, Mr. Icahn amassed an 8.13 percent stake in Xerox in November and December, saying the shares were undervalued. In a securities filing, he said at the time that his firm intended to have discussions with Xerox management and board “relating to improving operational performance and pursuing strategic alternatives, as well as the possibility of board representation.” Continue reading the main story

His disclosure came a month after Xerox’s chairwoman and chief executive, Ursula M. Burns, announced that the board had authorized a “comprehensive review of structural options” for the company’s business portfolio. At the time of that October announcement, Ms. Burns indicated that she was in favor of keeping the company together.As part of an agreement with Mr. Icahn, three of his representatives will serve on the board of the services company after it has been spun off, the person briefed on the decision said.

Mr. Icahn did not return a phone call on Thursday.But he told the cable channel CNBC on Thursday that the plan was “a major move” that “will greatly enhance shareholder value.” Mr. Icahn said that he had several meetings with Ms. Burns and “applaud and respect her for doing what she believes shareholders want.”

A representative from Xerox, which is based in Norwalk, Conn., declined to comment on plans to spin off the services business and on any discussions with Mr. Icahn.Shares of Xerox are down 28 percent from a year ago and down 13.5 percent since Nov. 23, when Mr. Icahn first announced he had taken a stake. The company now has a market value of more than $9.3 billion.In after-hours trading, its shares dipped slightly after The Wall Street Journal reported the plan of the split.Xerox has been grappling with declining annual revenue for four consecutive years.In a conference call with analysts last year, Ms. Burns was asked whether she saw strategic value in having the services business together with the hardware businesses.“As we go through the review, that’s one of the things that we’ll validate,” Ms. Burns said.For his part, Mr. Icahn has been waging multiple battles in the last few months. In December, he prevailed over the Bridgestone Corporation in a seesaw battle to acquire the auto parts retailer Pep Boys for $18.50 a share, or about $1 billion.But in his public battle to break the American International Group into three parts, he has been less successful. On Tuesday, A.I.G. outlined plans to streamline its businesses, but stopped far short of Mr. Icahn’s more radical demands for change.Mr. Icahn, who says he owns 42 million shares of A.I.G., has not yet publicly responded to the company’s new strategy, and he could still start a proxy battle. In November, Mr. Icahn said he might propose that A.I.G. add a director to its board who could take over for the insurer’s chief executive.While Mr. Icahn has been an active proponent of divestitures and breakups, he is less keen on another hot area of Wall Street deal-making. He has been critical of inversions, where a United States company merges with a foreign company and moves its headquarters overseas to take advantage of lower corporate tax rates.In October, the investor announced that he had formed a $150 million super PAC to fight inversions.

I’ve always been an obsessive character. I don’t see a psychiatrist, but, if you really analyzed it, people like me are out to win, and winning is money.”Carl C. IcahnSynopsisBorn in New York City in 1936, Carl C. Icahn began his financial career in 1961. Starting with his proxy battle at Tappan in the late 1970s, he forged a reputation as one of Wall Street's leading "corporate raiders" during the following decade. Icahn became very wealthy through his substantial stakes in corporations like RJR Nabisco, Texaco, Phillips Petroleum and Viacom, overcoming missteps with TWA and Time Warner to remain a highly influential investor.Early Years and CareerCarl Celian Icahn was born on February 16, 1936, in Brooklyn, New York, and raised in Queens. The only child of Bella, a public-school teacher, and Michael, a cantor at a local synagogue, Icahn grew up without much money. He learned to fend for himself in the tough environment of Far Rockaway High School, where he garnered strong enough grades to be accepted to Princeton University.  
After earning his B.A. in philosophy from Princeton in 1957, Icahn heeded his mother's wishes and enrolled at New York University School of Medicine. Never fully invested in the process, he dropped out during his third year and went into the Army Reserves. In 1961, Icahn began his career on Wall Street as a broker at Dreyfus & Co. In 1968, with financial assistance from an uncle, he obtained a seat on the New York Stock Exchange and launched Icahn & Co., a securities firm devoted to arbitrage and options trading.  
Wall Street Titan
In the late 1970s, Icahn shifted gears and began acquiring significant portions of stock in Tappan, a family-owned appliance company. Upon becoming the majority shareholder, he initiated a proxy fight that led to the company being sold to Electrolux and a doubling of the stock prices. As one of the notorious "corporate raiders" of the 1980s, Icahn enriched himself and his partners by his takeovers, and at the same time (so his defenders claimed), making money for ordinary stockholders. He also engaged in what was called "greenmail": threatening to take over corporations such as Marshall Field and Phillips Petroleum, he would sell his stocks at the end and walk off with a sizeable profit. His success was such that he provided much of the inspiration for the famed Gordon Gekko character of the 1987 movie Wall Street. 
Icahn attempted to operate some of the companies he acquired. After assuming control of American Car & Foundry Company in 1984, he slashed overhead and liquidated assets, turning a sizable profit after three years. However, a higher-profile effort to run Trans World Airlines (TWA) after its purchase in 1985 went belly-up. Icahn took the company private and invested a huge sum of his own money, but wound up resigning his position as chairman after TWA filed for bankruptcy in 1992. 
Having avoided the scandals that brought down fellow financial high rollers like Ivan Boesky and Michael Milken, Icahn continued his brand of "activist investing" into the 1990s and beyond. He launched bids to take over RJR Nabisco, losing out to Philip Morris but claiming a profit of more than $600 million in the process. 
After opening a hedge fund in 2004, Icahn stumbled in his effort to break up Time Warner and push its CEO, Richard Parsons, out the door. His attempts to take control of Blockbuster also proved fruitless with the decline of the video-rental market. However, he showed he could still flex his muscle by influencing sales at companies like Mylan Laboratories and Kerr-McGee. Icahn in 2007 became CEO of Icahn Capital LP, a subsidiary of Icahn Enterprises, and in 2011 he closed his hedge fund to outside investors. Refusing to ease out of the game even as he neared his 80th birthday, he made news in 2012 with the announcement of his acquisition of a significant stake in Netflix.   The investor has since remained in the headlines with his attempts to influence transactions at eBay and Apple, a public feud with Pershing Square Capital Management 

CEO Bill Ackman and his support of 2016 Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. With his majority holdings in companies like XO Communications, Tropicana Entertainment and CVR Energy, he ranked No. 43 on the Forbes list of billionaires in 2016. 
Philanthropy and Personal 
Despite his reputation as a cutthroat investor and negotiator, Icahn has devoted significant resources to the fields of education and medicine, with a particular interest in genomics. He donated $200 million to the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in 2012, and launched the Icahn Scholars Program to attract the world's brightest physician-scientists. Additionally, he has established a series of charter schools and homeless shelters in the Bronx, New York. 
Icahn fathered two children with his first wife, Liba Trejbal. After their separation in the early 1990s, he married his longtime assistant, Gail Golden. Icahn's son, Brett, has since gone into business with his father. Fact CheckWe strive for accuracy and fairness.

His mother also worked as a schoolteacher.[9] Carl graduated from Princeton University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy in 1957 and then entered New York University School of Medicine, but he dropped out after two years to join the army reserves.[8][10][11]
Investment career[edit]
Early career and 'corporate raider' years: 1961–2005[edit]




This aircraft had originally been built in 1999 for TWA, as part of its last-minute fleet renewal, but due to Icahn's hostile take over was sold to American Airlines, instead.


Icahn began his career on Wall Street as a stockbroker in 1961; in 1968, he formed Icahn & Co., a securities firm that focused on risk arbitrage and options trading.[12] In 1978, he began taking controlling positions in individual companies.[5] Icahn developed a reputation as a "corporate raider" after his hostile takeover of Trans World Airlines in 1985.[1] Icahn systematically sold TWA's assets to repay the money he borrowed to purchase the company, which was described as "asset stripping." In 1988, Icahn took TWA private, gaining a personal profit of $469 million, and leaving TWA with a debt of $540 million. In 1991, he sold TWA's London routes to American Airlines for $445 million.[2] He formed lowestfares.com to sell TWA tickets and acquired portions of Global Leisure Travel from Ramy El-Batrawi to merge into it.[13]
Icahn launched an unsuccessful $7 billion hostile takeover for 89% of U.S. Steel in late 1986.[14]
In July 2001 Icahn’s Riverdale, LLC loaned Genesisintermedia $100 million in exchange for an option to purchase 2 million shares of the company.[15][16]
In 2004, after Mylan Laboratories had announced a deal to acquire King Pharmaceuticals, Icahn purchased a large block of stock and threatened a proxy fight over the acquisition. Mylan later gave up its efforts to acquire King.
Take over offers and pharmaceutical holdings: 2005–2010[edit]
In 2005, XO Holding announced its intention to sell the wired part of its business for $700 million to its majority shareholder and chairman Icahn; the money would be used to pay back its debts and to buy back its preferred stock for about $600 million from Icahn. Icahn would have then owned the wired business outright, and still own his 60% stake in XO. In spite of Icahn's majority ownership and the board of directors declaring the deal to be in the best interest of shareholders, R2 and other minority shareholders defeated the attempt through the Delaware Court in 2008, which awarded penalties for damages to the business caused by Icahn's self-dealing and/or conflict of interest.
In February 2006, a group led by Icahn (with 3.3% of the stock) and Lazard Frères CEO Bruce Wasserstein proposed the breakup of Time Warner into four companies and stock buybacks totaling approximately $20 billion; they agreed not to contest the re-election of Time Warner's slate of board members at the 2006 shareholders meeting if Time Warner would buy back up $20 billion of stock, nominate more independent members to the board of directors, cut $1 billion of costs by 2007, and continue discussions with the group on the future of Time Warner Cable. In August 2006, he bought stock in the video game publisher Take-Two Interactive, and later increased his holdings to 11.3% in 2009, becoming the company's second largest shareholder.[17]
In January 2007, he purchased a 9.2% stake in Telik, a biotech company engaged in cancer research. By that time he was also the beneficial owner of 6.1 million shares, of WCI Communities. He also owned about 33.5 million shares of Motorola, but in May was refused a seat on its Board of Directors. On February 9, 2007, Lear Corporation's board of directors accepted a $2.3 billion takeover offer from Icahn.[18][19] That month he also invested $50 million in Motricity, a North Carolina-based provider of mobile content delivery technology. In 2007, Icahn and his affiliates also owned majority positions in ACF Industries, American Railcar Industries, Philip Services, and NYSE-listed Icahn Enterprises, By September he also owned of 8.5% of the business software company BEA Systems. He increased his holdings to 13% in October,[20] two months before Oracle Corporation announced it was purchasing BEA Systems.[21] Beginning in 2007, Icahn gradually increased his stake in biotechnology company Biogen Idec.[22][23]
Icahn sold his casino interests in Nevada in February 2008, including the Stratosphere, Arizona Charlie's Boulder, Arizona Charlie's Decatur, and Aquarius Casino Resort which were operated through American Entertainment Properties, a subsidiary of Icahn Enterprises. The sale price of $1.3 billion was roughly $1 billion more than he paid for the properties. In March 2008, Icahn sued Motorola as part of his effort to gain four seats on Motorola's board and force a sale of its mobile business.[24] That month, a story about Icahn aired on American news program, 60 Minutes, with reporter Lesley Stahl and he also appeared on Nightly Business Report and discussed his views on proxy fights.[25] In May that year Icahn purchased a large block of shares in Yahoo, and shortly thereafter threatened to start a proxy fight to remove Yahoo's board of directors in response to their rejection of Microsoft's takeover bid.[26] Instead, he forced an agreement to expand Yahoo's board to eleven members, including Icahn and two others of his choice.[27] In June 2008, Icahn launched The Icahn Report, which hosts United Shareholders of America where individual investors can sign up and campaign for shareholder rights. In September/October 2008 Icahn was involved in the rejected attempted purchase of Imclone by Bristol Myers Squibb and in the eventual sale of Imclone to Eli Lilly in an all-cash deal valued at $6.5 billion.[28] In December that year he filed suit against Realogy over a proposed debt swap.[29]
In April 2009, Icahn engaged in a proxy battle for Amylin.[30] In September he offered to buy the shares of XO he did not already own for 55 cents each. He later raised his offer to 80 cents, but it expired. In October he resigned from the board of directors at Yahoo!,[31] and by the following February had reduced his equity stake from a one-time high of 75 million shares to 12 million shares.[32]
Icahn was a director of Blockbuster until January 2010 and the chairman of Imclone, Icahn Enterprises, XO Communications, WestPoint Home, Cadus, and American Railcar Industries. He is a beneficial owner of Adventrx Pharmaceuticals, and Vector Group. Icahn also tried to take over Marvel Comics.[33] Icahn, through a subsidiary of his Icahn Enterprises LP, acquired the Fontainebleau property in Las Vegas for about $150 million in February 2010. In March he was one of a group of lenders who purchased Tropicana Casino and Resort Atlantic City, bringing the company out of bankruptcy for $200 million. Also in March he conducted a failed takeover bid of Lionsgate Films.[34] In May he announced ownership of about 12% of Hain Celestial Group Inc.,[35] and the purchase of an 8.54% stake in Lawson Software,[36]
Proxy battles and technology positions: 2010–2015[edit]
In May 2010 Icahn held 6.9% stake in Mentor Graphics;[37] in July he acquired a 14 percent stake in the company; Mentor then signed a poison-pill provision. In February 2011 Icahn made an offer to buy the company for about $1.86 billion in cash.
In January 2011, Icahn once more made a bid to purchase the remaining shares of the XO Holder common stock.[38] By February he had accumulated a 9.08% stake in The Clorox Company (CLX).[39] On March 15, 2011, Mentor's board issued a strong warning to its shareholders against a proxy action by Icahn.[40]
In October 2012, Icahn purchased a 10% stake in Netflix.[41][42] In November he was involved in a proxy battle over control of the Oshkosh Corp. board of directors.
In February 2013, Forbes listed Icahn as one of the 40 Highest-Earning hedge fund managers.[43] By April he had accumulated a 9.2% stake in Nuance Communications, Inc.[44] On August 2, 2013, Icahn sued computer giant Dell and its board in an attempt to derail a $24.4 billion buyout bid by the CEO, Michael Dell, in favor of his own rumored forthcoming bid.[45] In 2013 Icahn was an outspoken proponent of Apple;[46][47] In October that year he held a 4.7 million share position.[48] In October 2013, Icahn acquired around 61 million shares in Talisman Energy prompting shares in the ailing Canadian oil producer to surge.[49] Also that month he sold about 50% of his shares in Netflix for a profit in excess of 800 million in less than one year. In November he acquired a 12.5% interest in Hologic, a medical device and diagnostics manufacturer.
In January, 2014, Icahn bought another half-billion worth of Apple Inc. shares, stating they're "very cheap."[50] Also in January, Icahn proposed to eBay to spin off PayPal, an e-commerce business. This started a proxy fight which was settled by April.[51] By June 2014, had acquired a 9.4 percent stake in Family Dollar. Now the biggest shareholder, he becomes involved in a deal whereby Family Dollar is bought by Dollar Tree for $8.5 billion. He then disposed of about a third of his stake. In October 2014, Icahn took a stake in Canadian energy company Talisman Energy. The company's stock price went down by 71% and he sold his shares two months later.[52]
Lyft, PayPal, & other pursuits: 2015–present[edit]
On May 15, 2015, Icahn made a $100 million investment in the ride-sharing service Lyft.[53] In November 2015, Icahn hired CBRE Group Inc. to market the unfinished resort Fontainebleau Las Vegas to potential buyers.[54] That month he swapped his stake of eBay for the same number of shares in PayPal Holdings.[55] At that time Icahn held a 7.13% stake in Xerox; he was the second-largest investor after The Vanguard Group.[56] In December 2015 Icahn made a qualifying offer to purchase the auto-parts and maintenance chain Pep Boys for $15.50 a share.[57] He also raised his stake in the Houston-based energy company Cheniere Energy to 13.8, making him its largest shareholder.[58]
In January 2016, Icahn held a 4.66% stake in Gannett Co. Inc.,[59] and also held shares in Cheniere Energy and Freeport-McMoRan, both of which declined in value.[52] Icahn sold his Apple shares in April 2016, citing concerns about Apple's relationship with China.[60] In August of that year he purchased 10 percent ownership of Herbalife; his holdings in the company were about 19 million shares by October.[61] Also in October Icahn closed the Trump Taj Mahal Casino in Atlantic City, citing a $350 million USD loss over a few years as well as being unable to reach a negotiation deal with union workers on strike. Nearly 3,000 workers lost their jobs.[62][63] That year he also increased his holdings in the car rental company Hertz, after the company's stock price had declined significantly.[64]
Personal life[edit]
In 1979, Icahn married Liba Trejbal, a ballerina from the former Czechoslovakia.[65][66][67] They separated in 1993 and divorced in 1999 after years of litigation during which Liba sought to invalidate a prenuptial agreement she had signed prior to their marriage, claiming duress as she was pregnant at the time.[68] Liba originally fought Icahn's offer of roughly $1.5 million a year because he was worth billions at the time and eventually settled for an undisclosed amount.[67][69] They have two children, one of whom is Brett Icahn.[65]
In 1999, Icahn married his longtime assistant and former broker, Gail Golden.[67] She has two children from a prior marriage.[65]
Political and economic views[edit]
Icahn endorsed Donald Trump for the 2016 U.S. presidential election. He also announced the formation of a super PAC pledging $150 million to push for corporate tax reform, in particular of inversions, which occur when corporations leave the U.S. to take advantage of lower tax rates elsewhere.[70]
Upon becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Trump announced that he would nominate Icahn for Treasury Secretary.[71] However, this position went to Steve Mnuchin instead. [72] [73]
Bernie Sanders criticized Icahn's investment operations in Atlantic City. Icahn disputed Sanders' remarks acknowledging the general income inequality issue.[74][75]
On December 21, 2016, it was announced that Icahn would serve as Special Advisor to the President on Regulatory Reform under President Donald Trump.[76] CNBC reported that Icahn would aid Trump in an "individual capacity" rather than as a federal employee, and that he would not have "specific duties" and therefore would not have to relinquish his business interests while serving as an advisor to Trump.[77]
When the President had Icahn interview Scott Pruitt during consideration of his nomination as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Icahn specifically asked Pruitt about his position on the EPA's Renewable Fuel Standard.[78] Icahn has also spoken directly to President Trump and to Gary Cohn about his proposed changes to the ethanol rule.[78] CVR Energy, in which Icahn has 82% ownership, would save $205.9 million a year if Icahn's proposal is adopted.[78]The Sugar Land, Texas oil refinery benefited when President Trump made an exception to his regulation freeze to expand the tax advantage of master limited partnerships.[78] CVR Energy’s stock doubled after President Trump's election, increasing $455 million in value.[78]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]




The Carl C. Icahn Center for Science at Choate Rosemary Hall


According to Forbes Magazine, Icahn has a net worth of $16.6 billion USD making him the 26th wealthiest person on the Forbes 400, and the 5th wealthiest hedge fund manager as of February 2017.[3]
Icahn Stadium on Randall's Island in New York City is named after him, as is the Carl C. Icahn Center for Science and Icahn Scholar Program at Choate Rosemary Hall, a prep school in Connecticut. This organization pays for tuition, room and board, books, and supplies for 10 students every year for four years (freshman-senior), an expense that adds up to about $160,000 per student.
Icahn made a substantial contribution to his alma mater, Princeton University, to fund a genomics laboratory which bears his name, the Carl C. Icahn Laboratory at the University's Institute for Integrated Genomics. He also made large contributions to Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, of which he is a trustee, which in return not only named a building the Icahn Medical Institute designed by Davis Brody Bond, but also, in 2013, renamed the Mount Sinai School of Medicine as the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. The genomics institute led by Eric Schadt was also renamed and is now the Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology.




The Carl C. Icahn Laboratory at Princeton University


His foundation, the Children's Rescue Fund, built Icahn House in The Bronx, a 65-unit complex for homeless families consisting of single pregnant women and single women with children, and operates Icahn House East and Icahn House West, both of which are homeless shelters located in New York City.
Icahn has received a number of awards, including the Starlight Foundation's Founders Award and its 1990 Man of the Year Award. He was also named Guardian Angel 2001 Man of the Year. In 2004, he was honored by the Center for Educational Innovation –  Public Education Association for his work with charter schools. In 2006, he was honored with the 100 Women in Hedge Funds Effecting Change Award for his outstanding contributions to improving education.
In 2010, Icahn joined the Giving Pledge list, pledging to give away more than half his fortune, yet has not decided on the specific beneficiaries.[79][80]
On January 30, 2016, Icahn donated $1 million for US veterans groups at a Des Moines, Iowa, fundraiser held by Donald Trump.[81]
Thoroughbred horse racing[edit]
In 1985 Icahn established Foxfield Thoroughbreds, a horse breeding operation. At that year's Newstead Farm Trust sale run by Fasig-Tipton, he paid $4 million for Larida, a 6-year-old mare and a record $7 million for the 4-year-old bay mare Miss Oceana who was in foal to champion sire, Northern Dancer.[82]
Icahn's Meadow Star won the 1990 Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies and was voted the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Two-Year-Old Filly. In 1992, Foxfield ended its racing operation and became a commercial breeder. Having bred more than 140 stakes horses, in 2004 Icahn shut down Foxfield, selling all his mares and weanlings without reserve at the Keeneland Sales November breeding stock auction.[83]

Icahn sendte Netflix rett til værs

Storinvestoren Carl Icahn har sikret seg 10 prosent av Netflix. Det ga vill jubel på Wall Street.

Onsdag kveld gjorde storinvestoren Carl Icahn det kjent at han har kjøpt 10 prosent av nettfilm-selskapet Netflix, melder Marketwatch. Det var godt nytt for aksjen, som endte opp 13,88 prosent. Også før helgen fikk selskapet et gigaløft: Aksjene i Netflix steg også da kraftig, basert på rykter om at Microsoft kan være interessert i å kjøpe selskapet. Fra bunnpunktet på formiddagen steg aksjen nesten 15 prosent. Netflix gir kundene tilgang på et bibliotek av tv-serier og filmer via internett mot en månedlig leie. De har eksistert lenge i USA, men ble først nylig lansert i Norge. Nå skal altså ryktene ha det til at de kan bli en del av Microsofts voksende økosystem av tjenester og maskiner.  Les mer:

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
