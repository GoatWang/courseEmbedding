Of these properties, 418 are leased to Darden and/or one or more of Darden’s operating subsidiaries on a triple-net basis on terms comparable to similar leases negotiated on an arm’s-length basis.  We are actively scaling and diversifying our portfolio as seen by our recent acquisitions.
The portfolio was formed through a selection of 424 high-quality Darden restaurant properties with stable cash flows and strong rent coverage

Is Four Corners Property Trust In Your Strike Zone? - Four Corners Property Trust, Inc. (NYSE:FCPT) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Is Four Corners Property Trust In Your Strike Zone?Dec.19.16 | About: Four Corners (FCPT) Brad Thomas Dividend growth investing, REITs, newsletter provider, valueMarketplaceREIT BeatSummaryFCPT’s portfolio is comprised of high-quality restaurant properties that demonstrate strong operating performance.FCPT looks to increase diversification by targeting different brands, meal price-points, cuisine types, and geographies.I am still somewhat skittish on the prospects of having most of my eggs in one basket.In just a few days, I plan to put together my Rhino REIT Ratings on the Triple Net REITs. Now that rate fears are in the rear view mirror, I decided that it was a good time for readers to take a closer look at the Net Lease REITs and determine which companies are best prepared to deliver growing dividends for the long haul. Thanks in large part to the insatiable demand for income products, the Net Lease REIT sector has exploded. Over the last few years, a number of new players have gone public, STORE Capital (NYSE:STOR), VEREIT (NYSE:VER), and Four Corners Property Trust (NYSE:FCPT), to name a few. While many have considered rising rates a headwind for Net Lease REITs, we actually consider it a tailwind. In other words, we believe that many C-Corporations that own real estate will be more likely to consider monetizing real estate in order to lock in lease rates. Most Net Lease REITs utilize sale/leaseback and build-to-suit strategies to acquire new investments and we suspect that the rising rates will serve as a catalyst for REITs to source deals before rates climb higher. Since the IRS has made it harder for C-Corps to spin their real estate into a REIT structure, we believe that Net Lease REITs will also have an added advantage. In an article last December, I explained that "a Congressional tax bill proposed a ban on certain tax-free REIT spin-offs" that put the brakes on REIT spin-offs. This bill now forces companies that want to spin off their real estate into a REIT to be taxed - the distribution of either the real estate or operating assets would no longer be tax-free. Think of it like this, what if there were no new banks being formed. The banks that are already in existence would have a tremendous advantage due to limited competition. This makes it much more difficult for new Net Lease REITs to form, or at least go public by spinning their assets.
 However, one Net Lease REIT went public just in time… 

 What's on the Menu? Four Corners Property Trust Just over a year ago, Four Corners Property Trust completed its spinoff from Darden Restaurants Inc. (NYSE: DRI) into an independent public company trading on the NYSE. The company began trading as a C-Corp. became a REIT effective January 1, 2016. The portfolio was originally formed through a selection of 424 high-quality Darden restaurant properties with stable cash flows and strong rent coverage. Under the terms of the spinoff, Darden distributed all of the outstanding Four Corners shares pro rata to Darden shareholders of record as of the close of business Nov. 2. Darden shareholders retained their Darden shares and received 1 share of Four Corners for every 3 Darden shares held, with cash paid in lieu of fractional Four Corners shares. As you can see below, the FCPT portfolio now includes 466 properties in 44 states. The portfolio has grown from just a few brands into 16 brands: 

 When FCPT went public, the portfolio was comprised of only brands related to Darden (5 initial Darden restaurant brands: Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Bahama Breeze, Seasons 52, Wildfish Seafood Grille): 


 However, over the last year, FCPT has invested in a number of other properties (not affiliated with Darden). 11 additional brands acquired to date: KFC, Burger King, Arby's, Pizza Hut, Buffalo Wild Wings, Wendy's, Steak 'n Shake, Dairy Queen, Denny's, Fazoli's, Zaxby's. 

 Year-to-date FCPT has acquired 22 restaurants purchased for $37.2 million with a 17-year average lease term and going in cap rates between 6.5% and 7.2%. FCPT's portfolio tenants are principally investment grade (95%) with positive operating trends, fulsome public disclosure, and strong rent coverage (EBITDAR/rent of 4.2x). 

 Here's a snapshot of FCPT's portfolio diversification: 

 A Focus on Quality Income FCPT's portfolio is comprised of high-quality restaurant properties that demonstrate strong operating performance: 

 


 Also, FCPT has limited lease rollover risk as evidenced by the snapshot below: There are no lease maturities until 2027, and the weighted average lease term for the portfolio is just under 14 years. 

 The Balance Sheet FCPT's existing portfolio performed as planned during the third quarter and notably DRI was upgraded by all three rating agencies and is now rated BBB flat, BBB flat and Ba3. 

 FCPT is comprised of high-quality restaurant properties that demonstrate strong operating performance. The REIT's coverage ratios remain strong with cash interest coverage of 6x and net debt to cash EBITDA of 4.2x. 

 FCPT's current low leverage will increase as the company begins to draw on its 4-year $350 million revolver to initially finance acquisitions. Like most Net Lease REITs, FCPT is able to harvest organic cash flow growth from its portfolio of Triple Net leases. 


 These individual leases allow for maximum flexibility in resetting rent levels and laddering expiration dates. The DRI leases (with FCPT) have built-in 1.5% rent escalators and fair market value adjustments that provide organic growth. Most importantly, FCPT's portfolio (tenants) is currently 95% investment-grade rated. While there's an argument that one should not have all of their eggs in one basket, the one big egg in the FCPT basket is as solid as a rock. 

 The Latest Results In Q3-16, FCPT's Funds from Operations (or FFO) was $20.3 million, or $0.34 per diluted common share and Adjusted Funds from Operations (or AFFO) was $18.2 million, or $0.30 per diluted common share. The company's regular dividend is $0.2425 per common share for the third quarter of 2016. 

 Source: S&P Global Market Intelligence FCPT is seeking to grow and diversify with an initial focus on the quick service subsector in order to move the portfolio closer to reflecting the national restaurant landscape. FCPT plans to become a preferred partner and capital source for leading restaurant operators and franchisees, capitalizing on the current industry trends pushing operator consolidation and an "asset light" business model. FCPT looks to increase diversification by targeting different brands, meal price-points, cuisine types, and geographies. 


 Within the vast universe of properties, FCPT seeks to address the following restaurant subsection: 

 The franchisee industry is highly fragmented, but undergoing consolidation and growth by top players, presenting new partnership opportunities for FCPT. 

 FCPT pursues properties within the median range of Casual Dining, Fast Casual and Quick Service. Concepts with mid-level sales volumes provide rent support, while keeping rent at replaceable levels in case of vacancy. 

 Is Four Corners Property Trust In Your Strike Zone? 

 Source: S&P Global Market Intelligence This means that there is small cap volatility, but there's also the potential for significant growth within the highly fragmented marketplace. In the FCPT Investor Presentation, "Ted Williams described in his book, The Science of Hitting, that the most important thing, for a hitter, is to wait for the right pitch…and that's exactly the philosophy I have about investing...wait for the right pitch…and it will come…it's the key to investing." - Warren Buffett
 

 We like the fact that FCPT was able to enter the REIT sector and provide investors with another outlet to collect predictable dividends. Now it's time for the management team to manage risk and provide investors with steady dividend income and modest share price appreciation. Here's how the company has performed since going public over a year ago: 

 Source: S&P Global Market Intelligence As I ponder FCPT as a prospective investment in the Durable Income Portfolio, I ponder the risks. As I see it, high tenant concentration and lack of experience as a REIT are the biggest concerns. While I consider Darden attractive from a revenue perspective, I am still somewhat skittish on the prospects of having most of my eggs in one basket. What if I owned just one REIT? There's a reason I own over 25 REITs and there's also a reason that Realty Income is one of the REITs that I own (see my recent article HERE). Let's see how FCPT's P/FFO multiple compares with the peer group: 

 Source: S&P Global Market Intelligence As previously referenced, FCPT's dividend yield is 5.0% and while some investors may find that appealing, I believe there are better opportunities in the Net Lease REIT arena. For example, VER is trading at a 10.9 P/FFO multiple. While the company does have high concentration with Red Lobster, there are other investment grade tenants in the portfolio. VER's dividend yield is 6.6%.
 Also, we believe that there are better opportunities for income in the preferred space (we discuss the Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) preferred in our upcoming newsletter). In summary, we don't have FCPT in our strike zone. We believe that there are too many risks to justify the rewards. We would be a buyer if the yield was closer to 6.0% but even then, we would like to see more of a track record.

		  Company will reduce approximately $1 billion in debt and affirms combined DRI and FCPT annualized dividend is expected to be at least $2.20 per share

						 from   Darden Restaurants, Inc.: Financial 











 
















































 

 




















 


ORLANDO, Fla., Nov. 9, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Darden Restaurants, Inc. (NYSE:   DRI) ("Darden") announced today that it successfully completed its previously announced spin-off of select real estate and restaurant assets into Four Corners Property Trust, Inc. (NYSE:   FCPT) ("FCPT").  FCPT has become an independent, public company that intends to elect and qualify to be treated as a real estate investment trust (REIT) effective January 1, 2016.  
Under the terms of the spin-off, Darden shareholders received one common share of FCPT for every three shares of Darden common stock held as of the record date, which was the close of business on November 2, 2015.  Darden shareholders will receive cash in lieu of fractional FCPT shares.  The spin-off is expected to be tax-free to Darden shareholders.  Darden has received opinions from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and KPMG LLP that the spin-off will qualify as tax-free and has received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service on certain issues relevant to the qualification of the spin-off as tax-free.
In connection with the spin-off, Darden received cash proceeds from FCPT of $315 million, which it anticipates using, together with cash on hand, to retire approximately $1 billion in debt in the near future while maintaining its investment grade credit profile.
"Our successful spin-off of FCPT significantly advances Darden's commitment to deliver value to shareholders," said CEO Gene Lee. "Additionally, this transaction makes Darden stronger financially, with an improved capital structure and less debt."
FCPT shares will commence trading on November 10, 2015, on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "FCPT."  Darden will continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "DRI."
With the transaction complete, Darden expects the total combined dividend received by holders of Darden and FCPT will be at least equivalent to Darden's current dividend of $2.20 per annum.  This will include FCPT's expected annualized dividend of $1.35 per share which, as a result of the ratio of one share of FCPT common stock for every three shares of Darden common stock, would be equivalent to $0.45 per Darden share, plus at least $1.75 per share paid by Darden.



Minimum Aggregate Annualized Dividend Per Share (DPS)






DRI Annualized DPS – Pre Spin ($0.55 per quarter)


$2.20








Minimum DRI Annualized DPS – Post Spin ($0.4375 per quarter)


$1.75



FCPT Annualized DPS ($1.35, adjusted for 1:3 spin ratio)


$0.45








Minimum Aggregate DRI and FCPT annualized DPS – Post Spin


$2.20

The declaration and payment of any future dividends will continue to be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will be dependent upon Darden's financial position, results of operations, available cash, cash flow, capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by the Board. 
Darden's previously announced shareholder rights plan has expired as a result of the spin-off.  Stockholders are not required to take any action as a result of this expiration.  In addition, as previously announced, FCPT CEO Bill Lenehan has resigned his seat on Darden's Board of Directors now that the spin-off is complete.
Darden was represented in the spin-off by Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and Hogan Lovells US LLP.  J.P. Morgan and Moelis & Company served as financial advisers.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.      Key Stock Data    P/E Ratio (TTM)  19.70 (07/28/17)      EPS (TTM)  $1.30      Market Cap $1.51 B     Shares Outstanding 60.02 M     Public Float 59.72 M     Yield 3.79% (07/28/17)      Latest Dividend $0.2425 (07/17/17)      Ex-Dividend Date 06/28/17       ?    Shares Sold Short The total number of shares of a security that have been sold short and not yet repurchased. Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    1.01      Net Money Flow ($)  9,644    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.
