Ted Phillips | Talking Management
CEO, Chicago Bears
Ted Phillips is the first Chicago Bears CEO from outside the Halas family. In nine years, he has overseen a host of changes to the storied franchise--and led the team back to the championship. The Bears' 2007 Super Bowl run was its first appearance there since 1986.  In an interview with Crain's, Mr. Phillips discusses the challenge of being an accountant in a football organization. He's learned how to delegate to his coach and general manager, although Mr. Phillips says he never tells head coach Lovie Smith who to play on Sunday, or GM Jerry Angelo who to draft. However, he does ask a lot of questions.  Mr. Phillips also talks about how he rides out the inevitable losing seasons. That's where continuity of leadership comes in, he says.

Richard Melman | Talking Management
Founder and Chairman, Lettuce Entertain You Enterprises Inc.
Richard Melman went into the restaurant business because he didn't know what else to do. During a brief stint as a salesman for Fuller Brush Co., Mr. Melman learned that he didn't like having doors slammed in his face. Instead of asking people for something, he thought he'd try doing something for them. That led him to open a restaurant--R. J. Grunt's in Lincoln Park--in 1971. Today he presides over Lettuce Entertain You Enterprises Inc., a dining empire of 75 restaurants in six states.
