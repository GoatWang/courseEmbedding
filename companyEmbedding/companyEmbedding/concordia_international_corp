Provides Business UpdatePR NewswireDecember 19, 2016ReblogShareTweetShareOAKVILLE, ON, Dec. 19, 2016 /PRNewswire/ - Concordia International Corp. ("Concordia" or the "Company") (CXRX) (CXR.TO), an international specialty pharmaceutical company focused on generic and legacy pharmaceutical products and orphan drugs, today announced that the Company has paid the first installment of its earn-out to Cinven1 relating to Concordia's October 2015 acquisition of Amdipharm Mercury Limited. All financial references below are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted.   Today's payment of £72 million was paid with cash on hand generated by the Company's cash flows. Following today's payment, the Company has a cash balance of approximately $410 million2. The Company also has up to an additional $200 million available under its undrawn revolving credit facility, subject to compliance with certain debt incurrence covenants if drawn upon.The Company believes that it has access to sufficient liquidity to meet all of its near term financial obligations, as it continues to focus on developing a new long term strategic plan. "A few weeks into my new role as CEO, and having met the majority of our employees, key shareholders and debtholders, I am looking forward to working with our senior management team and board of directors to chart a path forward that will help us rebuild value for all stakeholders," stated Mr. Oberman. "This plan will focus on management's key priorities for the Company, which include operational excellence, portfolio expansion, financial management and stakeholder outreach.  We are working to execute on each of these priorities, and in furtherance of our focus on operational excellence, we have recently implemented the termination of the Company's phase 3 trial for Photodynamic Therapy with Photofrin® and the elimination of the Company's contract sales force in the first phase of this plan.  We look forward to providing a progress update during our regular year-end reporting, anticipated in March 2017."Termination of the Company's Phase 3 Trial for Photodynamic Therapy with Photofrin® The Company continues to market Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) with Photofrin® for its FDA-approved indications, which include esophageal cancer, high-grade dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus and non-small cell lung cancer. However, after careful consideration, Concordia has decided to terminate enrollment for its phase 3 trial, which is evaluating PDT with Photofrin® as a potential treatment for cholangiocarcinoma, a rare form of cancer.  Patients currently enrolled in the phase 3 trial will continue through to completion. The decision to end the trial does not diminish management's confidence in PDT with Photofrin®'s potential as a commercial product. Rather, it is reflective of some of the challenges the Company experienced enrolling the trial for a rare disease that affects a relatively small patient population. The Company intends to redirect its resources to other potential PDT with Photofrin® opportunities.Elimination of Contract Sales TeamAs part of the Company's ongoing evaluation of its business, Concordia has decided to further reduce expenses by terminating its current contract sales team that was promoting Donnatal®. Donnatal® is a commercial therapy prescribed to treat irritable bowel syndrome. The Company believes it has allocated the appropriate amount of time to assess the impact of its contract sales force on Donnatal® sales and concluded that the results were not in line with expectations.  Management expects Donnatal® to remain an important product for Concordia and intends to evaluate new cost-effective opportunities to market the product, including co-promotion arrangements. Nasdaq Biotech IndexIn addition, the Company announced it will be removed from the Nasdaq Biotech Index (NBI) effective prior to the market open today. On an annual basis, Nasdaq re-ranks the NBI based on market capitalization parameters that Concordia currently does not meet. About ConcordiaConcordia is a diverse, international specialty pharmaceutical company focused on generic and legacy pharmaceutical products and orphan drugs. The Company has an international footprint with sales in more than 100 countries, and has a diversified portfolio of more than 200 established, off-patent molecules that make up more than 1,300 SKUs. Concordia also markets orphan drugs through its Orphan Drugs Division, consisting of Photofrin® for the treatment of certain rare forms of cancer.Read MoreConcordia operates out of facilities in Oakville, Ontario and, through its subsidiaries, operates out of facilities in Bridgetown, Barbados; London, England and Mumbai, India.Notice regarding forward-looking statements and information:This press release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and forward-looking information within the meaning of Canadian securities laws, regarding Concordia and its business, which may include, but are not limited to the Company's cash balances, the availability of the revolving credit facility, the Company having sufficient liquidity to meet all of its near term financial obligations, the development of a new long term strategic plan, rebuilding value for all stakeholders, management's key priorities and the execution of those priorities, the Company providing progress updates (including in March 2017), continuing to market PDT with Photofrin®, confidence in PDT with Photofrin® as a potential commercial product, the potential of PDT with Photofrin®, the availability of other opportunities for PDT with Photofrin®, Donnatal® remaining an important product for the Company, and the evaluation of new cost-effective opportunities for Donnatal® (including, co-promotion opportunities).
