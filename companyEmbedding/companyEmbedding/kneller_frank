Summary


C-LEVEL EXECUTIVE: GLOBAL LEADERSHIP LEAD THROUGH HIGH-GROWTH | DRIVE TOP TO THE BOTTOM LINE | DELIVER ACROSS ALL METRICS I'm an adaptable executive who leads companies through challenge of high-growth and change to drive results because that is a pattern that began with my first job experience.A wise colleague once described my impact on the organization as "flying the plane while building it.” He was right in that I build teams that design forward-thinking strategies and execute with conviction -- while still driving top line growth to the bottom line. As a change agent, I am known for shifting corporate and franchise / dealer culture as means to boost productivity and enhance customer satisfaction. Delivered double-digit revenue growth (e.g. 70%+) and triple digit profit growth (e.g. 220%+).Organizations in which I’ve led, both from the C-suite and other executive roles, reflect my personal passion. My personal mission is to retain and enhance the value of consumers’ largest investments: their home and their vehicles. My leadership style can be summed up in this explanation: "It is critical to be able to lead from in front and behind", if there is turbulence in the business be ready to take the lead position, if performance is good and no head winds, let your people benefit from the tailwind and take the lead and the recognition."I am multilingual: English and professionally conversational French and Spanish. Having lived internationally for a third of my life, I've built an extensive background  leading international multi-business unit line operations.► Strategic Analysis & Planning► Acquisitions & Divestitures ► Manufacturing Plants► Automotive Aftermarket► Operational Excellence► Executive Team Development ► Dealer & Franchise DevelopmentPlease contact me through www.linkedin.com/in/frankkneller/ franklinkneller@gmail.com 847 337-4076 (mobile)
