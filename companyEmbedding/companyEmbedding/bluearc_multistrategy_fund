How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

BlueArc Capital Raises $39M For New Hedge Fund
Apr 14 2014  |  1:56pm ET

Atlanta, Georgia based BlueArc Capital Management has raised $39 million for a new hedge fund.
The BlueArc Multi-Strategy Fund began selling on April 1, 2014, according to regulatory filings. Minimum investment in the new fund—as in all BlueArc funds—is $250,000.
Keel Point Advisors, a multi-family office with an ongoing relationship with BlueArc, is co-investment manager of the fund.
Ronald Zazworsky, Jr. is founder and CEO of BlueArc which began operations in 2005, providing alternative investment funds to family office and qualified purchaser investors with a primary focus on private equity and hedge fund investment strategies.
As of March 17, 2014 BlueArc, which runs a number of other strategies, had $279 million in discretionary and non-discretionary assets under management.
Attempts to contact BlueArc for comment were unsuccessful as of press time.

UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT

THIS UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT effective the 24th day of November, 2014, by and between BLUEARC MULTI-STRATEGY FUND, a Delaware business trust, having its principal office and place of business at One Buckhead Plaza, 3060 Peachtree Road, Suite 1600, Atlanta, Georgia 30305 (the �Trust�), and NORTHERN LIGHTS DISTRIBUTORS, LLC, a Nebraska limited liability company having its principal office and place of business at 17605 Wright Street, Omaha, Nebraska
�68130 (�NLD�).

WHEREAS, the Trust is offering shares of beneficial interest (the �Shares�) in separate investment portfolios as set forth on Schedule A, as may be amended from time to time (each a �Fund� and collectively, the �Funds�), and each a series of the Trust; and

WHEREAS, the Trust is a closed-end management investment company to be registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the �1940 Act�); and

WHEREAS, NLD is registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("1934 Act"), as a broker-dealer and is engaged in the business of selling shares of registered investment companies either directly to purchasers or through other financial intermediaries; and

WHEREAS, the Trust desires that NLD offer, as principal underwriter, the Shares of the Funds to the public and NLD is willing to provide those services on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement in order to promote the growth of the Funds and facilitate the distribution of the Shares;

NOW THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein, the Trust and NLD hereby agree as follows:

1.
APPOINTMENT OF NLD AND DELIVERY OF DOCUMENTS

(a)
The Trust hereby appoints NLD, and NLD hereby agrees, to act as principal underwriter and distributor of the Shares of the Funds for the period and on the terms set forth in this Agreement. �In connection therewith, the Funds have delivered to NLD current copies of:

(i)
the Trust�s Agreement and Declaration of Trust and By-laws (the �Organizational Documents�);

(ii)
the Trust�s current Registration Statement;

(iii)
the Trust�s �notification of registration under the 1940 Act on Form N-8A as filed with the SEC;



Page 3 of 21





(iv)
the Trust�s current Prospectus and Statement of Additional Information (as currently in effect and as amended or supplemented, the �Prospectus�); and

(v)
each current shareholder service plan or similar document adopted by the Trust (�Service Plan�).

(b)
The Trust shall promptly furnish NLD with:

(i)
all amendments of or supplements to the foregoing; and

(ii)
a copy of the resolution of the Board appointing NLD and authorizing the execution and delivery of this Agreement.

2.
NATURE OF DUTIES

(a)
NLD shall act as distributor of the Funds except that the rights given under this Agreement to NLD shall not apply to: �(i)�Shares issued in connection with the merger, consolidation or reorganization of any other investment company or series or class thereof with a Fund or class thereof; (ii) the Trust�s acquisition by purchase or otherwise of all or substantially all of the assets or stock of any other investment company or series or class thereof; (iii) the reinvestment in Shares by the Funds� shareholders of dividends or other distributions; or (iv) any other offering by the Funds of securities to its shareholders (collectively "exempt transactions").

(b)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, NLD is and may in the future distribute shares of other investment companies including investment companies having investment objectives similar to those of the Funds. �The Funds further understand that existing and future investors in the Funds may invest in shares of such other investment companies. �The Funds agree that the services that NLD provides to such other investment companies shall not be deemed in conflict with its duties to the Funds under this Agreement.

3.
OFFERING OF SHARES

(a)
NLD shall have the right to buy from the Funds the Shares needed to fill unconditional orders for Shares of the Funds placed with NLD by investors or selected dealers or selected agents (each as defined in Section 12 hereof) acting as agent for their customers� or on their own behalf. Alternatively, NLD may act as the Funds� agent, to offer, and to solicit offers to subscribe to, Shares of the Funds.

(b)
The price that NLD shall pay for Shares purchased from the Funds shall be the NAV used in determining the Public Offering Price on which the orders are based. �Shares purchased by NLD are to be resold by NLD to investors at the respective Public Offering 



Page 4 of 21




Price(s), or to selected dealers or selected agents acting in accordance with the terms of selected dealer or selected agent agreements described in Section 12 of this Agreement. �The Funds will advise NLD of the NAV(s) each time that it is determined by the Funds, or its designated agent, and at such other times as NLD may reasonably request.

(c)
NLD will promptly forward all orders and subscriptions to the Funds or its designated agent. �All orders and all subscriptions shall be directed to the Funds for acceptance and shall not be binding until accepted by the Funds. �Any order or subscription may be rejected by the Funds; provided, however, that the Funds will not arbitrarily or without reasonable cause refuse to accept or confirm orders or subscriptions for the purchase of Shares. �The Funds or its designated agent will confirm orders and subscriptions upon their receipt, will make appropriate book entries and, upon receipt by the Funds or its designated agent of payment therefore, will issue such Shares in uncertificated form pursuant to the instructions of NLD. �NLD agrees to cause such payment and such instructions to be delivered promptly to the Funds or its designated agent.

(d)
The Funds reserve the right to suspend the offering of Shares of the Funds at any time in the absolute discretion of the Board, and upon notice of such suspension NLD shall cease to offer Shares of the Funds specified in the notice.

(e)
No Shares shall be offered by either NLD or the Funds under any of the provisions of this Agreement and no orders for the purchase or sale of Shares hereunder shall be accepted by the Funds if and so long as the effectiveness of the Registration Statement then in effect or any necessary amendments thereto shall be suspended under any of the provisions of the Securities Act, or if and so long as a current Prospectus, as required by Section 10(b) of the Securities Act, as amended, is not on file with the SEC; provided, however, that nothing contained in this paragraph shall in any way limit the Funds� obligation to repurchase Shares from any shareholder in accordance with the provisions of the Fund's Organizational Documents or the Prospectus applicable to the Shares.

4.
LICENSED REPRESENTATIVES OF THE FUNDS

At the request of the Trust, a Fund, a Fund�s sponsor, adviser or affiliate, NLD may license certain designated employees as a �registered representative� and maintain their licensed status in accordance with FINRA rules and regulations including the following:

(a)
filing Form U-4�s and fingerprint submission and processing renewals and terminations;

(b)
on-going compliance up-dates and training;

(c)
preparation of materials and training for compliance with FINRA continuing education requirements; and



Page 5 of 21





(d)
supervision of registered representatives.

NLD reserves the right in its sole discretion of refuse to register or maintain the registration for any individual and otherwise impose any requirements, fees or limitations on licensed persons.

5.
REPURCHASE OF SHARES BY THE TRUST

Shares of the Funds are not redeemable, but shall be repurchased by the Trust in accordance with its obligations as set forth in the Organizational Documents and the Prospectus relating to the Shares.

6.
DUTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS OF NLD

(a)
NLD shall use reasonable efforts to facilitate the sale of Shares of the Funds upon the terms and conditions contained herein and in the then current Prospectus. �NLD shall devote reasonable time and effort to facilitate the distribution of Fund shares but shall not be obligated to sell any specific number of Shares. �The services of NLD to the Funds hereunder are not to be deemed exclusive, and nothing herein contained shall prevent NLD from entering into like arrangements with other investment companies so long as the performance of its obligations hereunder is not impaired thereby.

(b)
NLD will execute and deliver agreements with broker/dealers, financial institutions and other industry professionals based on forms of agreement approved from time to time by the Board with respect to shares of the Funds, including but not limited to forms of sales support agreements and shareholder servicing agreements.

(c)
NLD shall be responsible for reviewing and providing advice and counsel on, and filing with FINRA, all sales literature (e.g., advertisements, brochures and shareholder communications, including the Fund�s website) with respect to the Funds. �All costs associated with advertising filings shall be paid by the Funds. �NLD will forward all FINRA comments on marketing materials to the Trust for incorporation into such materials and the sole responsibility for incorporation of such comments shall remain with the Trust; provided, however, that the Trust shall provide all factual content, opinion, and other content for such materials and NLD shall not be responsible for the accuracy of the content of such materials, when used thereafter by the Trust or any person authorized by the Trust to use such material; nor shall NLD be responsible for the filing
or content of any such materials used by third parties without the authorization of NLD; and provided further that NLD shall not be responsible for filing any materials that fall within the definition of advertising and sales literature if such materials are not provided to NLD in a form suitable for filing in a timely manner. �In addition, NLD will provide one or more persons, during normal business hours, to respond to telephone questions with respect to the Funds.

(d)
NLD will forward all sales related complaints concerning the Funds to the Trust.

(e)
NLD will provide assistance in the preparation of quarterly board materials with regard to sales and other distribution related data reasonably requested by the Board of the Funds.

(f)
All activities by NLD and its agents and employees as distributor of Shares shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including, without limitation, the 1940 Act, the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act, and FINRA Rules, all rules and regulations made or adopted pursuant to the 1940 Act by the SEC or any securities association registered under the Securities Exchange Act.

(g)
In selling Shares of the Funds, NLD shall use its best efforts in all material respects duly to conform with the requirements of all federal and state laws relating to the sale of the Shares. �Neither NLD, any selected dealer, any selected agent nor any other person is authorized by the Funds to give any information or to make any representations other than as is contained in a Funds� Prospectus or any advertising materials or sales literature specifically approved in writing by the Funds or their agents.

(h)
NLD shall adopt and follow procedures for the confirmation of sales to investors and selected dealers or selected agents, the collection of amounts payable by investors and selected dealers or selected agents on such sales, and the cancellation of unsettled transactions, as may be necessary to comply with the requirements of FINRA.
