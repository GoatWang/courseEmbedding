30 ft. Tape Measure

Measure surfaces and materials quickly for a variety of different applications using the Milwaukee® 30-Foot Tape Measure. This tool features a blueprint, or architect, scale, which lets you calculate materials needed for tasks based on 1/4-inch and 1/8-inch drawings. For durability, the Milwaukee 30-foot tape measure has a 5-point reinforced frame. It also has nylon bond blade protection for corrosion resistance. The two-sided printing on this tool lets you see measurements from above and below for your convenience. If you're working alone, the Milwaukee heavy-duty tape measure offers up to a 9-foot standout. A 360-degree hook attachment lets the tape measure grip materials at multiple angles. For the safety of your fingers when the blade retracts, the tool features a finger stop. It also comes with a built-in wire form belt clip for transportation that won't tear your pocket.

Rated 5 out of

Rock solid, feature packed and built to last!
I have owned many tape measures over the years and I can safely say they all measure out the same. But, using the different tape measures provides different experiences. I have settled on the Milwaukee 30" to meet my measuring needs. The Milwaukee 30' tape is long enough for my needs - anything longer and I use a cloth tape. The ergonomics of this tape are really good - the body is comfortable to hold and measure and has a tape stop to keep your fingers from getting pinched. The end of the tape has a 360 degree hook to secure the end of the tape from a bunch of angles allowing me to use the tape without someone else to hold the end. Unlike most other tapes I have used this tape has blueprint scale builtin to help estimate the correct amount of materials to by to get the job done. This has saved me more than one trip to to the lumberyard for re supply. Most importantly, the Milwaukee 30' tape has a lifetime limited warranty - so if it goes bad - it goes back! Saving me money in the long run. I would and have purchased this product again.

Frame Size Information
If you look on the inside of the arm of your glasses you find will something that looks like: 52 [] 16 135.
This is information on the size of your glasses: the lens diameter, the bridge width and the arm length, all measured in millimetres.



The Eye Width, or Lens Diameter, is the width of the lens (in mm), measured from the bridge. (In this example, the Eye Width is 52.)
The Bridge Width is the gap above your nose between the lenses. It should be comfortable. Too tight, and the glasses could pinch your nose; too loose and the glasses will not be stable on your face. (In this example, the Bridge Width is 16.)
The Temple Length, or Arm Length, is usually one of three standards ďż˝ 135, 140 or 145mm. The arm should be long enough to sit comfortably over your ears. Glasses with straight arms do not always have this measurement indicated. (In this example, the Temple Length is 135.)

For the day of 07/28/2017 














Karen Peters (State College PA)






 "The prescription glasses I ordered are perfect. It took about 2 1/2 weeks for them to arrive. I am pleased with the quality of the product and the customer service. " 













Debra Carter (Central New Jersey)






 "I was extremely satisfied with the price, the fantastic customer service, the selection!  I was concerned with certain details of the frame so Customer Service actually called the manufacturer to reassure me while I waited - she went out of her way.  The item was shipped promptly, was beautiful and just exactly as described; I was extremely pleased with the service, price and sunglasses!" 













Freda (Augusta, GA)






 "I am very pleased with my transaction.  Not only did I receive a great deal on my glasses (about $100 cheaper than everywhere else with FREE shipping too), but shipping was super fast as well!  I was a little skeptical about ordering from this site, but I will definitely recommend EZ Contacts to everyone I know!  "
