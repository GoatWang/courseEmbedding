(Formerly known as the Cambiar Unconstrained Equity Fund) The Cambiar Global Ultra Focus Fund is a concentrated, non-diversified portfolio that is made up of the highest conviction names from our Opportunity, Small Cap, SMID and International Equity Funds.  In general, portfolio construction is based on a stock by stock analysis.  The investment team will rely heavily on fundamentals and valuations, while taking into consideration global macro events.

The Fund may also engage in some proprietary shorting that Cambiar calls parent-subsidiary arbitrage (PASA).  At certain times, the market valuation of a parent company and that of the subsidiary can become disconnected and nonsensical, creating unique opportunities.


Non-diversified fund designed for long-term capital appreciation


Concentrated 20-30 stock portfolio.


Global portfolio with a bias towards U.S. stocks.


Fund may hold derivatives, pair trades and occasional short positions.

Disclosure
The Global Ultra Focus Fund was formerly known as the Cambiar Unconstrained Equity Fund.
Mutual fund investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. In addition to the normal risks associated with investing, international investments may involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuation in currency values, from differences in generally accepted accounting principles or from economic or political instability in other nations.  Emerging Markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors as well as increased volatility and lower trading volume. The Fund may invest in derivatives, which are often more volatile than other investments and may magnify the Fund's gains or losses. With short sales, you risk paying more for a security than you received from its sale. Short sales losses are potentially unlimited and the expenses involved with the shorting strategy may negatively impact the performance of the Fund. Diversification may not protect against market risk. The Cambiar Global Ultra Focus Fund is a non-diversified fund.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or “star rating”, is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product’s monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. CAMAX was rated against 714 World Stock funds over a three year period and 590 funds over a five year period. With respect to these World Stock funds, CAMAX received a rating of 1 stars for the three year and 4 stars for the five year period, respectively. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Russell 3000 Index returns do not reflect any management fees, transaction costs or expenses. Individuals cannot invest directly in an Index.
P/E ratio 1 YR Forecast is a calculation that divides the current share price by the estimates of earnings in the next four quarters. Debt/Equity - Long Term is a calculation that takes interest bearing, long-term debt divided by shareholder equity. EPS Growth - Long Term is a calculation that takes the company’s estimated profits for five years divided by the outstanding shares. Alpha is a measure of risk-adjusted performance. Beta is a measure of risk in relation to the market or benchmark. The Sharpe Ratio is a direct measure of reward-to-risk and is calculated by subtracting the risk free rate from the rate of return for a portfolio and dividing the result by the standard deviation. Standard Deviation is a statistical measure of historical volatility; a measure of the extent to which numbers are spread around their average. R-Squared measures how closely a portfolio’s performance correlates with the performance of a benchmark index.  These calculations are not a forecast of the Fund’s future performance.

The Cambiar Small Cap Fund is a team-managed portfolio designed to capitalize on U.S. small cap investments.  The Fund employs an equal-weight portfolio construction approach. We believes this approach enables the strategy to maintain a more focused portfolio relative to its peers, while also mitigating stock-specific risk via uniform position sizes.

All new stock positions enter the portfolio at a range of 1.5%-2% (based on liquidity). 
The investable universe for the strategy includes companies in the $500 million - $3 billion market cap range.
The Fund holds between 45-55 stocks.
The Fund is diversified across multiple sectors/industries.

Commentary
Market Review (6.30.2017)
U.S. equities (as defined by the S&P 500 Index) posted their seventh consecutive quarter of positive returns, gaining 3.1% in the second quarter.  We believe the path of least resistance remains to the upside for equities, although red flags in the form of elevated valuations, tightening monetary policy and investor complacency bear watching.  At one point during the quarter, market volatility (VIX) levels reached a closing low mark not seen since the 4th quarter of 1993 (source: Chicago Board Options Exchange).  Although market nay-sayers will point to investor complacency as a precursor to a market decline, we see no historical data to substantiate this claim.  That said, the massive shift to passive investments results in a uniquely different market structure vs. previous cycles; a relevant consideration is how stock prices will react should the market become more stressed.
While equities may now be in the later innings of the recovery that began in 2009, corporate earnings remain healthy in the aggregate, inflation levels are benign, and international markets have also begun to participate to the upside.  As discussed in previous commentaries, Cambiar believes that stock selection will take on more importance as we get into the later stages of the business/market cycle.
Growth vs. Value
One of the more notable performance trends in the equity markets this year to date has been the wide performance gap between growth and value stocks.  This divergence in returns began in the first quarter, and continued to widen in the second quarter before closing a bit in June.  As the below graphs illustrate, earnings estimates have been raised across S&P 500 participants in the aggregate, which typically coincides with multiple expansion.  Yet value stocks (as defined by the S&P 500 Value) have experienced multiple compression for much of the year, while growth stocks have seen their multiples re-rate to the upside
Fundamentals vs Multiple Expansion
  
Source: Bloomberg.  For illustrative Purposes Only
The outperformance of growth stocks coincides with a flattening/decline in bond yields, implying increased market skepticism towards economic growth, and thus we feel, favoring companies who possess higher organic growth rates.  Not surprisingly, the surge in growth stocks has been most prominent in the technology sector – examples include Amazon, Apple and Facebook.  While each of these companies deserve premium valuations given high market shares and de-facto monopoly business profiles, the increases in market capitalizations begin to question whether the embedded market expectations are realistic/achievable.
Needless to say, the market environment thus far in 2017 has been less friendly for value practitioners.  Cambiar’s response has been to remain focused on the fundamentals, and to not lose sight of the objective in what has been an obviously potent – and potentially overdone – growth flip.  Style-driven markets tend to self-cancel over longer timeframes, but can influence performance over shorter periods.  Cambiar’s relatively low allocation to growth-oriented segments of the market, as well as being a bit too ‘value-y’ has been a headwind vs. benchmarks over the first two quarters of the year. Yet given the low valuation/low expectation intersection in which many of our companies reside, even a modest change in market sentiment could provide a boost to the Cambiar portfolios.
Small Cap Fund
The Cambiar Small Cap Fund was unable to keep pace with the strategy’s assigned benchmarks in the quarter – an admittedly frustrating performance in an environment that was relatively conducive to active management.  Cambiar’s underperformance vs. the Russell 2000 Index is more understandable, given this benchmarks higher allocation to growth stocks (which have outperformed value by a wide margin in 2017). 
Cambiar remains disciplined in identifying companies that meet our purchase criteria, which has admittedly been more difficult in a relatively expensive small cap market.  Price discovery has been more evident in 2017, and correlations across sectors have declined – both of these factors provide an improved backdrop for active managers to add value.  Although the healthier environment has yet to translate into outperformance for the strategy, Cambiar remains confident that the portfolio can rebound in the back half of the year.
At a sector level, Technology continued to be a challenging space for the portfolio as Cambiar’s tech holdings had the largest negative impact in Q2.  A reasonable criticism is that the portfolio seems to be out of sync with the market, notably in the technology sector - where a value mindset in the face of significant technological disruption can be asymmetric to the downside.  Perhaps the Fund has been too “value-y”; that said, we believe the tech companies we own maintain strong marketshare, generate consistent cashflow and remain relevant in their respective endmarkets.  ATM processor Cardtronics is a 2Q case in point regarding Cambiar’s struggles in the Tech sector.  The stock declined after lowering earnings for 2017.  Cambiar anticipated 2017 to be a transition year as the company worked to integrate a number of restructuring initiatives.  However, short-term execution issues as well as slowing same store sales growth were the primary cause of the earnings shortfall in Q2.  Cambiar continues to believe these issues to be transitory, and are confident in the ability of management to execute their business plan. 
Energy stocks took another leg down in the quarter, as oil prices continued to slide before recovering a bit at the end of June.  While only averaging ~6% of the portfolio, Cambiar’s energy positions have been a detractor to performance.  Although the market is focused on the number of oil rigs coming online, an overlooked data point is oil production within shale – which has started to flatten.  Assuming that demand remains robust, Cambiar believes that oil prices are poised to move higher in the second half of the year, which should trigger a re-rating in the portfolio’s holdings in the sector.  
The Consumer Staples sector is traditionally viewed to be the lower beta segment of the portfolio, given the companies’ relatively stable demand trends.  Yet the sector was anything but stable in the quarter, as Amazon’s purchase of Whole Foods triggered a sell-off on fears of reduced pricing power and lower margins stemming from the deal.  The Fund was hampered by both an overweight allocation to the sector as well as below-benchmark stock performance.  United Natural Foods and Dean Foods were two underperforming positions in the quarter.  In our view, the market’s negative response in both cases is a ‘shoot first’ response, as there is nothing imminent that derails their respective investment cases.  Both companies we feel offer attractive free cashflow yields and possess attractive upside. 
Bright spots in the quarter included positive stock selection in Healthcare and Financials.  Healthcare was a notable underperformer in the first quarter; the subsequent outperformance in 2Q illustrates the need for patience and not over-reacting to shorter-term stock moves.  Individual outperformers included Bruker Corporation and Molina Healthcare.  Molina’s re-rating in the quarter was due to the departure of the firm’s founders after a period of disappointing financial performance.  Many believe (Cambiar included) that a new executive team can drive margin expansion and earnings growth for Molina.  Although Cambiar took advantage of the recovery in the stock to trim the holding back to policy weight, we believe the long-term outlook remains positive.
Trading activity within the portfolio was fairly light in Q2, which points to Cambiar’s continued conviction in the strategy’s aggregate exposures – despite the slow start to 2017.  The valuation support remains intact for a number of the portfolio’s current underperformers – we acknowledge the value trap tone of this comment, but do not believe that to be the case.  Although encouraged to see some of our detractors from the first quarter become strong contributors more recently, the portfolio has yet to put it all together.
Although moving further in the rearview mirror, the past success of the Small Cap Fund (as well as solid performance in Cambiar’s other domestic offerings) gives us confidence in the ability to demonstrate a greater degree of efficacy in the portfolio.  That said, we are aware that performance is the final proof statement, and that stronger results are imperative to restore confidence in the strategy.  As mean reversion is an underlying tenet to the Cambiar discipline, the Fund is certainly overdue to experience some mean reversion vs. the benchmarks.
Looking Ahead
U.S. equities moved higher in the first half of 2017, as corporates delivered on the earnings front and there were no notable disruptions (i.e., ‘risk off’) moves as has been the case in previous years.  To this point, equities have not been susceptible to tightening monetary policy, as the two interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve barely made a ripple in the market.  The heavy skew of asset flows into passively managed instruments is likely a contributing factor to the low volatility that has permeated the equity markets – vs. history as well as relative to fixed income.

Source: Bloomberg
While Cambiar maintains a fairly constructive outlook for equities, we anticipate that the glidepath may get a bit bumpier in the second half of 2017.  Statistically speaking – can we get much lower as it relates to market volatility?  Additional moves by the Fed in the way of rate hikes/balance sheet reduction actions at a time when inflation is lower than expected may also start to impact the markets via tightening liquidity.  As discussed in our 1Q commentary, the direction of stock prices should be positively correlated to earnings, as there is not much room left for multiple expansion.  On this front, earnings have been solid, and businesses could get an additional lift in the second half of the year should some of the Trump Administration’s pro-growth policies come to pass.      
Regardless of the environment, the Cambiar formula for seeking to outperform the market has not changed: invest in quality businesses whose current valuation is not indicative of their normalized earnings power, identify inflection points that can drive mean reversion in fundamentals/earnings, and be patient in waiting for the stock to reflect the inherent value.

The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. CAMSX was rated against 646 US-domiciled Small Blend funds over a three year time period, 545 funds over a five year period and 389 funds over a ten year period. With respect to these small blend funds, CAMSX received a Morningstar rating of 1 stars for the three year, 1 stars for the five year period, and 2 stars for the 10 year period, respectively.

Commentary
Market Review (6.30.2017)
Global equities maintained their upward trajectory into the second quarter, highlighted by strength in the European markets.  The MSCI Europe Index returned 7.4% in 2Q, doubling up on the 3.1% return for the S&P 500 Index.  Europe has been a few years behind the U.S. in its recovery from the global financial crisis, yet economic data coming out of the Eurozone has been encouraging – providing a healthy backdrop for earnings gains.  Monetary policy in Europe remains generally accommodative, although the European Central Bank (ECB) has begun discussing steps in removing the stimulus punch bowl.  Emerging Markets, as measured by the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, also posted positive gains for the quarter, and remain one of the top-performing asset classes on a year-to-date basis.
Growth vs. Value
One of the more notable performance trends in the equity markets this year has been the wide performance gap between growth and value stocks.  This divergence in returns began in the first quarter, and continued to widen in the second quarter before closing a bit in June.  As the below graphs illustrate, earnings estimates have been raised across international equities in the aggregate, which typically coincides with multiple expansion.  Yet value stocks (as defined by the MSCI EAFE Value Index) have experienced multiple compression, while growth stocks have seen their multiples re-rate to the upside.
Fundamentals vs Multiple Expansion
  
Source: Bloomberg. For illustrative purposes only.
The outperformance of growth stocks coincides with a flattening/decline in bond yields, implying increased market skepticism towards economic growth, and thus we feel, favoring companies who possess higher organic growth rates.  Not surprisingly, the surge in growth stocks has been most prominent in the technology sector – examples include Amazon, Apple, Alibaba and Tencent.  While each of these companies deserve premium valuations given high market shares and de-facto monopoly business profiles, their respective increases in market capitalizations begin to question whether the embedded market expectations are realistic/achievable.
Needless to say, the market environment thus far in 2017 has been less friendly for value practitioners.  Cambiar’s response has been to remain focused on the fundamentals, and to not lose sight of the objective in what has been a potent – and potentially overdone – growth flip.  Style-driven markets tend to self-cancel over longer timeframes, but can influence performance over shorter periods.  Cambiar’s relatively low allocation to growth-oriented segments of the market, as well as being a bit too ‘value-y’ had been a headwind vs. benchmarks over the first two quarters of the year. Yet given the low valuation/low expectation intersection in which many of our companies reside, even a modest change in market sentiment could provide a boost to the Cambiar portfolios.
Global Equity Fund                                                                                                                              
Although positive in absolute terms, the Cambiar Global Equity Fund trailed the strategy’s assigned benchmarks for the second quarter.  The performance shortfall in the quarter is primarily attributed to security selection, as the portfolio’s overweight allocation to Europe had a positive effect on performance.  Implementing a value discipline in a market that clearly favors growth has been a headwind; that said, an impartial assessment also points to the need for better performance from the positions we own.  Stock selection has historically been an attribute at Cambiar, and while disappointed that the Global portfolio has not participated to a greater extent thus far in 2017, we remain constructive on the outlook for our companies.     
Portfolio buy/sell activity in the quarter was in line with previous time periods.  A rare intra-quarter round trip involved the purchase and subsequent sale of Royal Ahold Delhaize; Ahold owns a number of supermarket brands in Europe and the U.S.  Within weeks after initiating the position, Amazon’s purchase of Whole Foods jeopardized the investment case for Ahold – which was predicated on increasing free cashflow and margin improvement.  In light of the change in the competitive landscape (particularly when it involves a competitor with particularly deep pockets and a willingness to manage the business at a loss), Cambiar took a modest loss in the position and moved on to fight another day.
Energy stocks remained in reverse during the second quarter; the Global portfolio was negatively impacted by an overweight allocation in the sector as well as below-benchmark returns during the quarter.  Despite positive steps taken by companies in the form of restructuring, improvement of balance sheets and an increased focus on free cashflow, stock prices remain highly correlated to underlying commodity prices, which have been on a downward trajectory since the start of the year.  The market remains fixated on the weekly Energy Information Administration (EIA) inventory reports, with draws positive for the sector and inventory builds sparking a sell-off.  While acknowledging that the rebalance of oil supply and demand has taken longer than expected, Cambiar does anticipate that oil prices will firm in the second half of the year.  Given the overwhelmingly negative sentiment enveloping the sector, it would not take much in the way of good news for energy stocks to begin performing more favorably.
The Healthcare sector has been one of the top-performing sectors in the market thus far in 2017 –likely a function of more positive investor sentiment, improving fundamentals and reduced threat of pricing reform.  Cambiar has maintained an overweight position in Healthcare during the year; however, this value-add has been offset by mixed stock performance.  During the quarter, solid gains from Smith & Nephew and Agilent were negated by soft returns from Universal Health Services, Astellas Pharmaceuticals and Biogen.  Cambiar remains constructive on the intermediate-term prospects for the portfolio’s Healthcare holdings, confident that the underlying value in our companies should be reflected in their stock prices.
One sector where Cambiar exhibited positive stock selection in the quarter was Financials, as a number of the portfolio’s international bank and insurance positions rebounded in response to solid earnings gains and investor optimism regarding economic growth.  Higher bond yields would be an additional tailwind to participants in the sector.  One area of weakness within the sector was the portfolio’s U.S. credit card positions – Capital One and Synchrony, which is a private label issuer of credit cards.  Synchrony raised their forward credit loss and provisioning estimates, which subsequently impacted earnings guidance.  Cambiar believed the market response to be an overreaction to this well-managed company; given Synchrony’s attractive valuation, strong cashflow and consistent top-line growth, we are continuing to hold the position.  
Looking Ahead
Global equities are firmly in the green as we reach the halfway point of 2017.  While popular investment narratives for the first six months of the year have tended to be more thematic in nature (i.e., pro-growth, bearish energy), an improvement in underlying fundamentals across most sectors of the market have resulted in a broad-based rally in stocks. 
Looking ahead, the backdrop for equities appears to remain attractive; that said, Cambiar spends equal time considering what could wrong as we do in focusing on the positive attributes of our companies.  With more central banks starting to adopt less dovish tones (as opposed to outright hawkish), the market is understandably nervous about the prospects of reduced monetary stimulus possibly derailing the economic recovery.  We think such concerns are a bit premature, but certainly worth monitoring.
Could 2017 be the first year since 2012 when international markets finally outperform the U.S?  Cambiar has been of the position for the past couple of years that non-U.S. stocks should offer a more attractive risk/return profile, given valuations and the potential for more robust earnings growth.  Although economic growth rates in Europe and Japan are unlikely to overtake that of the U.S., it is more about the rate of change vs. absolute levels.
Regardless of the environment, the Cambiar formula for seeking to outperform the market has not changed: invest in quality businesses whose current valuation is not indicative of their normalized earnings power, identify inflection points that can drive mean reversion in fundamentals/earnings, and be patient in waiting for the stock to reflect the inherent value.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. CAMGX was rated against 714 World Stock funds over a three year period and 590 funds over a five-year period. With respect to these World Stock funds CAMGX received a rating of 2 stars for the three year and 3 stars for the five year period, respectively. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Commentary
Market Review (6.30.2017)
U.S. equities (as defined by the S&P 500 Index) posted their seventh consecutive quarter of positive returns, gaining 3.1% in the second quarter.  We believe the path of least resistance remains to the upside for equities, although red flags in the form of elevated valuations, tightening monetary policy and investor complacency bear watching.  At one point during the quarter, market volatility (VIX) levels reached a closing low mark not seen since the 4th quarter of 1993 (source: Chicago Board Options Exchange).  Although market nay-sayers will point to investor complacency as a precursor to a market decline, we see no historical data to substantiate this claim.  That said, the massive shift to passive investments results in a uniquely different market structure vs. previous cycles; a relevant consideration is how stock prices will react should the market become more stressed.
While equities may now be in the later innings of the recovery that began in 2009, corporate earnings remain healthy in the aggregate, inflation levels are benign, and international markets have also begun to participate to the upside.  As discussed in previous commentaries, Cambiar believes that stock selection will take on more importance as we get into the later stages of the business/market cycle.
Growth vs. Value
One of the more notable performance trends in the equity markets this year to date has been the wide performance gap between growth and value stocks.  This divergence in returns began in the first quarter, and continued to widen in the second quarter before closing a bit in June.  As the below graphs illustrate, earnings estimates have been raised across S&P 500 participants in the aggregate, which typically coincides with multiple expansion.  Yet value stocks (as defined by the S&P 500 Value) have experienced multiple compression for much of the year, while growth stocks have seen their multiples re-rate to the upside
Fundamentals vs Multiple Expansion
  
Source: Bloomberg.  For illustrative Purposes Only
The outperformance of growth stocks coincides with a flattening/decline in bond yields, implying increased market skepticism towards economic growth, and thus we feel, favoring companies who possess higher organic growth rates.  Not surprisingly, the surge in growth stocks has been most prominent in the technology sector – examples include Amazon, Apple and Facebook.  While each of these companies deserve premium valuations given high market shares and de-facto monopoly business profiles, the increases in market capitalizations begin to question whether the embedded market expectations are realistic/achievable.
Needless to say, the market environment thus far in 2017 has been less friendly for value practitioners.  Cambiar’s response has been to remain focused on the fundamentals, and to not lose sight of the objective in what has been an obviously potent – and potentially overdone – growth flip.  Style-driven markets tend to self-cancel over longer timeframes, but can influence performance over shorter periods.  Cambiar’s relatively low allocation to growth-oriented segments of the market, as well as being a bit too ‘value-y’ has been a headwind vs. benchmarks over the first two quarters of the year. Yet given the low valuation/low expectation intersection in which many of our companies reside, even a modest change in market sentiment could provide a boost to the Cambiar portfolios.
Opportunity Fund
The Cambiar Opportunity Fund was successful in outpacing the Russell 1000 value benchmark, yet unable to overtake the primary S&P 500 Index for the quarter.  In a continuation of market conditions from the first quarter, growth stocks widened their lead over value – thus making the S&P 500 Index a tough bogey to outperform over the first six months of 2017.  Despite the increasingly loud calls for the end of active management, it is worth noting that the Opportunity Fund has outperformed the R1000V Index by a fairly wide margin over the past one year, with longer-term results also more than holding their own.  We anticipate that the current environment remains favorable for active management - given the variance in returns across economic sectors.   
Buy/sell activity in the quarter was relatively low, with three new purchases and two liquidations.  The Fund remained diversified across most sectors of the market, Financials and Technology continued to have the largest representations in the portfolio.  Underweight allocations include Consumer Discretionary, Utilities and Telecom.  Cambiar’s non-participation in Telecom has been a value-add thus far in 2017, as the sector has been a lagging performer.  Although the stated dividend yields within telecom may appear desirable in the current low-rate environment, yields that appear too good to be true may also be a red flag of sorts.  Given an increasingly aggressive pricing environment, high debt loads and flattening subscriber trends, telecom stocks may not represent an overly attractive investment opportunity – even with the yield.
Value stocks once again played second fiddle to their growth counterparts, as growth extended their year-to-date lead over value.  With few exceptions (Telecom and Energy), value sectors finished modestly higher, although there were more outsized moves at the individual stock level.   
At a sector level, Cambiar’s Technology positions once again were the top value-add for the portfolio.  Shares of Oracle were boosted by a strong earnings report; Cambiar also received positive contributions from Alphabet (formerly Google) and Amdocs – which provides customer management/billing services…a rather steady-Eddie business relative to other participants in Techland.    
Energy stocks remained in reverse during the second quarter; Cambiar’s modest overweight allocation in the sector (13% vs. 12% for the index) was subsequently a detractor from performance for the quarter.  Despite positive steps taken by companies in the form of restructuring, improvement of balance sheets and an increased focus on free cashflow, stock prices remain highly correlated to underlying commodity prices, which have been on a downward trajectory since the start of the year.  The market is fixated on the weekly Energy Information Administration (EIA) inventory reports, with draws positive for the sector and inventory builds sparking a sell-off.  Given the sunk costs many U.S. producers have incurred with their existing wells, oil production at current prices provides sufficient cash returns.  However, it is likely that the rate of growth in new well activity will slow as management teams re-evaluate their capex plans in response to the lower price deck.  Reduced labor supply, higher input costs and less friendly capital market/financing options might also constrain shale production.  While acknowledging that the rebalance of oil supply and demand has taken longer than expected, Cambiar does anticipate that oil prices will firm in the second half of the year.  Given the overwhelmingly negative sentiment enveloping the sector, it would not take much in the way of good news for energy stocks to begin performing more favorably.
Positive stock selection in the Consumer Discretionary and Staples sectors was somewhat offset by below-benchmark (although positive) returns in the Healthcare sector.  Healthcare has been one of the top-performing sectors in the market thus far in 2017 – likely a function of improved sentiment towards the sector, improving fundamentals and reduced threat of pricing reform.  
Looking Ahead
U.S. equities moved higher in the first half of 2017, as corporates delivered on the earnings front and there were no notable disruptions (i.e., ‘risk off’) moves as has been the case in previous years.  To this point, equities have not been susceptible to tightening monetary policy, as the two interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve barely made a ripple in the market.  The heavy skew of asset flows into passively managed instruments is likely a contributing factor to the low volatility that has permeated the equity markets – vs. history as well as relative to fixed income.

Source: Bloomberg
While Cambiar maintains a fairly constructive outlook for equities, we anticipate that the glidepath may get a bit bumpier in the second half of 2017.  Statistically speaking – can we get much lower as it relates to market volatility?  Additional moves by the Fed in the way of rate hikes/balance sheet reduction actions at a time when inflation is lower than expected may also start to impact the markets via tightening liquidity.  As discussed in our 1Q commentary, the direction of stock prices should be positively correlated to earnings, as there is not much room left for multiple expansion.  On this front, earnings have been solid, and businesses could get an additional lift in the second half of the year should some of the Trump Administration’s pro-growth policies come to pass.      
Regardless of the environment, the Cambiar formula for seeking to outperform the market has not changed: invest in quality businesses whose current valuation is not indicative of their normalized earnings power, identify inflection points that can drive mean reversion in fundamentals/earnings, and be patient in waiting for the stock to reflect the inherent value.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. CAMOX was rated against 1091 US-domiciled Large Blend funds over a three year period, 936 over a five year period and 681 over a ten year period. With respect to these large blend funds, CAMOX received a rating of 3 stars, 3 stars and 2 stars, respectively. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.​

BBB Reason for Ratings


        BBB rating is based on 13 factors: Get the details about the factors considered.










BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy

Our Philosophy
Cambiar utilizes a fundamental, relative value investment discipline.  Our investment approach is best described as the search for quality companies that possess underappreciated catalysts and trade near the low end of their normalized valuation ranges.





Research
Plays a central role in all of Cambiar’s investment decision.  Each of Cambiar’s seasoned analysts are assigned coverage of two to three sectors/industries, creating a target-rich environment for them to choose only stocks that meet our investment criteria.





Valuations
The market tends to value companies within a range, which can be used to establish some degree of context for what a company is worth at a given point in time.  Cambiar’s seasoned analysts follow that range closely and are able to identify when a company is approaching the lower end of their valuation range, potentially resulting in an attractive entry point.





Catalyst
Simply identifying a company valued at the lower end of its historical range is the first step, but a potential investment must also stand to benefit from an event that will cause investors to push it towards revaluing higher.   






100% Employee Owned.
Cambiar’s ownership structure is designed to foster individual accountability and a culture of entrepreneurship in which each employee feels responsible for the success of the firm and its clients.
Our independence coupled with being located in Denver, Colorado, away from the groupthink and conventional wisdom associated with major financial cities, allows us to have a unique perspective on the markets.
 
Cambiar Funds are distributed by SEI Investments Distribution Co. (SIDCO), 1 Freedom Valley Dr Oaks, PA 19456, which is not affiliated with the Advisor. Check the background of SIDCO on FINRA’s BrokerCheck

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
