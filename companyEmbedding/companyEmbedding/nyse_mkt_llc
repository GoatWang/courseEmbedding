History[edit]
The Curb market[edit]
See also: Curbstone broker




Curb brokers in Wall Street, New York City, 1920, a year before the trading was moved indoors. That year, journalist Edwin C. Hill described the curb trading on lower Broad Street as "a roaring, swirling whirlpool... like nothing else under the astonishing sky that is its only roof.”[5]


The exchange grew out of the loosely organized curb market of curbstone brokers on Broad Street in Manhattan. Efforts to organize and standardize the market started early in the 20th century under Emanuel S. Mendels and Carl H. Pforzheimer.[6] The curb brokers had been kicked out of the Mills Building front by 1907, and had moved to the pavement outside the Blair Building where cabbies lined up. There they were given a "little domain of asphalt" fenced off by the police on Broad Street between Exchange Place and Beaver Street.[7] As of 1907, the curb market operated starting at 10'clock in the morning, each day except Sundays, until a gong at 3 o'clock. Orders for the purchase and sale of securities were shouted down from the windows of nearby brokerages, with the execution of the sale then shouted back up to the brokerage.[7]
Organizing and 'Curb list'[edit]
As of 1907, E. S. Mendels gave the brokers rules "by right of seniority," but the curb brokers intentionally avoided organizing. According to the Times, this came from a general belief that if a curb exchange was organized, the exchange authorities would force members to sell their other exchange memberships.[7] However, in 1908 the New York Curb Market Agency was established, which developed appropriate trading rules for curbstone brokers, organized by Mendels.[8] The informal Curb Association formed in 1910 to weed out undesirables.[5] The curb exchange was for years at odds with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), or "Big Board," operating several buildings away. Explained the New York Times in 1910, the Big Board looked at the curb as "a trading place for 'cats and dogs.'"[9] On April 1, 1910, however, when the NYSE abolished its unlisted department, the NYSE stocks "made homeless by the abolition" were "refused domicile" by the curb brokers on Broad Street until they had complied with the "Curb list" of requirements.[9] In 1911, Mendels and his advisers drew up a constitution and formed the New York Curb Market Association, which can be considered the first formal constitution of American Stock Exchange.[8]
1920s-1940s: Move indoors[edit]




American Stock Exchange building, constructed in 1921.


In 1920, journalist Edwin C. Hill wrote that the curb exchange on lower Broad Street was a roaring, swirling whirlpool” that "tears control of a gold-mine from an unlucky operator, then pauses to auction a puppy-dog. It is like nothing else under the astonishing sky that is its only roof.” After a group of Curb brokers formed a real estate company to design a building, Starrett & Van Vleck designed the new exchange building on Greenwich Street in Lower Manhattan between Thames and Rector, at 86 Trinity Place. It opened in 1921,[5] and the curbstone brokers moved indoors on June 27, 1921.[citation needed] In 1929, the New York Curb Market changed its name to the New York Curb Exchange. Within no time, the Curb Exchange became the leading international stock market, listing more foreign issues than all other U.S. securities markets combined.[citation needed]
George Rea was approached about the position of president of the New York Curb Exchange in 1939.[10] He was unanimously elected[10] as the first paid president in the history of the Curb Exchange. He was paid $25,000 per year and held the position for 3 years before offering his resignation in 1942.[11] He left the position having "done such a good job that there is virtually no need for a full-time successor."[12]
Modernization as the American Stock Exchange[edit]
In 1953 the Curb Exchange was renamed the American Stock Exchange.[citation needed] The exchange was shaken by a scandal in 1961, and in 1962 began a reorganization.[13] Its reputation recently damaged by charges of mismanagement, in 1962 the American Stock Exchange named Edwin Etherington its president. Writes CNN, he and executive vice president Paul Kolton were "tapped in 1962 to clean up and reinvigorate the scandal-plagued American Stock Exchange."[14] At AMEX for five years, he was credited with improving opportunities for minorities and women.[citation needed] In 1971, Johnson Products Company became the first African American-owned company to be listed on the American Stock Exchange.[15]
As of 1971, it was the second largest stock exchange in the United States. Paul Kolton succeeded Ralph S. Saul as AMEX president on June 17, 1971,[13] making him the first person to be selected from within the exchange to serve as its leader, succeeding Ralph S. Saul, who announced his resignation in March 1971.[16][17] In November 1972, Kolton was named as the exchange's first chief executive officer and its first salaried top executive.[18] As chairman, Kolton oversaw the introduction of options trading.[citation needed] Kolton opposed the idea of a merger with the New York Stock Exchange while he headed the exchange saying that "two independent, viable exchanges are much more likely to be responsive to new pressures and public needs than a single institution".[17] Kolton announced in July 1977 that he would be leaving his position at the American Exchange in November of that year.[19]
In 1977, Thomas Peterffy purchased a seat on the American Stock Exchange and played a role in developing the electronic trading of securities. Peterffy created a major stir among traders by introducing handheld computers onto the trading floor in the early 1980s.[20][21]
Richard F. Syron joined the American Stock Exchange as CEO in 1994 held that post for five years, which included its merger in 1998 into the National Association of Securities Dealers.[citation needed]
NYSE merger[edit]
As of 2003, AMEX was the only U.S. stock market to permit the transmission of buy and sell orders through hand signals.[22]
On January 17, 2008, NYSE Euronext announced it would acquire the AMEX for $260 million in stock.[23] Before the closing of the acquisition, NYSE Euronext announced that the AMEX would be integrated with the Alternext European small-cap exchange and renamed the NYSE Alternext U.S.[24] The American Stock Exchange merged with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE Euronext) on October 1, 2008.[4] Post merger, the Amex equities business was branded "NYSE Alternext US". As part of the re-branding exercise, NYSE Alternext US was re-branded as NYSE Amex Equities.[4] On December 1, 2008, the Curb Exchange building at 86 Trinity Place was closed, and the Amex Equities trading floor was moved to the NYSE Trading floor at 11 Wall Street.[4] 90 years after its 1921 opening, the old New York Curb Market building was empty but remained standing.[5] In March 2009, NYSE Alternext U.S. was changed to NYSE Amex Equities. On May 10, 2012, NYSE Amex Equities changed its name to NYSE MKT LLC.[4]

History[edit]
The Curb market[edit]
See also: Curbstone broker




Curb brokers in Wall Street, New York City, 1920, a year before the trading was moved indoors. That year, journalist Edwin C. Hill described the curb trading on lower Broad Street as "a roaring, swirling whirlpool... like nothing else under the astonishing sky that is its only roof.”[5]


The exchange grew out of the loosely organized curb market of curbstone brokers on Broad Street in Manhattan. Efforts to organize and standardize the market started early in the 20th century under Emanuel S. Mendels and Carl H. Pforzheimer.[6] The curb brokers had been kicked out of the Mills Building front by 1907, and had moved to the pavement outside the Blair Building where cabbies lined up. There they were given a "little domain of asphalt" fenced off by the police on Broad Street between Exchange Place and Beaver Street.[7] As of 1907, the curb market operated starting at 10'clock in the morning, each day except Sundays, until a gong at 3 o'clock. Orders for the purchase and sale of securities were shouted down from the windows of nearby brokerages, with the execution of the sale then shouted back up to the brokerage.[7]
Organizing and 'Curb list'[edit]
As of 1907, E. S. Mendels gave the brokers rules "by right of seniority," but the curb brokers intentionally avoided organizing. According to the Times, this came from a general belief that if a curb exchange was organized, the exchange authorities would force members to sell their other exchange memberships.[7] However, in 1908 the New York Curb Market Agency was established, which developed appropriate trading rules for curbstone brokers, organized by Mendels.[8] The informal Curb Association formed in 1910 to weed out undesirables.[5] The curb exchange was for years at odds with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), or "Big Board," operating several buildings away. Explained the New York Times in 1910, the Big Board looked at the curb as "a trading place for 'cats and dogs.'"[9] On April 1, 1910, however, when the NYSE abolished its unlisted department, the NYSE stocks "made homeless by the abolition" were "refused domicile" by the curb brokers on Broad Street until they had complied with the "Curb list" of requirements.[9] In 1911, Mendels and his advisers drew up a constitution and formed the New York Curb Market Association, which can be considered the first formal constitution of American Stock Exchange.[8]
1920s-1940s: Move indoors[edit]




American Stock Exchange building, constructed in 1921.


In 1920, journalist Edwin C. Hill wrote that the curb exchange on lower Broad Street was a roaring, swirling whirlpool” that "tears control of a gold-mine from an unlucky operator, then pauses to auction a puppy-dog. It is like nothing else under the astonishing sky that is its only roof.” After a group of Curb brokers formed a real estate company to design a building, Starrett & Van Vleck designed the new exchange building on Greenwich Street in Lower Manhattan between Thames and Rector, at 86 Trinity Place. It opened in 1921,[5] and the curbstone brokers moved indoors on June 27, 1921.[citation needed] In 1929, the New York Curb Market changed its name to the New York Curb Exchange. Within no time, the Curb Exchange became the leading international stock market, listing more foreign issues than all other U.S. securities markets combined.[citation needed]
George Rea was approached about the position of president of the New York Curb Exchange in 1939.[10] He was unanimously elected[10] as the first paid president in the history of the Curb Exchange. He was paid $25,000 per year and held the position for 3 years before offering his resignation in 1942.[11] He left the position having "done such a good job that there is virtually no need for a full-time successor."[12]
Modernization as the American Stock Exchange[edit]
In 1953 the Curb Exchange was renamed the American Stock Exchange.[citation needed] The exchange was shaken by a scandal in 1961, and in 1962 began a reorganization.[13] Its reputation recently damaged by charges of mismanagement, in 1962 the American Stock Exchange named Edwin Etherington its president. Writes CNN, he and executive vice president Paul Kolton were "tapped in 1962 to clean up and reinvigorate the scandal-plagued American Stock Exchange."[14] At AMEX for five years, he was credited with improving opportunities for minorities and women.[citation needed] In 1971, Johnson Products Company became the first African American-owned company to be listed on the American Stock Exchange.[15]
As of 1971, it was the second largest stock exchange in the United States. Paul Kolton succeeded Ralph S. Saul as AMEX president on June 17, 1971,[13] making him the first person to be selected from within the exchange to serve as its leader, succeeding Ralph S. Saul, who announced his resignation in March 1971.[16][17] In November 1972, Kolton was named as the exchange's first chief executive officer and its first salaried top executive.[18] As chairman, Kolton oversaw the introduction of options trading.[citation needed] Kolton opposed the idea of a merger with the New York Stock Exchange while he headed the exchange saying that "two independent, viable exchanges are much more likely to be responsive to new pressures and public needs than a single institution".[17] Kolton announced in July 1977 that he would be leaving his position at the American Exchange in November of that year.[19]
In 1977, Thomas Peterffy purchased a seat on the American Stock Exchange and played a role in developing the electronic trading of securities. Peterffy created a major stir among traders by introducing handheld computers onto the trading floor in the early 1980s.[20][21]
Richard F. Syron joined the American Stock Exchange as CEO in 1994 held that post for five years, which included its merger in 1998 into the National Association of Securities Dealers.[citation needed]
NYSE merger[edit]
As of 2003, AMEX was the only U.S. stock market to permit the transmission of buy and sell orders through hand signals.[22]
On January 17, 2008, NYSE Euronext announced it would acquire the AMEX for $260 million in stock.[23] Before the closing of the acquisition, NYSE Euronext announced that the AMEX would be integrated with the Alternext European small-cap exchange and renamed the NYSE Alternext U.S.[24] The American Stock Exchange merged with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE Euronext) on October 1, 2008.[4] Post merger, the Amex equities business was branded "NYSE Alternext US". As part of the re-branding exercise, NYSE Alternext US was re-branded as NYSE Amex Equities.[4] On December 1, 2008, the Curb Exchange building at 86 Trinity Place was closed, and the Amex Equities trading floor was moved to the NYSE Trading floor at 11 Wall Street.[4] 90 years after its 1921 opening, the old New York Curb Market building was empty but remained standing.[5] In March 2009, NYSE Alternext U.S. was changed to NYSE Amex Equities. On May 10, 2012, NYSE Amex Equities changed its name to NYSE MKT LLC.[4]

History[edit]
The Curb market[edit]
See also: Curbstone broker




Curb brokers in Wall Street, New York City, 1920, a year before the trading was moved indoors. That year, journalist Edwin C. Hill described the curb trading on lower Broad Street as "a roaring, swirling whirlpool... like nothing else under the astonishing sky that is its only roof.”[5]


The exchange grew out of the loosely organized curb market of curbstone brokers on Broad Street in Manhattan. Efforts to organize and standardize the market started early in the 20th century under Emanuel S. Mendels and Carl H. Pforzheimer.[6] The curb brokers had been kicked out of the Mills Building front by 1907, and had moved to the pavement outside the Blair Building where cabbies lined up. There they were given a "little domain of asphalt" fenced off by the police on Broad Street between Exchange Place and Beaver Street.[7] As of 1907, the curb market operated starting at 10'clock in the morning, each day except Sundays, until a gong at 3 o'clock. Orders for the purchase and sale of securities were shouted down from the windows of nearby brokerages, with the execution of the sale then shouted back up to the brokerage.[7]
Organizing and 'Curb list'[edit]
As of 1907, E. S. Mendels gave the brokers rules "by right of seniority," but the curb brokers intentionally avoided organizing. According to the Times, this came from a general belief that if a curb exchange was organized, the exchange authorities would force members to sell their other exchange memberships.[7] However, in 1908 the New York Curb Market Agency was established, which developed appropriate trading rules for curbstone brokers, organized by Mendels.[8] The informal Curb Association formed in 1910 to weed out undesirables.[5] The curb exchange was for years at odds with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), or "Big Board," operating several buildings away. Explained the New York Times in 1910, the Big Board looked at the curb as "a trading place for 'cats and dogs.'"[9] On April 1, 1910, however, when the NYSE abolished its unlisted department, the NYSE stocks "made homeless by the abolition" were "refused domicile" by the curb brokers on Broad Street until they had complied with the "Curb list" of requirements.[9] In 1911, Mendels and his advisers drew up a constitution and formed the New York Curb Market Association, which can be considered the first formal constitution of American Stock Exchange.[8]
1920s-1940s: Move indoors[edit]




American Stock Exchange building, constructed in 1921.


In 1920, journalist Edwin C. Hill wrote that the curb exchange on lower Broad Street was a roaring, swirling whirlpool” that "tears control of a gold-mine from an unlucky operator, then pauses to auction a puppy-dog. It is like nothing else under the astonishing sky that is its only roof.” After a group of Curb brokers formed a real estate company to design a building, Starrett & Van Vleck designed the new exchange building on Greenwich Street in Lower Manhattan between Thames and Rector, at 86 Trinity Place. It opened in 1921,[5] and the curbstone brokers moved indoors on June 27, 1921.[citation needed] In 1929, the New York Curb Market changed its name to the New York Curb Exchange. Within no time, the Curb Exchange became the leading international stock market, listing more foreign issues than all other U.S. securities markets combined.[citation needed]
George Rea was approached about the position of president of the New York Curb Exchange in 1939.[10] He was unanimously elected[10] as the first paid president in the history of the Curb Exchange. He was paid $25,000 per year and held the position for 3 years before offering his resignation in 1942.[11] He left the position having "done such a good job that there is virtually no need for a full-time successor."[12]
Modernization as the American Stock Exchange[edit]
In 1953 the Curb Exchange was renamed the American Stock Exchange.[citation needed] The exchange was shaken by a scandal in 1961, and in 1962 began a reorganization.[13] Its reputation recently damaged by charges of mismanagement, in 1962 the American Stock Exchange named Edwin Etherington its president. Writes CNN, he and executive vice president Paul Kolton were "tapped in 1962 to clean up and reinvigorate the scandal-plagued American Stock Exchange."[14] At AMEX for five years, he was credited with improving opportunities for minorities and women.[citation needed] In 1971, Johnson Products Company became the first African American-owned company to be listed on the American Stock Exchange.[15]
As of 1971, it was the second largest stock exchange in the United States. Paul Kolton succeeded Ralph S. Saul as AMEX president on June 17, 1971,[13] making him the first person to be selected from within the exchange to serve as its leader, succeeding Ralph S. Saul, who announced his resignation in March 1971.[16][17] In November 1972, Kolton was named as the exchange's first chief executive officer and its first salaried top executive.[18] As chairman, Kolton oversaw the introduction of options trading.[citation needed] Kolton opposed the idea of a merger with the New York Stock Exchange while he headed the exchange saying that "two independent, viable exchanges are much more likely to be responsive to new pressures and public needs than a single institution".[17] Kolton announced in July 1977 that he would be leaving his position at the American Exchange in November of that year.[19]
In 1977, Thomas Peterffy purchased a seat on the American Stock Exchange and played a role in developing the electronic trading of securities. Peterffy created a major stir among traders by introducing handheld computers onto the trading floor in the early 1980s.[20][21]
Richard F. Syron joined the American Stock Exchange as CEO in 1994 held that post for five years, which included its merger in 1998 into the National Association of Securities Dealers.[citation needed]
NYSE merger[edit]
As of 2003, AMEX was the only U.S. stock market to permit the transmission of buy and sell orders through hand signals.[22]
On January 17, 2008, NYSE Euronext announced it would acquire the AMEX for $260 million in stock.[23] Before the closing of the acquisition, NYSE Euronext announced that the AMEX would be integrated with the Alternext European small-cap exchange and renamed the NYSE Alternext U.S.[24] The American Stock Exchange merged with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE Euronext) on October 1, 2008.[4] Post merger, the Amex equities business was branded "NYSE Alternext US". As part of the re-branding exercise, NYSE Alternext US was re-branded as NYSE Amex Equities.[4] On December 1, 2008, the Curb Exchange building at 86 Trinity Place was closed, and the Amex Equities trading floor was moved to the NYSE Trading floor at 11 Wall Street.[4] 90 years after its 1921 opening, the old New York Curb Market building was empty but remained standing.[5] In March 2009, NYSE Alternext U.S. was changed to NYSE Amex Equities. On May 10, 2012, NYSE Amex Equities changed its name to NYSE MKT LLC.[4]

History[edit]
The Curb market[edit]
See also: Curbstone broker




Curb brokers in Wall Street, New York City, 1920, a year before the trading was moved indoors. That year, journalist Edwin C. Hill described the curb trading on lower Broad Street as "a roaring, swirling whirlpool... like nothing else under the astonishing sky that is its only roof.”[5]


The exchange grew out of the loosely organized curb market of curbstone brokers on Broad Street in Manhattan. Efforts to organize and standardize the market started early in the 20th century under Emanuel S. Mendels and Carl H. Pforzheimer.[6] The curb brokers had been kicked out of the Mills Building front by 1907, and had moved to the pavement outside the Blair Building where cabbies lined up. There they were given a "little domain of asphalt" fenced off by the police on Broad Street between Exchange Place and Beaver Street.[7] As of 1907, the curb market operated starting at 10'clock in the morning, each day except Sundays, until a gong at 3 o'clock. Orders for the purchase and sale of securities were shouted down from the windows of nearby brokerages, with the execution of the sale then shouted back up to the brokerage.[7]
Organizing and 'Curb list'[edit]
As of 1907, E. S. Mendels gave the brokers rules "by right of seniority," but the curb brokers intentionally avoided organizing. According to the Times, this came from a general belief that if a curb exchange was organized, the exchange authorities would force members to sell their other exchange memberships.[7] However, in 1908 the New York Curb Market Agency was established, which developed appropriate trading rules for curbstone brokers, organized by Mendels.[8] The informal Curb Association formed in 1910 to weed out undesirables.[5] The curb exchange was for years at odds with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), or "Big Board," operating several buildings away. Explained the New York Times in 1910, the Big Board looked at the curb as "a trading place for 'cats and dogs.'"[9] On April 1, 1910, however, when the NYSE abolished its unlisted department, the NYSE stocks "made homeless by the abolition" were "refused domicile" by the curb brokers on Broad Street until they had complied with the "Curb list" of requirements.[9] In 1911, Mendels and his advisers drew up a constitution and formed the New York Curb Market Association, which can be considered the first formal constitution of American Stock Exchange.[8]
1920s-1940s: Move indoors[edit]




American Stock Exchange building, constructed in 1921.


In 1920, journalist Edwin C. Hill wrote that the curb exchange on lower Broad Street was a roaring, swirling whirlpool” that "tears control of a gold-mine from an unlucky operator, then pauses to auction a puppy-dog. It is like nothing else under the astonishing sky that is its only roof.” After a group of Curb brokers formed a real estate company to design a building, Starrett & Van Vleck designed the new exchange building on Greenwich Street in Lower Manhattan between Thames and Rector, at 86 Trinity Place. It opened in 1921,[5] and the curbstone brokers moved indoors on June 27, 1921.[citation needed] In 1929, the New York Curb Market changed its name to the New York Curb Exchange. Within no time, the Curb Exchange became the leading international stock market, listing more foreign issues than all other U.S. securities markets combined.[citation needed]
George Rea was approached about the position of president of the New York Curb Exchange in 1939.[10] He was unanimously elected[10] as the first paid president in the history of the Curb Exchange. He was paid $25,000 per year and held the position for 3 years before offering his resignation in 1942.[11] He left the position having "done such a good job that there is virtually no need for a full-time successor."[12]
Modernization as the American Stock Exchange[edit]
In 1953 the Curb Exchange was renamed the American Stock Exchange.[citation needed] The exchange was shaken by a scandal in 1961, and in 1962 began a reorganization.[13] Its reputation recently damaged by charges of mismanagement, in 1962 the American Stock Exchange named Edwin Etherington its president. Writes CNN, he and executive vice president Paul Kolton were "tapped in 1962 to clean up and reinvigorate the scandal-plagued American Stock Exchange."[14] At AMEX for five years, he was credited with improving opportunities for minorities and women.[citation needed] In 1971, Johnson Products Company became the first African American-owned company to be listed on the American Stock Exchange.[15]
As of 1971, it was the second largest stock exchange in the United States. Paul Kolton succeeded Ralph S. Saul as AMEX president on June 17, 1971,[13] making him the first person to be selected from within the exchange to serve as its leader, succeeding Ralph S. Saul, who announced his resignation in March 1971.[16][17] In November 1972, Kolton was named as the exchange's first chief executive officer and its first salaried top executive.[18] As chairman, Kolton oversaw the introduction of options trading.[citation needed] Kolton opposed the idea of a merger with the New York Stock Exchange while he headed the exchange saying that "two independent, viable exchanges are much more likely to be responsive to new pressures and public needs than a single institution".[17] Kolton announced in July 1977 that he would be leaving his position at the American Exchange in November of that year.[19]
In 1977, Thomas Peterffy purchased a seat on the American Stock Exchange and played a role in developing the electronic trading of securities. Peterffy created a major stir among traders by introducing handheld computers onto the trading floor in the early 1980s.[20][21]
Richard F. Syron joined the American Stock Exchange as CEO in 1994 held that post for five years, which included its merger in 1998 into the National Association of Securities Dealers.[citation needed]
NYSE merger[edit]
As of 2003, AMEX was the only U.S. stock market to permit the transmission of buy and sell orders through hand signals.[22]
On January 17, 2008, NYSE Euronext announced it would acquire the AMEX for $260 million in stock.[23] Before the closing of the acquisition, NYSE Euronext announced that the AMEX would be integrated with the Alternext European small-cap exchange and renamed the NYSE Alternext U.S.[24] The American Stock Exchange merged with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE Euronext) on October 1, 2008.[4] Post merger, the Amex equities business was branded "NYSE Alternext US". As part of the re-branding exercise, NYSE Alternext US was re-branded as NYSE Amex Equities.[4] On December 1, 2008, the Curb Exchange building at 86 Trinity Place was closed, and the Amex Equities trading floor was moved to the NYSE Trading floor at 11 Wall Street.[4] 90 years after its 1921 opening, the old New York Curb Market building was empty but remained standing.[5] In March 2009, NYSE Alternext U.S. was changed to NYSE Amex Equities. On May 10, 2012, NYSE Amex Equities changed its name to NYSE MKT LLC.[4]

History[edit]
The Curb market[edit]
See also: Curbstone broker




Curb brokers in Wall Street, New York City, 1920, a year before the trading was moved indoors. That year, journalist Edwin C. Hill described the curb trading on lower Broad Street as "a roaring, swirling whirlpool... like nothing else under the astonishing sky that is its only roof.”[5]


The exchange grew out of the loosely organized curb market of curbstone brokers on Broad Street in Manhattan. Efforts to organize and standardize the market started early in the 20th century under Emanuel S. Mendels and Carl H. Pforzheimer.[6] The curb brokers had been kicked out of the Mills Building front by 1907, and had moved to the pavement outside the Blair Building where cabbies lined up. There they were given a "little domain of asphalt" fenced off by the police on Broad Street between Exchange Place and Beaver Street.[7] As of 1907, the curb market operated starting at 10'clock in the morning, each day except Sundays, until a gong at 3 o'clock. Orders for the purchase and sale of securities were shouted down from the windows of nearby brokerages, with the execution of the sale then shouted back up to the brokerage.[7]
Organizing and 'Curb list'[edit]
As of 1907, E. S. Mendels gave the brokers rules "by right of seniority," but the curb brokers intentionally avoided organizing. According to the Times, this came from a general belief that if a curb exchange was organized, the exchange authorities would force members to sell their other exchange memberships.[7] However, in 1908 the New York Curb Market Agency was established, which developed appropriate trading rules for curbstone brokers, organized by Mendels.[8] The informal Curb Association formed in 1910 to weed out undesirables.[5] The curb exchange was for years at odds with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), or "Big Board," operating several buildings away. Explained the New York Times in 1910, the Big Board looked at the curb as "a trading place for 'cats and dogs.'"[9] On April 1, 1910, however, when the NYSE abolished its unlisted department, the NYSE stocks "made homeless by the abolition" were "refused domicile" by the curb brokers on Broad Street until they had complied with the "Curb list" of requirements.[9] In 1911, Mendels and his advisers drew up a constitution and formed the New York Curb Market Association, which can be considered the first formal constitution of American Stock Exchange.[8]
1920s-1940s: Move indoors[edit]




American Stock Exchange building, constructed in 1921.


In 1920, journalist Edwin C. Hill wrote that the curb exchange on lower Broad Street was a roaring, swirling whirlpool” that "tears control of a gold-mine from an unlucky operator, then pauses to auction a puppy-dog. It is like nothing else under the astonishing sky that is its only roof.” After a group of Curb brokers formed a real estate company to design a building, Starrett & Van Vleck designed the new exchange building on Greenwich Street in Lower Manhattan between Thames and Rector, at 86 Trinity Place. It opened in 1921,[5] and the curbstone brokers moved indoors on June 27, 1921.[citation needed] In 1929, the New York Curb Market changed its name to the New York Curb Exchange. Within no time, the Curb Exchange became the leading international stock market, listing more foreign issues than all other U.S. securities markets combined.[citation needed]
George Rea was approached about the position of president of the New York Curb Exchange in 1939.[10] He was unanimously elected[10] as the first paid president in the history of the Curb Exchange. He was paid $25,000 per year and held the position for 3 years before offering his resignation in 1942.[11] He left the position having "done such a good job that there is virtually no need for a full-time successor."[12]
Modernization as the American Stock Exchange[edit]
In 1953 the Curb Exchange was renamed the American Stock Exchange.[citation needed] The exchange was shaken by a scandal in 1961, and in 1962 began a reorganization.[13] Its reputation recently damaged by charges of mismanagement, in 1962 the American Stock Exchange named Edwin Etherington its president. Writes CNN, he and executive vice president Paul Kolton were "tapped in 1962 to clean up and reinvigorate the scandal-plagued American Stock Exchange."[14] At AMEX for five years, he was credited with improving opportunities for minorities and women.[citation needed] In 1971, Johnson Products Company became the first African American-owned company to be listed on the American Stock Exchange.[15]
As of 1971, it was the second largest stock exchange in the United States. Paul Kolton succeeded Ralph S. Saul as AMEX president on June 17, 1971,[13] making him the first person to be selected from within the exchange to serve as its leader, succeeding Ralph S. Saul, who announced his resignation in March 1971.[16][17] In November 1972, Kolton was named as the exchange's first chief executive officer and its first salaried top executive.[18] As chairman, Kolton oversaw the introduction of options trading.[citation needed] Kolton opposed the idea of a merger with the New York Stock Exchange while he headed the exchange saying that "two independent, viable exchanges are much more likely to be responsive to new pressures and public needs than a single institution".[17] Kolton announced in July 1977 that he would be leaving his position at the American Exchange in November of that year.[19]
In 1977, Thomas Peterffy purchased a seat on the American Stock Exchange and played a role in developing the electronic trading of securities. Peterffy created a major stir among traders by introducing handheld computers onto the trading floor in the early 1980s.[20][21]
Richard F. Syron joined the American Stock Exchange as CEO in 1994 held that post for five years, which included its merger in 1998 into the National Association of Securities Dealers.[citation needed]
NYSE merger[edit]
As of 2003, AMEX was the only U.S. stock market to permit the transmission of buy and sell orders through hand signals.[22]
On January 17, 2008, NYSE Euronext announced it would acquire the AMEX for $260 million in stock.[23] Before the closing of the acquisition, NYSE Euronext announced that the AMEX would be integrated with the Alternext European small-cap exchange and renamed the NYSE Alternext U.S.[24] The American Stock Exchange merged with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE Euronext) on October 1, 2008.[4] Post merger, the Amex equities business was branded "NYSE Alternext US". As part of the re-branding exercise, NYSE Alternext US was re-branded as NYSE Amex Equities.[4] On December 1, 2008, the Curb Exchange building at 86 Trinity Place was closed, and the Amex Equities trading floor was moved to the NYSE Trading floor at 11 Wall Street.[4] 90 years after its 1921 opening, the old New York Curb Market building was empty but remained standing.[5] In March 2009, NYSE Alternext U.S. was changed to NYSE Amex Equities. On May 10, 2012, NYSE Amex Equities changed its name to NYSE MKT LLC.[4]

Start Preamble
        
        
        
        November 12, 2015.
        Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) [1] 
           of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Act”) [2] 
           and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,[3] 
           notice is hereby given that on October 30, 2015, NYSE MKT LLC (the “Exchange” or “NYSE MKT”) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.
I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change
The Exchange proposes to discontinue the NYSE MKT Realtime Reference Price (“NYSE MKT RRP”) market data product offering. The text of the proposed rule change is available on the Exchange's Web site at www.nyse.com, at the principal office of the Exchange, and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.
II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of those statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant parts of such statements.
A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
1. Purpose
In 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) approved the NYSE MKT RRP market data product and certain fees for it.[4] 
           The NYSE MKT RRP market data product provides, on a real-time basis, last sale prices in all securities that trade on the Exchange. Currently, there are no subscribers to the NYSE MKT RRP market data product. Therefore, the Exchange has determined to discontinue the NYSE MKT RRP market data product. The Exchange also proposes to update the Fee Schedule to remove reference to the NYSE MKT RRP in connection with this change.
The Exchange will announce the date that the NYSE MKT RRP will be decommissioned via an NYSE Market Data Notice.
2. Statutory Basis
The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) [5] 
           of the Act, in general, and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) [6] 
           of the Act, in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest, and it is not designed to permit unfair discrimination among customers, brokers, or dealers.
The Exchange believes that discontinuing NYSE MKT RRP and removing it from the Fee Schedule would remove impediments to and perfect a free and open market by streamlining the Exchange's market data product offerings to include those for which there has been more demand and would provide vendors and subscribers with a simpler and more standardized suite of market data products. The proposal to discontinue NYSE MKT RRP is applicable to all members, issuers and other persons and does not unfairly discriminate between customers, issuers, brokers or dealers.
In adopting Regulation NMS, the Commission granted self-regulatory organizations (“SROs”) and broker-dealers increased authority and flexibility to offer new and unique market data to consumers of such data. It was believed that this authority would expand the amount of data available to users and consumers of such data and also spur innovation and competition for the provision of market data. The Commission concluded that Regulation NMS—by lessening regulation of the market in proprietary data—would itself further the Act's goals of facilitating efficiency and competition:
[E]fficiency is promoted when broker-dealers who do not need the data beyond the prices, sizes, market center identifications of the NBBO and consolidated last sale information are not required to receive (and pay for) such data. The Commission also believes that efficiency is promoted when broker-dealers may choose to receive (and pay for) additional market data based on their own internal analysis of the need for such data.[7] 

Start Printed Page 72125
The Exchange believes that the discontinuation of a market data product for which there is little or no demand, as is the case with NYSE MKT RRP, is a direct example of efficiency because it acknowledges that investors and the public have indicated that they have little or no use for certain information and allows the Exchange to dedicate resources to developing products (including through innovations of existing products and entirely new products) that provide information for which there is more of an expressed need.
B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition
In accordance with Section 6(b)(8) of the Act,[8] 
           the Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
The Exchange notes that it operates in a highly competitive market in which other exchanges are free to offer similar products. Additionally, since there has been little or no demand for the NYSE MKT RRP product the Exchange's proposed discontinuance will not harm competition.
C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others
No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change.
III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action
Because the foregoing proposed rule does not (i) significantly affect the protection of investors or the public interest; (ii) impose any significant burden on competition; and (iii) become operative for 30 days from the date on which it was filed, or such shorter time as the Commission may designate if consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest, provided that the self-regulatory organization has given the Commission written notice of its intent to file the proposed rule change at least five business days prior to the date of filing of the proposed rule change or such shorter time as designated by the Commission,[9] 
           the proposed rule change has become effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act [10] 
           and Rule 19b-4(f)(6) thereunder.[11] 

At any time within 60 days of the filing of such proposed rule change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. If the Commission takes such action, the Commission shall institute proceedings under Section 19(b)(2)(B) [12] 
           of the Act to determine whether the proposed rule change should be approved or disapproved.
A proposed rule change filed under Rule 19b-4(f)(6) [13] 
           normally does not become operative prior to 30 days after the date of the filing. However, pursuant to Rule 19b4(f)(6)(iii),[14] 
           the Commission may designate a shorter time if such action is consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest. The Exchange has asked the Commission to waive the 30-day operative because it believes that immediate operation of this filing would not impact any users of NYSE MKT RRP. The Commission, noting that there are currently no subscribers to these data services, finds that it is consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest to waive the 30-day operative date and to permit the proposal to be operative upon filing.[15] 

IV. Solicitation of Comments
