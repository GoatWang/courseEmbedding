Navigate Rates






















Investment risks, such as changing interest rates, may present opportunities for fixed-income solutions. Consider a non-traditional approach for navigating interest rates with Columbia Threadneedle Investments.

Predicting how and when interest rates will change can frustrate investors and leave advisors uncertain on a strategy. Instead of viewing fluctuations as an obstacle to your clients’ goals, consider them an opportunity. We’ve created a non-traditional strategy to endure changing rates and thrive in all markets — helping you navigate today's fluctuating market and guide your clients toward success.
Four major risk factors
Duration, credit, inflation and currency risk are all drivers of fixed-income performance, and they affect investments differently. We believe that a multi-sector approach that capitalizes on all four risk factors may lead to better or more diversified outcomes across market cycles. In each case below, one of the four risk factors dominates the overall risk profile, which subjects investors to a narrow range of potential outcomes.
For a closer look at when these risks are most and least attractive, read our white paper, Harnessing Fixed-Income Returns Through the Cycle.
How different risks drive performance of common bond indices Source: BlackRock Solutions, 12/31/15

Duration risk
A traditional fixed-income portfolio, which typically invests in high-quality, government-related bonds, can leave investors vulnerable to the performance of one single risk factor — duration. Also known as interest rate risk, duration represents the price volatility of a long-term investment in a changing interest rate environment. The longer you hold an investment, the more impact interest rate changes will likely have on returns.



Exhibit 1*
Performance of credit versus growth and valuation



Credit risk
The chance of a borrower defaulting on a debt is known as credit risk. It’s highly cyclical, and the best returns tend to occur in periods just after episodes of underperformance — when investor sentiment begins to shift. Future returns tend to be significantly higher when bonds are cheaper, as seen in Exhibit 1.






Exhibit 2*
Performance of inflation versus inflation expectations



Inflation risk
Inflation risk, or purchasing power risk, is the chance that the rate of inflation will exceed the rate of return on your investment. This risk is driven by both actual and expected future rate of inflation. It performs best when the economy is overheating and prices and wages are rising.1 The more inflation exceeds expectations, the better inflation risk performs.






Exhibit 3*
Performance of currency versus global yield changes



Currency risk
Currency risk is the risk of loss when an investor has exposure to foreign-currency-traded investments —which is common for investments in global bond markets. It’s important to be aware of the trend in global bond yields relative to the U.S. when incorporating currency risk into your bond portfolio. Foreign currency returns rise as foreign yields become more attractive, as shown in Exhibit 3.

PIMCO Global StocksPLUS & Income Fund




				 18 July, 2017,  03:49 | Author: Pamela Mathis			













The ATR is not used to figure out price direction, just to measure volatility. The RSI was originally created by J. Welles Wilder which was introduced in his 1978 book "New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems". The general interpretation of the ATR is the higher the ATR value, the higher the volatility. The Williams Percent Range or Williams %R is a technical indicator that was created to measure overbought and oversold market conditions. It dived, as 3 investors sold PIMCO Income Opportunity Fund shares while 12 reduced holdings. The Williams %R fluctuates between 0 and -100 measuring whether a security is overbought or oversold. Levels above -20 may indicate the stock may be considered is overbought. MA's may be used to identify uptrends or downtrends, and they can be a prominent indicator for detecting a shift in momentum for a particular stock. The Average Directional Index or ADX is a technical analysis indicator used to describe if a market is trending or not trending. For traders looking to capitalize on trends, the ADX may be an essential technical tool. The weekly steps can be used to determine a near-term trend. Investors will commonly use Williams %R in conjunction with other trend indicators to help spot possible stock turning points. Wells Fargo & Mn has invested 0% in PIMCO Income Opportunity Fund (NYSE:PKO). Many technical chart analysts believe that an ADX value over 25 would suggest a strong trend. When the price is above, this typically indicates a bullish trend. Pimco Corporate & Income Strategy Fund (PCN)'s Williams Percent Range or 14 day Williams %R presently is at -26.53. A CCI closer to +100 may provide an overbought signal, and a CCI near -100 may offer an oversold signal. On the other hand, a reading of -100 would imply that the stock is oversold and possibly set for a rally.
The Oasis Petroleum's (NYSE:OAS) "Buy" Rating Reaffirmed at Jefferies Group LLC
					Hudson Bay Capital Management LP bought a new stake in shares of Oasis Petroleum during the fourth quarter valued at $227,000. Finally, Advisory Services Network LLC acquired a new stake in Oasis Petroleum during the first quarter valued at $242,000.
					Pimco Municipal Income Fund (NYSE:PMF) announced a monthly dividend on Wednesday, July 5th, Wall Street Journal reports. Taking a glance at the relative strength indictor, we note that the 14-day RSI is now at 46.98, the 7-day stands at 46.27, and the 3-day is sitting at 48.42. The RSI, or Relative Strength Index is a popular oscillating indicator among traders and investors. Normal oscillations tend to stay in the range of -100 to +100. When charted, the RSI can serve as a visual means to monitor historical and current strength or weakness in a certain market. The opposite is the case when the RSI line is heading lower. This measurement is based on closing prices over a specific period of time. Generally, the RSI is considered to be oversold when it falls below 30 and overbought when it heads above 70. 34,220 shares of the stock were exchanged.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Shares Sold Short The total number of shares of a security that have been sold short and not yet repurchased. Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    0.98      Net Money Flow ()  -9,001    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock. A ratio above one suggests greater buying pressure, below one suggests greater selling.               Advertisement         Competitors PCN   Data not available.

Navigate Rates












Navigate Rates






















Investment risks, such as changing interest rates, may present opportunities for fixed-income solutions. Consider a non-traditional approach for navigating interest rates with Columbia Threadneedle Investments.

Predicting how and when interest rates will change can frustrate investors and leave advisors uncertain on a strategy. Instead of viewing fluctuations as an obstacle to your clients’ goals, consider them an opportunity. We’ve created a non-traditional strategy to endure changing rates and thrive in all markets — helping you navigate today's fluctuating market and guide your clients toward success.
Four major risk factors
Duration, credit, inflation and currency risk are all drivers of fixed-income performance, and they affect investments differently. We believe that a multi-sector approach that capitalizes on all four risk factors may lead to better or more diversified outcomes across market cycles. In each case below, one of the four risk factors dominates the overall risk profile, which subjects investors to a narrow range of potential outcomes.
For a closer look at when these risks are most and least attractive, read our white paper, Harnessing Fixed-Income Returns Through the Cycle.
How different risks drive performance of common bond indices Source: BlackRock Solutions, 12/31/15

Duration risk
A traditional fixed-income portfolio, which typically invests in high-quality, government-related bonds, can leave investors vulnerable to the performance of one single risk factor — duration. Also known as interest rate risk, duration represents the price volatility of a long-term investment in a changing interest rate environment. The longer you hold an investment, the more impact interest rate changes will likely have on returns.



Exhibit 1*
Performance of credit versus growth and valuation



Credit risk
The chance of a borrower defaulting on a debt is known as credit risk. It’s highly cyclical, and the best returns tend to occur in periods just after episodes of underperformance — when investor sentiment begins to shift. Future returns tend to be significantly higher when bonds are cheaper, as seen in Exhibit 1.






Exhibit 2*
Performance of inflation versus inflation expectations



Inflation risk
Inflation risk, or purchasing power risk, is the chance that the rate of inflation will exceed the rate of return on your investment. This risk is driven by both actual and expected future rate of inflation. It performs best when the economy is overheating and prices and wages are rising.1 The more inflation exceeds expectations, the better inflation risk performs.






Exhibit 3*
Performance of currency versus global yield changes



Currency risk
Currency risk is the risk of loss when an investor has exposure to foreign-currency-traded investments —which is common for investments in global bond markets. It’s important to be aware of the trend in global bond yields relative to the U.S. when incorporating currency risk into your bond portfolio. Foreign currency returns rise as foreign yields become more attractive, as shown in Exhibit 3.
