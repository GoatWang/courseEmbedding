For Ronnie Irani, the American dream began while he was growing up in India with words and images of the Wild West. When he arrived in Oklahoma, he became enamored with another American standard — the oil and natural gas industry — and he never looked back. Now he is president of his own company, RKI Exploration & Production, and is an active advocate for the industry, in India and Oklahoma.Here's an edited transcript from a recent conversation with The Oklahoman:Q: What brought you to Oklahoma?A: During my fifth or sixth grade in school I got introduced to Western novels and movies, and I got hooked. Those were my early impressions of America — bold and vast — and I dreamed of coming here. After completing my undergraduate degree from University of Bombay in 1977, I decided to come to the University of Oklahoma to further my studies. My older brother Barry had come to OU to study petroleum engineering and his letters home made a strong impression on me.Q: What has kept you in Oklahoma for more than 30 years?A: My wife Shahnaaz and I decided a long time ago that Oklahoma is home for us. We have two wonderful daughters who were born and grew up here. I am grateful to Oklahoma for my success here in America and want to help other students realize their dreams. I spend a lot of time on OU campus helping in the petroleum engineering school, business college and the international student programs. Through the Ronnie Irani Student Endowment fund, we help students in areas of scholarship, mentoring and leadership. Last year the (Mewbourne School of Petroleum and Geological Engineering) at OU established a relationship with a petroleum university in India and brought 50 students to spend one month on campus taking classes and interacting with our local industry. This has now become an annual event, and I'm glad to be a part of it.Q: What attracted you to the oil and gas business?A: Life in an independent oil and gas company is adventurous and fun, lots of imagination and creativity. You can engage in the entire process from coming up with the geological and exploration concept to getting the well drilled, to marketing the product. With modern, cutting-edge technology in understanding rocks and fluid flow 10,000 feet plus below the surface, drilling horizontally at similar depths and completing wells in this new world of resource plays in shales is fascinating.Q: Why did you opt to start your own company rather than work for an established producer?A: I've had a successful career in corporate America, all of it right here in Oklahoma. My past 32 years in the oil and natural gas industry have been tremendous. This is an amazing industry with amazing people working in it. If you're creative, can take some risk and are willing to work hard, there can be no limit to your success. I wanted to take another shot at growing a company, this time from grass roots.Q: You've been active in OERB for some time. Why do you feel that is important?A: The OERB, a brainchild of some of our (Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association) leaders 18 years ago, is a tremendously successful program. It is one of my great passions because we do some much for education and the environment in Oklahoma. It is the only program that reaches students from kindergarten all the way through college. The tools and funding the OERB provides for education and cleaning up abandoned and orphaned well sites throughout Oklahoma — all thanks to the oil and natural gas industry — is unmatched by any other industry. Some teachers in the state wouldn't have science curriculum were it not for OERB programs. And, with our college scholarships and Petro Tech program, we are also helping secure the energy future of this great country by making sure qualified workers will be ready to fill the jobs as they open around the state and country.Q: What do you like to do in your spare time?A: Play golf with my close friends, read, spend time at home. But mostly I try to help out wherever I can be effective. A few years ago some of us in the industry got together and started the Oklahoma Energy Explorers. This has been tremendously successful with close to 400 members. More recently I have been engaged in forming the India–U.S. Chamber of Commerce of Greater Oklahoma City. Our goal is to bring together the significant number of Indian origin professionals and businesses in various sectors in Oklahoma City and surrounding area and also to connect Oklahoma companies to opportunities in India and vice versa. We've the support of the India consulate office in Houston and appreciate the support and guidance of our Greater Oklahoma City Chamber to make this a successful effort. I'm also very engaged in helping the Integris James Hall Center for Mind, Body and Spirit spread their Wellness program to various corporations and community members in Oklahoma City and surrounding areas. This is a great program designed to make you take charge of your own health and well being. Some corporations like Chesapeake and Devon are pretty far along in the process, but other companies need a jump-start to get things going.
