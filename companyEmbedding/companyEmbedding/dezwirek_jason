Jason brand was born in California in 1959 when a group of independent thinkers sought to established a new kind of personal care for themselves and their families. Taking the name Jason which means "Healer" in Greek, they rejected harsh, risky chemicals. Instead, they blended simple, healing ingredients to create soaps and lotions crafted according to the Jason Code of Honor. For over 50 years the makers of Jason products have kept this code and committed themselves  to the idea of wholesome personal care solutions that are safe for us, our families and our planet. Herbspro.com is proud to carry the entire range of this fine brand.
