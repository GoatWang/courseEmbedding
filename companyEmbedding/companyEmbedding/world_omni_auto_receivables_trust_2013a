NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Link to Fitch Ratings' Report: World Omni Automobile Lease 
      Securitization Trust 2013-A (US ABS): http://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=717786


      Fitch Ratings expects to assign the following ratings to World Omni 
      Automobile Lease Securitization Trust 2013-A:
    

      --$110,000,000 class A-1 'F1+sf';
    

      --$179,000,000 class A-2a 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$164,000,000 class A-2b 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$215,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$85,170,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$30,040,000 class B 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Stable Collateral Quality: 2013-A has a weighted average (WA) FICO score 
      of 745, seasoning of 7.5 months and concentration of cars totaling 
      62.5%, in line with 2012-A and within range of prior deals. The 
      transaction is 100% backed by new vehicle leases.
    

      Concentration Risks: The Toyota Camry (35.2%) and Corolla (13.3%) are 
      the top two models comprising 2013-A and have produced low historical 
      residual value (RV) losses. The leases were originated in only five 
      southeastern states (five-state area) consistent with prior deals, with 
      the largest being Florida (65.5%). Fitch took these risks into account 
      in analyzing 2013-A.
    

      Concentrated Residual Maturities: 2013-A has a WA original term of 37.8 
      months and less longer term leases than in 2012-A. Lease maturities have 
      heavy residual maturities in a six-month period in 2016 totaling 62.73%. 
      Fitch accounted for this RV maturity risk by applying a six-month 
      stressed loss average to derive the RV loss proxy and applied 
      adjustments to the weightings of the RV haircuts.
    

      Strong Credit and Residual Losses: Credit and residual losses on World 
      Omni's portfolio and securitizations are currently low, having improved 
      in 2010?2013 with mostly RV gains recorded on most models, supported by 
      strong credit quality and elevated used vehicle values.
    

      Consistent CE Structure: 2013-A is a sequential-pay structure. Initial 
      class A note credit enhancement (CE) is 16.50% of initial securitization 
      value (SV), growing to 18.00%, and 13.15% for the class B notes growing 
      to 14.65%. Expected initial excess spread is 3.11%.
    

      Quality of Origination, Underwriting and Servicing Platform: World Omni 
      demonstrates adequate abilities as originator, underwriter and servicer, 
      as evidenced by historical delinquency, credit loss and RV loss 
      performance of the managed portfolio and securitizations.
    

      Integrity of Legal Structure: The legal structure of the transaction 
      should provide that a bankruptcy of the trust or World Omni would not 
      impair the timeliness of payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated decreases in the value of returned vehicles and/or 
      increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted 
      receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case and 
      could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch evaluated 
      the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to World Omni Automobile Lease 
      Securitization Trust 2013-A to increased credit and residual losses over 
      the life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the transaction 
      displays some sensitivity to increased defaults and credit losses, which 
      could lead to downgrades of one to two rating categories under Fitch's 
      severe (2.5 times base case loss) scenario. The transaction also shows 
      significantly more sensitivity to residual loss volatility under Fitch's 
      severe scenario whereby the notes could fall below an investment grade 
      rating.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      accompanying presale report.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Section
2.04         
Transfer Restrictions on Notes

 

(a)          As
of the date of this Indenture, the Retained Notes have not been
registered under the Securities Act and will not be listed on any
exchange.  Unless and until such Notes have been sold
pursuant to a transaction registered under the Securities Act, no
transfer of such a Note shall be made unless such transfer is made
pursuant to an effective registration statement under the
Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws or is
exempt from the registration requirements under the Securities Act
and such state securities laws.  Except in a transfer
pursuant to Rule 144A or a transfer to the Depositor or by the
Depositor to an Affiliate thereof, in the event that a transfer is
to be made in reliance upon an exemption from the Securities Act
and state securities laws, in order to assure compliance with the
Securities Act and such laws, the Noteholder desiring to effect
such transfer and such Noteholder’s prospective transferee
shall each certify to the Issuing Entity, the Indenture Trustee and
WOAR in writing the facts surrounding the transfer in substantially
the forms set forth in Exhibit E (the “ Transferor
Certificate ”) and Exhibit F (the “
Investment Letter ”).  Except in a transfer
pursuant to Rule 144A or a transfer to the Depositor or by the
Depositor to an Affiliate thereof, there shall also be delivered to
the Issuing Entity and the Indenture Trustee an Opinion of Counsel
that such transfer may be made pursuant to an exemption from the
Securities Act, which opinion of counsel shall not be an expense of
the Trust, the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee (unless it is
the transferee from whom such opinion is to be obtained) or of WOAR
or World Omni.  WOAR shall provide to any Noteholder and
any prospective transferee designated by any such Noteholder
information regarding the Retained Notes and the Receivables and
such other information as shall be necessary to satisfy the
condition to eligibility set forth in Rule 144A(d)(4) for transfer
of any such Retained Notes without registration thereof under the
Securities Act pursuant to the registration exemption provided by
Rule 144A.  Each Noteholder desiring to effect such a
transfer shall, and does hereby agree to, indemnify the Issuing
Entity, the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee, WOAR and World
Omni (in any capacity) against any liability that may result if the
transfer is not so exempt or is not made in accordance with federal
and state securities laws.

 

(b)          (i)
Sale, pledge or transfer of a Retained Note may only be made to a
Person who is a United States Person (within the meaning of Section
7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code) and is not acquiring such
Retained Notes with the assets of any Plan that is subject to Title
I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code; and (ii) no sale, pledge,
or transfer of a Retained Note shall be made (x) to any one person
in an amount less than $2,000,000 (or such other amount as the
Depositor may determine in order to prevent the Issuing Entity from
being treated as a “publicly traded partnership” under
Section 7704 of the Code) or (y) to a Special Pass-Through Entity,
in each case under this clause (ii), unless (A) an opinion of
counsel satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee and the Depositor
that such sale, pledge, or transfer shall not cause the Issuing
Entity to be treated as an association (or publicly traded
partnership) taxable as a corporation for federal income tax
purposes shall have been delivered to the Indenture Trustee and the
Depositor and (B) the Depositor shall have provided prior written
approval; provided , however , that the restrictions
in Section 2.04(b)(i) and (ii) above shall not
continue to apply to such Retained Notes (covered by the opinion
described in this clause) in the event counsel satisfactory to the
Indenture Trustee and the Depositor has rendered an opinion, with
respect to the sale, pledge or transfer by the Depositor or an
Affiliate thereof, to the effect that the Retained Notes to be
sold, pledged, or transferred will be characterized as indebtedness
for federal income tax purposes.  Any transferee, other
than the Depositor or an Affiliate thereof, acquiring a Retained
Note or an interest therein shall be deemed to have made the
representations set forth in Section 2.14 (as if Section
2.14(a) applied to the Retained Notes).   Any attempted
sale, pledge or other transfer in contravention of this Section
2.4(b) will be void ab initio and the purported transferor will
continue to be treated as the owner of the Retained
Note.

For the purposes of this
Section 2.4(b) , “Special Pass-Through Entity”
means a grantor trust, S corporation, or partnership (as
determined, in each case, for Federal income tax purposes) where
more than 50% of the value of any beneficial owner’s interest
in such pass through entity is attributable to the pass-through
entity’s interest in the Retained Note.

 

(c)          [Reserved].

 

(d)          By
acquiring a Note other than any Retained Note to which the
restrictions of Section 2.04(b) of this Indenture apply, each
initial purchaser, transferee and owner of a beneficial interest in
such Note will be deemed to represent that either (1) it is not
acquiring the Notes with the assets of any Plan or (2) the
acquisition and holding of such Notes will not give rise to a
nonexempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code or Similar Law. Each Note other than any
Retained Note will bear a legend reflecting such deemed
representation.  By acquiring a Retained Note to which
the restrictions of Section 2.04(b) of this Indenture apply,
each initial purchaser, transferee and owner of a beneficial
interest in such Retained Note will be deemed to represent that
either (1) it is not acquiring such Retained Note with the assets
of any Plan that is subject to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Code or (2) it is acquiring such Retained Note with the assets
of a Plan that is not subject to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975
of the Code and the acquisition and holding of such Retained Note
will not give rise to a nonexempt prohibited transaction under
Similar Law.

 

(e)          By
directly or indirectly acquiring a Retained Note in a transaction
pursuant to Rule 144A, each initial purchaser, transferee and owner
of a beneficial interest will be deemed to represent, warrant and
agree as follows:

 

(i)          it
understands that such Notes have not been registered under the
Securities Act, and may not be sold except as permitted in the
following sentence.  It understands and agrees, on its
own behalf and on behalf of any accounts for which it is acting as
hereinafter stated, (x) that such Notes are being offered only in a
transaction not involving any public offering within the meaning of
the Securities Act and (y) that such Notes may be resold, pledged
or transferred only (i) to the Depositor, (ii) to an
“accredited investor” as defined in Rule
501(a)(1),(2),(3) or (7) of Regulation D under the Securities Act
(an “ Accredited Investor ”) acting for its own
account (and not for the account of others) or as a fiduciary or
agent for others (which others also are Accredited Investors unless
the holder is a bank acting in its fiduciary capacity) that
executes a certificate substantially in the form of the Investment
Letter, (iii) so long as such Note is eligible for resale pursuant
to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, to a person whom it
reasonably believes after due inquiry is a “qualified
institutional buyer” as defined in Rule 144A, acting for its
own account (and not for the account of others) or as a fiduciary
or agent for others (which others also are “qualified
institutional buyers”) to whom notice is given that the
resale, pledge or transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A
or (iv) in a sale, pledge or other transfer made in a transaction
otherwise exempt from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act, in which case the Indenture Trustee shall require
that both the prospective transferor and the prospective transferee
certify to the Indenture Trustee and the Depositor in writing the
facts surrounding such transfer, which certification shall be in
form and substance satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee and the
Depositor.  Except in the case of a transfer described in
clauses (i) or (iii) above, the Indenture Trustee
shall require that a written opinion of counsel (which will not be
at the expense of the Depositor, any Affiliate of the Depositor or
the Indenture Trustee), satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee and
the Depositor, be delivered to the Indenture Trustee and the
Depositor to the effect that such transfer will not violate the
Securities Act, and will be effected in accordance with any
applicable securities laws of each state of the United
States.  It will notify any purchaser of such Notes from
it of the above resale restrictions, if then
applicable.  It further understands that in connection
with any transfer of such Notes by it that the Indenture Trustee
and the Depositor may request, and if so requested it will furnish,
such certificates and other information as they may reasonably
require to confirm that any such transfer complies with the
foregoing restrictions;

(ii)         it
is a “qualified institutional buyer” as defined under
Rule 144A under the Securities Act and is acquiring such Notes for
its own account (and not for the account of others) or as a
fiduciary or agent for others (which others also are
“qualified institutional buyers”).  It is
familiar with Rule 144A under the Securities Act and is aware that
the seller of such Notes  and other parties intend to
rely on the foregoing representations, warranties and
acknowledgements and the exemption from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act provided by Rule
144A;

 

(iii)        [Reserved];

 

(iv)        it
understands that Issuing Entity, the Indenture Trustee, the
Depositor and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the
foregoing acknowledgments, representations and agreements, and it
agrees that if any of the acknowledgments, representations and
warranties deemed to have been made by it by its purchase of such
Notes, for its own account or for one or more accounts as to each
of which it exercises sole investment discretion, are no longer
accurate, it shall promptly notify the Depositor; and

 

(v)         Issuing
Entity, the Indenture Trustee and the Depositor are entitled to
rely upon the foregoing representations, warranties and
acknowledgements and are irrevocably authorized to produce the
foregoing representations, warranties and acknowledgments or a copy
hereof to any interested party in any administrative or legal
proceeding or official inquiry with respect to the matters covered
hereby.

Section
2.05         
Registration; Registration of Transfer and Exchange . The
Issuing Entity shall cause a note registrar (the “ Note
Registrar ”) to keep a register (the “ Note
Register ”) in which the Note Registrar shall provide for
the registration of Notes and the registration of transfers of
Notes.  The Indenture Trustee initially shall be the Note
Registrar for the purpose of registering Notes and transfers of
Notes as herein provided.  Upon any resignation of any
Note Registrar, the Issuing Entity shall promptly appoint a
successor or, if it elects not to make such an appointment, assume
the duties of Note Registrar.

 

If a Person other than
the Indenture Trustee is appointed by the Issuing Entity as Note
Registrar, the Issuing Entity will give the Indenture Trustee
prompt written notice of the appointment of such Note Registrar and
of the location, and any change in the location, of the Note
Register, and the Indenture Trustee shall have the right to inspect
the Note Register at all reasonable times and to obtain copies
thereof, and the Indenture Trustee shall have the right to rely
upon a certificate executed on behalf of the Note Registrar by an
Executive Officer thereof as to the names and addresses of the
Holders of the Notes and the principal amounts and number of such
Notes.

 

Upon surrender for
registration of transfer of any Note at the office or agency of the
Issuing Entity to be maintained as provided in
Section 3.02 , if the requirements of Section 8-401 of
the UCC are met the Issuing Entity shall execute, and the Indenture
Trustee shall authenticate and the Noteholder shall obtain from the
Indenture Trustee, in the name of the designated transferee or
transferees, one or more new Notes of the same Class in any
authorized denominations, of a like aggregate principal
amount.

 

At the option of the
Holder, Notes may be exchanged for other Notes of the same Class in
any authorized denominations, of a like aggregate principal amount,
upon surrender of the Notes to be exchanged at such office or
agency.  Whenever any Notes are so surrendered for
exchange, if the requirements of Section 8-401 of the UCC are met
the Issuing Entity shall execute, and the Indenture Trustee shall
authenticate and the Noteholder shall obtain from the Indenture
Trustee, the Notes which the Noteholder making the exchange is
entitled to receive.

 

All Notes issued upon
any registration of transfer or exchange of Notes shall be the
valid obligations of the Issuing Entity, evidencing the same debt,
and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the
Notes surrendered upon such registration of transfer or
exchange.

 

Every Note presented or
surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall be duly
endorsed by, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer
in form satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee duly executed by, the
Holder thereof or such Holder’s attorney duly authorized in
writing, with such signature guaranteed by an “eligible
guarantor institution” meeting the requirements of the Note
Registrar, which requirements include membership or participation
in the Securities Transfer Agent’s Medallion Program (“
STAMP ”) or such other “signature guarantee
program” as may be determined by the Note Registrar in
addition to, or in substitution for, STAMP, all in accordance with
the Exchange Act.

No service charge shall
be made to a Holder for any registration of transfer or exchange of
Notes, but the Issuing Entity or the Note Registrar may require
payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental
charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of
transfer or exchange of Notes, other than exchanges pursuant to
Section 2.03 or 9.06 not involving any
transfer.

 

The preceding provisions
of this Section notwithstanding, the Issuing Entity shall not be
required to make and the Note Registrar need not register transfers
or exchanges of Notes selected for redemption or of any Note for a
period of 15 days preceding the due date for any payment with
respect to the Note.

 

Section
2.06         
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Notes . If (i) any
mutilated Note is surrendered to the Indenture Trustee or Note
Registrar, or the Indenture Trustee receives evidence to its
satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Note, and
(ii) there is delivered to the Indenture Trustee such security
or indemnity as may be required by it to hold the Issuing Entity
and the Indenture Trustee harmless, then, in the absence of notice
to the Issuing Entity, the Note Registrar or the Indenture Trustee
that such Note has been acquired by a protected purchaser, and
provided that the requirements of Sections 8-405 and 8-406 of the
UCC are met, the Issuing Entity shall execute, and upon its request
the Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange
for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen
Note, a replacement Note of the same Class; provided ,
however , that if any such destroyed, lost or stolen Note,
but not a mutilated Note, shall have become or within seven days
shall be due and payable, or shall have been called for redemption,
instead of issuing a replacement Note, the Issuing Entity may pay
such destroyed, lost or stolen Note when so due or payable or upon
the Redemption Date without surrender thereof.  If, after
the delivery of such replacement Note or payment of a destroyed,
lost or stolen Note pursuant to the proviso to the preceding
sentence, a protected purchaser of the original Note in lieu of
which such replacement Note was issued presents for payment such
original Note, the Issuing Entity and the Indenture Trustee shall
be entitled to recover such replacement Note (or such payment) from
the Person to whom it was delivered or any Person taking such
replacement Note from such Person to whom such replacement Note was
delivered or any assignee of such Person, except a protected
purchaser, and shall be entitled to recover upon the security or
indemnity provided therefor to the extent of any loss, damage, cost
or expense incurred by the Issuing Entity or the Indenture Trustee
in connection therewith.

 

Upon the issuance of any
replacement Note under this Section, the Issuing Entity may require
the payment by the Holder of such Note of a sum sufficient to cover
any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in
relation thereto and any other reasonable expenses (including the
fees and expenses of the Indenture Trustee) connected
therewith.

 

Every replacement Note
issued pursuant to this Section in replacement of any mutilated,
destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall constitute an original
additional contractual obligation of the Issuing Entity, whether or
not the mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall be at any
time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the
benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and
all other Notes duly issued hereunder.

 

The provisions of this
Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all
other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or
payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes.

the Indenture Trustee or Holders of the Notes representing at least
a majority of the Outstanding Amount of the Controlling Securities

manner provided in Section 5.02 .  In such
case, principal shall be paid in accordance with the priorities set
forth in Section 8.02(d) or Section 8.02(e) , as the
case may be.  The Indenture Trustee shall notify the
Person in whose name a Note is registered at the close of business

upon presentation and surrender of such Note and shall specify the
place where such Note may be presented and surrendered for payment
of such installment.  Notices in connection with
redemptions of Notes shall be mailed to Noteholders as provided in
Section 10.02 .

the Issuing Entity defaults in a payment of interest on the Notes,
the Issuing Entity shall pay defaulted interest (plus interest on
such defaulted interest to the extent lawful) at the applicable
Interest Rate in any lawful manner.  The Issuing Entity
may pay such defaulted interest to the persons who are Noteholders
on a subsequent special record date, which date shall be at least
five Business Days prior to the payment date.  The
Issuing Entity shall fix or cause to be fixed any such special
record date and payment date, and, at least 15 days before any such
special record date, the Issuing Entity shall mail to each

Trust Company, the initial Clearing Agency, by, or on behalf of,

Cede & Co., the nominee of the initial Clearing Agency,
and no Note Owner will receive a definitive Note representing such

”) have been issued to such Note Owners pursuant to
Section 2.13 :

 

(i)          the
provisions of this Section shall be in full force and

Participants and receive and transmit payments of principal of and
interest on the Notes to such Clearing Agency Participants;
and

 

(v)         whenever
this Indenture requires or permits actions to be taken based upon
instructions or directions of Holders of Notes evidencing a
specified percentage of the Outstanding Amount of the Controlling
Securities, the Clearing Agency shall be deemed to represent such
percentage only to the extent that it has received instructions to
such effect from Note Owners and/or Clearing Agency Participants
owning or representing, respectively, such required percentage of
the beneficial interest in the Controlling Securities and has
delivered such instructions to the Indenture Trustee.

 

Section

Definitive Notes .  The Retained Notes, upon
original issuance, will be in the form of Definitive Notes, but, at
the request of all of the holders thereof, may be exchanged for
Book-Entry Notes.  If (i) the Administrator advises
the Indenture Trustee in writing that the Clearing Agency is no
longer willing or able to properly discharge its responsibilities
with respect to the Book-Entry Notes and the Administrator is
unable to locate a qualified successor, (ii) the Administrator
at its option advises the Indenture Trustee in writing that it
elects to terminate the book-entry system through the Clearing
Agency or (iii) after the occurrence of an Event of Default or
a Servicer Default, Owners of the Book-Entry Notes representing
beneficial interests aggregating at least a majority of the
Outstanding Amount of the Controlling Securities advise the
Clearing Agency in writing that the continuation of a book-entry
system through the Clearing Agency is no longer in the best
interests of such Note Owners, then the Clearing Agency shall
notify all Note Owners and the Indenture Trustee of the occurrence
of any such event and of the availability of Definitive Notes to
Note Owners requesting the same.  Upon surrender to the
Indenture Trustee of the typewritten Notes representing the
Book-Entry Notes by the Clearing Agency, accompanied by
registration instructions, the Issuing Entity shall execute and the
Indenture Trustee shall authenticate the Definitive Notes in
accordance with the instructions of the Clearing
Agency.  None of the Issuing Entity, the Note Registrar
or the Indenture Trustee shall be liable for any delay in delivery
of such instructions and may conclusively rely on, and shall be
protected in relying on, such instructions.  Upon the
issuance of Definitive Notes, the Indenture Trustee shall recognize
the Holders of the Definitive Notes as Noteholders.

 

Section

Issuing Entity has entered into this Indenture, and the Notes will

indebtedness secured by the Trust Estate.  The Issuing
Entity, by entering into this Indenture, and each Noteholder, by
its acceptance of a Note (and each Note Owner by its acceptance of
an interest in the applicable Book-Entry Note), agree to treat the
Notes (other than Notes held by any entity whose separate existence
from the Issuing Entity is disregarded for federal income tax
purposes, but only so long as such Notes are held by such entity)
for all purposes including federal, state and local income, single
business and franchise tax purposes as indebtedness.

 

(b)          Each
Noteholder or Note Owner, by its acceptance of a Note or, in the
case of a Note Owner, a beneficial interest in a Note, agrees to
provide to the Person from whom it receives payments on the Notes
(including the Paying Agent) the Noteholder Tax Identification
Information and, upon request, to the extent FATCA Withholding Tax
is applicable, the Noteholder FATCA Information.

 

(c)          Each
Noteholder or Note Owner, by its acceptance of a Note or, in the
case of a Note Owner, a beneficial interest in a Note, agrees that
the Indenture Trustee has the right to withhold any amounts of
interest (properly withholdable under law and without any
corresponding gross-up) payable to a Noteholder or holder of an
interest in a Note that fails to comply with the requirements of
Section 2.14(b) .

Section
2.15          CUSIP
Numbers . The Issuing Entity in issuing the Notes may use
“CUSIP” numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so,
the Indenture Trustee shall use “CUSIP” numbers in
notices of redemption as a convenience to Noteholders;
provided that any such notice may state that no
representation is made as to the correctness of such
“CUSIP” numbers either as printed on the Notes or as
contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be
placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the
Notes  and any such redemption shall not be affected by
any defect in or omission of such numbers.  The Depositor
will promptly notify the Indenture Trustee in writing of any change
in the “CUSIP” numbers.

Entity to such Noteholder for all purposes of this
Indenture.

the Issuing Entity hereby initially appoints the Indenture Trustee
to serve as its agent for the foregoing purposes.  The

benefit of the Persons entitled thereto, and (unless the Paying
Agent is the Indenture Trustee) shall promptly notify the Indenture
Trustee of its action or failure so to act.

 

The Issuing Entity will
cause each Paying Agent other than the Indenture Trustee to execute
and deliver to the Indenture Trustee an instrument in which such
Paying Agent shall agree with the Indenture Trustee (and if the
Indenture Trustee acts as Paying Agent, it hereby so agrees),
subject to the provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent
will:

 

(i)          hold
all sums held by it for the payment of amounts due with respect to
the Notes in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto

of as herein provided and pay such sums to such Persons as herein
provided;

(v)         comply
with all requirements of the Code with respect to the withholding
from any payments made by it on any Notes of any applicable

at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and
discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, by Issuing
Entity Order direct any Paying Agent to pay to the Indenture
Trustee all sums held in trust by such Paying Agent, such sums to
be held by the Indenture Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon
which the sums were held by such Paying Agent; and upon such
payment by any Paying Agent to the Indenture Trustee, such Paying
Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to

money shall thereupon cease; provided , however ,

such money then remaining will be repaid to the Issuing
Entity.  The Indenture Trustee shall also adopt and
employ, at the expense and direction of the Issuing Entity, any
other reasonable means of notification of such repayment
(including, but not limited to, mailing notice of such repayment to
Holders whose Notes have been called but have not been surrendered
for redemption or whose right to or interest in monies due and
payable but not claimed is determinable from the records of the
Indenture Trustee or of any Paying Agent, at the last address of
record for each such Holder).

any financing statement, continuation statement or other instrument
required to be executed pursuant to this Section 3.05
.  The Issuing Entity hereby ratifies any such financing
statements filed prior to the date hereof; it being understood that
such authorization shall not be deemed to be an obligation on the
part of the Administrator or the Indenture Trustee to make any such
filing.

 

Section
3.06         
Opinions as to Trust Estate .

 

(a)          On
the Closing Date, the Issuing Entity shall furnish to the Indenture

requisite documents and the execution and filing of any financing
statements and continuation statements that will, in the opinion of

Section
3.07         
Performance of Obligations; Servicing of Receivables
.

 

(a)          The
Issuing Entity will not take any action and will use its best
efforts not to permit any action to be taken by others that would
release any Person from any of such Person’s material
covenants or obligations under any instrument or agreement included
in the Trust Estate or that would result in the amendment,
hypothecation, subordination, termination or discharge of, or
impair the validity or effectiveness of, any such instrument or
agreement, except as expressly provided in this Indenture, the Sale
and Servicing Agreement or such other instrument or
agreement.

 





17





 


 

(b)          The
Issuing Entity may contract with other Persons to assist it in
performing its duties under this Indenture, and any performance of
such duties by a Person identified to the Indenture Trustee in an
Officer’s Certificate of the Issuing Entity shall be deemed
to be action taken by the Issuing Entity.  Initially, the
Issuing Entity has contracted with the Servicer and the
Administrator to assist the Issuing Entity in performing its duties
under this Indenture.

 

(c)          The
Issuing Entity will punctually perform and observe all of its
obligations and agreements contained in this Indenture, the Basic
Documents and in the instruments and agreements included in the
Trust Estate, including but not limited to filing or causing to be
filed all UCC financing statements and continuation statements
required to be filed by the terms of this Indenture and the Sale
and Servicing Agreement in accordance with and within the time
periods provided for herein and therein.  Except as
otherwise expressly provided therein, the Issuing Entity shall not
waive, amend, modify, supplement or terminate any Basic Document or
any provision thereof without the consent of the Indenture Trustee
or the Holders of at least a majority of the Outstanding Amount of
the Controlling Securities.

 

(d)          If
the Issuing Entity shall have knowledge of the occurrence of a
Servicer Default under the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the
Issuing Entity shall promptly notify the Indenture Trustee and the
Rating Agencies thereof, and shall specify in such notice the
action, if any, the Issuing Entity is taking with respect to such
default.  If a Servicer Default shall arise from the
failure of the Servicer to perform any of its duties or obligations
under the Sale and Servicing Agreement with respect to the
Receivables, the Issuing Entity shall take all reasonable steps
available to it to remedy such failure.

 

(e)          As
promptly as possible after the giving of notice of termination to
the Servicer of the Servicer’s rights and powers pursuant to
Section 8.01 of the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the
Indenture Trustee shall appoint a successor servicer (the “
Successor Servicer ”), and such Successor Servicer
shall accept its appointment by a written assumption in a form
acceptable to the Indenture Trustee.  In the event that a
Successor Servicer has not been appointed and accepted its
appointment at the time when the Servicer ceases to act as
Servicer, the Indenture Trustee without further action shall
automatically be appointed the Successor Servicer.  The
Indenture Trustee may resign as the Servicer by giving written
notice of such resignation to the Issuing Entity and the Depositor
and in such event will be released from such duties and
obligations, such release not to be effective until the date a new
servicer enters into a servicing agreement with the Issuing Entity
as provided below.  Upon delivery of any such notice to
the Issuing Entity, the Indenture Trustee shall obtain a new
servicer as the Successor Servicer under the Sale and Servicing
Agreement.  Any Successor Servicer other than the
Indenture Trustee shall (i) be an established financial
institution having a net worth of not less than $100,000,000 and
whose regular business includes the servicing of Contracts and
(ii) enter into a servicing agreement with the Issuing Entity
having substantially the same provisions as the provisions of the
Sale and Servicing Agreement applicable to the
Servicer.  If within 30 days after the delivery of the
notice referred to above, the Issuing Entity shall not have
obtained such a new servicer, the Indenture Trustee may appoint, or
may petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint, a
Successor Servicer.  In connection with any such
appointment, the Indenture Trustee may make such arrangements for
the compensation of such successor as it and such successor shall
agree, subject to the limitations set forth below and in the Sale
and Servicing Agreement, and in accordance with
Section 8.02 of the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the
Issuing Entity shall enter into an agreement with such successor
for the servicing of the Receivables (such agreement to be in form
and substance satisfactory to the Indenture
Trustee).  Notwithstanding anything herein or in the Sale
and Servicing Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the
Indenture Trustee be liable for any Servicing Fee or for any
differential in the amount of the Servicing Fee paid hereunder and
the amount necessary to induce any Successor Servicer to act as
Successor Servicer under the Basic Documents and the transactions
set forth or provided for therein.  If the Indenture
Trustee shall succeed to the Servicer’s duties as servicer of
the Receivables as provided herein, it shall do so in its
individual capacity and not in its capacity as Indenture Trustee
and, accordingly, the provisions of Article VI hereof
shall be inapplicable to the Indenture Trustee in its duties as the
successor to the Servicer and the servicing of the
Receivables.  In case the Indenture Trustee shall become
successor to the Servicer under the Sale and Servicing Agreement,
the Indenture Trustee shall be entitled to appoint as Servicer any
one of its Affiliates, provided that it shall be fully liable for
the actions and omissions of such Affiliate in such capacity as
Successor Servicer.

 





18





 


 

(f)          Upon
any termination of the Servicer’s rights and powers pursuant
to the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Issuing Entity shall
promptly notify the Indenture Trustee.  As soon as a
Successor Servicer is appointed, the Indenture Trustee shall notify
the Issuing Entity of such appointment, specifying in such notice
the name and address of such Successor Servicer.

 

(g)          Without
derogating from the absolute nature of the assignment granted to
the Indenture Trustee under this Indenture or the rights of the
Indenture Trustee hereunder, the Issuing Entity agrees
(i) that it will not, without the prior written consent of the
Indenture Trustee or the Holders of at least a majority of the
Outstanding Amount of the Controlling Securities and, if such
action would result in a material adverse effect on, the Swap
Counterparty, if any, amend, modify, waive, supplement, terminate
or surrender, or agree to any amendment, modification, supplement,
termination, waiver or surrender of, the terms of any Collateral
(except to the extent otherwise provided in the Sale and Servicing
Agreement) or the Trust Agreement, the Sale and Servicing
Agreement, the Receivables Purchase Agreement, the Administration
Agreement, the Interest Rate Swaps, if any, or the Swap
Counterparty Rights Agreement, if any (except as may be permitted
thereby), or waive timely performance or observance by the Servicer
or the Depositor under the Sale and Servicing Agreement (except as
may be permitted thereby); and (ii) that any such amendment
shall not (A) increase or reduce in any manner the amount of,
or accelerate or delay the timing of, distributions that are
required to be made for the benefit of the Noteholders or
(B) reduce the aforesaid percentage of the Controlling
Securities that is required to consent to any such amendment,
without the consent of the Holders of all the Outstanding
Notes.  If any such amendment, modification, supplement
or waiver shall be so consented to by the Indenture Trustee or such
Holders, the Issuing Entity agrees, promptly following a request by
the Indenture Trustee to do so, to execute and deliver, in its own
name and at its own expense, such agreements, instruments, consents
and other documents as the Indenture Trustee may deem necessary or
appropriate in the circumstances.

liquidate in whole or in part or (B) sell, transfer, exchange or

reason of the payment of the taxes levied or assessed upon any part
of the Trust Estate; or

 

(iii)        (A) permit

subordinated, terminated or discharged, or permit any Person to be
released from any covenants or obligations with respect to the

hereby, (B) permit any lien, charge, excise, claim, security
interest, mortgage or other encumbrance (other than the lien of
this Indenture) to be created on or extend to or otherwise arise
upon or burden the Trust Estate or any part thereof or any interest
therein or the proceeds thereof (other than tax liens,
mechanics’ liens and other liens that arise by operation of
law, in each case on any of the Financed Vehicles and arising

this Indenture with respect thereto, whether by declaration or
otherwise, enforce any judgment obtained and collect from the
Issuing Entity and any other obligor upon such Notes monies
adjudged due;

 

(ii)         institute
Proceedings from time to time for the complete or partial
foreclosure of this Indenture with respect to the Trust
Estate;

however , that the Indenture Trustee may not sell or
otherwise liquidate the Trust Estate following an Event of Default,
other than an Event of Default described in
Section 5.01(i) or (ii) , unless (A) the
Holders of 100% of the Outstanding Amount of the Notes consent
thereto, (B) the proceeds of such sale or liquidation
distributable to the Noteholders are sufficient to discharge in
full all amounts then due and unpaid upon such Notes for principal

insufficiency with respect to clauses (B) and

following an Event of Default and such declaration and its
consequences have not been rescinded and annulled, the Indenture

connection with Sections 5.06(ii) and (iii) ,

groups of Holders of Notes, each representing less than a majority

absolute and unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of
and interest, if any, on such Note on or after the respective due
dates thereof expressed in such Note or in this Indenture (or, in
the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date) and to
institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such
right shall not be impaired without the consent of such
Holder.

Trustee or any Noteholder has instituted any Proceeding to enforce

been discontinued or abandoned for any reason or has been
determined adversely to the Indenture Trustee or to such
Noteholder, then and in every such case the Issuing Entity, the
Indenture Trustee and the Noteholders shall, subject to any
determination in such Proceeding, be restored severally and
respectively to their former positions hereunder, and thereafter
all rights and remedies of the Indenture Trustee and the
Noteholders shall continue as though no such Proceeding had been
instituted.

 

Section
5.09         
Rights and Remedies Cumulative . No right or remedy herein
conferred upon or reserved to the Indenture Trustee or to the
Noteholders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or
remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted
by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and
remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in
equity or otherwise.  The assertion or employment of any
right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the

or Omission Not a Waiver . No delay or omission of the
Indenture Trustee or any Holder of any Note to exercise any right
or remedy accruing upon any Default or Event of Default shall
impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such
Default or Event of Default or an acquiescence
therein.  Every right and remedy given by this
Article V or by law to the Indenture Trustee or to the
Noteholders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may
be deemed expedient, by the Indenture Trustee or by the
Noteholders, as the case may be.

 

Section
5.11         
Control by Noteholders . The Holders of at least a majority
of the Outstanding Amount of the Controlling Securities shall have
the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any
Proceeding for any remedy available to the Indenture Trustee with
respect to the Notes or exercising any trust or power conferred on
the Indenture Trustee; provided that:

 

(i)          such
direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with
this Indenture;

 

(ii)         subject
to the express terms of Section 5.04 , any direction to
the Indenture Trustee to sell or liquidate the Trust Estate shall
be by Holders of Notes representing not less than 100% of the
Outstanding Amount of the Controlling Securities;

 

(iii)        if
the conditions set forth in Section 5.05 have been
satisfied and the Indenture Trustee elects to retain the Trust
Estate pursuant to such Section, then any direction to the
Indenture Trustee by Holders of Notes representing less than 100%
of the Outstanding Amount of the Controlling Securities to sell or
liquidate the Trust Estate shall be of no force and effect;
and

 

(iv)        the
Indenture Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the
Indenture Trustee that is not inconsistent with such
direction.

 

Notwithstanding the
rights of Noteholders set forth in this Section, subject to
Section 6.01 , the Indenture Trustee need not take any
action that it determines might involve it in liability or might
materially adversely affect the rights of any Noteholders not
consenting to such action.

 

Section
5.12         
Waiver of Past Defaults . Prior to the declaration of the
acceleration of the maturity of the Notes as provided in
Section 5.02 , the Holders of Notes of at least a
majority of the Outstanding Amount of the Controlling Securities
may waive any past Default or Event of Default and its consequences
except a Default (a) in payment of principal of or interest on
any of the Notes or (b) in respect of a covenant or provision
hereof which cannot be modified or amended without the consent of
the Holder of each Note.  The Indenture Trustee will give
written notice of any such waiver to the Swap Counterparty, if
any.  In the case of any such waiver, the Issuing Entity,
the Indenture Trustee and the Holders of the Notes shall be
restored to their former positions and rights hereunder,
respectively; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or
other Default or impair any right consequent thereto.

 

Upon any such waiver,
such Default shall cease to exist and be deemed to have been cured
and not to have occurred, and any Event of Default arising
therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured and not to have
occurred, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver
shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default
or impair any right consequent thereto.

claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension
law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, that
may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and

Indenture.  Neither the lien of this Indenture nor any
rights or remedies of the Indenture Trustee or the Noteholders
shall be impaired by the recovery of any judgment by the Indenture
Trustee against the Issuing Entity or by the levy of any execution
