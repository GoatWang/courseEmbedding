We leverage our global network of relationships and regional expertise to invest capital opportunistically in order to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders and partners. Our portfolio is diversified across geography and product type.






 







Harrington Square | Renton, WA View 




Multifamily
Kennedy Wilson pursues multifamily acquisition opportunities where we can unlock value through a myriad of strategies, including institutional management, asset rehabilitation, repositioning and creative recapitalization. We focus primarily on apartments in supply-constrained, infill markets. We currently hold investments in more than 25,000 multifamily apartments located in the Western U.S. (primarily Greater Seattle, San Francisco - Bay Area, and Greater Los Angeles) and Dublin, Ireland.

150 S El Camino | Beverly Hills, CA View 




Commercial
We source, acquire, and finance various types of commercial real estate which includes office, industrial, retail, and mixed-use assets. After acquisition, the properties are generally repositioned to enhance market value. Assets are either sold as part of property-specific investment strategies designed to deliver above-market returns to our clients and shareholders or held if producing above average returns. Kennedy Wilson owns interests in over 18 million rentable square feet located primarily in the Western United States, United Kingdom and Ireland.

Kohanaiki | Kailua-Kona, Hawaii View 




Residential
Kennedy Wilson pursues major residential for sale housing acquisition opportunities, including land for entitlements, finished lots, urban infill condominium sites and partially finished and finished condominium projects. Our team members have many years of experience in buying, developing, repositioning and disposing of residential projects. This depth of experience combined with our financial strength allows us to identify and analyze opportunities, close acquisitions in a short time frame and execute business plans efficiently.

Riverfront promenades, welcoming parkland and destination retailers set the tone for a modern city district. Superb living spaces complement the contemporary office buildings to ensure Capital Dock has everything a global business could want in an international neighbourhood.

Kennedy Wilson Lands Anchor at Dublin Project





























Kennedy Wilson Lands Anchor at Dublin Project
J.P. Morgan has agreed to acquire an eight-story office building at Capital Dock, a 660,000-square-foot mixed-use development rising in the city's Docklands area.

Kennedy Wilson has reeled in an anchor tenant for the office segment of Capital Dock, a 660,000-square-foot mixed-use project the global real estate investment company is in the midst of creating in Dublin, Ireland. J.P. Morgan Bank (Ireland) plc will be the first big name on campus, with the bank having committed to acquiring a 130,000-square-foot office building at the multi-structure development through a forward-funding sale agreement. The sale price: $137 million, according to a report by Bloomberg.
Capital Dock in Dublin
“Securing such a prominent occupier to anchor the office component of Capital Dock is a significant endorsement of the value and our vision for this vibrant iconic scheme,” Mary Ricks, president & CEO of Kennedy Wilson Europe, said in a prepared statement. KW is developing Capital Dock in a joint venture with Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. and the National Asset Management Agency, and holds a 43 percent ownership stake in the project.  
Capital Dock is located in the Docklands area of Dublin on a 4.8-acre site bordered on three sides by canal and riverside promenades. Designed by architectural firm O’Mahony Pike, the LEED Gold-certified property will consist of an aggregate 345,000 square feet of office space at 100, 200 and 300 Capital Dock, as well as 190 residential apartments encompassed in three additional structures, and 25,000 square feet of retail space. J.P. Morgan will occupy 200 Capital Dock, an eight-story tower featuring 130,000 square feet of office space.
Capital Dock was designed to appeal to expanding international businesses, and it appears the property’s target audience is taking note. “The Dublin occupier market is buoyant and we are in active and advanced dialogue with both Irish and international companies attracted to our visionary Capital Dock development and looking to base themselves in the heart of Dublin,” Ricks added. Demand for premier office space is strong in the Irish capital, and the numbers tell the story. The vacancy rate in the city center is just 4.8 percent, according to a first quarter 2017 report by commercial real estate services firm JLL, which is marketing office space at Capital Dock.
The lending community is looking kindly upon Capital Dock, too. KW announced that Deutsche Bank has provided a construction loan of €125 million, or approximately $137.3 million, for the development. Together, the loan and J.P. Morgan’s commitment cover the remaining costs for completion of the entire waterfront project.
J.P. Morgan will close the acquisition of its new office building in tandem with the delivery of Capital Dock, which is scheduled for the third quarter of 2018.

400-450 N. Brand Blvd. in Glendale, Calif.
Kennedy Wilson Real Estate Fund V has acquired 400 and 450 N. Brand Blvd., a two-building, 437,000-square-foot office campus in Glendale, Calif., for $144 million. The transaction was paid for with $50 million in equity from Fund V and a five-year interest-only loan of $94 million.
JLL’s Executive Vice President Tom Bohlinger and Senior Vice President Jon Lange represented the seller, a venture of MetLife Inc. and Beacon Capital Partners, as well as the buyer. JLL’s Managing Director Brian Halpern and Senior Associate Alex Kane led the team on the financing.
The Class A property is 88 percent leased to 21 tenants including Cigna, also serving as the headquarters for DineEquity and Learner’s Digest International.
“Brand offers both a strong initial yield and attractive asset management opportunities within an area that continues to expand, driven by a large growth in urban housing and a strong presence of entertainment and other large corporations,” Nicholas Colonna, president of commercial investments and fund management at Kennedy Wilson, said in a prepared statement.
Glendale is home to major corporate and entertainment firms including Walt Disney Imagineering, Whole Foods, Marvel Animation, Dreamworks and Legal Zoom. The Brand is located minutes from The Americana and Glendale Galleria, which offer 2.5 million square feet of high-end retail and restaurants. Since 2013, the submarket has added or approved an additional 4,000 units of multifamily housing.
Kennedy Wilson owns a 12 percent stake in Fund V, which currently has a portfolio of 18 office, multifamily, retail and residential assets with a gross purchase price of $1 billion. With the latest transaction, Fund V’s capital is about 90 percent invested or committed.
The Beverly Hills, Calif.,-based firm announced in February 2016 that it had completed fundraising for Fund V, a U.S. value-add, closed-end fund with $500 million in capital commitments. Kennedy Wilson provided $60 million. Other funds came from the U. S., Europe and the Middle East, and included new and existing investors primarily from public and corporate pension funds. The fund has a flexible mandate that focuses on core West Coast markets and crosses various property types.
In September, Kennedy Wilson said one of the fund’s investments was the purchase of a 451-unit multifamily community in Bellevue, Wash., for $172 million. Fund V invested $58 million and secured a 10-year $115 million loan from Fannie Mae for the balance.
In addition to the Brand campus deal, Kennedy Wilson also announced a separate transaction—the sale of a 195,000-square-foot office building in North Hollywood, Calif., for $69 million. The firm had a 52.5 percent ownership in the property. No other details on the disposition were released.
Kennedy Wilson has been in the news recently, announcing in April that London-based Kennedy Wilson Europe Real Estate Plc, which invests in direct real estate and real estate loans in Europe, would become a wholly owned subsidiary of KW. When the merger is completed by the third quarter, the combined company is expected to have an enterprise value of $8.2 billion and a global portfolio of more than 400 properties.
