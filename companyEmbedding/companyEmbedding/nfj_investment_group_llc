NFJ Investment Group LLC Key Developments

Participants Sue Allianz Asset Management of America, L.P. Allianz Global Investors Fund Management LLC, Pacific Investment Management Company LLC, Allianz Global Investors U.S. LLC, and NFJ Investment Group LLC
Oct 12 15
A lawsuit filed by two participants in an Allianz retirement plan claims the company and its asset management partners, including PIMCO, misused employees 401(k) plan assets for their own financial benefit. Plaintiffs level a host of complaints against two sets of defendants overseeing the Allianz Asset Management 401 (k) plan, suggesting the 'total plan cost of 0.77% is outrageously high for a defined contribution plan with over $500 million in assets'. Named in the complaint are Allianz Asset Management of America (both AAM-LP and AAM-LLC), as well as 'the Committee of the Allianz Asset Management of America, L.P. 401(k) Savings and Retirement Plan [Chief Operating Officer and Managing Director of AAM] John Maney and John Does 1 to 30, who improperly managed Plan assets for the benefit of themselves and their affiliates instead of the Plan and its participants. Several participating employers are also named in the complaint. These include: AAM-LP and AAM-LLC (collectively, 'AAM'), Allianz Global Investors Fund Management LLC, Pacific Investment Management Company LLC (PIMCO), Allianz Global Investors U.S. LLC, and NFJ Investment Group LLC, who improperly received plan assets as profits at the expense of the Plan and its participants. Lead plaintiffs Aleksandr Urakhchin and Nathan Marfice filed their claim in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, seeking an order for Allianz and company 'to remedy breaches of fiduciary duties and unlawful self-dealing'. Plaintiffs seek to recover the financial losses suffered by the plan through improper fees and self-dealing, and to obtain injunctive and other equitable relief from the defendants, as provided by ERISA. Case documents show Urakchin and Marfice accuse defendants of the plan as an opportunity to promote the Allianz Family's mutual fund business and maximize profits at the expense of the Plan and its participants'. The accusations go beyond lax oversight commonly alleged in ERISA cases and suggest proactive self-dealing by defendants.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.
