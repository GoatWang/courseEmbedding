Washington Real Estate Investment Trust Appoints Edward J. Murn, IV 
      as Managing Director, Head of Residential Division






April 01, 2013 05:02 PM Eastern Daylight Time



ROCKVILLE, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Washington Real Estate Investment Trust (WRIT) (NYSE: WRE) announced the 
      appointment of Edward J. Murn, IV as Managing Director, Head of 
      Residential Division.
    

      Mr. Murn will oversee operations, investments and development for WRIT’s 
      11-property, 2,540 unit residential portfolio. His local real estate 
      career spans more than 20 years, serving most recently as Director of 
      Development at The Tower Companies, where he was responsible for 
      prominent metro DC area assets and projects including The Blairs, White 
      Flint Mall, and Tower Oaks. Prior to Tower, Mr. Murn served as Vice 
      President of Multifamily Development with Kettler, Inc. Previously, Mr. 
      Murn was Director of Acquisitions & Development – Northeast Investment 
      Group with Archstone-Smith Trust and Director of Capital Markets at 
      Charles E. Smith Residential Realty, Inc. Mr. Murn began his 
      professional career as a commercial real estate banker in the Washington 
      metro area. He holds a Master of Science in Real Estate from Johns 
      Hopkins University and a Master of Business Administration from Loyola 
      College. Mr. Murn is an active member of the Urban Land Institute and 
      Johns Hopkins Real Estate Forum.
    

      “We are excited to welcome Ed Murn to WRIT. He comes with extensive 
      multifamily operational and investment experience from The Tower 
      Companies and Kettler, Inc., two exceptional DC real estate firms, 
      making him an excellent addition to our team as we look to expand our 
      residential portfolio. This addition, along with our recent hiring of 
      Paul Weinschenk to head up our Retail Division, demonstrates our 
      commitment to maximizing the growth potential of our core residential 
      and retail sectors,” said George F. “Skip” McKenzie, President and Chief 
      Executive Officer of WRIT.
    

      WRIT is a self-administered, self-managed, equity real estate investment 
      trust investing in income-producing properties in the greater Washington 
      metro region. WRIT owns a diversified portfolio of 69 properties 
      totaling approximately 9 million square feet of commercial space and 
      2,540 residential units, and land held for development. These 69 
      properties consist of 25 office properties, 17 medical office 
      properties, 16 retail centers and 11 multifamily properties. WRIT shares 
      are publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: WRE).
    

Certain statements in this press release are "forward-looking 
      statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation 
      Reform Act of 1995. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, 
      uncertainties, and other factors that may cause actual results to differ 
      materially. Such risks, uncertainties and other factors include, but are 
      not limited to, the potential for federal government budget reductions, 
      changes in general and local economic and real estate market conditions, 
      the timing and pricing of lease transactions, the effect of the current 
      credit and financial market conditions, the availability and cost of 
      capital, fluctuations in interest rates, tenants' financial conditions, 
      levels of competition, the effect of government regulation, the impact 
      of newly adopted accounting principles, and other risks and 
      uncertainties detailed from time to time in our filings with the SEC, 
      including our 2012 Form 10-K. We assume no obligation to update or 
      supplement forward-looking statements that become untrue because of 
      subsequent events.
