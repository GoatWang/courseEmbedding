Early years and education[edit]
Gordon earned her Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1975, graduating Phi Beta Kappa,[4] and a Master of Science degree from the MIT Sloan School of Management in 1976.[5][6]
When she attended MIT, the male-female ratio of undergraduates was 10:1.[1] Her intention was to become a high school math teacher, but meeting other women at MIT who were preparing to become professionals led her to change her course, pursue a Master’s degree, and go into business.[2]
Career[edit]
After graduating from Sloan School of Management in 1976, Gordon went to work as a consultant for Boston Consulting Group. When the company decided to expand one year later Gordon volunteered to relocate to Europe.[1] She was a strategy consultant based in the Boston, London and Chicago offices, until 1980.[7]
From 1980 until 1982 Gordon worked at Signode, a packaging company specializing in materials handling.[7] In 1982 she joined the Packaging Corporation of America, a division of Tenneco Inc, where she had a mentor who advised her to go into management.[1][7] As the first female officer of Tenneco, she was the Vice President of Operations from 1994 to 1997 and the Vice President and General manager of the Folding Carton Business from 1997 to 1999.[1][8] Gordon’s worked at Tenneco for 17 years.[6]
In 1999 Gordon joined Pechiney as Senior Vice President, Pechiney Group and President, Pechiney Plastic Packaging, Inc. Pechiney was acquired by Alcan in 2003 and Gordon held various leadership positions until landing her first role as President and CEO at Alcan Packaging, based in Paris, in 2006, just before the company was acquired by Rio Tinto in July 2007. [9]
Gordon first joined Ingredion Incorporated as the CEO, president and chairman, previously called Corn Products International, on May 4, 2009.[5][6] Since taking over at Ingredion she re-branded the company and implemented a new corporate strategy, diversifying it from a focus on high fructose corn syrup to making food ingredients more broadly. The company went from a $2.2 billion market cap to over $5 billion with increased sales to $6.5 billion, bringing it onto list of Fortune 500 companies.[1]
Other affiliations[edit]
In addition to Ingredion, Gordon serves on the board of directors of International Paper and is on the board of trustees of The Conference Board and a member of the MIT Corporation, the Institute's board of trustees. She is a director of World Business Chicago (a non-profit economic development organization) and the first female chairman-elect of the Economic Club of Chicago. She is also a member of the board of The Executives' Club of Chicago and The Chicago Council on Global Affairs.[7]
In the past, she has served on the boards of five public companies, and she was the first female director of each: Arthur J. Gallagher & Company, United Stationers Inc., Outboard Marine Corporation, Sunstrand Corporation and Zenith Electronics.[7][10]
Awards and recognition[edit]
Gordon was recognized as one of the 50 most powerful women in business in 2011 in Fortune magazine’s ranking, coming in the 42nd position. In 2012 she was ranked 43 in the Fortune list of 50 most powerful women.[11] The National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD) recognized Gordon as the Director of the Year in September 2013.[12]
Personal life and family[edit]
Gordon is married and has two children,[8] whom she had when she was in her late twenties.[1]

Ingredion Incorporated (formerly Corn Products International, Inc) is an ingredient solutions provider based in Westchester, Illinois. The company turns corn, tapioca, potatoes, and other vegetables and fruits into ingredients for the food, beverage, brewing, and pharmaceutical industries and numerous industrial sectors.[3] It has more than 11,000 employees around the world, and customers in more than 60 markets in over 40 countries. In 2015, net sales were $5.6 billion.[3]
History[edit]
The company, which began as Corn Products Refining Co. and later as "CPC," was founded by the merger of leading US corn refiners in 1906.[4] It supplied the raw materials for Argo cornstarch and Mazola corn oil.[5]
CPC acquired starch factories in Europe from 1919 until 1987 when they were sold to the French sugar manufacture Béghin-Say and renamed Cerestar.[4][6]
In 1981, CPC formed a partnership with Texaco to produce bioethanol at a plant in Pekin, Illinois.[7] In 1995, the plant was sold to Williams Companies and, in 2003, continued as Aventine Renewable Energy.[8] The company has a facility in nearby Mapleton, Illinois, along U.S. Route 24, which is part of an industrial area, a major area employer.[9]
The Bestfoods division of the company known for brands Maizena, Knorr, Hellmann's / Best Foods mayonnaise, and Skippy Peanut Butter existed from 1958 until 1997 when the company split into Bestfoods, a packaged-foods company, and Corn Products International, a starch and sweeteners company.[10] Ingredion is a Fortune 1000 Company.[11]
In October 2010, CPI acquired National Starch of Dutch paints firm AkzoNobel for $1.3 billion in cash.[12] It also took on pension and employee benefit liabilities.[13][14]
The combined company employs approximately 11,000 people in North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia-Pacific. It operates 37 manufacturing facilities in 15 countries and sales offices in 29 countries. Ingredion Idea Labs Research and ingredient development centers are located in key global markets. In 2012, the company was renamed Ingredion.[15]

This interview with 
Ilene Gordon, C.E.O. of Ingredion, a company that turns raw materials into ingredients for the food, beverage and other industries, was conducted and condensed by 
Adam Bryant. Q. What are some leadership lessons you’ve learned from mentors over the years?A. There was one gentleman in particular. He had three daughters and his attitude was: “Look, you’re really smart, you’re very ambitious and focused. I can help teach you about business.” This was around 1982, and I’d already been out of business school for several years. He made it a priority to help me to hone my business skills.I was a strategist by training, and I was doing acquisitions. I was smart, I was analytical, but he said to me: “You ought to run some of these businesses and see how good your analysis was. It may look great on paper, but you have to motivate and inspire people. You’re 30 years old and the guy you’re leading is 55. How do you get the best out of him? That’s your challenge.”So, early on, this mentor gave me that opportunity to run businesses. I’ve been running them since I was 32.

He had a philosophy of putting people in jobs that were bigger than they were. If somebody has talent and good people skills and drive, I think you can stretch them and put them in a job that they’re not quite ready for, so they grow into it. That’s what people did for me, so I’m a big believer in doing that and taking young people and stretching them. Continue reading the main story

And employees love to hear that, because they feel like they’re going to get opportunities. There’s a big competition for talent. People will leave their company if they think they’ll have more opportunities elsewhere. So you need to offer opportunities to your young people. And you’ll have a much better retention.It’s not all about a 2 percent raise; it’s really about opportunity. I’m taking these lessons in how people treated me as a young professional and use those lessons today to excite our people.Q. How do you know if somebody’s able to stretch into a big new job?A. One question somebody once asked me was, “What do you think are important attributes to be successful in leadership?” I said it’s about tenacity. It’s never giving up. It’s having a Plan B. And that’s one of my favorite expressions: Have a Plan B, because Plan A doesn’t always go well, or maybe it’s derailed by a competitor or somebody else’s new product or some type of regulation.

My point is to always have a Plan B that you can implement. Maybe you have to go to Plan C or D, but the point is that you always have to have a backup plan.I look for young people who have a lot of energy, and who treat other people well, because we’re not looking for bullies. Some people push their way through things and they’re not collaborative. I look for people who don’t give up, who are very focused and organized but are also able to collaborate with other people, because in today’s organizations, you actually may not have anybody directly reporting to you but may have a team of 10 people from other parts of the organization. They’re your virtual team.So I look for young people who have the energy and drive to get things done, to keep their eye on where they’re going but at the same time realize they can’t do it alone. It’s not just a one-person show. You can’t be the micromanager; you have to be able to get things done through others.

Q. What else do you do to help develop younger managers?A. I use one dinner a year with my board to bring in young, high-potential managers. We have everybody give an “elevator speech.” You have three minutes to tell the board and other people in the room where you came from, the challenges you’re facing and how you’re trying to create value for the company. Everybody might want to take 15 minutes, but you have to be succinct.This is part of what we’re looking for in people who have potential; it’s all about communication. What are the challenges you have, and you have three minutes to explain them, because there are 40 of you and we’re going to be here all night otherwise. And if you take somebody else’s time, that’s not respectful. It’s all about being succinct and articulate.

Q. What questions do you ask when you hire? What qualities do you look for in job candidates?A. I like to look at the person’s résumé, and ask a lot of questions about how they made decisions to go from one company to the other. Did they have a plan? Not everybody has to have a structured plan, but I like to hear their thought process. Did they make things happen for themselves and their companies, or was it just serendipity? And serendipity is sometimes O.K., too.So that’s how I get into the interview and get people talking, but the key question I always ask, going back to my own theme, is: Who mentored you? Who did you learn from? Because I feel that, with the people we’re hiring, we’re hiring all their mentors, too. I want to know if they learned from somebody who was an operating expert or somebody who was a strategist and what companies those mentors worked in. That’s because I’m not just hiring the person sitting there; I’m hiring the four people who mentored him. I don’t think there’s anybody who’s successful in their role today who hasn’t been mentored by somebody.Business is always challenging. It doesn’t always go well, and Plan A doesn’t always work. So I look for people who have dealt with some adversity in their life. It could have been in business — maybe their company was acquired, and they had to figure out what they wanted to do and made a change, rather than sitting around for two years lamenting, “Why me?”Or somebody might have lost their parents early on. The point is, they’ve dealt with some type of adversity or illness and they came back and they persevered.That’s what I look for, because very few people have had perfect lives. You want people who are able to have a Plan B and C, and to rise above a challenge, move ahead and just get on with it, and have that can-do attitude.

 Biography




 




May 29, 2015 8:53 p.m. ET


Ilene Gordon has always been a woman with a plan. As a teenager, the chief executive of Ingredion, a leading processor of starches, sweeteners, and specialty food ingredients, knew her summer plans by January. Based on advice from a mentor in business school, she planned to give birth to her first child at least five years into her career. And, by age 30, she had mapped out a career path that would get her to the top of a big company. Gordon, 61, can safely say much has worked out as she planned. After graduating from the...

What to do when your leading product becomes Public Health Enemy No. 1


\What do you do when your leading product becomes Public Health Enemy No. 1? If you're Ilene Gordon, the dealmaking chief executive of ingredient- and food-flavoring-maker Ingredion, you blow up the company and reinvent it. Gordon, 63, took over the top spot at the sleepy company then called Corn Products International in 2009. Among her first moves was shifting the company away from high-fructose corn syrup, a cash cow yet a much-maligned sweetener used in soft drinks, baked goods and processed foods. Then Gordon put in motion a plan to engineer the company's overhaul through a string of acquisitions, a change in strategy and transformation of the century-old firm's culture. Her plan is now bearing fruit, helping push its stock up more than 38 percent year-to-date on strong sales and better-than-expected margins. While her approach initially was viewed by some inside the Westchester-based company as radical and overly aggressive, few are complaining now as the profits roll in and its stock this year hit an all-time high. “Not only was she a visionary, she probably saved the company,” says Erik Gordon (no relation), a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. “Whatever the facts are about high-fructose corn syrup, this fact is also true: High-fructose corn syrup is a lousy business to be in.” While Ingredion—whose primary function is converting raw products like corn, rice, tapioca and other plants into food ingredients—still sells the product, it represents less than 10 percent of total sales, down from north of 20 percent when Gordon took over. Her journey to diversify started in 2010 with the $1.3 billion purchase of National Starch, a Bridgewater, N.J.-based innovator in food ingredients and specialty starches that operated 11 plants in eight countries. That acquisition gave Ingredion a foothold in food textures, new capabilities in research and development as well as a new roster of customers. “We used the acquisition to really transform the company and refocus on putting together products that are very much on-trend,” Gordon says. The trend toward clean labels and niche nutrition “was all just accelerating in 2010. Back then, you may have had one friend who was gluten-free. Today, there are so many people who avoid gluten.” Gordon's timing, says Robert Moskow, an analyst at Credit Suisse, was excellent because it came as food processors and beverage companies were beginning to explore reformulating their products to remove artificial flavors, colors and other ingredients to meet changing consumer demand. “She deserves a lot of credit for having that foresight,” he says. Perhaps most important, Gordon used National Starch as a catalyst for taking a more proactive approach with customers. Instead of simply taking orders for Corn Products' legacy commodity ingredients, her sales teams were prodded to start asking what products its customers were developing and how the new Ingredion could help. “That's her greatest accomplishment with the company,” Moskow says. “She turned around the culture of a 100-year-old company, and that's not an easy thing to do.” Gordon says Ingredion's customers were “really ready to engage with us very early in the process,” and her team was prepared to help them start developing more healthful recipes “to meet this unmet market need.” The market has responded favorably. Shares closed Sept. 30 at  $133.06, up 454 percent since the closing price the day she became CEO. Today investors and analysts remain bullish on Ingredion's prospects as it moves headlong into developing new plant-based proteins, food colorings and flavorings, texturizers and other all-natural food additives to realign itself with consumers' preferences. Through its internal Idea Labs unit, Ingredion is working with packaged-foods companies to make their products more nutritious and more “clean label.” “Our challenge has been to figure out clever ways to use whole foods to replace processed foods,” says Tony DeLio, Ingredion's vice president of global innovation. That means adding color with carrots or beets; enhancing a product's texture with a fruit puree; or adding plant-based proteins to foods to make them more nutritious.
KEEPING LABELS 'CLEAN'
When a customer wants to remove an artificial sweetener or even an “added sugar”—under new government regulations, food- and drink-makers must disclose added sugars on labels—Ingredion can offer fruit purees that keep a label “clean” while adding the required sweetness. When a food manufacturer seeks to remove fat or sodium from a product, Ingredion's scientists work with a series of patented plant-based products to build texture and flavor back in. As a corollary to its relatively newly developed technical expertise, Ingredion is also getting more requests to help with nonfood products, such as improving packaging material by replacing plastic with a corn based-option or helping personal-care product marketers replace difficult-to-pronounce ingredients in body washes, shampoos and lotions with plant-based alternatives, DeLio says. “The trends of clean and simple, high-protein, gluten-free—all those things we're seeing here are becoming global,” he says. “It has presented us with a tremendous opportunity, and now one of the big questions is 'How do we invest for the future?' “ Best, perhaps, to leave it to  Gordon, who has turned a plodding old commodity company  into a growing high-tech innovation lab.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search



Ilene S. Gordon


Ilene S. Gordon (born in 1953[1]) became CEO, president, and chairman of Ingredion (formerly Corn Products International) in May, 2009 and became the 21st female CEO of a Fortune 500 company when Ingredion’s sales reached $6 billion for the first time, in 2012.[2] As of 2014 she was one of only 24 women who were CEOs of Fortune 500 companies.[3]

Early years and education[edit]
Gordon earned her Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1975, graduating Phi Beta Kappa,[4] and a Master of Science degree from the MIT Sloan School of Management in 1976.[5][6]
When she attended MIT, the male-female ratio of undergraduates was 10:1.[1] Her intention was to become a high school math teacher, but meeting other women at MIT who were preparing to become professionals led her to change her course, pursue a Master’s degree, and go into business.[2]
Career[edit]
After graduating from Sloan School of Management in 1976, Gordon went to work as a consultant for Boston Consulting Group. When the company decided to expand one year later Gordon volunteered to relocate to Europe.[1] She was a strategy consultant based in the Boston, London and Chicago offices, until 1980.[7]
From 1980 until 1982 Gordon worked at Signode, a packaging company specializing in materials handling.[7] In 1982 she joined the Packaging Corporation of America, a division of Tenneco Inc, where she had a mentor who advised her to go into management.[1][7] As the first female officer of Tenneco, she was the Vice President of Operations from 1994 to 1997 and the Vice President and General manager of the Folding Carton Business from 1997 to 1999.[1][8] Gordon’s worked at Tenneco for 17 years.[6]
In 1999 Gordon joined Pechiney as Senior Vice President, Pechiney Group and President, Pechiney Plastic Packaging, Inc. Pechiney was acquired by Alcan in 2003 and Gordon held various leadership positions until landing her first role as President and CEO at Alcan Packaging, based in Paris, in 2006, just before the company was acquired by Rio Tinto in July 2007. [9]
Gordon first joined Ingredion Incorporated as the CEO, president and chairman, previously called Corn Products International, on May 4, 2009.[5][6] Since taking over at Ingredion she re-branded the company and implemented a new corporate strategy, diversifying it from a focus on high fructose corn syrup to making food ingredients more broadly. The company went from a $2.2 billion market cap to over $5 billion with increased sales to $6.5 billion, bringing it onto list of Fortune 500 companies.[1]
Other affiliations[edit]
In addition to Ingredion, Gordon serves on the board of directors of International Paper and is on the board of trustees of The Conference Board and a member of the MIT Corporation, the Institute's board of trustees. She is a director of World Business Chicago (a non-profit economic development organization) and the first female chairman-elect of the Economic Club of Chicago. She is also a member of the board of The Executives' Club of Chicago and The Chicago Council on Global Affairs.[7]
In the past, she has served on the boards of five public companies, and she was the first female director of each: Arthur J. Gallagher & Company, United Stationers Inc., Outboard Marine Corporation, Sunstrand Corporation and Zenith Electronics.[7][10]
Awards and recognition[edit]
Gordon was recognized as one of the 50 most powerful women in business in 2011 in Fortune magazine’s ranking, coming in the 42nd position. In 2012 she was ranked 43 in the Fortune list of 50 most powerful women.[11] The National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD) recognized Gordon as the Director of the Year in September 2013.[12]
Personal life and family[edit]
Gordon is married and has two children,[8] whom she had when she was in her late twenties.[1]

Gordon first joined Ingredion Incorporated as the CEO, president and chairman, previously called Corn Products International, on May 4, 2009.[5][6] Since taking over at Ingredion she re-branded the company and implemented a new corporate strategy, diversifying it from a focus on high fructose corn syrup to making food ingredients more broadly. The company went from a $2.2 billion market cap to over $5 billion with increased sales to $6.5 billion, bringing it onto list of Fortune 500 companies.[1]
Other affiliations[edit]
In addition to Ingredion, Gordon serves on the board of directors of International Paper and is on the board of trustees of The Conference Board and a member of the MIT Corporation, the Institute's board of trustees. She is a director of World Business Chicago (a non-profit economic development organization) and the first female chairman-elect of the Economic Club of Chicago. She is also a member of the board of The Executives' Club of Chicago and The Chicago Council on Global Affairs.[7]
In the past, she has served on the boards of five public companies, and she was the first female director of each: Arthur J. Gallagher & Company, United Stationers Inc., Outboard Marine Corporation, Sunstrand Corporation and Zenith Electronics.[7][10]
Awards and recognition[edit]
Gordon was recognized as one of the 50 most powerful women in business in 2011 in Fortune magazine’s ranking, coming in the 42nd position. In 2012 she was ranked 43 in the Fortune list of 50 most powerful women.[11] The National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD) recognized Gordon as the Director of the Year in September 2013.[12]
Personal life and family[edit]
Gordon is married and has two children,[8] whom she had when she was in her late twenties.[1]

Early years and education[edit]
Gordon earned her Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1975, graduating Phi Beta Kappa,[4] and a Master of Science degree from the MIT Sloan School of Management in 1976.[5][6]
When she attended MIT, the male-female ratio of undergraduates was 10:1.[1] Her intention was to become a high school math teacher, but meeting other women at MIT who were preparing to become professionals led her to change her course, pursue a Master’s degree, and go into business.[2]
Career[edit]
After graduating from Sloan School of Management in 1976, Gordon went to work as a consultant for Boston Consulting Group. When the company decided to expand one year later Gordon volunteered to relocate to Europe.[1] She was a strategy consultant based in the Boston, London and Chicago offices, until 1980.[7]
From 1980 until 1982 Gordon worked at Signode, a packaging company specializing in materials handling.[7] In 1982 she joined the Packaging Corporation of America, a division of Tenneco Inc, where she had a mentor who advised her to go into management.[1][7] As the first female officer of Tenneco, she was the Vice President of Operations from 1994 to 1997 and the Vice President and General manager of the Folding Carton Business from 1997 to 1999.[1][8] Gordon’s worked at Tenneco for 17 years.[6]
In 1999 Gordon joined Pechiney as Senior Vice President, Pechiney Group and President, Pechiney Plastic Packaging, Inc. Pechiney was acquired by Alcan in 2003 and Gordon held various leadership positions until landing her first role as President and CEO at Alcan Packaging, based in Paris, in 2006, just before the company was acquired by Rio Tinto in July 2007. [9]

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
