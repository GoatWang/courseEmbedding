Although there is certainly no lack of technology companies and PR Firms throwing merchandise at you for featured spots and reviews. Arrangements and direct interaction with Media Relations staff as well as follow-up with B-Roll footage is offered to the client as a courtesy so the firm/corporation to see how we've placed the product and certainly, the highlighted features and benefits. This new entertainment highlights start-up "Toys for Grown-Ups" features eye-candy for our 18-34 market. Saturated with the newest gadgets and technological innovations coupled with exciting entertainment highlights, interviews and exclusive themed travel and technology segments, "Toys for Grown-Ups" is poised as the liaison between wanting the best and knowing what the best is. We decided during the initial inception and merge of the show that we like to highlight the finer points of a product and discuss features and benefits that may differ from a similar innovation or model.  We aren’t a team that highlights what they don’t like about a product.  Who wants to watch a gadget review/travel bashing show? “Jerry Springer guests review the new iPad?

Specialties & ExpertiseDr. Michael Nichols has the following 7 areas of expertise,  1 specialty and 1 board certification.                     Family Medicine
    A family practitioner is a doctor who specializes in caring for people of all ages, at all stages of life. Rather than focusing on the treatment of one disease or patient population, family practitioners are often the doctors that people see for their everyday ailments, like cold and flu or respiratory infections, and health screenings. When necessary, family practitioners will provide referrals for conditions that require the expertise of another specialist.


    The doctors may also provide physicals, inoculations, prenatal care, treat chronic diseases, like diabetes and asthma, and provide advice on disease prevention.
