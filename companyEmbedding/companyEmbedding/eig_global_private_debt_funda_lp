* This undertaking does not affect any limits Section 102(a) of the National Securities Markets
Improvement Act of 1996 ("NSMIA") [Pub. L. No. 104-290, 110 Stat. 3416 (Oct. 11, 1996)] imposes on the ability of States to
require information. As a result, if the securities that are the subject of this Form D are "covered securities" for purposes
of NSMIA, whether in all instances or due to the nature of the offering that is the subject of this Form D, States cannot
routinely require offering materials under this undertaking or otherwise and can require offering materials only to the
extent NSMIA permits them to do so under NSMIA's preservation of their anti-fraud authority.

EIG and The Noble Group (“Noble”), have joined together to form a new company, Harbour Energy, Ltd. (“Harbour”), which focuses on making control and near control investments in upstream and midstream companies, primarily outside of the United States. Harbour operates at the confluence of three major trends in the global energy industry – new sources of supply, changing trade patterns and changes in the commodity trading industry causing traditional financial intermediaries to exit and independent physical energy trading houses to gain in importance. Harbour is entirely managed by EIG but benefits from Noble’s industry leading expertise in energy trading, logistics and risk management.






CREDIT/DIRECT LENDING

Since 2001, EIG's credit/direct lending vehicles have targeted higher credit quality project finance instruments. These vehicles provide senior and high yield loans to energy and infrastructure projects and companies on a global basis. EIG believes that an ability to make senior, longer duration investments provides a competitive advantage, given that many energy and infrastructure assets have long useful lives and often are supported by stable, contracted cash flows.

Triloma Financial Group and EIG Global Energy Partners have launched Triloma EIG Global Energy Fund, a  joint venture that will invest in energy debt. Triloma Energy Advisors and EIG Credit Management Company will manage the fund.
PRESS RELEASE
ORLANDO, Fla. and WASHINGTON, Feb. 23, 2015 /PRNewswire/ — Triloma Financial Group (“Triloma”) and EIG Global Energy Partners (“EIG”) today announced the formation of Triloma EIG Global Energy Fund (the “Fund”), an unlisted investment company that will invest primarily in a global portfolio of privately originated energy company and project debt. The Fund will be managed by Triloma Energy Advisors and EIG Credit Management Company, and will seek to raise capital with the issuance of common stock through a best effort, continuous public offering with Triloma Securities, member FINRA/SIPC, serving as the managing dealer.
“Our creation of this Fund with EIG represents a significant milestone in Triloma’s strategy of identifying unique alternative investment opportunities and creating longstanding joint ventures with experienced and proven investment partners,” said Larry Goff, Chief Executive Officer of Triloma Securities. “Partnering with EIG allows us to provide individual investors with unparalleled access to energy investment opportunities with one of the oldest and preeminent energy investors in the world.” 





“The energy sector is a voracious consumer of capital and is tailor-made for specialists like EIG that can provide privately-negotiated financial solutions,” said R. Blair Thomas, Chief Executive Officer of EIG. “Current market volatility only serves to increase the opportunity set as generalists exit the space and companies find themselves with funding gaps caused by lower commodity prices and commercial banks pulling back due to regulatory and market pressure. Our 33-years of experience in this space give us confidence that now is an attractive time to create the Fund to take advantage of current market dynamics. Triloma’s team has a strong distribution and asset management platform and extensive experience with publicly registered investment programs, and will allow us to attract a broader range of investors to our platform.”
Barry Goff, Managing Director of Triloma, said: “We believe energy companies and projects are underserved by traditional sources of financing. In order to take full advantage of the current market environment, it is essential to have experience investing across many commodity cycles and the in-house technical capabilities necessary to successfully navigate the complexities in the energy sector. EIG’s experience and expertise will allow us to take advantage of investment opportunities throughout the energy value chain on a global basis.”
About Triloma EIG Global Energy Fund
Triloma EIG Global Energy Fund (the “Fund”) is an unlisted investment company that will primarily invest in a global portfolio of privately originated energy company and project debt. Its investment objective will be to provide shareholders with current income, capital preservation and, to a lesser extent, long term capital appreciation. The Fund will be managed by Triloma Energy Advisors and EIG Credit Management Company, and will offer individuals an opportunity to invest in U.S. and non-U.S. energy companies and projects in many instances alongside institutional investors. Investments will be made through a series of feeder funds each of which will invest substantially all of the net proceeds its raises from its public offering in the Fund. 





About Triloma
Triloma Financial Group is a leading private investment management firm providing individuals with unique alternative investment opportunities. Its business is organized primarily into investment management and capital markets activities. Triloma manages and sponsors a group of private and publicly-offered investment programs focused on private equity, real estate and energy investments.
