Dave Cox
                            Entrepreneur in Residence                          

David J. “Dave” Cox, Vice President, U.S. Sales, EndoArterial, Peripheral Vascular, was responsible until April of 2016 for leading the U.S. EndoArterial sales organization, as well as Sales Operations and Sales Training. Dave oversaw the development and execution of the strategy for the EndoArterial business, which included a robust portfolio of devices for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis and peripheral arterial disease. The sales force was comprised of four Area Directors, twenty three District Managers, one hundred sixty five Sales Representatives, and eighty six Clinical Specialist, generating $465m in annual sales. In CY15 revenues grew 20% in a US market growing 5-7%. The growth was fueled by the launch of IN.PACT ADMIRAL, the second drug coated angioplasty balloon for the treatment of PAD, stocked in the first year in just over 1400 hospitals that generated sales of over $70m. In parallel, Dave took Direct Distribution expense down from 32% of revenues to 20% over the course of 3 years through increasing revenues and opportunistic sales force re-modeling.
Dave joined Medtronic through the acquisition of Covidien (2015) that had previously acquired ev3 (2010), and was with the Company for 17 years. Most recently, Dave also served as leader of the U.S. EndoVenous sales team, in addition to his responsibilities in leading the commercial efforts of the U.S. EndoArterial franchise. The EndoVenous sales team consisted of 80 field persons and generated $120m in revenue. Prior to this, he served as South Zone Vice President of Sales for both the EndoArterial and EndoVenous U.S. businesses, and earned back-to-back President’s Club recognition in 2011 and 2012.
He has held several leadership roles within the organizations throughout his tenure, including Regional Sales Manager, Area Sales Director and Senior Director of Corporate Accounts. Dave has a solid track record of building high performance teams, strategic decision making and driving a high level of accountability to deliver on objectives.
Dave has garnered more than 25 years of experience in sales and sales management of highly technical products. Prior to Medtronic, Dave served in positions of increasing responsibility within the medical device and pharmaceutical industries, including roles at Centocor, Inc., Boehringer Mannheim Co. and Allergan Pharmaceuticals.
Since leaving Medtronic in April 2017, Dave has recently completed a year of full time consulting role to NebuPure Healthcare, a WaterTech Holdings company, both very early stage pre-commercial companies. Both are focused on further development of a proprietary air disinfecting system for healthcare spaces, as well as other spaces, where HAIs and CAI’s are a threat. Dave was involved in platform form factor build out, testing to include EPA registration, and developing the commercial “go to market” strategy.
Dave has also just been named a Board Advisory and Mentor for the Charleston Device Initiative (CMDi), a joint venture between the Medical University of South Carolina and MedTech Catalyst, to assist in evaluating new technologies for funding and early stage commercial strategy mentoring post funding.
Dave holds two bachelor’s degrees in Business Administration, in Marketing and Production Management, as well as a minor in Economics, from James Madison University.

Dr. William Cohn has been awarded over twenty patents for his medical devices which help surgeons operate on a beating heart, a task thought to be impossible for many years. A native Houstonian, he graduated from Baylor College of Medicine in 1986 and was recruited to Boston’s Beth-Israel Hospital where he focused on minimally invasive surgery. Dr. Cohn creates procedures and devices to minimize the invasiveness of heart surgery and uses new techniques that avoid the employment of the heart-lung machine, thereby allowing the heart to continue beating during surgery and reducing the risk to the patient. In Spring of 2004, Dr. Cohn returned to Houston to join the renowned Texas Heart Institute at St. Luke’s Episcopal Hospital as well as the faculty at Baylor College of Medicine. Today he continues his clinical research activity at the Texas Heart Institute and St. Luke’s Episcopal Hospital, where he is serving as Director of Minimally Invasive Surgical Technology and Co-Director of the Cardiovascular Research Laboratories.

COURT OF APPEALS OF TEXAS, FOURTEENTH DISTRICT, HOUSTON




14-13-01066-CV




Kem Thompson Frost






                                      	The trial court dismissed shareholder claims based on a Delaware forum-selection clause. The shareholders' claims all arise out of alleged non-contractual, general obligations imposed by law rather than out of the shareholders agreement. If, under applicable law, the claims a plaintiff asserts are not within the scope of a forum-selection clause, the existence of unasserted claims that are within the scope of this clause does not cause the asserted claims to fall within the scope of the clause. The trial court’s dismissal is reversed and remanded. SHELDON v. PINTO TECHNOLOGY VENTURES, L.P., Houston’s 14th Court of Appeals, No. 14-13-01066-CV, 9/10/15.
