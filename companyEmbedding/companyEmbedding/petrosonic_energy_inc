Welcome toPetrosonic Energy
The primary focus of Petrosonic Energy is to provide technologies that upgrade heavy oil economically and in an environmentally friendly manner.  Petrosonic's patented SonoprocessTM  does just that.  It uses clean tech sonic energy to de-asphalt heavy oil at a much smaller scale, lower capital and operating costs than conventional upgraders and at lower costs than blending operations that use diluent to transport the heavy crude via pipelines. SonoprocessTM eliminates the use of diluent for heavy oil producers thus reducing their production costs considerably and it can decongest the pipeline capacity by 1/3rd by replacing diluent. The processing capacity of the Sonoprocess can be increased modularly, thus, benefiting all heavy oil producers, small and large, as well as, pipeline, storage and refining companies.

Petrosonic has developed, tested and validated its core technology through a reputable independent engineering firm. The company also has recently developed a proprietary solution that enables the Sonoprocess to use lpg/propane as solvents which are widely available and much cheaper than other solvents previously used. The new solution de-risks the technology further and improves the net returns considerably.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.      Short Interest ()   N/A      ?    Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.
