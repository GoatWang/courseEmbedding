USA PATRIOT Act:  Foreign Banking Clients and Customer Identification Program In response to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the US Congress passed the USA PATRIOT Act.  Parts of this Act apply to the financial services industry and require certain financial institutions to request specific information from foreign banks on a “certification” form.  Also as part of the USA PATRIOT Act and to assist in the government’s fight against terrorist financing and money laundering, SGAS is required to obtain and verify information about the identity of our clients.  Because of this, when you open an account at SGAS, we will ask for information that will allow us to confirm your identity or the identity of your corporation, partnership or other entity.  This process may include a request to see to your driver’s license, passport, corporate papers or other identifying documents.
