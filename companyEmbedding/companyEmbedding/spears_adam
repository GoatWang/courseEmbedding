JOIN THE LISTClickFIND A STORELost In Translation: Rediscovering The Hebrew Roots Of Our Faithby Klein, John/ Spears, Adam/ Christopher, MichaelDespite the sensational nature of its subject, Lost in Translation: Rediscovering the Hebrew Roots of our Faith is written in simple, clear, rational language that relies 100 percent on the Bible as the ultimate authority. The book s authors clear away centuries of confusion surrounding subjects that are seldom addressed in modern sermons and Bible studies. Using the ancient Hebrew language and culture, the authors clarify many of the Bible's so-called mysteries and help the reader rediscover many of the foundational truths that have been lost in translation. Topics include: Who is the Bride of Messiah? Is there a difference between covenant and testament? Israel: Who are they really? What is the difference between devils, demons, and nephilim? Join us on an exciting adventure to rediscover the treasures still buried within the pages of The Book that reveal the pathway to the heart of God. A must-read for the church! Providing foundational insights which lead to a greater understanding of God's master plan, this book will open your eyes to scriptural distortions due to the centuries of Greek influence on the church. Corey Berti, Senior Pastor, Silver Valley Worship Center, ID I've been a believer for 12 years, and I've read numerous scriptures that didn't make sense. The authors do a tremendous job of explaining the importance of understanding our Hebrew roots which provide context and clarity to the overall theme of God's message. It's like watching TV in black and white and then suddenly seeing it in color. The truth hasn't changed, but it's meaning becomes more vivid.

Britney Spears' 'Hold It Against Me' Video: A Product Placement Roundup

COMMENTS













It's not quite the spot-the-product-placement game that Lady Gaga and Beyoncé's "Telephone" video was, but if you watch the new video for Britney Spears' "Hold it Against Me" and you'll definitely spot more than one.Not surprisingly, since Spears is signed to Sony Music, Sony products are prominent: There are numerous shots of Sony TVs and monitors (Spears looks into one as she browses online dating site Plenty Of Fish), and few up-close shots of the Sony logo that end up somewhere in the gray area between brand placement and subliminal advertising.    Britney Spears' 'Hold It Against Me' Video: Hot Or Not?   The video also has close-ups of Make Up Forever brand of eye shadow (Aqua Cream #2, for those of you keeping score at home) and Spears' Radiance brand of fragrance. And, as already mentioned, Plenty Of Fish is conspicuously seen in the video. According to a New York Times article, Plenty Of Fish paid for its placement in the video. The placement was arranged by the Kluger Agency, whose chief executive Adam Kluger told the Times to his knowledge Plenty of Fish is the only paid placement in the video. Britney Spears' 10 Best Music Videos: Readers Poll ResultsOf course, it should be noted that Spears is signed to Sony Music. It's also notable that "Hold It Against Me" director Jonas Akerlund also directed the product-heavy video for Lady Gaga's "Telephone," which also featured Plenty Of Fish.
