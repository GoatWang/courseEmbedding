               Soledad Mountain            







The Soledad Mountain Project (the “Project”) is a gold-silver project located is located 5 miles south of the town of Mojave in Kern County, southern California. The Project uses conventional open pit mining methods and the cyanide heap leach and Merrill-Crowe processes to recover gold and silver from crushed, agglomerated ore.Gold and silver production is projected to average approximately 74k oz and 781k oz respectively per year although this is expected to fluctuate from year to year depending upon the ore head grades. Gold and silver production is projected to be 807k oz of gold and 8.3MM oz of silver over a period of ~11 years. ✲Access to site is from State Route 14 and an existing paved County road. A power line crosses the property boundary and the Union-Pacific railroad lines parallel State Route 14 within ~1 mile of the Project. The primary water supply for the Project is also located within a mile of site.Highlights of the February 2015 feasibility study, calculated on 100% basis, include: ✲Life-of-mine average annual gold production of 74k oz and silver production of 781k oz during full production Years 2-11;First quartile total cash costs net of by-products of US$518/oz of gold (including royalties, California fees, property taxes, off-site refining charges and reclamation financial assurance) and of US$558/oz of gold including sustaining capital costs;11-yr mine life;After-tax net present value of US$214MM (5% discount rate);**After-tax internal rate of return of 28.3%;**Utilization of a high-pressure grinding roll (the “HPGR”) to size and prepare ore particles for heap leaching (see below for benefits) andStrong project economics with only 65% of the resource included in the feasibility study*Base case gold price of US$1250/oz and silver price of US$17.00/oz** Net of $25.4MM of capital expenditures spent prior to December 31, 2014The primary ore types that will be mined are rhyolite porphyry and flow-banded rhyolite, pyroclastics and quartz latite porphyry representing approximately 70%, 10% and 20% of the ore tonnage respectively. Minor quantities of siliceous vein material (0.1%) will also be mined. The rock types will be found in different areas and at various stages of the mine life. The primary rock types are of extrusive volcanic origin and are quite similar in chemical composition and are high in silica with little or no clay.The crushing-screening plant includes a primary and secondary crusher and screen in closed circuit with the secondary crusher. The HPGR is used as part of the crushing-screening circuit to prepare the ore particles for stacking on the two leach pads.The HPGR consists of two counter-rotating rolls - one fixed roll and a ‘floating’ roll. The ‘floating’ roll is mounted on and can move freely on two slides and the grinding forces are applied by four hydraulic rams. Ore is choke-fed to the gap between the rolls.Assessments carried out by two HPGR manufacturers, third party technical consultants, and Company management have indicated that benefits of using the HPGR could include:Higher gold and silver recoveries due to the formation of micro-cracks in ore particles;Faster gold and silver extraction rates;Stronger agglomerates due to a more favorable overall particle size distribution and this will also impact the flow rate of solutions through the heap;Lower capital costs than a four-stage, conventional crushing-screening plant;Manageable dust control with fewer transfer points;Lower energy consumption and thus lower operating costs andCircuit flexibility that will readily permit future upgrades such as a finer HPGR feed size or the recycle of edge product

Aggregate Potential 

Golden Queen Mining proposes an aggregate and construction materials business that will be developed once the heap leach operation is in full production, based on the location of the Project in southern California with close proximity to major highways and railway lines. The California Department of Transportation projects aggregate demand of approximately 13 million tons per year for the area surrounding Palmdale, Lancaster, and Rosamond and less than 27% of this demand can be met from existing permitted resources. Similarly, estimates suggests that demand from the area surrounding Bakersfield is approximately 5 million tons per year for the next 50 years, and less than 46% of this demand can be met from existing permitted resources. California updated its analysis of permitted aggregate reserves compared with 50-year projected aggregate demand in 2012. The analysis is available at:  www.consrv.ca.gov/cgs/information/publications/ms/Documents/MS_52.pdf, and the accompanying map of aggregate supply and demand centers is available at:  www.conservation.ca.gov/cgs/information/publications/ms/Documents/MS_52_2012.pdf Senate Bill 420 was affected in 2006 to recognize the need for local sources of aggregate in California. Senate Bill 420 requires the California Department of Transportation to use recycled aggregates in State paving projects where economical. In this instance, the waste rock from the Project would constitute a recycled waste product consistent with Senate Bill 420. 

Aggregate Production from Waste Rock 

Research suggests that up to 1 million tons of waste rock could be sold into the southern California aggregates market annually. The source of raw materials will be quality waste rock stockpiled on a level pad east of the East Pit. The waste rock can be classified into a range of products such as riprap, crushed stone, and sand with little further processing. Every effort will be made to proceed with processing of the waste rock as early in the life of the mine as possible and it is expected that this can proceed shortly after the start of pre-production mining. Closing reclamation of the facilities required for the processing of waste rock, including the storage pad, will remain the Company’s responsibility. 

An Economic Advantage 

There are three key elements that should create advantages for the Company as an aggregate producer:

The run-of-mine waste rock and sand will be produced as a by-product from a mining operation. This should give the Project an economic advantage as an aggregate producer in comparison with producers that have to mine rock or obtain sand from alluvial deposits to produce aggregate.
Available infrastructure on site will have an important impact on the cost of producing aggregate and shipping aggregate or final products to market.
It has become difficult to obtain permits for new quarry developments in southern California. The Project has its permits in place and this should be a distinct advantage for an aggregate producer that wishes to work with the Company as a sub-contractor on site or as partner in a bulk concrete products facility on site.
It is important to note that no contributions from the sale of aggregate products will be included in the cash flow projections until long-term contracts for the sales of products are secured.

✲ This is forward-looking information and includes risks and assumptions. Click here to see our statement on forward-looking information.
 

In the Community 

Golden Queen is committed to the community of Mojave and is a longtime supporter of charitable, business and economic development activities in the region. The Company maintains memberships and involvement in multiple organizations including revitalization efforts focused on the town of Mojave.
In addition, the Company has invested over half a million dollars to date in the cleanup of the northern slopes of Soledad Mountain. An extraordinary amount of illegal dumping and remnants from historical mining operations have been removed from the area since 2006.

The Company is proud of its long history in California’s eastern Kern County and looks forward to benefiting the region’s economy for many more years to come.

Summary of Information on a Passive Foreign Investment Company or PFIC 

Golden Queen Mining Co. Ltd. is classified as a passive foreign 
investment company, or PFIC, which will subject our U.S. investors to 
adverse tax rules.Based upon our analysis of our assets as at December 31, 2012 and income
 for the year 2012, we were a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes 
during 2012. We have substantial passive assets in the form of cash and 
cash equivalents, and can provide no assurance that we will not continue
 to remain a PFIC in 2013 and beyond. The determination of whether or 
not we continue to be a PFIC would principally be based upon:
The composition of our assets, the amount of which will depend, in 
part, on our total net assets and the market value of our Treasury 
portfolio, which is subject to change;  and 
The proportion of our revenue that is passive income.We have limited control over these variables. To the extent we do have 
control over these variables, we may take steps to reduce the material 
and adverse effect that our PFIC classification may have on our share 
price. Further, we may consider additional capital markets or corporate 
financing transactions in the future. Should we proceed with such 
offerings, we cannot, at this stage, comment with certainty on timing, 
amounts or particular uses of net proceeds. Depending upon the usage of 
such net proceeds, we could continue to remain a PFIC. Since we are a 
PFIC, U.S. investors are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding 
the application of the PFIC rules to their particular circumstances.

               Approvals & Permits            







Golden Queen Mining has secured all key mining approvals and permits. 

Land Use - Conditional Use Permits 

The Kern County Planning Commission unanimously approved the Project at its regularly scheduled meeting in Bakersfield on April 8, 2010. All appeals that were subsequently filed against the Commission’s decision were withdrawn and the decision made by the Planning Commission was final in 2010. The Bureau of Land Management confirmed that its Record of Decision approving the Plan of Operations under NEPA in November 1997 also remains valid.The State of California introduced backfilling requirements for certain types of open pit metal mines in December 2002. Norwest has prepared life-of-mine waste rock management plans and these plans incorporate sequential backfilling of mined-out phases of the open pit with limited double-handling of waste rock at the end of the mine life.The Company announced that the Kern County Planning and Community Development Department approved the additional information submitted by the Company in regards to Condition 107 of the Conditional Use Permits for the Project in a news release on July 12, 2012.Under Condition 107 of the Conditional Use Permits, the Company was required to submit, prior to the commencement of mining, additional information relating to closure and closing reclamation for the Project. The Company submitted the required information to the Planning Department on November 28, 2011 and again on June 8, 2012. In accordance with the Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975, the Planning Department consulted the State Department of Conservation/Office of Mine Reclamation (the “OMR”). The OMR confirmed in a letter to the Planning Department dated June 29, 2012 that the information provided by the Company adequately demonstrated compliance with Condition 107.  

Water Quality - Waste Discharge Requirements 

The Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board unanimously approved 
Waste Discharge Requirements and a Monitoring and Reporting Program for 
the Project at a public hearing held in South Lake Tahoe on July 14, 
2010. The Executive Officer subsequently signed the Board Order and this
 is now in effect. 

Air Quality - Authority to Construct and Permit to Operate 

The Air Quality and Health Risk Assessment for the Project was completed and submitted to the Kern County Planning Department and the Eastern Kern Air Pollution Control District, EKAPCD on July 21, 2009. This study was approved by Kern County Planning Commission on April 8, 2010, as part of the certification of the Supplemental Environmental Impact Report.Ten applications for Authority to Construct permits were submitted to the EKAPCD in February 2011. The EKAPCD confirmed that the information required to support the applications was complete. The draft Authority to Construct permits were received in September 2011. The Company’s consulting engineers and legal counsel completed their review of the draft Authority to Construct permits in January 2012. EKAPCD issued the Authority to Construct permits on February 8, 2012.The Authority to Construct permits will be converted to a Permit to Operate after construction has been completed and subject to inspection by EKAPCD.

	limitation, risks and uncertainties regarding: accidents, equipment breakdowns; changes in planned work resulting from logistical,
	technical or other factors; that results of operations on the Project will not meet projected expectations due to any combination

	our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. Investors are cautioned that forward-looking statements are

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

About This Report




It's long been thought that huge profits on metals can only come from the big mining companies. After all, they have the most money and best mines to get the most gold.
But what if there was a better way to cash in on these big gains?
You can with junior miners!
And soon, everyone will catch on and want their piece of the action.
You see, no one is really paying attention to these “little brothers” right now... But you should be.
The whole sector has been beaten down for years. That’s why there’s so much potential with the junior miners. They have much more room for growth, opening up the possibility of triple-digit gains!
Plus, they have the opportunity to pile on the profits through acquisitions.
The bigger miners have been scoping out their juniors for a while now, and they’re starting to acquire them in order to keep their operations going.
This means large jumps in juniors’ stock prices and large gains for their investors.
Recently, some miners being acquired saw increases of 110% to 198%
We don’t know how long the ones left will continue to be overlooked, or how long the potential for these huge, triple-digit gains will be around.
That’s why we created this special report: “The Top Three Junior Gold Miners for 2017.” 
Inside it, you’ll get the scoop on three small mining stocks that are jam-packed with growth potential... plus, our “go-to” checklist: the three most important things to look for in a junior mining company.
Simply enter your email address above to join Energy & Resource Digest, and we’ll send you this report absolutely free.
Don’t miss out on these junior miners. The opening for triple-digit gains may not last much longer.
