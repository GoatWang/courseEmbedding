San Antonio, TX – August 19-21, 2017
First Steps to Success
You just have to experience it.
 












Meet the broke, homeless cocktail waitress who turned millionaire in 2 short years.
Everyone has a unique life story to share — but initially, Dani Johnson’s looked pretty bleak, made up of hardships and challenge.
Dani grew up on welfare in a violently abusive and drug-infested home. She was emotionally, physically, verbally and sexually abused on a regular basis. The personal trauma and violent conditions that Dani identified as home were all she knew. Consequently, she was pregnant at 17 and homeless at 21. Instead of accepting what life had so far scripted for her, Dani rewrote her own playbook, chapter by chapter — and by 23, she was a millionaire. In the years since, Dani Johnson has become a multi-millionaire many times over and owns multiple companies with her business partner and husband Hans, who is a best-selling author, internationally sought-after speaker and radio show host. She’s also a mother of 5 and grandmother of 8 (and counting).







As she continues to learn and grow, Dani invites you along for the journey, willing to teach you everything she has learned to have a smokin’ hot marriage with her husband, 5 of the most honorable & visionary kids, a TON of cash stored up, NO debt, workplace domination and the freedom to do what she wants when she wants!

Do You Want…

Workplace domination
Unshackling from debt
More cash

Honorable kids






This isn’t talk. It’s a step-by-step formula that radically transforms every area of your life.
At First Steps To Success, multi-millionaire, wife & mom, Dani Johnson, will equip you with simple strategies to see immediate change in your life. She will transfer her success skill to you through this unique and experiential learning event!

You will leave this event ready to get results.
Many take what they’ve learned and scale their businesses, land jobs, get promotions and bonuses, improve their relationships and increase their influence from this dynamic training. Many use these new skills to overcome obstacles that have held them captive for a lifetime. No matter what you do with it, you can be sure that you’ll be equipped to succeed beyond your wildest dreams, while bringing others along with you for the journey.

Here’s what will happen in your life afterFirst Steps To Success…






Workplace Domination
We’re talking bonuses, promotions and raises galore. You’re the top performer in your career. But instead of everyone HATING you because of it, they’ll actually be excited for you, cheer you on and want to be like you, which will just boost your influence over that place even more.








Unshackling From Debt
You’re free! You wake up each morning, feeling light and excited for your day. No longer are debt collectors nagging you to pay what you owe. You can make decisions without the guilt of knowing you owe people money. You owe NOTHING to ANYBODY. You’re free to live your life.





More Cash
Instead of it slipping through your fingers, you’ll know exactly what to do to make your cash stick around and grow. You’re blown away every day by how much money you’re able to save, even though your income hasn’t increased. (But then again, based on history, that is likely to happen, too.)


Honorable Kids
They’ll go from bratty, out-of-control monsters to poster children. Seriously, you’ll be able to take an uninterrupted shower… They’ll gladly help around the house. You can actually take them out to public places with full confidence that they’ll behave and you’ll enjoy yourself.








A Smokin’ Hot Marriage
Your marriage will go from dull and full of arguments to steamy, passionate and full of you-know-what. 😉 You won’t be able to get enough of each other… Instead of dreading the times you’re in the same room, your favorite time of day will be seeing your spouse.

Here’s a quick breakdown of each day:

First Steps to Success
It’s time to ease two of your highest frustration points: finances and relationships. Dani will show you how to create and protect your wealth and stop clashing with the people in your life. Some topics we’ll cover are:

Declare war on your debt, and pay it all off (including your mortgage) in 5-7 years with your current level of income
Relieve the tension in your relationships at home and at work 
Discover the 4 personalities — who you are and who the people around you are.

Johnson & Johnson verdict: Can talcum powder really cause cancer?

Last Updated May 3, 2016 8:20 AM EDT

When a St. Louis jury awarded $72 million to the family of a woman who died from ovarian cancer, which she claimed was caused by using Johnson & Johnson talcum powder, it prompted many questions about just how safe such products really are.Jackie Fox of Birmingham, Alabama, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in March 2013 and died last October. Her civil suit, which was taken over by her son Marvin Salter after her death, was decided in February 2016 and was part of a broader claim in St. Louis Circuit Court involving nearly 60 people.The suit claimed the talc in Johnson & Johnson's iconic Baby Powder and Shower to Shower led Fox to develop cancer after several decades of use for feminine hygiene.In a similar case in May, a jury ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay $55 million to a South Dakota woman who said the company's talcum powder caused her to develop ovarian cancer.A naturally-occurring mineral, talc is mainly made up of the elements magnesium, silicon, and oxygen. It's widely used in cosmetics and personal care products to absorb moisture, cut down on friction, prevent caking, and improve the product's feel.In its natural form, talc can sometimes contain asbestos, which is known to cause cancers in and around the lungs when inhaled. But all talcum products sold in the U.S. have not contained asbestos since the 1970's.The evidence around asbestos-free talcum products and cancer risk is more unclear.The American Cancer Society notes that research looking at the potential link between talcum powder and ovarian cancer is mixed. Some studies report a slightly increased risk in women who reported using talcum powder in the genital area, while other studies found no increased risk at all.Experts say some of the studies that found a small increase in risk may not be highly accurate because they relied on a person's memory of talc use many years earlier. Dr. Francisco Xynos, a gynecologic oncologist at SSM Health St. Mary's Hospital in St. Louis, told CBS affiliate KMOX that the scientific evidence of a cancer link is weak."I think the concern for the general population should be negligible, because there is no scientific proof of that," Xynos said.The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), which is part of the World Health Organization, classifies genital use of talcum-based body powder as "possibly carcinogenic to humans."The American Cancer Society says more research is needed on the topic.At the trial in Fox's case, Dr. Daniel Cramer, Director of the OB/GYN Epidemiology Center at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, and an expert who testified for the plaintiff, said he conducted his own study that shows an increased risk of ovarian cancer with talcum powder use. "I think the link is a persuasive one," Cramer told CBS Boston. "There have been more than 20 epidemiologic studies and a majority of these have found an elevated risk, and when you combine those risks into a single estimate, it is highly significant."Fox's attorneys also introduced into evidence a September 1997 internal letter from a Johnson & Johnson medical consultant suggesting that denying the risks could mean that "... the talc industry will be perceived by the public like it perceives the cigarette industry: denying the obvious in the face of all evidence to the contrary.""They made a conscious decisions not to warn the customers they were using a very dangerous product," said Jere Beasley, a lawyer for the family.The St. Louis jury determined that Fox was entitled to $10 million in actual damages and $62 million in punitive damages. (Lawyers note that such large monetary awards are often reduced on appeal.)"The whole fight was not just for her but so many other women and that's why I continue this fight," Fox's son, Marvin Salter, said.Johnson & Johnson said in a statement that it sympathizes with Fox's family, but it maintains that the verdict "goes against decades of sound science proving the safety of talc as a cosmetic ingredient in multiple products."The company said it would appeal.

When it comes to bath time, your baby has special needs. Learn how to wash your baby safely and effectively while enjoying this bonding time.

Freshening Between Your Baby’s Baths

As your baby grows, she’ll start to explore more, which means she’ll make more of a mess. Too many baths may dry out her skin, so what can you do to keep her clean in between? 









Keep baby clean between baths

Review Text: 

Well... this little "golden shampoo" helps more than just babies... it helps adults. I am a gold prospector and I run a big group in California of gold prospectors. The first time I got a sty in my eye from the dirt in the field, my doctor told me about Johnson's Baby Shampoo and how it would help heal the sty. Washing with the shampoo, my sty cleared in two days!!! The initial medication I got from the doctors never worked. Now when I feel a sty coming on... I just wash my eyes with it and a little warm water. And it goes away. I also cleanse my face with it now since my Grandmother told me its all she's used for a long time and she had beautiful skin. (She passed last year.) I wish I can get enough of the travel size bottles to pass one out to every miner at our meeting. That would be awesome.
Thank you for saving my eyes!!!

Review Text: 

The Johnson's Baby shampoo found is stores 3 years ago, the ones not marked with the words 'conditioners' left the hair dry and full.
This Johnson's Baby shampoo found this year (2017) is marked "improved formula" and is usually sold as 'original formula online. It has conditioners and leaves hair silky and shiny and slicked down, close to the head.
The true original does not have such conditioning effect, thus it leaves the hair greatly more full bodied and textured. A much different look !
I do not like this 'improved formula' version of Johnsons Baby shampoo, not at all.

Review Text: 

Monty enjoys his bath, although he's a cute little dog... he's even much more handsome after cleaning up. The Baby Shampoo is a great alternative to others on the market. It's gentle on his coat and on our wallet. You should check with you vet because not all might agree, but in Monty's case it's OK every few weeks.

I have used Johnson's Baby Shampoo for years. My 80 year old mom does as well. Up until now.
The new "improved" formula removed one ingredient and replaced with upwards of 5 ingredients now...
Both my mom and me are now experiencing burning eyes when using this product...
We will no longer use after many, many years...
Very disappointed with this product, from someone we have trusted for some time...

Why Choose JOHNSON’S®?







For Every Little Wonder
Commitment to a Healthy Planet



Our Mission
Our mission is simple: to create the best baby care products in the world.
It's important to us that babies and their families have access to products that are safe, rigorously tested, environmentally-friendly, and created specifically to care for a baby’s unique needs. Each choice we make is deeply rooted in research and love, from concept to shelf.
Your baby’s needs are our priority and inspiration. And we're dedicated to making a better, safer world for all our families.












Testimonials





One of my favorite projects at JOHNSON’S® was studying babies’ eyes – how they develop, what makes them different from adult eyes, and how to take care of them. My specific role is to clinically evaluate products, which, for us, always starts with understanding babies. We do that work like no other company.
I used JOHNSON’S® products for all my babies. My youngest still doesn’t always close his eyes in the shower, so he still uses JOHNSON’S® baby shampoo!
Neena Tierny Associate Director, Fellow Global R&D Johnson & Johnson Consumer & Personal Products WorldwideMother of three - one girl and two boys.















Our Background
We know you spend a lot of time researching the products you use for your baby. That's why we invest so much time in testing them - so you can trust them. Our scientists, many whom are parents themselves, examine every ingredient and combination in the bottle against real life scenarios, so you can feel confident you're only getting the best. JOHNSON’S®:

Understanding Meets Caring
A baby’s needs are different than our own. Each sense, from sight to touch, plays a much bigger role than you might expect. JOHNSON’S® cares best for babies because we understand what makes them special: we've been pioneering baby research and setting global standards in baby skin care for more than 125 years. Scroll down to explore the baby science that drives everything we do.













 



Sight


■Babies’ eyes continue to develop after birth, making sight the last sense to fully develop


■Eye contact is key for social development


■Newborns can only focus their eyes at 8 to 12 inches (the distance to your face when you're cradling or feeding)


■Babies blink 2 to 5 times per minute in their first year, so their eyes are more vulnerable to irritation












 



Touch


■Physical contact is a baby's first emotional bond, and is key for emotional and intellectual development


■Skin is the first line of defense against toxins, irritants, and allergens


■Baby's skin is up to 30% thinner and more sensitive than adults


■Skin needs to remain hydrated to stay strong. Ensuring proper hydration can be greatly helped with daily lotion or oil












 



Scent


■Scent goes from nose to brain and can be a powerful influence on emotion and memory


■Babies are able to smell before they're born


■Enjoyable and familiar scents improve mood, calmness, and alertness


■Mother's scent can help stop baby from crying


■In a study, babies bathed with a fragranced bath product engaged 30% more with with their mothers after bath, compared to babies in a non-fragranced bath












 



Sleep


■Parents around the world report that getting baby to sleep is a common struggle


■To study baby sleep, we partnered with Dr. Jodi Mindell from Saint Joseph's University and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia


■Dr. Mindell is a leading pediatric sleep expert - and together, we developed a solution to help your little one (and you) get more sleep.


■Our 3-step BEDTIME™ routine has been proven to help babies fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer, and reduce awakenings during the night:

1. Warm Bath
2. Baby Massage
3. Quiet Time
