FerriSSD


White Paper
Product Brief


The FerriSSD® is designed optimally for a wide range of embedded applications requiring faster access, small form factor and reliable SATA/PATA interface storage. By combining Silicon Motion (SMI)'s proprietary industry proven controller technology, NAND flash and passive components into a single BGA package, FerriSSD® simplifies design efforts, reduces time-to-market while protecting from NAND technology migration concerns. FerriSSD® also comes with advanced firmware features as well as the provision for customized firmware – enabling highly reliable and differentiable storage solutions.





Key Features
End to End Data Path Protection
SMI’s FerriSSDs incorporate full data error detection with recovery engines to provide enhanced data integrity throughout the entire Host-to-NAND-to-Host data path. The FerriSSD® data recovery algorithm can effectively detect any error in the SSD data path, including hardware (i.e. ASIC) errors, firmware errors and memory errors arising in SRAM, DRAM or NAND.




NANDXtend™ ECC Engine
Conventional SSDs employ standard BCH and RS ECC (error correction coding) engines for initiate first-level correction using NAND shift-read-retries. In addition to this first-level error correction, FerriSSDs also implement a highly efficient second-level correction scheme using an LDPC (low-density parity check) code and a Group page RAID algorithm (a highly efficient redundant backup) to reduce potential dPPM at customer site while extending the service life of SSD.




IntelligentScan and DataRefresh to Enhance Data Integrity
SMI’s proprietary IntelligentScan function will activate automatically to scan recharge, repair or retire the cell block (DataRefresh) according to the host behavior and working environment (eg. ambient temperature). As a result of the combination of IntelligentScan and DataRefresh, FerriSSD® can effective prolong its service life much beyond typical NAND specifications.

Silicon Motion Technology Corp. Beats Estimates, Shares Surge
Silicon Motion exceeded analyst estimates in the fourth quarter, sacrificing low-margin sales in return for a sharp focus on profitable product lines.

Silicon Motion Technology (NASDAQ:SIMO) just reported results for the fourth quarter of 2013, expanding on a preliminary report filed three weeks ago.
The preliminary release pointed to roughly $52 million in net sales and gross margins between 48% and 49%. The final report pinned sales down to $52.5 million, a 26% year-over-year drop. Non-GAAP gross margins landed at 48.8%, unchanged from the third quarter and up from 44.6% in the year-ago period.
Adjusted earnings landed at $0.30 per American depositary share, down from $0.36 per ADS a year ago. Analysts were expecting adjusted earnings of $0.21 per ADS on $51.8 million in revenue, and Silicon Motion surpassed both of these targets. Shares jumped about 5% in after-hours trading.
The Taiwan-based microchip designer saw storage controller chips for solid-state disks deliver roughly half of the company's total sales in the quarter. The company is moving out of less profitable commodity markets such as 4G LTE mobile handset radio transceivers. Sales in that segment plunged 41% year over year, and the stronger product mix helped push Silicon Motion's margins higher.





Looking ahead, CEO Wallace Kou sees next-generation radio chips driving Silicon Motion's growth in 2014, with the first products getting ready to ship: "I am pleased to announce that the testing of our new LTE-Advanced transceiver paired with Samsung's new LTE-Advanced baseband is nearing completion for our first flagship win at Samsung's 2014 smartphone lineup."
LTE-Advanced is the next version of the popular LTE mobile technology, many times faster and much more reliable than today's 4G LTE.

History[edit]
Silicon Motion Technology Corporation was formed as the combination of Silicon Motion, Inc., which was established in 1995 in Silicon Valley in the United States, and Feiya Technology Corporation, which was founded in 1997 in Taipei, Taiwan. At the time, mobile graphic chips were the main product of Silicon Motion and NAND controllers were the main products of Feiya Technology Corporation. In 2002, Concord Asia Capital (now known as Concord Venture Capital Group), mediated the merger of the two companies which was completed in August 2002.[4] In 2005 the combined company was renamed Silicon Motion Technology Corporation and began listing on the NASDAQ stock market under the SIMO ticker symbol.
