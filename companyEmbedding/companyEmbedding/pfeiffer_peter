Michelle Pfeiffer, original 3.5 x 5 photograph by celebrity photographer Peter Warrack. Vintage photograph from the original negative. Printed by Warrack as part of his personal archive. Previously unpublished.
In his early 20's, Peter Warrack lived in London, Rome, and Athens working for entertainment magazines and writing articles about events that he attended, like the Cannes Film Festival. It was during this period of time that his interest in photography began to develop. Over the years, Peter began to amass a very extensive collection of photographs of people he met. He attended many events and met many famed individuals of the time. He always took the time to research people before meeting them and was able to talk with them about their careers, their travels and even their families. 
Verso bears official "Peter Warrack Archive" ink stamping. In very good condition, though might have light mounting residue on verso from previous mounting.
Provenance: From the Peter Warrack Estate.

Satisfaction 100% Guaranteed

Description
The circle of life
Jugendstil was an art movement between 1890/95 and 1914.The German name was derived from the magazine “Jugend”, founded in 1896 in Munich . was a revolt against stifled art and life forms of the Gründerzeit. The artists of the art nouveau sought a new beginning at the sources of art, which they recognized in nature. Art Nouveau embodied a new, free feeling of life and a new beginning. 
Peter Paul Pfeiffer(1879-1957) worked as a sculptor,goldsmith, designer and carpenter. He created jewelry, belt buckles, reliefs, plaques, bust and portrait reliefs and medals. 
We are proud to present a rare piece of this superb German artist, a natural aquamarine and ruby pendant made and signed by Paul Peter Pfeiffer. 
This gorgeous piece is based on leaf motif and is in the manner of the Wiener Werkstatte. Centering is a rectangular cushion cut natural aquamarine of approx 6.37 Ct of a glorious vivid azure colour. 
Surrounded by a luscious halo of fourteen round cut natural rubies totaling approx 1.18 Ct sparkling with bright pink highlights. 
This fine example is typical of Pfeiffer style, characterized by soft, curved shapes and lines featuring natural leaves in harmonious design. 
Artfully crafted in 18 Kt yellow gold, marked with assay and signed on the back. 
Very good overall condition commensurate to use and age
