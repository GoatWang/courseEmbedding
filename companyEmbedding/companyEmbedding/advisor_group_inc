Advisor Group, Inc. Announces Comprehensive Digital Onboarding, Advice and Data Aggregation Platform for Financial Advisors and Retail Investors
Jul 11 17
Advisor Group, Inc. announced the launch of a comprehensive digital onboarding, advice and data aggregation platform for financial advisors affiliated with Advisor Group and their clients. Launched in alliance with Jemstep the new platform will be fully supported by both Pershing and Envestnet, Advisor Group's primary clearing and advisory platform partners, respectively. The platform will enable advisors to seamlessly onboard new clients and open new accounts through one consolidated and entirely digital process accessible through any web-enabled electronic device, thereby eliminating most paperwork. The platform will support a broad spectrum of Advisor Group's advisory and brokerage solutions, encompassing data aggregation and account maintenance functions as well as a fully digital advice solution accessible through advisors' websites for clients who prefer a self-directed wealth management experience. Advisor Group expects to roll out the new platform during the fourth quarter of 2017. Advisor Group's new digital onboarding, advice and service platform is expected to address a number of crucial recurring challenges for advisors in the independent space as follows: Digital Onboarding and Paperless Workflows. The platform offers a greatly streamlined and paperless account opening process, both for traditional advisor-led client relationships and for client-driven relationships on the platform's fully-integrated digital advice solution. Following the onboarding process, the platform will provide clients with access to a secure, mobile-enabled web portal featuring paperless reporting and monitoring functionality, driving further practice efficiency for advisors and reducing unwanted paper deliveries for clients. Funding, Asset Transfers and Asset Allocation. The new platform is also expected to enable clients to more easily transfer assets from other institutions to their brokerage and advisory accounts as needed by initiating a paperless, e-signature-based transfer process at the client's discretion. Through seamless integration with both Pershing (for brokerage accounts) and Envestnet (for advisory solutions), the new platform will allow advisors to quickly and efficiently allocate client assets to the most appropriate investment solutions across the full range of Advisor Group's offerings. Account Aggregation. The new platform will enable the firm's financial advisors and their clients to view all client assets through a single consolidated interface. This will include the ability to view assets held at other institutions, such as bank balances and 401(k) assets, through the client portal. In addition to offering clients the convenience of consolidated reporting and monitoring across all their assets, this functionality is expected to drive new opportunities for advisors to increase their "wallet share" by identifying new ways to serve existing clients. Digital Advice. The digital advice component of the new platform will enable the firm's advisors to effectively serve a broader range of account sizes by allowing them to engage select clients through the platform's fully-integrated Jemstep Advisor Pro digital advice solution. The digital advice solution can be customized as an advisor-branded offering and can be made accessible to investors seeking a personally-driven wealth management experience through the advisor's website.

Who We Are
Our goal at Advisor Solutions Group, Inc. (“ASG”) is to work in close partnership with our clients, helping you create a customized compliance program.

Our mission is to help investment advisers do what they do best – manage money and care for their clients.
Why ASG 

We have in-depth experience working with investment advisers of diverse backgrounds and business models.

We provide education, training, compliance implementation, and ongoing support.
We are proactive in our approach with clients.
We frequently update you with the most current and relevant compliance concerns.
