 GETELMAN CORP. (Form: 424B3, Received: 04/08/2016 15:43:50) 

















	Filed Pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3)


	SEC File No. 333-209891






	PROSPECTUS



	 



	GETELMAN CORP.




	10,000,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK




	$0.01 PER SHARE






	This is the initial offering of common stock of Getelman Corp. and no public market currently exists for the securities being offered. We are registering for sale a total of 10,000,000 shares of common stock at a fixed price of $0.01 per share to the general public in best efforts offering. We estimate our total offering registration costs to be approximately $8,000. There is no minimum number of shares that must be sold by us for the offering to proceed, and we will retain the proceeds from the sale of any of the offered shares. The offering is being conducted on a self-underwritten, best efforts basis, which means our President, Mark Gitelman, will attempt to sell the shares. We are making this offering without the involvement of underwriters or broker-dealers. The tables and information below shows the offering price of the securities and net proceeds we plan to receive on both a per share basis and for the total amount of the offering.

	92,000









	This Prospectus will permit our President to sell the shares directly to the public, with no commission or other remuneration payable to him for any shares he may sell. Mr. Gitelman will sell all the shares registered herein. In offering the securities on our behalf, he will rely on the safe harbor from broker-dealer registration set out in Rule 3a4-1 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. The shares will be offered at a fixed price of $0.01 per share for a period of two hundred and forty (240) days from the effective date of this prospectus. The offering shall terminate on the earlier of (i) when the offering period ends (240 days from the effective date of this prospectus), (ii) the date when the sale of all 10,000,000 shares is completed, (iii) when the Board of Directors decides that it is in the best interest of the Company to terminate the offering prior the completion of the sale of all 10,000,000 shares registered under the Registration Statement of which this Prospectus is part. 







	Getelman Corp. is a development stage company and has recently started its operations. To date we have been involved primarily in organizational activities. We do not have sufficient capital to commence operations. Any investment in the shares offered herein involves a high degree of risk. You should only purchase shares if you can afford the loss of your investment. Our independent registered public accountant has issued an audit opinion which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.





	There has been no market for our securities and a public market may never develop, or, if any market does develop, it may not be sustained. Our common stock is not traded on any exchange or on the over-the-counter market. After the effective date of the registration statement relating to this prospectus, we hope to have a market maker file an application with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) for our common stock to be eligible for trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. To be eligible for quotation, issuers must remain current in their quarterly and annual filings with the SEC. If we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board. We do not yet have a market maker who has agreed to file such application. There can be no assurance that our common stock will ever be quoted on a stock exchange or a quotation service or that any market for our stock will develop.





	We are an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act).








	THE PURCHASE OF THE SECURITIES OFFERED THROUGH THIS PROSPECTUS INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY READ AND CONSIDER THE SECTION OF THIS PROSPECTUS ENTITLED RISK FACTORS ON PAGES 7 THROUGH 15 BEFORE BUYING ANY SHARES OF GETELMAN CORP.S COMMON STOCK.









	NEITHER THE SEC NOR ANY STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION HAS APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED OF THESE SECURITIES OR PASSED UPON THE ADEQUACY OR ACCURACY OF THIS PROSPECTUS. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.

	PROSPECTUS SUMMARY



	 



	AS USED IN THIS PROSPECTUS, UNLESS THE CONTEXT OTHERWISE REQUIRES, WE, US, OUR, AND GETELMAN CORP. REFERS TO GETELMAN CORP. THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY DOES NOT CONTAIN ALL OF THE INFORMATION THAT MAY BE IMPORTANT TO YOU. YOU SHOULD READ THE ENTIRE PROSPECTUS BEFORE MAKING AN INVESTMENT DECISION TO PURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK.



	 



	GETELMAN CORP.



	 


	Getelman Corp. was incorporated in Nevada on July 12, 2015. We are development stage company and intend to commence operations in the business consuting with specialization in team-building activities and events in order to establish strong sense of unity between co-workers.  We plan to deliver our services to recently incorporated and/ or well-established enterprises. Our companys main objective is to fulfill the need of the small and medium sized businesses to organize and carry out corporate events for team-building and entertaining purposes.





	We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to develop our business operations (See Description of Business and Use of Proceeds). To implement our plan of operations we require a minimum of $42,000 for the next twelve months as described in our Plan of Operations. There is no assurance that we will generate any revenue in the first 12 months after completion our offering or ever generate any revenue.





	Being a development stage company, we have very limited operating history. If we do not generate any revenue we may need a minimum of $10,000 of additional funding to pay for ongoing SEC filing requirements. We do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing. Our principal executive offices are located at 2235 E. Flamingo Rd., Suite 355, Las Vegas, NV 89119. Our phone number is 725-777-0799.



	From inception (July 12, 2015) until the date of this filing, we have had limited operating activities. Our financial statements from inception (July 12, 2015) through January 31, 2016, reports no revenue and a net loss of $1,616. Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit opinion for Getelman Corp., which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. To date, we have developed our business plan and developed business-model of our company.





	As of the date of this prospectus, there is no public trading market for our common stock and no assurance that a trading market for our securities will ever develop.





	Proceeds from this offering are required for us to proceed with your business plan over the next twelve months. We require minimum funding of approximately $42,000 to conduct our proposed operations and pay all expenses for a minimum period of one year including expenses associated with this offering and maintaining a reporting status with the SEC. If we are unable to obtain minimum funding of approximately $42,000, our business may fail. Since we are presently in the development stage of our business, we can provide no assurance that we will successfully sell any products or services related to our planned activities.

	RISK FACTORS



	 



	AN INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE RISKS DESCRIBED BELOW AND THE OTHER INFORMATION IN THIS PROSPECTUS BEFORE INVESTING IN OUR COMMON STOCK. IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS OCCUR, OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE SERIOUSLY HARMED. THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK, WHEN AND IF WE TRADE AT A LATER DATE, COULD DECLINE DUE TO ANY OF THESE RISKS, AND YOU MAY LOSE ALL OR PART OF YOUR INVESTMENT.









	RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS









	BECAUSE OUR AUDITORS HAVE RAISED A GOING CONCERN, THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTY THAT WE WILL CONTINUE OPERATIONS IN WHICH CASE YOU COULD LOSE YOUR INVESTMENT.






	Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty about our ability to continue in business. As such we may have to cease operations and you could lose your investment.






	WE ARE SOLELY DEPENDENT UPON THE FUNDS TO BE RAISED IN THIS OFFERING TO START OUR BUSINESS, THE PROCEEDS OF WHICH MAY BE INSUFFICIENT TO ACHIEVE REVENUES AND PROFITABLE OPERATIONS. WE MAY NEED TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING WHICH MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE.

	Page
















	Our current operating funds are less than necessary to complete our intended operations. We need the proceeds from this offering to start our operations as described in the Plan of Operation section of this prospectus. As of January 31, 2016, we had cash in the amount of $10,056 and liabilities of $2,172. As of this date, we have no income and just recently started our operation. The proceeds of this offering may not be sufficient for us to achieve revenues and profitable operations. We need additional funds to achieve a sustainable sales level where ongoing operations can be funded out of revenues. There is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us.





	We require minimum funding of approximately $42,000 to conduct our proposed operations for a period of one year. If we are not able to raise this amount, or if we experience a shortage of funds prior to funding we may utilize funds from Mark Gitelman, our sole officer and director, who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for professional fees, including fees payable in connection with the filing of this registration statement and operation expenses. However, Mr. Gitelman has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. After one year we may need additional financing. If we do not generate any revenue we may need a minimum of $10,000 of additional funding to pay for ongoing SEC filing requirements. We do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing.


	 


	If we are successful in raising the funds from this offering, we plan to commence activities to continue our operations. We cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funds to continue our business plan according to our plan of operations.






	WE MAY CONTINUE TO LOSE MONEY, AND IF WE DO NOT ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE OUR BUSINESS.






	We are company with limited operations, have incurred expenses and have losses. In addition, we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses. As a result, we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability, which may not occur. We expect our operating expenses to increase as a result of our planned expansion. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may be unable to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. We expect to have quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in revenues, expenses, losses and cash flow, some of which could be significant. Results of operations will depend upon numerous factors, some beyond our control, including regulatory actions, market acceptance of our products and services, new products and service introductions, and competition.






	WE ARE A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY AND HAVE COMMENCED LIMITED OPERATIONS IN OUR BUSINESS. WE EXPECT TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT OPERATING LOSSES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

	 





	We were incorporated on July 12, 2015 and to date have been involved primarily in organizational activities. We have commenced limited business operations. Accordingly, we have no way to evaluate the likelihood that our business will be successful. Potential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by new companies and the high rate of failure of such enterprises. The likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays encountered in connection with the operations that we plan to undertake. These potential problems include, but are not limited to, unanticipated problems relating to the ability to generate sufficient cash flow to operate our business, and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates. We anticipate that we will incur increased operating expenses without realizing any revenues. We expect to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future. We recognize that if the effectiveness of our business plan is not forthcoming, we will not be able to continue business operations. There is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful, and it is doubtful that we will generate any operating revenues or ever achieve profitable operations. If we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks, our business will most likely fail.

	WE HAVE LIMITED SALES AND MARKETING EXPERIENCE, WHICH INCREASES THE RISK THAT OUR BUSINESS WILL FAIL.




	 



	We have no experience in the marketing of business consulting and event planning company, and have only nominal sales and marketing experience. Our future success will depend, among other factors, upon whether our services can be sold at a profitable price and the extent to which consumers acquire, adopt, and continue to use them. There can be no assurance that our business will gain wide acceptance in its targeted markets or that we will be able to effectively market our services.






	WE ARE IN A COMPETITIVE MARKET WHICH COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO GAIN MARKET SHARE WHICH COULD HARM OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.





	 




	The business of niche of business consulting and event planning services is very competitive. Barriers to entry are relatively low, and we face competitive pressures from companies anxious to join this niche. There are a number of successful business consulting and event planning companies that offer similar niche services, which may prevent us from gaining enough market share to become successful.  These competitors have existing customers that may form a large part of our targeted client base, and such clients may be hesitant to switch over from already established competitors to our service.  If we cannot gain enough market share, our business and our financial performance will be adversely affected.






	SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS MAY BE ABLE TO USE THEIR FINANCIAL STRENGTH TO DOMINATE THE MARKET, WHICH MAY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUES.



	Some of our competitors may be much larger companies than us and very well capitalized. They could choose to use their greater resources to finance their continued participation and penetration of this market, which may impede our ability to generate sufficient revenue to cover our costs. Their better financial resources could allow them to significantly out spend us on research and development, as well as marketing and production. We might not be able to maintain our ability to compete in this circumstance.






	WE CANNOT GUARANTEE FUTURE CUSTOMERS. EVEN IF WE OBTAIN CUSTOMERS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO GENERATE A PROFIT. IF THAT OCCURS WE WILL HAVE TO CEASE OPERATIONS.






	We have not identified any customers and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to attract future customers. Even if we obtain new customers for our service, there is no guarantee that we will make a profit. If we are unable to attract enough customers to operate profitably, we will have to suspend or cease operations.






	BECAUSE WE ARE SMALL AND DO NOT HAVE MUCH CAPITAL, OUR MARKETING CAMPAIGN MAY NOT BE ENOUGH TO ATTRACT SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS TO OPERATE PROFITABLY. IF WE DO NOT MAKE A PROFIT, WE WILL SUSPEND OR CEASE OPERATIONS.






	Due to the fact we are small and do not have much capital, we must limit our marketing activities and may not be able to make our services known to potential customers. Because we will be limiting our marketing activities, we may not be able to attract enough customers to operate profitably. If we cannot operate profitably, we may have to suspend or cease operations.






	BECAUSE OUR SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR WILL OWN MORE THAN 50% OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK, HE WILL MAKE AND CONTROL CORPORATE DECISIONS THAT MAY BE DISADVANTAGEOUS TO MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS.







	7 |

	Page
















	Mr. Gitelman, our sole officer and director, will own more than 50% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Accordingly, he will have significant influence in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters, including the election of directors, mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and also the power to prevent or cause a change in control. The interests of Mr. Gitelman may differ from the interests of the other stockholders and may result in corporate decisions that are disadvantageous to other shareholders.






	WE DEPEND TO A SIGNIFICANT EXTENT ON CERTAIN KEY PERSON, THE LOSS OF WHOM MAY MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COMPANY.






	Currently, we have only one employee who is also our sole officer and director. We depend entirely on Mark Gitelman for all of our operations. The loss of Mr. Gitelman would have a substantial negative effect on our company and may cause our business to fail. Mr. Gitelman has not been compensated for his services since our incorporation, and it is highly unlikely that he will receive any compensation unless and until we generate substantial revenues. There is intense competition for skilled personnel and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel on acceptable terms. The loss of Mr. Gitelmans services could prevent us from completing the development of our plan of operation and our business. In the event of the loss of services of such personnel, no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain the services of adequate replacement personnel.





	We do not have any employment agreements or maintain key person life insurance policies on our officer and director. We do not anticipate entering into employment agreements with him or acquiring key man insurance in the foreseeable future.






	BECAUSE OUR SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR WILL ONLY BE DEVOTING LIMITED TIME TO OUR OPERATIONS, OUR OPERATIONS MAY BE SPORADIC WHICH MAY RESULT IN PERIODIC INTERRUPTIONS OR SUSPENSIONS OF OPERATIONS. THIS ACTIVITY COULD PREVENT US FROM ATTRACTING ENOUGH CUSTOMERS AND RESULT IN A LACK OF REVENUES WHICH MAY CAUSE US TO CEASE OPERATIONS.






	Mark Gitelman, our sole officer and director will only be devoting limited time to our operations. He will be devoting approximately 20 hours a week to our operations. Because our sole office and director will only be devoting limited time to our operations, our operations may be sporadic and occur at times which are convenient to him. As a result, operations may be periodically interrupted or suspended which could result in a lack of revenues and a possible cessation of operations.






	OUR SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR HAS NO EXPERIENCE MANAGING A PUBLIC COMPANY WHICH IS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN DISCLOSURE CONTROL AND PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.






	We have never operated as a public company. Mark Gitelman, our sole officer and director has no experience managing a public company which is required to establish and maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. As a result, we may not be able to operate successfully as a public company, even if our operations are successful. We plan to comply with all of the various rules and regulations, which are required for a public company that is reporting company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. However, if we cannot operate successfully as a public company, your investment may be materially adversely affected.






	WE ARE AN EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY UNDER THE JOBS ACT, AND WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN IF THE REDUCED DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO EMERGING GROWTH COMPANIES WILL MAKE OUR COMMON STOCK LESS ATTRACTIVE TO INVESTORS.







	8 |

	Page
















	We qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to:





	-


	have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;


	-


	provide an auditor attestation with respect to managements report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting;


	-


	comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditors report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);


	-


	submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as say-on-pay and say-on-frequency; and


	-


	disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the Chief Executives compensation to median employee compensation.


	 


	In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.





	We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues is $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates is $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.





	Until such time, however, we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.








	RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS OFFERING









	BECAUSE THE OFFERING PRICE HAS BEEN ARBITRARILY SET BY THE COMPANY, YOU MAY NOT REALIZE A RETURN ON YOUR INVESTMENT UPON RESALE OF YOUR SHARES.



	 


	The offering price and other terms and conditions relative to the Companys shares have been arbitrarily determined by us and do not bear any relationship to assets, earnings, book value or any other objective financial criteria. Additionally, as the Company was formed on July 12, 2015, and has only a limited operating history with no earnings, the price of the offered shares is not based on its past earnings, and no investment banker, appraiser, or other independent third party, has been consulted concerning the offering price for the shares or the fairness of the offering price used for the shares, as such our stockholders may not be able to receive a return on their investment when they sell their shares of common stock.






	WE ARE SELLING THIS OFFERING WITHOUT AN UNDERWRITER AND MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL ANY SHARES.







	9 |

	Page
















	This offering is self-underwritten, that is, we are not going to engage the services of an underwriter to sell the shares; we intend to sell our shares through our President, who will receive no commissions. There is no guarantee that he will be able to sell any of the shares. Unless he is successful in receiving the proceeds in the amount of $100,000 from this offering, we may have to seek alternative financing to implement our business plan.






	THE REGULATION OF PENNY STOCKS BY THE SEC AND FINRA MAY DISCOURAGE THE TRADABILITY OF THE COMPANY'S SECURITIES.



	 


	The shares being offered are defined as a penny stock under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and rules of the Commission. The Exchange Act and such penny stock rules generally impose additional sales practice and disclosure requirements on broker-dealers who sell our securities to persons other than certain accredited investors who are, generally, institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 ($300,000 jointly with spouse), or in transactions not recommended by the broker-dealer. For transactions covered by the penny stock rules, a broker dealer must make certain mandated disclosures in penny stock transactions, including the actual sale or purchase price and actual bid and offer quotations, the compensation to be received by the broker-dealer and certain associated persons, and deliver certain disclosures required by the Commission. Consequently, the penny stock rules may make it difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase, if at all.






	OUR PRESIDENT, MR. GITELMAN DOES NOT HAVE ANY PRIOR EXPERIENCE OFFERING AND SELLING SECURITIES , AND OUR OFFERING DOES NOT REQUIRE A MIMIMUM AMOUNT TO BE RAISED. AS A RESULT OF THIS WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RAISE ENOUGH FUNDS TO COMMENCE AND SUSTAIN OUR BUSINESS AND INVESTORS MAY LOSE THEIR ENTIRE INVESTMENT.






	Mr. Gitelman does not have any experience conducting a securities offering. Consequently, we may not be able to raise any funds successfully. Also, the best effort offering does not require a minimum amount to be raised. If we are not able to raise sufficient funds, we may not be able to fund our operations as planned, and our business will suffer and your investment may be materially adversely affected. Our inability to successfully conduct a best-effort offering could be the basis of your losing your entire investment in us.








	DUE TO THE LACK OF A TRADING MARKET FOR OUR SECURITIES, YOU MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY SELLING ANY SHARES YOU PURCHASE IN THIS OFFERING.



	We are not registered on any market or public stock exchange. There is presently no demand for our common stock and no public market exists for the shares being offered in this prospectus. We plan to contact a market maker immediately following the completion of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board (OTCBB). The OTCBB is a regulated quotation service that displays real-time quotes, last sale prices and volume information in over-the-counter securities. The OTCBB is not an issuer listing service, market or exchange. Although the OTCBB does not have any listing requirements, to be eligible for quotation on the OTCBB, issuers must remain current in their filings with the SEC or applicable regulatory authority. If we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board. Market makers are not permitted to begin quotation of a security whose issuer does not meet this filing requirement. Securities already quoted on the OTCBB that become delinquent in their required filings will be removed following a 30 to 60 day grace period if they do not make their required filing during that time. We cannot guarantee that our application will be accepted or approved and our stock listed and quoted for sale. As of the date of this filing, there have been no discussions or understandings between Getelman Corp. and anyone acting on our behalf, with any market maker regarding participation in a future trading market for our securities. If no market is ever developed for our common stock, it will be difficult for you to sell any shares you purchase in this offering. In such a case, you may find that you are unable to achieve any benefit from your investment or liquidate your shares without considerable delay, if at all. In addition, if we fail to have our common stock quoted on a public trading market, your common stock will not have a quantifiable value and it may be difficult, if not impossible, to ever resell your shares, resulting in an inability to realize any value from your investment.






	WE WILL INCUR ONGOING COSTS AND EXPENSES FOR SEC REPORTING AND COMPLIANCE. WITHOUT REVENUE WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE, MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR INVESTORS TO SELL THEIR SHARES, IF AT ALL.



	 


	The estimated cost of this registration statement is $8,000 which will be paid from offering proceeds. If the offering proceeds are less than registration cost, we will have to utilize funds from Mark Gitelman, our sole officer and director, who has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process. Mr. Gitelmans verbal agreement to provide us loans for registration costs is non- binding and discretionary. After the effective date of this prospectus, we will be required to file annual, quarterly and current reports, or other information with the SEC as provided by the Securities Exchange Act. We will voluntarily continue reporting in the absence of an SEC reporting obligation. We plan to contact a market maker immediately following the close of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board. To be eligible for quotation, issuers must remain current in their filings with the SEC. In order for us to remain in compliance we will require future revenues to cover the cost of these filings, which could comprise a substantial portion of our available cash resources. The costs associated with being a publicly traded company in the next 12 month will be approximately $10,000. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to remain in compliance it may be difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase, if at all. Also, if we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board.











	THE COMPANY'S INVESTORS MAY SUFFER FUTURE DILUTION DUE TO ISSUANCES OF SHARES FOR VARIOUS CONSIDERATIONS IN THE FUTURE.



	Our Articles of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of 75,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of which 10,000,000 shares are currently issued and outstanding. If we sell the 10,000,000 shares being offered in this offering, we would have 20,000,000 shares issued and outstanding. As discussed in the Dilution section below, the issuance of the shares of common stock described in this prospectus will result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common stock held by our existing shareholders. The issuance of common stock for future services or acquisitions or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by our investors, and might have an adverse effect on any trading market for our common stock.









	FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS



	 


	This prospectus contains forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. We use words such as anticipate, believe, plan, expect, future, intend, and similar expressions to identify such forward-looking statements. Investors should be aware that all forward-looking statements contained within this filing are good faith estimates of management as of the date of this filing. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the risks faced by us as described in the Risk Factors section and elsewhere in this prospectus.

	USE OF PROCEEDS

The following table sets forth the uses of proceeds assuming the sale of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of the securities offered for sale by the Company.

	The above figures represent only estimated costs. The estimated cost of this registration statement is $8,000 which will be paid from offering proceeds. If the offering proceeds are less than registration costs, Mark Gitelman, our president and director, has verbally agreed to loan the Company funds to complete the registration process. Mr. Gitelmans verbal agreement to provide us loans for registration costs is non- binding and discretionary. Also, these loans would be necessary if the proceeds from this offering will not be sufficient to implement our business plan and maintain reporting status and quotation on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board when and if our common stocks become eligible for trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. Mr. Gitelman will not be paid any compensation or anything from the proceeds of this offering. There is no due date for the repayment of the funds advanced by Mr. Gitelman. Mr. Gitelman will be repaid from revenues of operations if and when we generate revenues to pay the obligation. Additionally, we do not plan to use our proceeds to compensate our sole officer and director, Mr. Gitelman.





	If we sell 25% of the shares or less, we will not have enough funds to follow our plan of operation. In this case, we will need to loan the funds from our president and director, Mr. Gitelman, who has verbally agreed to loan the Company funds, or we will search for additional financing to implement our plan of operation.






	DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE



	 


	The offering price of the shares has been determined arbitrarily by us. The price does not bear any relationship to our assets, book value, earnings, or other established criteria for valuing a privately held company. In determining the number of shares to be offered and the offering price, we took into consideration our cash on hand and the amount of money we would need to implement our business plan. Accordingly, the offering price should not be considered an indication of the actual value of the securities.

	DILUTION



	 


	Dilution represents the difference between the Offering price and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of this Offering. Net tangible book value is the amount that results from subtracting total liabilities and from total assets. Dilution arises mainly as a result of our arbitrary determination of the Offering price of the shares being offered. Dilution of the value of the shares you purchase is also a result of the lower book value of the shares held by our existing stockholder.





	As of January 31, 2016, Total Stockholders' Equity was $8,384. On January 6, 2016 we sold 10,000,000 shares of common stocks to our sole officer and director, at a price of $0.001 per share, for net proceeds of $10,000.






	If 100% of the Shares Are Sold:






	Upon completion of this offering, in the event all of the shares are sold, the net tangible book value of the 20,000,000 shares to be outstanding will be $100,384 or approximately $0.005 per share. The net tangible book value per share prior to the offering is $0,0008. The net tangible book value of the shares held by our existing stockholders will be decreased by $0.0042 per share without any additional investment on their part. Investors in the offering will incur an immediate dilution from $0.01 per share to $0.005 per share.





	After completion of this offering, if 10,000,000 shares are sold, investors in the offering will own 50% of the total number of shares then outstanding for which they will have made cash investment of $100,000 or $0.01 per share. Our existing stockholder will own 50% of the total number of shares then outstanding, for which he has made contributions of cash totalling $10,000 or $0.001 per share.






	If 75% of the Shares Are Sold






	Upon completion of this offering, in the event 7,500,000 shares are sold, the net tangible book value of the 17,500,000 shares to be outstanding will be $75,384, or approximately $0.0043 per share. The net tangible book value per share prior to the offering is $0,0008. The net tangible book value of the shares held by our existing stockholders will be decreased by $0.0035 per share without any additional investment on their part. Investors in the offering will incur an immediate dilution from $0.01 per share to $0.0057 per share.





	After completion of this offering investors in the offering will own approximately 42.86% of the total number of shares then outstanding for which they will have made cash investment of $75,000, or $0.01 per share. Our existing stockholder will own approximately 57.14% of the total number of shares then outstanding, for which he has made contributions of cash totaling $10,000 or $0.001 per share.






	If 50% of the Shares Are Sold






	Upon completion of this offering, in the event 5,000,000 shares are sold, the net tangible book value of the 15,000,000 shares to be outstanding will be $50,384 or approximately $0.0034 per share. The net tangible book value per share prior to the offering is $0,0008. The net tangible book value of the shares held by our existing stockholders will be decreased by $0.0026 per share without any additional investment on their part. Investors in the offering will incur an immediate dilution from $0.01 per share to $0.0066 per share.





	After completion of this offering investors in the offering will own approximately 33.33% of the total number of shares then outstanding for which they will have made cash investment of $50,000, or $0.01 per share. Our existing stockholder will own approximately 66.67% of the total number of shares then outstanding, for which he has made contributions of cash totaling $10,000 or $0.001 per share.

	If 25% of the Shares Are Sold






	Upon completion of this offering, in the event 2,500,000 shares are sold, the net tangible book value of the 12,500,000 shares to be outstanding will be $25,384 or approximately $0.002 per share. The net tangible book value per share prior to the offering is $0,0008. The net tangible book value of the shares held by our existing stockholders will be decreased by $0.0012 per share without any additional investment on their part. Investors in the offering will incur an immediate dilution from $0.01 per share to $0.008 per share.





	After completion of this offering investors in the offering will own approximately 20.00% of the total number of shares then outstanding for which they will have made cash investment of $25,000, or $0.01 per share. Our existing stockholder will own approximately 80.00% of the total number of shares then outstanding, for which he has made contributions of cash totaling $10,000 or $0.001 per share.

	MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION






	You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this prospectus. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this prospectus, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the Risk Factors section of this prospectus for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.





	We qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to:


	 


	·


	have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;


	·


	provide an auditor attestation with respect to managements report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting;


	·


	comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditors report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);


	·


	submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as say-on-pay and say-on-frequency; and


	·


	disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEOs compensation to median employee compensation.


	 


	In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.

	Page



















	We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues is $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates is $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.





	Our cash balance was $5,991 as of March 23, 2016. We believe our cash balance is not sufficient to fund our operations for any period of time. We have been utilizing and may utilize funds from Mark Gitelman, our Chairman and President, who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for offering costs, filing fees, and professional fees. As of January 31, 2016, Mr. Gitelman has advanced to us $2,172. Mr. Gitelman, however, has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. In order to implement our plan of operations for the next twelve-month period, we require a minimum of $42,000 of funding from this offering. Being a development stage company, we have very limited operating history we do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing. Our principal executive offices are located at 2235 E. Flamingo Rd., Suite 355, Las Vegas, NV 89119. Our phone number is 725-777-0799.





	We are a development stage company and we have generated no revenue to date. Our full business plan entails activities described in the Plan of Operation section below. Long term financing beyond the maximum aggregate amount of this offering may be required to expand our business. The exact amount of funding will depend on the scale of our development and expansion. We do not currently have planned our expansion, and we have not decided yet on the scale of our development and expansion and on exact amount of funding needed for our long term financing. If we do not generate any revenue we may need a minimum of $10,000 of additional funding at the end of the twelve month period described in our Plan of Operation below to maintain a reporting status.





	Our independent registered public accountant has issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. This is because we have not generated revenues and no revenues are anticipated until we complete our initial business development. There is no assurance we will ever reach that stage.





	To meet our need for cash we are attempting to raise money from this offering. If we are unable to successfully find customers, we may quickly use up the proceeds from this offering and will need to find alternative sources. At the present time, we have not made any arrangements to raise additional cash, other than through this offering.





	If we need additional cash and cannot raise it, we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash, or cease operations entirely. Even if we raise $100,000 from this offering, we may need more funds for ongoing business operations after the first year, and would have to obtain additional funding.






	PLAN OF OPERATION






	We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 12, 2015. We have never declared bankruptcy, have never been in receivership, and have never been involved in any legal action or proceedings. Since incorporation, we have not made any significant purchase or sale of assets. We are a development stage company that has not generated any revenue and just recently started our operations. If we are unable to successfully find clients who will use our service, we may quickly use up the proceeds from this offering.






	15 |

	Page



















	We intend to commence operations in the business consuting with specialization in team-building activities and events in order to establish strong sense of unity between co-workers.  We plan to deliver our services to recently incorporated and/ or well-established enterprises. Our companys main objective is to fulfill the need of the small and medium sized businesses to organize and carry out corporate events for team-building and entertaining purposes.





	We intend to spend money on research and development when our business plan is complete in order to develop our business. We do not expect to purchase or sell plant or significant equipment. Further we do not expect significant changes in the number of employees.





	Our plan of operations is as follows:







	Complete Our Public Offering







	We expect to complete our public offering within 240 days after the effectiveness of our registration statement by the Securities and Exchange Commissions. We intend to concentrate our efforts on raising capital during this period. Our operations will be limited due to the limited amount of funds on hand. Upon completion of our public offering, our specific goal is to profitably sell our services. If we are unable to obtain minimum funding of approximately $42,000 (If 50% of the shares sold), our business may fail.





	Our plan of operations following the completion is as follows:







	Office Leasing




	Time Frame: 1st-12th months.


	Costs: $3,000.





	We are leasing the office at 2235 E. Flamingo Rd., Suite 355, Las Vegas, NV 89119 since November 9, 2015. Our yearly leasing fees are approximately $3,000.







	Furnishing and equipping the premises






	Time Frame: 1st-3d months


	Costs: $4,000-$9,000





	As our company intends to work in the corporate segment, we feel that its the reason why the office must have decently presentable appearance. For this purpose and for successful operation, as well, the company is likely to need an office equipped with computers, multifunctional printers, a land phone, mobile phones, headsets for managers to take calls via skype and similar VoIP services, a flat screen TV (or a white  screen and a projector) for demonstration purposes which will help to gauge customer interest in our services, office furniture and office supplies, furniture for customers, such as sofas, chairs or armchairs. In case we are able to sell only 50% of shares issued, we plan to equip the office with basic furniture and basic supplies, multifunctional printer and the computers to handle the everyday operations, a phone, 19 flat screen TV installed for the customers and coupled with a computer to play edited video snippets or demonstrate photos from the event already taken place, comfortable chairs for the customers. We believe the cost to be around $4,000. In case 75% issued shares are sold, we might look forward to purchase 23 TV panel, armchairs for the customers, decent furniture for the employees, print advertizing posters to place them around the office. The total cost is estimated to be $7,000. If we sell all of the shares offered we plan to buy 60 LED panel for outdoor and indoor demonstration purposes, comfortable furniture for the employees, handsets to receive and perform phone calls, a white screen and a projector for both in-office and onsite presentations, comfortable furniture for the customers (sofas and arm chairs), and other equipment which makes office environment customer-friendly and enhances working experience of our employees (such as water dispensers, coffee machines etc.) The total cost of this is estimated to be around $9,000.

	Additional Equipment




	Time Frame: 1st-4th months


	Costs: $5,000-$15,000





	Additional equipment - photo and video cameras to film the corporate events. Additional props - inflating equipment, inflatable structures (mattresses, castles, toys), foam plastic, polyurethane foam, protective equipment (hard caps, knee/elbow hard covers, kernmantle and other climbing gear). We plan it will cost for us $5,000 minimum.







	Website Development




	Time Frame: 3st-6th months


	Costs: $3,000-$5,000





	We anticipate that the website will become one of the element to boost our sales along with our marketing campaign, and to demonstrate our clients the features of our services through advertising videos and photos taken during the events carried out by our company. In addition, we plan to post samples of the scripts or their excerpts to demonstrate versatility of our services and their applicability to the needs of a particular customer. We expect that altogether it will help to gauge interest in our services. In case we sell 50% of the shares we plan to develop a web page built on free engines like Wordpress or Joomla. If 75% of the shares are sold we plan to develop additional landing page with limited functions. If we sell 100% of the shares offered we plan to develop full-functioning website with using flash and HTML 5 technologies.







	Marketing Campaign and Advertising




	Time Frame: 5st-12th months


	Costs: $10,000-$28,000





	We intend to advertise via the Internet, prior to other possible ways of advertising. We plan to advertise our service through:





	-


	Online advertisements.


	-


	SEO (Search Engines Optimization).


	-


	Radio commercials.


	-


	Printed advertisement.


	-


	Advertising through companies selling recreational tours


	-


	Direct calls or emails


	-


	We expect it to cost at least $10,000. If we sell all of the shares offerd we plan to spend minimum $28,000.









	Employees




	Time Frame: 8st-12th months


	Costs: $7,000-$22,000





	Staff is considered one of our most important investment. The employees are expected to represent the company, its philosophy and follow the corporate strategy while interacting with the clients or their representatives, and also while hosting the events in front of client companys employees. We intend to make efforts in hiring professionals skillful at planning, writing scripts, coordinating, and hosting events. Thus, we intend to look for creative writers, managers and performers (MCs, hosts, and actors). In case 50% shares sold we are likely to afford hiring a creative writer, and a manager, whose other duties will be to communicate to clients, or person to combine those two positions until we raise funds to complete hiring process. The duties of hosting event will have to be delegated to the third parties, who offer to hire entertainers and actors. If 75% shares sold we might add the managing staff and to look forward hiring our own performers and entertainers. If 100% shares sold we would be able to afford to complete the team with sales-managers, props team and drivers.

	OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS



	 


	We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.






	LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY; NEED FOR ADDITIONAL CAPITAL



	 


	There is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in the start-up stage of operations and have not generated any revenues. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products.





	We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholder.






	Results of operations








	From Inception on July 12, 2015 to January 31, 2016.







	During the period we incorporated the company, prepared a business plan. Our loss since inception is $1,616. We have just recently started our business operations, however, will not start significant operations until we have completed this offering.

	LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES



	 


	As of January 31, 2016, the Company had $10,056 cash and our liabilities were $2,172, comprising $2,172 owed to Mark Gitelman, our sole officer and director. As of January 31, 2016 our cash balance was $10,056. The available capital reserves of the Company are not sufficient for the Company to remain operational. We require minimum funding of approximately $42,000 to conduct our proposed operations and pay all expenses for a minimum period of one year including expenses associated with this offering and maintaining a reporting status with the SEC.





	Since inception, we have sold 10,000,000 shares of common stocks to our sole officer and director, at a price of $0.001 per share, for net proceeds of $10,000.





	We are attempting to raise funds to proceed with our plan of operations. We will have to utilize funds from Mark Gitelman, our sole officer and director, who has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process if offering proceeds are less than registration costs. However, Mr. Gitelman has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. Mr. Gitelmans verbal agreement to provide us loans for registration costs is non- binding and discretionary. To proceed with our operations within 12 months, we need a minimum of $42,000. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to sell all the shares required to satisfy our 12 month financial requirements. If we are successful, any money raised will be applied to the items set forth in the Use of Proceeds section of this prospectus. We will attempt to raise at least the minimum funds necessary to proceed with our plan of operations. In the long term we may need additional financing. We do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing. Obtaining additional funding will be subject to a number of factors, including general market conditions, investor acceptance of our business plan and initial results from our business operations. These factors may impact the timing, amount, terms or conditions of additional financing available to us. There is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us.





	Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion, meaning that there is substantial doubt if we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital. No substantial revenues are anticipated until we have completed the financing from this offering and implemented our plan of operations. Our only source for cash at this time is investments by others in this offering. We must raise cash to implement our strategy and stay in business. The amount of the offering will likely allow us to operate for at least one year and have the capital resources required to cover the material costs with becoming a publicly reporting. The Company anticipates over the next 12 months the cost of being a reporting public company will be approximately $10,000.







	The Company will have to meet all the financial disclosure and reporting requirements associated with being a publicly reporting company. The Companys management will have to spend additional time on policies and procedures to make sure it is compliant with various regulatory requirements, especially that of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This additional corporate governance time required of management could limit the amount of time management has to implement is business plan and impede the speed of its operations.





	Should the Company fail to raise a minimum of $42,000 under this offering the Company would be forced to scale back or abandon the implementation of its 12-month plan of operations.

	DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS



	 


	Our company prepares to offer event planning for the corporate market. We plan to target medium and small companies, which we refer to as clients or customers, as in most cases big enterprises have their own established event planning teams. We intend to commence operations in the business consulting with specialization in team-building activities and events in order to establish strong sense of unity between co-workers.  We plan to make create our event beneficial for the companies because:





	a)


	the employes will get a unique experience of togetherness, and friendly environment inside the staff as a possible outcome;


	b)


	properly planned and carried out event may help a company to get a positive image before employees, to enhance their loyalty to their company.





	In order to help our customers achieve the mentioned above results, we plan to provide customers with the highest level of event planning and hosting.





	Our principal office address is located at 2235 E. Flamingo Rd., Suite 355, Las Vegas, NV 89119. Our telephone number is 725-777-0799. Our plan of operation is forward-looking and there is no assurance that we will ever reach profitable operations. We are a development stage company and have not earned any revenue. It is likely that we will not be able to achieve profitability and would be forced to cease operations due to the lack of funding.






	Business






	Our company prepares to offer event planning for the corporate market. We plan to target medium and small companies, which we refer to as clients or customers, as in most cases big enterprises have their own established event planning teams.





	Our company plans to concentrate on team-building corporate events, offering various sorts of scripts for outdoor corporate retreats, as well as for indoor corporate parties. We anticipate that adventurous services we offer to unite co-workers and to build a strong team will attract customers. We intend to offer a great variety of activities acceptable for most ages, and suitable for people of average physical conditions, such as RPGs (role-play games), Treasure Hunt games, outdoor quests, sport competitions or any other sorts of outdoor activities, as well as quizzes, indoor quests (known as quests of a closed room) and many other different indoor activities. Taking into consideration our clients requirements, our company may provide event scripts which may combine several activities in a single event. Depending on the customers demand, corporate parties with music performers to follow the corporate retreat can be offered.  In addition to the planning of the events, our company plans to offer hosting events as well, for which we intend employ entertainers, MCs or hosts of our own. Which also means organizing those parties and decorating are the duties of our company. We believe that its cost effective for small and medium-sized business to work with our company, because once they have their event properly planned, they wont be troubled to search another third party to carry the plan out. Within the process of the business development we may think of additional services, such as lodging/ accommodation at our premises, catering, transferring by transport to the location of the event. If the client company wishes so, we also intend to provide filming, or photographic shooting of the events we conduct, to be distributed on DVDs among employees of the client company, and to be used later for advertizing purposes as well. We plan to post the edited video snippets and photos to our website, which we anticipate to be one of the key elements in attracting customers interest and advertising our services. Providing feature of having an account on our website, belonging to a company we intend to grant our loyal customers with discounts and special offers, and to distribute advertising prospects along with the update information regarding our services.

	Clients






	Our company is providing services to corporate customers only. The corporate customer is a company that contracts with our company to plan and typically host an event for the company. We anticipate that small and medium-sized corporations will be turning to our company to plan the events.






	Marketing and advertising






	We plan to apply the following marketing instruments to attract customers attention:







	Online advertisements


	- clickable banners (static or animated), placed on the websites related to business, corporate culture, event planning, and recreational services. We anticipate that it will also help us to align with the similar companies that do not provide event hosting services and may delegate this function to us.







	Search Engine Optimisation.


	In order to attract attention to our website, we seek for the opportunity of SEO (Search Engine Optimisation), to occupy the top places in search results of Google, Bing, Yandex and similar search engines. We also look forward to buying advertising space on the pages of the mentioned engines. We choose the Internet as the main instrument because it is seen as the largest repository of data, and people tend to search any information online, to get a great variety of options to choose from, rather than use other available sources.







	Video advertisement and commercials


	. We see the benefit of video advertisements for our company awareness in their versatility, by which we mean possibility to use them on the Internet (YouTube, Vimeo and other similar video hosting sites, as well as the other sites we intend to use for advertising), on TV (in a form of video commercials), on video billboards and other installments with video playback function.







	Radio Commercials and Printed Advertisement.


	We plan to support online advertising campaign with commercials on the most popular radio stations and in the printed media to enhance our companys  awareness. We suppose that this step may help us to remain in the focus of attention of those who already encountered our online or video advertisements, as well as get the attention of those who tend to rely on printed media, or doesnt have an opportunity to search the Internet.





	To achieve the largest scope of potential clients we also look forward at advertising through companies selling recreational and entertaining tours, even the ones who work with individuals, as an individual might happen to be a senior a person responsible for human resources, or a person who propose the corporate event to the seniors of their company.








	Competition






	We plan to take our own niche in the market of corporate events, as we plan to work in a highly competitive market (many entertaining companies with similar services make it such). We believe that we are about to compete favorably, on the basis that there are companies that offer only entertaining activities, companies specializing on rewarding or celebration parties, or companies offering training events or product launch events. Whereas, our goal is to offer events which, we presume, will result in stronger unity of co-workers after they experience hardship of the adventures we plan to offer.





	Our company's competitive edge is about to be based on two factors, specialization and strategic relationships. Our company will be specializing in two distinct areas of corporate planning. While specializing essentially precludes our company out of a lot of different markets, it allows our company to excel in the markets that it has chosen to participate in. Specialization allows our company to be an expert in the two areas that it is in. Additionally, the expert knowledge allows our company to provide the service as a cost saving to the company because the fewer services our company offers, the more they can concentrate on improving the current offerings. Improvements that our company strive for is a reduction in cost charged to the client and an improvement to the level of services offered.

	Page



















	Our company's second competitive edge is based on the use of strategic relationships. Our company clearly realizes that they cannot be good at everything. our company believes it is better to concentrate on a few things, excel in those areas, and form strategic partnerships with companies that excel in the service areas that our company doesn't. Applying this philosophy, Our company has decided in addition to planning corporate retreat training sessions, they want to offer the service of hosting/leading these events as well. The service of hosting/leading however, is quite different than planning and our company believes that it would be more cost effective to form a strategic relationship with an expert in this field instead of trying to become proficient themselves. our company then is able to offer a top-notch service offering of hosting/leading the training seminars but does not have to invest heavily in developing the program.





	The use of strategic relationships is unusual in the event planning space. Most event planners are generalists and try to do a little of everything. Our company is following the model of benchmark companies in other industries that have recognized the value of specialization and the use of strategic relationships.






	Revenue






	Our revenues primarily derive from planning corporate events, thus working out the entire script, and from hosting the events which, possibly, might be planned by another company that doesnt specialize in hosting. So, the basic charge includes writing a script, or updating it for the needs of the customer, adding to it the price of hosting an event, video and photoshoot, editing the videos, mounting the DVDs with the videos and photos of the event. Fees are calculated on the fixed charge for a script and hourly base of hosting the event. If a client company orders music performers to appear at any stage of the event, it will also make an added value to the total cost of the event. In case the company will be successful to obtain premises of its own, lodging and catering are about to be charged as well. Depending on customers demand, if turns cost effective, we will try to look forward to offering our clients commemorative merchandise, such as photo magnets, cups with photos, T-Shirts, office supplies with photos or marks related to the event they participated in.





	We plan that our service will cost for the potential clients from 20 to 30% of total budget of the event.  






	Insurance






	We do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are made a party of a products liability action, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease operations.






	Employees; Identification of Certain Significant Employees.






	We are a development stage company and currently have no employees. Mark Gitelman, our sole officer and director, in a non-employee officer and director of the Company. We intend to hire employees on an as needed basis.






	Offices






	Our business office is located at 2235 E. Flamingo Rd., Suite 355, Las Vegas, NV 89119. We are leasing this office since November 2015. Our phone number is 725-777-0799.  






	Government Regulation






	We will be required to comply with all regulations, rules, and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to our business in any jurisdiction which we would conduct activities. We do not believe that regulation will have a material impact on the way we conduct our business.

	10,000,000 shares of common stock (direct)




	100









	(1) A beneficial owner of a security includes any person who, directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship, or otherwise has or shares: (i) voting power, which includes the power to vote, or to direct the voting of shares; and (ii) investment power, which includes the power to dispose or direct the disposition of shares. Certain shares may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares). In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire the shares (for example, upon exercise of an option) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares outstanding is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person (and only such person) by reason of these acquisition rights. As of January 31, 2016, there were 10,000,000 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding.








	Future sales by existing stockholders






	A total of 10,000,000 shares of common stock were issued to our sole officer and director, all of which are restricted securities, as defined in Rule 144 of the Rules and Regulations of the SEC promulgated under the Securities Act. Under Rule 144, the shares can be publicly sold, subject to volume restrictions and restrictions on the manner of sale. Such shares can only be sold after six months provided that the issuer of the securities is, and has been for a period of at least 90 days immediately before the sale, subject to the reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Shares purchased in this offering, which will be immediately resalable, and sales of all of our other shares after applicable restrictions expire, could have a depressive effect on the market price, if any, of our common stock and the shares we are offering.





	There is no public trading market for our common stock. To be quoted on the OTCBB a market maker must file an application on our behalf to make a market for our common stock. As of the date of this Registration Statement, we have not engaged a market maker to file such an application, that there is no guarantee that a market marker will file an application on our behalf, and that even if an application is filed, there is no guarantee that we will be accepted for quotation.

	PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION



	 


	We are registering 10,000,000 shares of our common stock for sale at the price of $0.01 per share.





	This is a self-underwritten offering, and Mr. Gitelman, our sole officer and director, will sell the shares directly to family, friends, business associates and acquaintances, with no commission or other remuneration payable to him for any shares they may sell. There are no plans or arrangements to enter into any contracts or agreements to sell the shares with a broker or dealer. In offering the securities on our behalf, he will rely on the safe harbor from broker dealer registration set out in Rule 3a4-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Mr. Gitelman will not register as a broker-dealer pursuant to Section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in reliance upon Rule 3a4-1, which sets forth those conditions, as noted herein, under which a person associated with an Issuer may participate in the offering of the Issuers securities and not be deemed to be a broker-dealer:



	1.


	Our sole officer and director is not subject to a statutory disqualification, as that term is defined in Section 3(a)(39) of the Act, at the time of his participation; and,



	2.


	Our sole officer and director will not be compensated in connection with his participation by the payment of commissions or other remuneration based either directly or indirectly on transactions in securities; and



	3.


	Our sole officer and director is not, nor will he be at the time of his participation in the offering, an associated person of a broker-dealer; and



	4.


	Our sole officer and director meets the conditions of paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of Rule 3a4-1 of the Exchange Act, in that he (A) primarily perform, or intend primarily to perform at the end of the offering, substantial duties for or on behalf of our company, other than in connection with transactions in securities; and (B) he is not a broker or dealer, or been an associated person of a broker or dealer, within the preceding twelve months; and (C) has not participated in selling and offering securities for any issuer more than once every twelve months other than in reliance on Paragraphs (a)(4)(i) or (a)(4)(iii). Under Paragraph 3a4-1(a)(4)(iii), our sole officer and director must restricts his participation to any one or more of the following activities:



	A.


	Preparing any written communication or delivering such communication through the mails or other means that does not involve oral solicitation by his of a potential purchaser; provided, however, that the content of such communication is approved by our sole officer and director;



	B.

	C.


	Performing ministerial and clerical work involved in effecting any transaction.





	Our sole officer and director does not intend to purchase any shares in this offering.





	This offering is self-underwritten, which means that it does not involve the participation of an underwriter or broker, and as a result, no broker for the sale of our securities will be used. In the event a broker-dealer is retained by us to participate in the offering, we must file a post-effective amendment to the registration statement to disclose the arrangements with the broker-dealer, and that the broker-dealer will be acting as an underwriter and will be so named in the prospectus. Additionally, FINRA must approve the terms of the underwriting compensation before the broker-dealer may participate in the offering.

	Page



















	To the extent required under the Securities Act, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement will be filed disclosing the name of any broker-dealers, the number of shares of common stock involved, the price at which the common stock is to be sold, the commissions paid or discounts or concessions allowed to such broker-dealers, where applicable, that such broker-dealers did not conduct any investigation to verify the information set out or incorporated by reference in this prospectus and other facts material to the transaction.





	We are subject to applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations under it, including, without limitation, Rule 10b-5 and a distribution participant under Regulation M. All of the foregoing may affect the marketability of the common stock.





	All expenses of the registration statement including, but not limited to, legal, accounting, printing and mailing fees are and will be borne by us. 






	Penny Stock Regulations






	You should note that our stock is a penny stock. The SEC has adopted Rule 15g-9 which generally defines "penny stock" to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and "accredited investors". The term "accredited investor" refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer's confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock.

	DIVIDEND POLICY



	 


	We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to finance the expansion of our business. As a result, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.


	 





	INDEMNIFICATION






	Under our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the corporation, we may indemnify an officer or director who is made a party to any proceeding, including a lawsuit, because of his position, if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in our best interest. We may advance expenses incurred in defending a proceeding. To the extent that the officer or director is successful on the merits in a proceeding as to which he is to be indemnified, we must indemnify him against all expenses incurred, including attorney's fees. With respect to a derivative action, indemnity may be made only for expenses actually and reasonably incurred in defending the proceeding, and if the officer or director is judged liable, only by a court order. The indemnification is intended to be to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the State of Nevada.





	Regarding indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, which may be permitted to directors or officers under Nevada law, we are informed that, in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, indemnification is against public policy, as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.

	Getelman Corp


	2235 E. Flamingo Rd, Suite 155


	Las Vegas, NV 89119





	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Getelman Corp. as of January 31, 2016, and the related statements of income, stockholders equity and cash flows for the period July 12, 2015 through January 31, 2016.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.  





	We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  





	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Getelman Corp.  as of January 31, 2016, and the related statements of income, stockholders equity and cash flows for the period July 12, 2015 through January 31, 2016, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  





	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.  As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered loss from operations that raises a substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.  The  financial  statements  do  not  include  any  adjustments  that  might  result  from  the outcome of this uncertainty.

	GETELMAN CORP.




	NOTES TO THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


	FOR THE PERIOD FROM INCEPTION (JULY 12, 2015) TO JANUARY 31, 2016








	NOTE 1  ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION


	 


	GETELMAN CORP. (the Company) is a corporation established under the corporation laws in the State of Nevada on July 12, 2015.





	The Company intends to commence operations in the business of corporate team building consulting service.





	The Companys activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including failure to secure additional funding to properly execute the companys business plan.





	The Company has adopted January 31 fiscal year end.






	Basis of Presentation



	 


	The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.





	NOTE 2  GOING CONCERN





	The Companys financial statements as of January 31, 2016 been prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred a cumulative net loss from inception (July 12, 2015) to January 31, 2016 of $1,025. These factors among others raise substantial doubt about the ability of the company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.  





	In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Managements plan is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking third party equity and/or debt financing. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. These financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.





	NOTE 3  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES






	Use of Estimates






	Preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Actual results and outcomes may differ from managements estimates and assumptions.









	F-6
















	Cash and Cash Equivalents






	For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company's bank accounts are deposited in insured institutions. The funds are insured up to $250,000. At January 31, 2016 the Company's bank deposits did not exceed the insured amounts.






	Advertising Costs



	The Companys policy regarding advertising is to expense advertising when incurred. The Company incurred advertising expense of $0 during year ended January 31, 2016.






	Basic and Diluted Loss Per Share






	Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period.  Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.






	Stock-Based Compensation






	As of January 31, 20156, the Company has not issued any stock-based payments to its employees.


	Stock-based compensation is accounted for at fair value in accordance with ASC 718, when applicable.  To date, the Company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options.






	Income Taxes






	The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes.  Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values and their respective income tax basis (temporary differences).  The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.






	New Accounting Pronouncements






	There were various accounting standards and interpretations issued recently, none of which are expected to a have a material impact on our financial position, operations or cash flows.






	Subsequent Events






	The Company has evaluated all transactions from January 31, 2016 through the financial statement issuance date for subsequent event disclosure consideration.





	NOTE 4  CAPTIAL STOCK





	The Company has 75,000,000 shares of common stock authorized with a par value of $0.001 per share.





	NOTE 5  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS


	 


	In support of the Companys efforts and cash requirements, it may rely on advances from related parties until such time that the Company can support its operations or attains adequate financing through sales of its equity or traditional debt financing. There is no formal written commitment for continued support by officers, directors, or shareholders. Amounts represent advances or amounts paid in satisfaction of liabilities. The advances are considered temporary in nature and have not been formalized by a promissory note.  





	Since July 12, 2015 (Inception) through January 31, 2016, the Companys sole officer and director loaned the Company $2,172 to pay for incorporation costs and operating expenses.  As of January 31, 2016, the amount outstanding was $2,172. The loan is non-interest bearing, due upon demand and unsecured.


	 


	NOTE 6  INCOME TAX





	As of January 31, 2016 the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of $1,616 that may be available to reduce future years taxable income through 2036. Future tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have not been recognized in these financial statements, as their realization is determined not likely to occur and accordingly, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to these tax loss carry-forwards.

	PROSPECTUS




	THE INFORMATION IN THIS PROSPECTUS MAY BE CHANGED. THESE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE SOLD UNTIL THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION IS EFFECTIVE. THIS PROSPECTUS IS NOT AN OFFER TO SELL THESE SECURITIES AND IT IS NOT SOLICITING AN OFFER TO BUY THESE SECURITIES IN ANY STATE WHERE THE OFFER OR SALE IS NOT PERMITTED. THERE IS NO MINIMUM PURCHASE REQUIREMENT FOR THE OFFERING TO PROCEED.



	 



	GETELMAN CORP.




	10,000,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK




	$0.01 PER SHARE






	This is the initial offering of common stock of Getelman Corp. and no public market currently exists for the securities being offered. We are registering for sale a total of 10,000,000 shares of common stock at a fixed price of $0.01 per share to the general public in best efforts offering. We estimate our total offering registration costs to be approximately $8,000. There is no minimum number of shares that must be sold by us for the offering to proceed, and we will retain the proceeds from the sale of any of the offered shares. The offering is being conducted on a self-underwritten, best efforts basis, which means our President, Mark Gitelman, will attempt to sell the shares. We are making this offering without the involvement of underwriters or broker-dealers.





	This Prospectus will permit our President to sell the shares directly to the public, with no commission or other remuneration payable to him for any shares he may sell. Mr. Gitelman will sell all the shares registered herein. In offering the securities on our behalf, he will rely on the safe harbor from broker-dealer registration set out in Rule 3a4-1 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. The shares will be offered at a fixed price of $0.01 per share for a period of two hundred and forty (240) days from the effective date of this prospectus. The offering shall terminate on the earlier of (i) when the offering period ends (240 days from the effective date of this prospectus), (ii) the date when the sale of all 10,000,000 shares is completed, (iii) when the Board of Directors decides that it is in the best interest of the Company to terminate the offering prior the completion of the sale of all 10,000,000 shares registered under the Registration Statement of which this Prospectus is part. 







	Getelman Corp. is a development stage company and has recently started its operations. To date we have been involved primarily in organizational activities. We do not have sufficient capital to commence operations. Any investment in the shares offered herein involves a high degree of risk. You should only purchase shares if you can afford the loss of your investment. Our independent registered public accountant has issued an audit opinion which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.





	There has been no market for our securities and a public market may never develop, or, if any market does develop, it may not be sustained. Our common stock is not traded on any exchange or on the over-the-counter market. After the effective date of the registration statement relating to this prospectus, we hope to have a market maker file an application with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) for our common stock to be eligible for trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. To be eligible for quotation, issuers must remain current in their quarterly and annual filings with the SEC. If we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board. We do not yet have a market maker who has agreed to file such application. There can be no assurance that our common stock will ever be quoted on a stock exchange or a quotation service or that any market for our stock will develop.





	We are an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act).








	THE PURCHASE OF THE SECURITIES OFFERED THROUGH THIS PROSPECTUS INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY READ AND CONSIDER THE SECTION OF THIS PROSPECTUS ENTITLED RISK FACTORS ON PAGES 7 THROUGH 15 BEFORE BUYING ANY SHARES OF GETELMAN CORP.S COMMON STOCK.









	NEITHER THE SEC NOR ANY STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION HAS APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED OF THESE SECURITIES OR PASSED UPON THE ADEQUACY OR ACCURACY OF THIS PROSPECTUS. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.







	THE INFORMATION IN THIS PROSPECTUS IS NOT COMPLETE AND MAY BE CHANGED. WE MAY NOT SELL THESE SECURITIES UNTIL THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION IS EFFECTIVE. THIS PROSPECTUS IS NOT AN OFFER TO SELL THESE SECURITIES AND IT IS NOT SOLICITING AN OFFER TO BUY THESE SECURITIES IN ANY STATE WHERE THE OFFER OR SALE IS NOT PERMITTED.

	PROSPECTUS SUMMARY



	 



	AS USED IN THIS PROSPECTUS, UNLESS THE CONTEXT OTHERWISE REQUIRES, WE, US, OUR, AND GETELMAN CORP. REFERS TO GETELMAN CORP. THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY DOES NOT CONTAIN ALL OF THE INFORMATION THAT MAY BE IMPORTANT TO YOU. YOU SHOULD READ THE ENTIRE PROSPECTUS BEFORE MAKING AN INVESTMENT DECISION TO PURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK.



	 



	GETELMAN CORP.



	 


	Getelman Corp. was incorporated in Nevada on July 12, 2015. We are development stage company and intend to commence operations in the business consuting with specialization in team-building activities and events in order to establish strong sense of unity between co-workers.  We plan to deliver our services to recently incorporated and/ or well-established enterprises. Our companys main objective is to fulfill the need of the small and medium sized businesses to organize and carry out corporate events for team-building and entertaining purposes.





	We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to develop our business operations (See Description of Business and Use of Proceeds). To implement our plan of operations we require a minimum of $42,000 for the next twelve months as described in our Plan of Operations. There is no assurance that we will generate any revenue in the first 12 months after completion our offering or ever generate any revenue.





	Being a development stage company, we have very limited operating history. If we do not generate any revenue we may need a minimum of $10,000 of additional funding to pay for ongoing SEC filing requirements. We do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing. Our principal executive offices are located at 2235 E. Flamingo Rd., Suite 355, Las Vegas, NV 89119. Our phone number is 725-777-0799.



	From inception (July 12, 2015) until the date of this filing, we have had limited operating activities. Our financial statements from inception (July 12, 2015) through January 31, 2016, reports no revenue and a net loss of $1,616. Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit opinion for Getelman Corp., which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. To date, we have developed our business plan and developed business-model of our company.





	As of the date of this prospectus, there is no public trading market for our common stock and no assurance that a trading market for our securities will ever develop.





	Proceeds from this offering are required for us to proceed with your business plan over the next twelve months. We require minimum funding of approximately $42,000 to conduct our proposed operations and pay all expenses for a minimum period of one year including expenses associated with this offering and maintaining a reporting status with the SEC. If we are unable to obtain minimum funding of approximately $42,000, our business may fail. Since we are presently in the development stage of our business, we can provide no assurance that we will successfully sell any products or services related to our planned activities.

	RISK FACTORS



	 



	AN INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE RISKS DESCRIBED BELOW AND THE OTHER INFORMATION IN THIS PROSPECTUS BEFORE INVESTING IN OUR COMMON STOCK. IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS OCCUR, OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE SERIOUSLY HARMED. THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK, WHEN AND IF WE TRADE AT A LATER DATE, COULD DECLINE DUE TO ANY OF THESE RISKS, AND YOU MAY LOSE ALL OR PART OF YOUR INVESTMENT.









	RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS









	BECAUSE OUR AUDITORS HAVE RAISED A GOING CONCERN, THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTY THAT WE WILL CONTINUE OPERATIONS IN WHICH CASE YOU COULD LOSE YOUR INVESTMENT.






	Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty about our ability to continue in business. As such we may have to cease operations and you could lose your investment.

	WE ARE SOLELY DEPENDENT UPON THE FUNDS TO BE RAISED IN THIS OFFERING TO START OUR BUSINESS, THE PROCEEDS OF WHICH MAY BE INSUFFICIENT TO ACHIEVE REVENUES AND PROFITABLE OPERATIONS. WE MAY NEED TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING WHICH MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE.



	 


	Our current operating funds are less than necessary to complete our intended operations. We need the proceeds from this offering to start our operations as described in the Plan of Operation section of this prospectus. As of January 31, 2016, we had cash in the amount of $10,056 and liabilities of $2,172. As of this date, we have no income and just recently started our operation. The proceeds of this offering may not be sufficient for us to achieve revenues and profitable operations. We need additional funds to achieve a sustainable sales level where ongoing operations can be funded out of revenues. There is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us.





	We require minimum funding of approximately $42,000 to conduct our proposed operations for a period of one year. If we are not able to raise this amount, or if we experience a shortage of funds prior to funding we may utilize funds from Mark Gitelman, our sole officer and director, who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for professional fees, including fees payable in connection with the filing of this registration statement and operation expenses. However, Mr. Gitelman has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. After one year we may need additional financing. If we do not generate any revenue we may need a minimum of $10,000 of additional funding to pay for ongoing SEC filing requirements. We do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing.


	 


	If we are successful in raising the funds from this offering, we plan to commence activities to continue our operations. We cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funds to continue our business plan according to our plan of operations.









	WE MAY CONTINUE TO LOSE MONEY, AND IF WE DO NOT ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE OUR BUSINESS.






	We are company with limited operations, have incurred expenses and have losses. In addition, we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses. As a result, we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability, which may not occur. We expect our operating expenses to increase as a result of our planned expansion. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may be unable to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. We expect to have quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in revenues, expenses, losses and cash flow, some of which could be significant. Results of operations will depend upon numerous factors, some beyond our control, including regulatory actions, market acceptance of our products and services, new products and service introductions, and competition.

	WE ARE A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY AND HAVE COMMENCED LIMITED OPERATIONS IN OUR BUSINESS. WE EXPECT TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT OPERATING LOSSES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

	 





	We were incorporated on July 12, 2015 and to date have been involved primarily in organizational activities. We have commenced limited business operations. Accordingly, we have no way to evaluate the likelihood that our business will be successful. Potential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by new companies and the high rate of failure of such enterprises. The likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays encountered in connection with the operations that we plan to undertake. These potential problems include, but are not limited to, unanticipated problems relating to the ability to generate sufficient cash flow to operate our business, and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates. We anticipate that we will incur increased operating expenses without realizing any revenues. We expect to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future. We recognize that if the effectiveness of our business plan is not forthcoming, we will not be able to continue business operations. There is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful, and it is doubtful that we will generate any operating revenues or ever achieve profitable operations. If we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks, our business will most likely fail.








	WE HAVE LIMITED SALES AND MARKETING EXPERIENCE, WHICH INCREASES THE RISK THAT OUR BUSINESS WILL FAIL.




	 



	We have no experience in the marketing of business consulting and event planning company, and have only nominal sales and marketing experience. Our future success will depend, among other factors, upon whether our services can be sold at a profitable price and the extent to which consumers acquire, adopt, and continue to use them. There can be no assurance that our business will gain wide acceptance in its targeted markets or that we will be able to effectively market our services.






	WE ARE IN A COMPETITIVE MARKET WHICH COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO GAIN MARKET SHARE WHICH COULD HARM OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.





	 




	The business of niche of business consulting and event planning services is very competitive. Barriers to entry are relatively low, and we face competitive pressures from companies anxious to join this niche. There are a number of successful business consulting and event planning companies that offer similar niche services, which may prevent us from gaining enough market share to become successful.  These competitors have existing customers that may form a large part of our targeted client base, and such clients may be hesitant to switch over from already established competitors to our service.  If we cannot gain enough market share, our business and our financial performance will be adversely affected.

	SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS MAY BE ABLE TO USE THEIR FINANCIAL STRENGTH TO DOMINATE THE MARKET, WHICH MAY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUES.



	Some of our competitors may be much larger companies than us and very well capitalized. They could choose to use their greater resources to finance their continued participation and penetration of this market, which may impede our ability to generate sufficient revenue to cover our costs. Their better financial resources could allow them to significantly out spend us on research and development, as well as marketing and production. We might not be able to maintain our ability to compete in this circumstance.






	WE CANNOT GUARANTEE FUTURE CUSTOMERS. EVEN IF WE OBTAIN CUSTOMERS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO GENERATE A PROFIT. IF THAT OCCURS WE WILL HAVE TO CEASE OPERATIONS.






	We have not identified any customers and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to attract future customers. Even if we obtain new customers for our service, there is no guarantee that we will make a profit. If we are unable to attract enough customers to operate profitably, we will have to suspend or cease operations.






	BECAUSE WE ARE SMALL AND DO NOT HAVE MUCH CAPITAL, OUR MARKETING CAMPAIGN MAY NOT BE ENOUGH TO ATTRACT SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS TO OPERATE PROFITABLY. IF WE DO NOT MAKE A PROFIT, WE WILL SUSPEND OR CEASE OPERATIONS.






	Due to the fact we are small and do not have much capital, we must limit our marketing activities and may not be able to make our services known to potential customers. Because we will be limiting our marketing activities, we may not be able to attract enough customers to operate profitably. If we cannot operate profitably, we may have to suspend or cease operations.






	BECAUSE OUR SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR WILL OWN MORE THAN 50% OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK, HE WILL MAKE AND CONTROL CORPORATE DECISIONS THAT MAY BE DISADVANTAGEOUS TO MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS.






	Mr. Gitelman, our sole officer and director, will own more than 50% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Accordingly, he will have significant influence in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters, including the election of directors, mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and also the power to prevent or cause a change in control. The interests of Mr. Gitelman may differ from the interests of the other stockholders and may result in corporate decisions that are disadvantageous to other shareholders.

	WE DEPEND TO A SIGNIFICANT EXTENT ON CERTAIN KEY PERSON, THE LOSS OF WHOM MAY MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COMPANY.






	Currently, we have only one employee who is also our sole officer and director. We depend entirely on Mark Gitelman for all of our operations. The loss of Mr. Gitelman would have a substantial negative effect on our company and may cause our business to fail. Mr. Gitelman has not been compensated for his services since our incorporation, and it is highly unlikely that he will receive any compensation unless and until we generate substantial revenues. There is intense competition for skilled personnel and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel on acceptable terms. The loss of Mr. Gitelmans services could prevent us from completing the development of our plan of operation and our business. In the event of the loss of services of such personnel, no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain the services of adequate replacement personnel.





	We do not have any employment agreements or maintain key person life insurance policies on our officer and director. We do not anticipate entering into employment agreements with him or acquiring key man insurance in the foreseeable future.






	BECAUSE OUR SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR WILL ONLY BE DEVOTING LIMITED TIME TO OUR OPERATIONS, OUR OPERATIONS MAY BE SPORADIC WHICH MAY RESULT IN PERIODIC INTERRUPTIONS OR SUSPENSIONS OF OPERATIONS. THIS ACTIVITY COULD PREVENT US FROM ATTRACTING ENOUGH CUSTOMERS AND RESULT IN A LACK OF REVENUES WHICH MAY CAUSE US TO CEASE OPERATIONS.






	Mark Gitelman, our sole officer and director will only be devoting limited time to our operations. He will be devoting approximately 20 hours a week to our operations. Because our sole office and director will only be devoting limited time to our operations, our operations may be sporadic and occur at times which are convenient to him. As a result, operations may be periodically interrupted or suspended which could result in a lack of revenues and a possible cessation of operations.






	OUR SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR HAS NO EXPERIENCE MANAGING A PUBLIC COMPANY WHICH IS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN DISCLOSURE CONTROL AND PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.






	We have never operated as a public company. Mark Gitelman, our sole officer and director has no experience managing a public company which is required to establish and maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. As a result, we may not be able to operate successfully as a public company, even if our operations are successful. We plan to comply with all of the various rules and regulations, which are required for a public company that is reporting company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. However, if we cannot operate successfully as a public company, your investment may be materially adversely affected.

	WE ARE AN EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY UNDER THE JOBS ACT, AND WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN IF THE REDUCED DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO EMERGING GROWTH COMPANIES WILL MAKE OUR COMMON STOCK LESS ATTRACTIVE TO INVESTORS.






	We qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to:





	-


	have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;


	-


	provide an auditor attestation with respect to managements report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting;


	-


	comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditors report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);


	-


	submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as say-on-pay and say-on-frequency; and


	-


	disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the Chief Executives compensation to median employee compensation.


	 


	In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.





	We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues is $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates is $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.





	Until such time, however, we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.

	RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS OFFERING









	BECAUSE THE OFFERING PRICE HAS BEEN ARBITRARILY SET BY THE COMPANY, YOU MAY NOT REALIZE A RETURN ON YOUR INVESTMENT UPON RESALE OF YOUR SHARES.



	 


	The offering price and other terms and conditions relative to the Companys shares have been arbitrarily determined by us and do not bear any relationship to assets, earnings, book value or any other objective financial criteria. Additionally, as the Company was formed on July 12, 2015, and has only a limited operating history with no earnings, the price of the offered shares is not based on its past earnings, and no investment banker, appraiser, or other independent third party, has been consulted concerning the offering price for the shares or the fairness of the offering price used for the shares, as such our stockholders may not be able to receive a return on their investment when they sell their shares of common stock.






	WE ARE SELLING THIS OFFERING WITHOUT AN UNDERWRITER AND MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL ANY SHARES.



	 


	This offering is self-underwritten, that is, we are not going to engage the services of an underwriter to sell the shares; we intend to sell our shares through our President, who will receive no commissions. There is no guarantee that he will be able to sell any of the shares. Unless he is successful in receiving the proceeds in the amount of $100,000 from this offering, we may have to seek alternative financing to implement our business plan.






	THE REGULATION OF PENNY STOCKS BY THE SEC AND FINRA MAY DISCOURAGE THE TRADABILITY OF THE COMPANY'S SECURITIES.



	 


	The shares being offered are defined as a penny stock under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and rules of the Commission. The Exchange Act and such penny stock rules generally impose additional sales practice and disclosure requirements on broker-dealers who sell our securities to persons other than certain accredited investors who are, generally, institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 ($300,000 jointly with spouse), or in transactions not recommended by the broker-dealer. For transactions covered by the penny stock rules, a broker dealer must make certain mandated disclosures in penny stock transactions, including the actual sale or purchase price and actual bid and offer quotations, the compensation to be received by the broker-dealer and certain associated persons, and deliver certain disclosures required by the Commission. Consequently, the penny stock rules may make it difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase, if at all.

	OUR PRESIDENT, MR. GITELMAN DOES NOT HAVE ANY PRIOR EXPERIENCE OFFERING AND SELLING SECURITIES , AND OUR OFFERING DOES NOT REQUIRE A MIMIMUM AMOUNT TO BE RAISED. AS A RESULT OF THIS WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RAISE ENOUGH FUNDS TO COMMENCE AND SUSTAIN OUR BUSINESS AND INVESTORS MAY LOSE THEIR ENTIRE INVESTMENT.






	Mr. Gitelman does not have any experience conducting a securities offering. Consequently, we may not be able to raise any funds successfully. Also, the best effort offering does not require a minimum amount to be raised. If we are not able to raise sufficient funds, we may not be able to fund our operations as planned, and our business will suffer and your investment may be materially adversely affected. Our inability to successfully conduct a best-effort offering could be the basis of your losing your entire investment in us.








	DUE TO THE LACK OF A TRADING MARKET FOR OUR SECURITIES, YOU MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY SELLING ANY SHARES YOU PURCHASE IN THIS OFFERING.



	We are not registered on any market or public stock exchange. There is presently no demand for our common stock and no public market exists for the shares being offered in this prospectus. We plan to contact a market maker immediately following the completion of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board (OTCBB). The OTCBB is a regulated quotation service that displays real-time quotes, last sale prices and volume information in over-the-counter securities. The OTCBB is not an issuer listing service, market or exchange. Although the OTCBB does not have any listing requirements, to be eligible for quotation on the OTCBB, issuers must remain current in their filings with the SEC or applicable regulatory authority. If we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board. Market makers are not permitted to begin quotation of a security whose issuer does not meet this filing requirement. Securities already quoted on the OTCBB that become delinquent in their required filings will be removed following a 30 to 60 day grace period if they do not make their required filing during that time. We cannot guarantee that our application will be accepted or approved and our stock listed and quoted for sale. As of the date of this filing, there have been no discussions or understandings between Getelman Corp. and anyone acting on our behalf, with any market maker regarding participation in a future trading market for our securities. If no market is ever developed for our common stock, it will be difficult for you to sell any shares you purchase in this offering. In such a case, you may find that you are unable to achieve any benefit from your investment or liquidate your shares without considerable delay, if at all. In addition, if we fail to have our common stock quoted on a public trading market, your common stock will not have a quantifiable value and it may be difficult, if not impossible, to ever resell your shares, resulting in an inability to realize any value from your investment.

	WE WILL INCUR ONGOING COSTS AND EXPENSES FOR SEC REPORTING AND COMPLIANCE. WITHOUT REVENUE WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE, MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR INVESTORS TO SELL THEIR SHARES, IF AT ALL.



	 


	The estimated cost of this registration statement is $8,000 which will be paid from offering proceeds. If the offering proceeds are less than registration cost, we will have to utilize funds from Mark Gitelman, our sole officer and director, who has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process. Mr. Gitelmans verbal agreement to provide us loans for registration costs is non- binding and discretionary. After the effective date of this prospectus, we will be required to file annual, quarterly and current reports, or other information with the SEC as provided by the Securities Exchange Act. We will voluntarily continue reporting in the absence of an SEC reporting obligation. We plan to contact a market maker immediately following the close of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board. To be eligible for quotation, issuers must remain current in their filings with the SEC. In order for us to remain in compliance we will require future revenues to cover the cost of these filings, which could comprise a substantial portion of our available cash resources. The costs associated with being a publicly traded company in the next 12 month will be approximately $10,000. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to remain in compliance it may be difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase, if at all. Also, if we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board.











	THE COMPANY'S INVESTORS MAY SUFFER FUTURE DILUTION DUE TO ISSUANCES OF SHARES FOR VARIOUS CONSIDERATIONS IN THE FUTURE.



	Our Articles of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of 75,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of which 10,000,000 shares are currently issued and outstanding. If we sell the 10,000,000 shares being offered in this offering, we would have 20,000,000 shares issued and outstanding. As discussed in the Dilution section below, the issuance of the shares of common stock described in this prospectus will result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common stock held by our existing shareholders. The issuance of common stock for future services or acquisitions or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by our investors, and might have an adverse effect on any trading market for our common stock.









	FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS



	 


	This prospectus contains forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. We use words such as anticipate, believe, plan, expect, future, intend, and similar expressions to identify such forward-looking statements. Investors should be aware that all forward-looking statements contained within this filing are good faith estimates of management as of the date of this filing. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the risks faced by us as described in the Risk Factors section and elsewhere in this prospectus.

The following table sets forth the uses of proceeds assuming the sale of 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of the securities offered for sale by the Company.

	The above figures represent only estimated costs. The estimated cost of this registration statement is $8,000 which will be paid from offering proceeds. If the offering proceeds are less than registration costs, Mark Gitelman, our president and director, has verbally agreed to loan the Company funds to complete the registration process. Mr. Gitelmans verbal agreement to provide us loans for registration costs is non- binding and discretionary. Also, these loans would be necessary if the proceeds from this offering will not be sufficient to implement our business plan and maintain reporting status and quotation on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board when and if our common stocks become eligible for trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. Mr. Gitelman will not be paid any compensation or anything from the proceeds of this offering. There is no due date for the repayment of the funds advanced by Mr. Gitelman. Mr. Gitelman will be repaid from revenues of operations if and when we generate revenues to pay the obligation.






	DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE



	 


	The offering price of the shares has been determined arbitrarily by us. The price does not bear any relationship to our assets, book value, earnings, or other established criteria for valuing a privately held company. In determining the number of shares to be offered and the offering price, we took into consideration our cash on hand and the amount of money we would need to implement our business plan. Accordingly, the offering price should not be considered an indication of the actual value of the securities.

	DILUTION



	 


	Dilution represents the difference between the Offering price and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of this Offering. Net tangible book value is the amount that results from subtracting total liabilities and from total assets. Dilution arises mainly as a result of our arbitrary determination of the Offering price of the shares being offered. Dilution of the value of the shares you purchase is also a result of the lower book value of the shares held by our existing stockholder.





	As of January 31, 2016, Total Stockholders' Equity was $8,384. On January 6, 2016 we sold 10,000,000 shares of common stocks to our sole officer and director, at a price of $0.001 per share, for net proceeds of $10,000.






	If 100% of the Shares Are Sold:






	Upon completion of this offering, in the event all of the shares are sold, the net tangible book value of the 20,000,000 shares to be outstanding will be $100,384 or approximately $0.005 per share. The net tangible book value per share prior to the offering is $0,0008. The net tangible book value of the shares held by our existing stockholders will be decreased by $0.0042 per share without any additional investment on their part. Investors in the offering will incur an immediate dilution from $0.01 per share to $0.005 per share.





	After completion of this offering, if 10,000,000 shares are sold, investors in the offering will own 50% of the total number of shares then outstanding for which they will have made cash investment of $100,000 or $0.01 per share. Our existing stockholder will own 50% of the total number of shares then outstanding, for which he has made contributions of cash totalling $10,000 or $0.001 per share.






	If 75% of the Shares Are Sold






	Upon completion of this offering, in the event 7,500,000 shares are sold, the net tangible book value of the 17,500,000 shares to be outstanding will be $75,384, or approximately $0.0043 per share. The net tangible book value per share prior to the offering is $0,0008. The net tangible book value of the shares held by our existing stockholders will be decreased by $0.0035 per share without any additional investment on their part. Investors in the offering will incur an immediate dilution from $0.01 per share to $0.0057 per share.





	After completion of this offering investors in the offering will own approximately 42.86% of the total number of shares then outstanding for which they will have made cash investment of $75,000, or $0.01 per share. Our existing stockholder will own approximately 57.14% of the total number of shares then outstanding, for which he has made contributions of cash totaling $10,000 or $0.001 per share.






	If 50% of the Shares Are Sold






	Upon completion of this offering, in the event 5,000,000 shares are sold, the net tangible book value of the 15,000,000 shares to be outstanding will be $50,384 or approximately $0.0034 per share. The net tangible book value per share prior to the offering is $0,0008. The net tangible book value of the shares held by our existing stockholders will be decreased by $0.0026 per share without any additional investment on their part. Investors in the offering will incur an immediate dilution from $0.01 per share to $0.0066 per share.





	After completion of this offering investors in the offering will own approximately 33.33% of the total number of shares then outstanding for which they will have made cash investment of $50,000, or $0.01 per share. Our existing stockholder will own approximately 66.67% of the total number of shares then outstanding, for which he has made contributions of cash totaling $10,000 or $0.001 per share.

	MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION



	You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this prospectus. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this prospectus, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the Risk Factors section of this prospectus for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.





	We qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to:


	 











	 




	




	 




	have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;
















	




	 




	provide an auditor attestation with respect to managements report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting;

















	 




	




	 




	comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditors report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);





	 











	 




	




	 




	submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as say-on-pay and say-on-frequency; and





	 











	 




	




	 




	disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEOs compensation to median employee compensation.





	 


	In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.





	We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues is $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates is $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.

	Our cash balance was $10,056 as of January 31, 2016. We believe our cash balance is not sufficient to fund our operations for any period of time. We have been utilizing and may utilize funds from Mark Gitelman, our Chairman and President, who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for offering costs, filing fees, and professional fees. As of January 31, 2016, Mr. Gitelman has advanced to us $2,172. Mr. Gitelman, however, has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. In order to implement our plan of operations for the next twelve month period, we require a minimum of $42,000 of funding from this offering. Being a development stage company, we have very limited operating history we do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing. Our principal executive offices are located at 2235 E. Flamingo Rd., Suite 355, Las Vegas, NV 89119. Our phone number is 725-777-0799.





	We are a development stage company and we have generated no revenue to date. Our full business plan entails activities described in the Plan of Operation section below. Long term financing beyond the maximum aggregate amount of this offering may be required to expand our business. The exact amount of funding will depend on the scale of our development and expansion. We do not currently have planned our expansion, and we have not decided yet on the scale of our development and expansion and on exact amount of funding needed for our long term financing. If we do not generate any revenue we may need a minimum of $10,000 of additional funding at the end of the twelve month period described in our Plan of Operation below to maintain a reporting status.





	Our independent registered public accountant has issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. This is because we have not generated revenues and no revenues are anticipated until we complete our initial business development. There is no assurance we will ever reach that stage.





	To meet our need for cash we are attempting to raise money from this offering. If we are unable to successfully find customers we may quickly use up the proceeds from this offering and will need to find alternative sources. At the present time, we have not made any arrangements to raise additional cash, other than through this offering.





	If we need additional cash and cannot raise it, we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash, or cease operations entirely. Even if we raise $100,000 from this offering, we may need more funds for ongoing business operations after the first year, and would have to obtain additional funding.

	PLAN OF OPERATION






	We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 12, 2015. We have never declared bankruptcy, have never been in receivership, and have never been involved in any legal action or proceedings. Since incorporation, we have not made any significant purchase or sale of assets. We are a development stage company that has not generated any revenue and just recently started our operations. If we are unable to successfully find clients who will use our service, we may quickly use up the proceeds from this offering.





	We intend to commence operations in the business consuting with specialization in team-building activities and events in order to establish strong sense of unity between co-workers.  We plan to deliver our services to recently incorporated and/ or well-established enterprises. Our companys main objective is to fulfill the need of the small and medium sized businesses to organize and carry out corporate events for team-building and entertaining purposes.





	We intend to spend money on research and development when our business plan is complete in order to develop our business. We do not expect to purchase or sell plant or significant equipment. Further we do not expect significant changes in the number of employees.





	Our plan of operations is as follows:







	Complete Our Public Offering







	We expect to complete our public offering within 240 days after the effectiveness of our registration statement by the Securities and Exchange Commissions. We intend to concentrate our efforts on raising capital during this period. Our operations will be limited due to the limited amount of funds on hand. Upon completion of our public offering, our specific goal is to profitably sell our services. If we are unable to obtain minimum funding of approximately $42,000 (If 50% of the shares sold), our business may fail.





	Our plan of operations following the completion is as follows:







	Office Leasing




	Time Frame: 1st-12th months.


	Costs: $3,000.





	We are leasing the office at 2235 E. Flamingo Rd., Suite 355, Las Vegas, NV 89119 since November 9, 2015. Our yearly leasing fees are approximately $3,000.







	Furnishing and equipping the premises






	Time Frame: 1st-3d months


	Costs: $4,000-$9,000









	21 |

	Page










	As our company intends to work in the corporate segment, we feel that its the reason why the office must have decently presentable appearance. For this purpose and for successful operation, as well, the company is likely to need an office equipped with computers, multifunctional printers, a land phone, mobile phones, headsets for managers to take calls via skype and similar VoIP services, a flat screen TV (or a white  screen and a projector) for demonstration purposes which will help to gauge customer interest in our services, office furniture and office supplies, furniture for customers, such as sofas, chairs or armchairs. In case we are able to sell only 50% of shares issued, we plan to equip the office with basic furniture and basic supplies, multifunctional printer and the computers to handle the everyday operations, a phone, 19 flat screen TV installed for the customers and coupled with a computer to play edited video snippets or demonstrate photos from the event already taken place, comfortable chairs for the customers. We believe the cost to be around $4,000. In case 75% issued shares are sold, we might look forward to purchase 23 TV panel, armchairs for the customers, decent furniture for the employees, print advertizing posters to place them around the office. The total cost is estimated to be $7,000. If we sell all of the shares offered we plan to buy 60 LED panel for outdoor and indoor demonstration purposes, comfortable furniture for the employees, handsets to receive and perform phone calls, a white screen and a projector for both in-office and onsite presentations, comfortable furniture for the customers (sofas and arm chairs), and other equipment which makes office environment customer-friendly and enhances working experience of our employees (such as water dispensers, coffee machines etc.) The total cost of this is estimated to be around $9,000.







	Additional Equipment




	Time Frame: 1st-4th months


	Costs: $5,000-$15,000





	Additional equipment - photo and video cameras to film the corporate events. Additional props - inflating equipment, inflatable structures (mattresses, castles, toys), foam plastic, polyurethane foam, protective equipment (hard caps, knee/elbow hard covers, kernmantle and other climbing gear). We plan it will cost for us $5,000 minimum.







	Website Development




	Time Frame: 3st-6th months


	Costs: $3,000-$5,000





	We anticipate that the website will become one of the element to boost our sales along with our marketing campaign, and to demonstrate our clients the features of our services through advertising videos and photos taken during the events carried out by our company. In addition, we plan to post samples of the scripts or their excerpts to demonstrate versatility of our services and their applicability to the needs of a particular customer. We expect that altogether it will help to gauge interest in our services. In case we sell 50% of the shares we plan to develop a web page built on free engines like Wordpress or Joomla. If 75% of the shares are sold we plan to develop additional landing page with limited functions. If we sell 100% of the shares offered we plan to develop full-functioning website with using flash and HTML 5 technologies.

	Page












	Marketing Campaign and Advertising




	Time Frame: 5st-12th months


	Costs: $10,000-$28,000








	We intend to advertise via the Internet, prior to other possible ways of advertising. We plan to advertise our service through:


	- Online advertisements.


	- SEO (Search Engines Optimization).


	- Radio commercials.


	- Printed advertisement.


	- Advertising through companies selling recreational tours


	- Direct calls or emails


	We expect it to cost at least $10,000. If we sell all of the shares offerd we plan to spend minimum $28,000.









	Employees




	Time Frame: 8st-12th months


	Costs: $7,000-$22,000





	Staff is considered one of our most important investment. The employees are expected to represent the company, its philosophy and follow the corporate strategy while interacting with the clients or their representatives, and also while hosting the events in front of client companys employees. We intend to make efforts in hiring professionals skillful at planning, writing scripts, coordinating, and hosting events. Thus, we intend to look for creative writers, managers and performers (MCs, hosts, and actors). In case 50% shares sold we are likely to afford hiring a creative writer, and a manager, whose other duties will be to communicate to clients, or person to combine those two positions until we raise funds to complete hiring process. The duties of hosting event will have to be delegated to the third parties, who offer to hire entertainers and actors. If 75% shares sold we might add the managing staff and to look forward hiring our own performers and entertainers. If 100% shares sold we would be able to afford to complete the team with sales-managers, props team and drivers.

	OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS



	 


	We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.






	LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY; NEED FOR ADDITIONAL CAPITAL



	 


	There is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in the start-up stage of operations and have not generated any revenues. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products.


	We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholder.






	Results of operations








	From Inception on July 12, 2015 to January 31, 2016.







	During the period we incorporated the company, prepared a business plan. Our loss since inception is $1,616. We have just recently started our business operations, however, will not start significant operations until we have completed this offering.









	LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES



	 


	As of January 31, 2016, the Company had $10,056 cash and our liabilities were $2,172, comprising $2,172 owed to Mark Gitelman, our sole officer and director. As of January 31, 2016 our cash balance was $10,056. The available capital reserves of the Company are not sufficient for the Company to remain operational. We require minimum funding of approximately $42,000 to conduct our proposed operations and pay all expenses for a minimum period of one year including expenses associated with this offering and maintaining a reporting status with the SEC.





	Since inception, we have sold 10,000,000 shares of common stocks to our sole officer and director, at a price of $0.001 per share, for net proceeds of $10,000.





	We are attempting to raise funds to proceed with our plan of operations. We will have to utilize funds from Mark Gitelman, our sole officer and director, who has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process if offering proceeds are less than registration costs. However, Mr. Gitelman has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. Mr. Gitelmans verbal agreement to provide us loans for registration costs is non- binding and discretionary. To proceed with our operations within 12 months, we need a minimum of $42,000. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to sell all the shares required to satisfy our 12 month financial requirements. If we are successful, any money raised will be applied to the items set forth in the Use of Proceeds section of this prospectus. We will attempt to raise at least the minimum funds necessary to proceed with our plan of operations. In the long term we may need additional financing. We do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing. Obtaining additional funding will be subject to a number of factors, including general market conditions, investor acceptance of our business plan and initial results from our business operations. These factors may impact the timing, amount, terms or conditions of additional financing available to us. There is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us.









	24 |

	Page










	Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion, meaning that there is substantial doubt if we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital. No substantial revenues are anticipated until we have completed the financing from this offering and implemented our plan of operations. Our only source for cash at this time is investments by others in this offering. We must raise cash to implement our strategy and stay in business. The amount of the offering will likely allow us to operate for at least one year and have the capital resources required to cover the material costs with becoming a publicly reporting. The Company anticipates over the next 12 months the cost of being a reporting public company will be approximately $10,000.







	The Company will have to meet all the financial disclosure and reporting requirements associated with being a publicly reporting company. The Companys management will have to spend additional time on policies and procedures to make sure it is compliant with various regulatory requirements, especially that of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This additional corporate governance time required of management could limit the amount of time management has to implement is business plan and impede the speed of its operations.





	Should the Company fail to raise a minimum of $42,000 under this offering the Company would be forced to scale back or abandon the implementation of its 12-month plan of operations.












	DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS



	 


	Our company prepares to offer event planning for the corporate market. We plan to target medium and small companies, which we refer to as clients or customers, as in most cases big enterprises have their own established event planning teams. We intend to commence operations in the business consulting with specialization in team-building activities and events in order to establish strong sense of unity between co-workers.  We plan to make create our event beneficial for the companies because:


	a) the employes will get a unique experience of togetherness, and friendly environment inside the staff as a possible outcome;


	b) properly planned and carried out event may help a company to get a positive image before employees, to enhance their loyalty to their company.


	In order to help our customers achieve the mentioned above results, we plan to provide customers with the highest level of event planning and hosting.





	Our principal office address is located at 2235 E. Flamingo Rd., Suite 355, Las Vegas, NV 89119. Our telephone number is 725-777-0799. Our plan of operation is forward-looking and there is no assurance that we will ever reach profitable operations. We are a development stage company and have not earned any revenue. It is likely that we will not be able to achieve profitability and would be forced to cease operations due to the lack of funding.

	Business






	Our company prepares to offer event planning for the corporate market. We plan to target medium and small companies, which we refer to as clients or customers, as in most cases big enterprises have their own established event planning teams.





	Our company plans to concentrate on team-building corporate events, offering various sorts of scripts for outdoor corporate retreats, as well as for indoor corporate parties. We anticipate that adventurous services we offer to unite co-workers and to build a strong team will attract customers. We intend to offer a great variety of activities acceptable for most ages, and suitable for people of average physical conditions, such as RPGs (role-play games), Treasure Hunt games, outdoor quests, sport competitions or any other sorts of outdoor activities, as well as quizzes, indoor quests (known as quests of a closed room) and many other different indoor activities. Taking into consideration our clients requirements, our company may provide event scripts which may combine several activities in a single event. Depending on the customers demand, corporate parties with music performers to follow the corporate retreat can be offered.  In addition to the planning of the events, our company plans to offer hosting events as well, for which we intend employ entertainers, MCs or hosts of our own. Which also means organizing those parties and decorating are the duties of our company. We believe that its cost effective for small and medium-sized business to work with our company, because once they have their event properly planned, they wont be troubled to search another third party to carry the plan out. Within the process of the business development we may think of additional services, such as lodging/ accommodation at our premises, catering, transferring by transport to the location of the event. If the client company wishes so, we also intend to provide filming, or photographic shooting of the events we conduct, to be distributed on DVDs among employees of the client company, and to be used later for advertizing purposes as well. We plan to post the edited video snippets and photos to our website, which we anticipate to be one of the key elements in attracting customers interest and advertising our services. Providing feature of having an account on our website, belonging to a company we intend to grant our loyal customers with discounts and special offers, and to distribute advertising prospects along with the update information regarding our services.






	Clients






	Our company is providing services to corporate customers only. The corporate customer is a company that contracts with our company to plan and typically host an event for the company. We anticipate that small and medium-sized corporations will be turning to our company to plan the events.

	We plan to apply the following marketing instruments to attract customers attention:







	Online advertisements


	- clickable banners (static or animated), placed on the websites related to business, corporate culture, event planning, and recreational services. We anticipate that it will also help us to align with the similar companies that do not provide event hosting services and may delegate this function to us.

	Search Engine Optimisation.


	In order to attract attention to our website, we seek for the opportunity of SEO (Search Engine Optimisation), to occupy the top places in search results of Google, Bing, Yandex and similar search engines. We also look forward to buying advertising space on the pages of the mentioned engines. We choose the Internet as the main instrument because it is seen as the largest repository of data, and people tend to search any information online, to get a great variety of options to choose from, rather than use other available sources.







	Video advertisement and commercials


	. We see the benefit of video advertisements for our company awareness in their versatility, by which we mean possibility to use them on the Internet (YouTube, Vimeo and other similar video hosting sites, as well as the other sites we intend to use for advertising), on TV (in a form of video commercials), on video billboards and other installments with video playback function.




	Radio Commercials and Printed Advertisement.


	We plan to support online advertising campaign with commercials on the most popular radio stations and in the printed media to enhance our companys  awareness. We suppose that this step may help us to remain in the focus of attention of those who already encountered our online or video advertisements, as well as get the attention of those who tend to rely on printed media, or doesnt have an opportunity to search the Internet.





	To achieve the largest scope of potential clients we also look forward at advertising through companies selling recreational and entertaining tours, even the ones who work with individuals, as an individual might happen to be a senior a person responsible for human resources, or a person who propose the corporate event to the seniors of their company.








	Competition






	We plan to take our own niche in the market of corporate events, as we plan to work in a highly competitive market (many entertaining companies with similar services make it such). We believe that we are about to compete favorably, on the basis that there are companies that offer only entertaining activities, companies specializing on rewarding or celebration parties, or companies offering training events or product launch events. Whereas, our goal is to offer events which, we presume, will result in stronger unity of co-workers after they experience hardship of the adventures we plan to offer.





	Our company's competitive edge is about to be based on two factors, specialization and strategic relationships. Our company will be specializing in two distinct areas of corporate planning. While specializing essentially precludes our company out of a lot of different markets, it allows our company to excel in the markets that it has chosen to participate in. Specialization allows our company to be an expert in the two areas that it is in. Additionally, the expert knowledge allows our company to provide the service as a cost saving to the company because the fewer services our company offers, the more they can concentrate on improving the current offerings. Improvements that our company strive for is a reduction in cost charged to the client and an improvement to the level of services offered.






	27 |

	Page













	Our company's second competitive edge is based on the use of strategic relationships. Our company clearly realizes that they cannot be good at everything. our company believes it is better to concentrate on a few things, excel in those areas, and form strategic partnerships with companies that excel in the service areas that our company doesn't. Applying this philosophy, Our company has decided in addition to planning corporate retreat training sessions, they want to offer the service of hosting/leading these events as well. The service of hosting/leading however, is quite different than planning and our company believes that it would be more cost effective to form a strategic relationship with an expert in this field instead of trying to become proficient themselves. our company then is able to offer a top-notch service offering of hosting/leading the training seminars but does not have to invest heavily in developing the program.





	The use of strategic relationships is unusual in the event planning space. Most event planners are generalists and try to do a little of everything. Our company is following the model of benchmark companies in other industries that have recognized the value of specialization and the use of strategic relationships.






	Revenue






	Our revenues primarily derive from planning corporate events, thus working out the entire script, and from hosting the events which, possibly, might be planned by another company that doesnt specialize in hosting. So, the basic charge includes writing a script, or updating it for the needs of the customer, adding to it the price of hosting an event, video and photoshoot, editing the videos, mounting the DVDs with the videos and photos of the event. Fees are calculated on the fixed charge for a script and hourly base of hosting the event. If a client company orders music performers to appear at any stage of the event, it will also make an added value to the total cost of the event. In case the company will be successful to obtain premises of its own, lodging and catering are about to be charged as well. Depending on customers demand, if turns cost effective, we will try to look forward to offering our clients commemorative merchandise, such as photo magnets, cups with photos, T-Shirts, office supplies with photos or marks related to the event they participated in.





	We plan that our service will cost for the potential clients from 20 to 30% of total budget of the event.  






	Insurance






	We do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are made a party of a products liability action, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease operations.

	(1) A beneficial owner of a security includes any person who, directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship, or otherwise has or shares: (i) voting power, which includes the power to vote, or to direct the voting of shares; and (ii) investment power, which includes the power to dispose or direct the disposition of shares. Certain shares may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares). In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire the shares (for example, upon exercise of an option) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares outstanding is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person (and only such person) by reason of these acquisition rights. As of January 31, 2016, there were 10,000,000 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding.








	Future sales by existing stockholders






	A total of 10,000,000 shares of common stock were issued to our sole officer and director, all of which are restricted securities, as defined in Rule 144 of the Rules and Regulations of the SEC promulgated under the Securities Act. Under Rule 144, the shares can be publicly sold, subject to volume restrictions and restrictions on the manner of sale. Such shares can only be sold after six months provided that the issuer of the securities is, and has been for a period of at least 90 days immediately before the sale, subject to the reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Shares purchased in this offering, which will be immediately resalable, and sales of all of our other shares after applicable restrictions expire, could have a depressive effect on the market price, if any, of our common stock and the shares we are offering.





	There is no public trading market for our common stock. To be quoted on the OTCBB a market maker must file an application on our behalf to make a market for our common stock. As of the date of this Registration Statement, we have not engaged a market maker to file such an application, that there is no guarantee that a market marker will file an application on our behalf, and that even if an application is filed, there is no guarantee that we will be accepted for quotation.









	PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION



	 


	We are registering 10,000,000 shares of our common stock for sale at the price of $0.01 per share.





	This is a self-underwritten offering, and Mr. Gitelman, our sole officer and director, will sell the shares directly to family, friends, business associates and acquaintances, with no commission or other remuneration payable to him for any shares they may sell. There are no plans or arrangements to enter into any contracts or agreements to sell the shares with a broker or dealer. In offering the securities on our behalf, he will rely on the safe harbor from broker dealer registration set out in Rule 3a4-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Mr. Gitelman will not register as a broker-dealer pursuant to Section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in reliance upon Rule 3a4-1, which sets forth those conditions, as noted herein, under which a person associated with an Issuer may participate in the offering of the Issuers securities and not be deemed to be a broker-dealer:



	1.


	Our sole officer and director is not subject to a statutory disqualification, as that term is defined in Section 3(a)(39) of the Act, at the time of his participation; and,






	33 |

	Page














	2.


	Our sole officer and director will not be compensated in connection with his participation by the payment of commissions or other remuneration based either directly or indirectly on transactions in securities; and



	3.


	Our sole officer and director is not, nor will he be at the time of his participation in the offering, an associated person of a broker-dealer; and



	4.


	Our sole officer and director meets the conditions of paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of Rule 3a4-1 of the Exchange Act, in that he (A) primarily perform, or intend primarily to perform at the end of the offering, substantial duties for or on behalf of our company, other than in connection with transactions in securities; and (B) he is not a broker or dealer, or been an associated person of a broker or dealer, within the preceding twelve months; and (C) has not participated in selling and offering securities for any issuer more than once every twelve months other than in reliance on Paragraphs (a)(4)(i) or (a)(4)(iii). Under Paragraph 3a4-1(a)(4)(iii), our sole officer and director must restricts his participation to any one or more of the following activities:



	A.


	Preparing any written communication or delivering such communication through the mails or other means that does not involve oral solicitation by his of a potential purchaser; provided, however, that the content of such communication is approved by our sole officer and director;



	B.


	Responding to inquiries of a potential purchaser in a communication initiated by the potential purchaser; provided, however, that the content of such responses are limited to information contained in a registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933 or other offering document; or



	C.


	Performing ministerial and clerical work involved in effecting any transaction.





	Our sole officer and director does not intend to purchase any shares in this offering.





	This offering is self-underwritten, which means that it does not involve the participation of an underwriter or broker, and as a result, no broker for the sale of our securities will be used. In the event a broker-dealer is retained by us to participate in the offering, we must file a post-effective amendment to the registration statement to disclose the arrangements with the broker-dealer, and that the broker-dealer will be acting as an underwriter and will be so named in the prospectus. Additionally, FINRA must approve the terms of the underwriting compensation before the broker-dealer may participate in the offering.





	To the extent required under the Securities Act, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement will be filed disclosing the name of any broker-dealers, the number of shares of common stock involved, the price at which the common stock is to be sold, the commissions paid or discounts or concessions allowed to such broker-dealers, where applicable, that such broker-dealers did not conduct any investigation to verify the information set out or incorporated by reference in this prospectus and other facts material to the transaction.





	We are subject to applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations under it, including, without limitation, Rule 10b-5 and a distribution participant under Regulation M. All of the foregoing may affect the marketability of the common stock.

	All expenses of the registration statement including, but not limited to, legal, accounting, printing and mailing fees are and will be borne by us. 






	Penny Stock Regulations






	You should note that our stock is a penny stock. The SEC has adopted Rule 15g-9 which generally defines "penny stock" to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and "accredited investors". The term "accredited investor" refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer's confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock.

To the extent that the officer or director is successful on the merits in a proceeding as to which he is to be indemnified, we must indemnify him against all expenses incurred, including attorney's fees. With respect to a derivative action, indemnity may be made only for expenses actually and reasonably incurred in defending the proceeding, and if the officer or director is judged liable, only by a court order. The indemnification is intended to be to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the State of Nevada.

	To The Board of Directors

	Getelman Corp

	2235 E. Flamingo Rd, Suite 155

	Las Vegas, NV 89119

	 

	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Getelman Corp. as of January

	31, 2016, and the related statements of income, stockholders equity and cash flows for the period

	July 12, 2015 through January 31, 2016. These financial statements are the responsibility of the

	Companys  management.  Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  these  consolidated

	financial statements based on our audits.  

	 

	We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  standards  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting

	Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to

	obtain   reasonable   assurance   about   whether   the   financial   statements   are   free   of   material

	misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and

	disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles

	used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial

	statement  presentation.  We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a  reasonable  basis  for  our  opinion.

	 

	In  our  opinion,  the  consolidated  financial  statements  referred  to  above  present  fairly,  in  all

	material respects, the financial position of Getelman Corp. as of January 31, 2016, and the related

	statements of income, stockholders equity and cash flows for the period July 12, 2015 through

	January  31,  2016,  in  conformity  with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United

	States of America.

	 

	The  accompanying  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  assuming  that  the  Company  will

	continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has

	suffered loss from operations that raises a substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going

	concern.  The  financial  statements  do  not  include  any  adjustments  that  might  result  from  the

	outcome of this uncertainty.

	GETELMAN CORP.




	NOTES TO THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


	FOR THE PERIOD FROM INCEPTION (JULY 12, 2015) TO JANUARY 31, 2016





	NOTE 1  ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION


	 


	GETELMAN CORP. (the Company) is a corporation established under the corporation laws in the State of Nevada on July 12, 2015.





	The Company intends to commence operations in the business of corporate team building consulting service.





	The Companys activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including failure to secure additional funding to properly execute the companys business plan.





	The Company has adopted January 31 fiscal year end.






	Basis of Presentation



	 


	The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.





	NOTE 2  GOING CONCERN





	The Companys financial statements as of January 31, 2016 been prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred a cumulative net loss from inception (July 12, 2015) to January 31, 2016 of $1,025. These factors among others raise substantial doubt about the ability of the company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.  





	In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Managements plan is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking third party equity and/or debt financing. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. These financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

	NOTE 3  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES






	Use of Estimates






	Preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Actual results and outcomes may differ from managements estimates and assumptions.






	Cash and Cash Equivalents






	For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company's bank accounts are deposited in insured institutions. The funds are insured up to $250,000. At January 31, 2016 the Company's bank deposits did not exceed the insured amounts.






	Advertising Costs



	The Companys policy regarding advertising is to expense advertising when incurred. The Company incurred advertising expense of $0 during year ended January 31, 2016.






	Basic and Diluted Loss Per Share






	Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period.  Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.






	Stock-Based Compensation






	As of January 31, 20156, the Company has not issued any stock-based payments to its employees.


	Stock-based compensation is accounted for at fair value in accordance with ASC 718, when applicable.  To date, the Company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options.






	Income Taxes






	The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes.  Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values and their respective income tax basis (temporary differences).  The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

	New Accounting Pronouncements






	There were various accounting standards and interpretations issued recently, none of which are expected to a have a material impact on our financial position, operations or cash flows.






	Subsequent Events

	NOTE 4  CAPTIAL STOCK





	The Company has 75,000,000 shares of common stock authorized with a par value of $0.001 per share.





	NOTE 5  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS


	 


	In support of the Companys efforts and cash requirements, it may rely on advances from related parties until such time that the Company can support its operations or attains adequate financing through sales of its equity or traditional debt financing. There is no formal written commitment for continued support by officers, directors, or shareholders. Amounts represent advances or amounts paid in satisfaction of liabilities. The advances are considered temporary in nature and have not been formalized by a promissory note.  





	Since July 12, 2015 (Inception) through January 31, 2016, the Companys sole officer and director loaned the Company $2,172 to pay for incorporation costs and operating expenses.  As of January 31, 2016, the amount outstanding was $2,172. The loan is non-interest bearing, due upon demand and unsecured.


	 


	NOTE 6  INCOME TAX





	As of January 31, 2016 the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of $1,616 that may be available to reduce future years taxable income through 2036. Future tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have not been recognized in these financial statements, as their realization is determined not likely to occur and accordingly, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to these tax loss carry-forwards.

	ITEM 17. UNDERTAKINGS



	 


	The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes:





	1)


	To file, during any period in which offers or sales of securities are being made, a post-    effective amendment to this registration statement to:





	(i)


	Include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;



	(ii)


	To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) (§230.424(b) of this chapter) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the Calculation of Registration Fee table in the effective registration statement.



	(iii)


	To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement;


	2)


	That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.





	3)


	To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering.





	4)


	That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser:





	(i)


	If the registrant is subject to Rule 430C, each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use.





	5)


	That, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities: The undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:


	 


	(i)


	Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424;


	 


	(ii)


	Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant;


	 


	(iii)


	The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or our securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and





	(iv)


	Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser.


	 


	Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 (the Act) may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the provisions above, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and is, therefore, unenforceable.


	 


	In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities, other than the payment by us of expenses incurred or paid by one of our directors, officers, or controlling persons in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding, is asserted by one of our directors, officers, or controlling persons in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and we will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

	Section 4 - Remuneration






	The remuneration of the Officers of the Corporation may from time to time be determined by the Directors or, if the Directors decide, by the shareholders.






	Section 5 - Conflict of Interest

	ARTICLE IV:  SHARES OF STOCK







	Section 1 - Certificate of Stock






	a)


	The shares of the Corporation shall be represented by certificates or shall be uncertificated shares.





	b)


	Certificated shares of the Corporation shall be signed, either manually or by facsimile, by officers or agents designated by the Corporation for such purposes, and shall certify the number of shares owned by the shareholder in the Corporation.  Whenever any certificate is countersigned or otherwise authenticated by a transfer agent or transfer clerk, and by a registrar, then a facsimile of the signatures of the officers or agents, the transfer agent or transfer clerk or the registrar of the Corporation may be printed or lithographed upon the certificate in lieu of the actual signatures.  If the Corporation uses facsimile signatures of its officers and agents on its stock certificates, it cannot act as registrar of its own stock, but its transfer agent and registrar may be identical if the institution acting in those dual capacities countersigns or otherwise authenticates any stock certificates in both capacities.  If any officer who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon such certificate, shall have ceased to be such officer before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if he were such officer at the date of its issue.





	c)


	If the Corporation issued uncertificated shares as provided for in these Bylaws, within a reasonable time after the issuance or transfer of such uncertificated shares, and at least annually thereafter, the Corporation shall send the shareholder a written statement certifying the number of shares owned by such shareholder in the Corporation.





	d)


	Except as otherwise provided by law, the rights and obligations of the holders of uncertificated shares and the rights and obligations of the holders of certificates representing shares of the same class and series shall be identical.





	e)


	If a share certificate:





	(i)


	is worn out or defaced, the Directors shall, upon production to them of the certificate and upon such other terms, if any, as they may think fit, order the certificate to be cancelled and issue a new certificate;





	(ii)


	is lost, stolen or destroyed, then upon proof being given to the satisfaction of the Directors and upon and indemnity, if any being given, as the Directors think adequate, the Directors shall issue a new certificate; or





	(iii)


	represents more than one share and the registered owner surrenders it to the Corporation with a written request that the Corporation issue in his or her name two or more certificates, each representing a specified number of shares and in the aggregate representing the same number of shares as the certificate so surrendered, the Corporation shall cancel the certificate so surrendered and issue new certificates in accordance with such request.






	Section 2 - Transfers of Shares






	a)


	Transfers or registration of transfers of shares of the Corporation shall be made on the stock transfer books of the Corporation by the registered holder thereof, or by his or her attorney duly authorized by a written power of attorney;  and in the case of shares represented by certificates, only after the surrender to the Corporation of the certificates representing such shares with such shares properly endorsed, with such evidence of the authenticity of such endorsement, transfer, authorization and other matters as the Corporation may reasonably require, and the payment of all stock transfer taxes due thereon.





	b)


	The Corporation shall be entitled to treat the holder of record of any share or shares as the absolute owner thereof for all purposes and, accordingly, shall not be bound to recognize any legal, equitable or other claim to, or interest in, such share or shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise expressly provided by law.






	Section 3 - Record Date






	a)


	The Directors may fix in advance a date, which must not be more than 60 days permitted by the preceding the date of a meeting of shareholders or a class of shareholders, or of the payment of a dividend or of the proposed taking of any other proper action requiring the determination of shareholders as the record date for the determination of the shareholders entitled to notice of, or to attend and vote at, a meeting and an adjournment of the meeting, or entitled to receive payment of a dividend or for any other proper purpose and, in such case, notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws, only shareholders of records on the date so fixed will be deemed to be the shareholders for the purposes of this Bylaw.

	3. PAYMENTS





	3.1. Rent. Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord as basic monthly rent (the "Rent") at such place as Landlord may designate without prior demand therefore and without any deduction or offset whatsoever, the sum of $250.00. Said Rent shall be due and payable on the First day of each month. If any payment is not made by the fifth day following the due date of the payment, then there shall be added to the payment an amount equal to ten (10%) percent of the payment as an agreed late charge every month in which a payment is delinquent.





	3.2. Security Deposit. Tenant shall also pay to Landlord a "Security Deposit" in the amount of $250.00 . The Security Deposit shall be held by Landlord without liability for interest and as security for the performance by Tenant of Tenant's covenants and obligations under this Lease, it being expressly understood that the Security Deposit shall not be considered an advance payment of rental or a measure of Landlord's damages in case of default by Tenant. Unless otherwise provided by mandatory non-waivable law or regulation, Landlord may commingle the Security Deposit with Landlord's other funds. Landlord may, from time to time, without prejudice to any other remedy, use the Security Deposit to the extent necessary to make good any arrearages of rent or to satisfy any other covenant or obligation of Tenant hereunder. Following any such application of the Security Deposit, Tenant shall pay to Landlord on demand the amount so applied in order to restore the Security Deposit to its original amount. If Tenant is not in default at the termination of this Lease, the balance of the Security Deposit remaining after any such application shall be returned by Landlord to Tenant. If the tenant fails to complete the full term of the lease, the tenant will forfeit his security deposit.

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each party waives its respective rights to a trial before a jury in connection with any action to interpret or enforce this Agreement, or otherwise arising out of or relating to this Agreement (Disputes). Disputes also include matters based on or arising from an alleged tort or involving either of our employees, agents, affiliates, or assigns of a party. Disputes do not include the enforceability or meaning of this paragraph, which matters may be determined only by a court. All Disputes shall be resolved by a judge sitting without a jury. If, but only if, a court determines for any reason that this jury waiver is not enforceable, then at any time prior to trial of the Dispute but not later than 30 days after entry of the order determining this jury waiver is unenforceable, any party shall be entitled to move that court for an order compelling alternative dispute resolution (ADR) by arbitration or judicial reference, as applicable (ADR Order). The ADR Order shall require the Dispute be resolved by binding arbitration administered by the National Arbitration Forum ("NAF") and heard in Salt Lake City, Utah. The ADR adjudicator will: (i) rule on dispositive motions and give effect to all applicable legal defenses; (ii) apply rules of evidence governing civil cases; (iii) prepare a reasoned statement of decision applying applicable law; and (iv) award recovery of all attorneys' fees and costs, ADR administration fees and costs, and adjudicator fees. Commencing ADR shall not prevent any party from seeking and obtaining from a court of competent jurisdiction provisional relief and the exercise of such rights shall not constitute a waiver of the right to submit any Dispute to ADR. Judgment upon the adjudicators award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction therefore.





	18.1.


	Force Majeure. Landlord shall be excused for the period of any delay in the performance of any obligations hereunder when prevented from so doing by cause or causes beyond Landlord's control, including labor disputes, civil commotion, war, governmental regulations or controls, fire or other casualty, inability to obtain any material or service, or acts of God.





	18.2.


	No Waiver. Failure of Landlord to insist upon the strict performance of any provision or to exercise any option hereunder shall not be deemed a waiver of such breach. No provision of this Lease shall be deemed to have been waived unless such waiver is in writing signed by Landlord. No waiver of any default of Tenant shall be implied from any omission by Landlord to take any action on account of such default if such default persists or is repeated, and no express waiver shall affect any default other than the default specified in the express waiver and that only for the time and to the extent therein stated. One or more waivers by Landlord shall not be construed as a waiver of a subsequent breach of the same covenant, term or condition.

	18.5. Quiet Enjoyment.
