In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:
   Are Product Attribute Beliefs the Only Mediator of Advertising Effects on Brand Attitude?   Andrew A. Mitchell (bio)and  Jerry C. Olson (bio)   Mitchell, Andrew A. and Jerry C. Olson. 1981. Are product attribute beliefs the only mediator of advertising effects on brand attitude? Journal of Marketing Research. 18(August), 318–332. Reprinted with the permission of the American Marketing Association. Fishbein’s attitude theory posits that beliefs are the only mediators of attitude formation and change. The validity of this proposition for consumers’ beliefs about product attributes and brand attitudes was examined in the context of an advertising effects study. To manipulate product attribute beliefs and to create settings in which other mediation processes might occur, the authors exposed subjects to simple advertisements that contained either a verbal claim or visual information. Level of repetition also was varied. As expected, product attribute beliefs mediated attitude formation. However, another variable, termed attitude toward the advertisement, also mediated brand attitudes and purchase intentions. The authors discuss alternative explanations for the results and offer suggestions for future research. Attitude, defined here as an individual’s internal evaluation of an object such as a branded product, has been an important concept in marketing research for the past 20 years. There are at least two major reasons for this long-term interest. First, attitudes often are considered relatively stable and enduring predispositions to behave. Consequently, they should be useful predictors of consumers’ behavior toward a product or service. Second, social psychology has provided several theoretical models of the attitude construct (e.g., Fishbein 1963; McGuire 1968; Rosenberg 1956; Triandis 1971; Wyer 1974). These conceptual frameworks, especially Fishbein’s, have stimulated much of the attitude research in marketing. Most of this work, however, has been descriptive and pragmatic in orientation; theoretical issues have been relatively neglected. To increase the usefulness of the attitude construct, marketers must develop a clearer understanding of the causal determinants of attitude formation and change ( Olson and Mitchell 1975; also see Lutz 1977 Lutz and Bettman 1977). These causal influences are of critical importance because they mediate the effects of marketing decision variables such as advertising or price on consumer attitudes. Thus, a better understanding of the causal dynamics of attitude formation would not only aid marketing researchers in measuring the attitudinal impact of marketing variables, but also help managers develop more effective marketing strategy.  Attitude Theory  Fishbein (1963, 1967; Fishbein and Ajzen 1975) presented perhaps the clearest theoretical exposition of the causal basis of attitudes. According to Fishbein and Ajzen (1975, p. 222), “A person’s attitude is a function of his salient beliefs at a given point in time.” Beliefs are the subjective associations between any two discriminable concepts. Salient beliefs are those activated from memory and “considered” by the person in a given situation ( Fishbein and Ajzen 1975 Olson, Kanwar, and Muderrisoglu 1979). As these ideas are operationalized in the typical marketing research study, the attitude concept of interest is a brand and the related concepts are product attributes. That is, marketing researchers have been mainly concerned with consumers’ beliefs about attributes of a brand. Fishbein’s now-familiar attitude model specifies the relationship between the set of salient beliefs about a concept (often termed cognitive structure) and an overall evaluation of, or attitude toward, the concept.  [Editorial note: Throughout the text, the Greek letter “sigma” will be replaced with “E.” Therefore, the above equation would read as “Eb ie i= A o” in the text.] Fishbein clearly intended the attitude model in equation 1to describe only the predicted relationship between measures of the theoretical constructs (e.g., see Fishbein and Ajzen 1975, p. 222–3). That is, the algebraic model provides a means of estimating the belief-attitude relationship that was formed as a result of causal mechanisms. The model itself does not “state” the causal proposition nor does it specify the causal mechanisms. Fishbein also proposed that the attitude-belief relationship specified in equation 1holds for attitudes toward a specific behavior such as buying a product A act. However, the set of salient beliefs may not be the same as for A o. ( Fishbein and Ajzen 1975). In turn, attitude, especially A act, is...

 Advances in Consumer Research Volume 21, 1994       Pages 51-57 EXPLORING THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MEANS-END KNOWLEDGE AND INVOLVEMENT  Michael S. Mulvey, Pennsylvania State University Jerry C. Olson, Pennsylvania State University Richard L. Celsi, California State University, Long Beach Beth A. Walker, Arizona State University ABSTRACT -  This research investigates the cognitive basis for involvement. We propose  that the means-end knowledge about a product that is activated in a situation creates  perceptions of personal relevance or feelings of involvement. We demonstrate the  feasibility of this approach by describing the means-end knowledge of consumers at three  levels of involvement. Why do some consumers seem to care more about some products and brands and  not others? Why are some consumers highly motivated to seek information about certain  products, or to buy and use these products in particular situations? These questions  concern consumers' involvement, a key concept for understanding consumer behavior. Involvement refers to consumers' perceptions of personal relevance for an  object, activity, or event (cf. Bloch and Richins 1983). To date, however, most research  on consumer involvement is at too high a level of abstraction to explain why people  perceive a product to have personal relevance. In the typical measure of product  involvement, such as Zaichkowsky's (1985) Personal Involvement Inventory (PII), consumers  give direct ratings of their interest in a product, or their perceived importance of a  product. Such measures indicate the overall level of consumers' overall involvement with  the product, but they do not indicate the cognitive basis of that personal relevance. This  would require measures of consumers' knowledge (beliefs) concerning how and why a product  is personally relevant. Celsi and Olson (1988) suggest that the perceived personal relevance of a  product is determined by the activated cognitive structure of means-end associations that  link people's knowledge about product attributes and benefits with their self-knowledge  about important needs, goals, and values. In this paper, we describe an initial attempt to  measure the cognitive basis for involvement by measuring the means-end knowledge  structures that represent consumers' perceptions of personal relevance.  MEANS-END THEORY  A means-end chain is a simple knowledge structure that links product  attributes to the consequences produced by these attributes (Gutman 1982). Olson and  Reynolds (1983) described a means-end chain with six levels of attributes, consequences,  and values, ordered from less to more abstract (see figure 1). For example, a couple may decide to deposit money at a small, local bank  because it is nearby (concrete attribute) and provides friendly, personal service  (functional consequence). Personalized service is seen as important because the couple  wants to establish a trusting relationship with the company responsible for managing their  money (psychosocial consequence), in order to satisfy their need for security (terminal  value). A means-end chain is the cognitive representation of the connection between a  person's knowledge about a product (salient attributes and benefits) and their self  knowledge (important psychological and social consequences and values). Thus, the end  consequences of some means-end chains can be quite abstractCe.g., a person's life goals and personal values.  The means-end approach is based on the assumption that consumers see  products as means to important ends. This means that the personal consequences produced by  a product are more important (more self-relevant) than the characteristics of the product  itself. A product is self-relevant to the extent a consumer sees it as instrumental in  achieving important consequences or values. When means-end knowledge is activated from  memory or formed in a situation, the person perceives the product to be personally  relevant and feels involved with it (Celsi and Olson 1988). Thus, means-end knowledge  structures are the cognitive basis for involvement. They also account for how and why  consumers feel involved with a product in a particular situation.  Since researchers have not measured the product-related knowledge that  underlies involvement, we conducted a simple study to demonstrate the usefulness of  means-end theory in representing personal relevance. In particular, we wanted to explore  two broad issues about the content and structure of consumers' product knowledge:    Content. How does the means-end knowledge about a product differ between      more and less involved consumers? Are there systematic differences in knowledge about      attributes, consequences, or values? Structure. Do more involved consumers have a more complex network of      knowledge compared to less involved consumers? Do the interrelationships differ at the      attribute, consequence, or value levels?   METHODOLOGY To examine these issues, we identified three groups of consumers with very  different levels of involvement (low, moderate, and high) and compared their means-end  knowledge structures about tennis rackets. We measured subjects' involvement with the  activity of playing tennis because most people's self-relevance is focused on playing  tennis, not on tennis products. We measured subjects' product knowledge about tennis  rackets because this is the most critical product for playing the sport.  Subjects were 58 people from a University community, selected on a  convenience basis. This group consisted of 23 women and 35 men, ranging in age from 18 to  51C90% were between the ages of 20 and 22. All  but four of the subjects were college students. We measured subjects' involvement with playing tennis using Zaichkowsky's  (1985) Personal Involvement Inventory (PII scores can range from 20-140). Based on their  PII scores, we assigned subjects to three, nonoverlapping involvement groupsCLow (PII=20-60; n=17), Medium (PII=70-110; n=21), and  High Involvement (120-140; n=19). Most people in the low involvement group were novices  who played tennis only infrequently and were uninterested in the sport. People in the  medium involvement group played tennis occasionally to frequently and were moderately  interested in the sport. People in the high involvement group played competitively on a  daily basis and were highly committed to the sport (in fact, several were on the  university tennis team). Thus, the three involvement groups represented a wide range of  involvement from quite low to extremely high. Three to four weeks after completing the  PII, we assembled subjects in small groups of 5 to 10 to measure their means-end knowledge  about tennis rackets.  FIGURE 1 TABLE 1 LISTING OF MEANS-END CONCEPTS We used a self-administered questionnaire developed by Walker and Olson  (1991) to elicit people's means-end knowledge. Essentially, this paper-and-pencil  procedure allows subjects to administer the laddering "interview" to themselves.  First, subjects wrote down the product features they thought people in general consider  when purchasing a tennis racket. Next, they were asked to identify the characteristics  that they, personally, would consider when buying a tennis racket for their own use. Of  these, they checked the four most important choice criteria in their purchase decision.  Next, subjects completed a self-administered laddering  "interview" for each of the four choice criteria. The procedure began by writing  the reason the first choice criteria was important to them (often this was a functional  consequence of some sort). Then they wrote why that answer was important (what does this  get you?). This usually produced a higher-ordered consequence. This pattern of writing why  each answer was important continued until subjects could go no further (they reached the  end of the means-end chain). This self-administered laddering procedure produced four  means-end chains for each subject consisting of two to five levels each. ANALYSIS We used a computer program called "Laddermap" (Gengler and  Reynolds 1992) to help analyze the laddering responses. The analysis began with a content  analysis to reduce subjects' idiosyncratic responses to a common set of meanings. Two  independent judges conducted the content analysis, and disagreements were resolved in  discussions with a third judge. We identified 26 concepts that summarized all the  attributes, consequences, and values mentioned in the laddering responses. Table 1 lists  the final means-end concepts, along with examples of the verbatim responses that make up  each concept. Next, we examined the connections between the attribute, consequence, and  value concepts. These linkages are often called implications. An implication is the  perception of a causal or instrumental relationship between two concepts (a red car  implies a fast acceleration). A means-end chain is merely a sequence of causal  implicationsCan attribute implies a consequence  which implies another consequence which implies a value. Two types of relationships  between concepts are possibleCdirect and  indirect implications. For example, a means-end chain A¦B¦C contains two direct  implications (A¦B and B¦C), each of which was explicitly stated by a consumer in the  laddering interview. In addition, the means-end chain includes an indirect implication  between A¦C, which was not actually mentioned by a consumer, but is implied by the two  direct associations. We combined both types of implications to produce a 26 x 26  implications matrix for each involvement group (available from the first author). The  implications matrix accounts for all the direct and indirect relationships between a set  of means-end concepts, and thus accounts for the aggregate cognitive structure of the  group. Although some subjects mentioned the same concept or implication more than  once, we counted each unique concept and association mentioned by a subject only once.  This avoided overweighting associations mentioned by verbose respondents who might mention  an association between two concepts several times in the four ladders. Thus, each unique  link in a means-end chain received equal weight in the implication matrix. The aggregate implications matrix for each involvement group was converted  to a cognitive structure map by the Laddermap program. The program produces a graphic  representation of the key attribute, consequence, and value concepts and the associations  between them. Figures 2, 3, and 4 present the cognitive structure maps for the low, medium  and high involvement groups, respectively. To simplify the maps, we present only those  connections mentioned by at least two consumers.  The format for the cognitive structure maps was suggested by Gengler,  Klenosky and Mulvey (1992). Each means-end concept is represented by a circle. White  circles represent attributes, grey circles represent consequences, and black circles  represent values. The area of the circles are proportional to the percentage of subjects  who mentioned the concept. The thickness of the line segments is proportional to the  percentage of subjects who linked the concepts (both direct plus indirect associations). A good cognitive structure map should account for most of the concepts and  associations elicited by the laddering procedure and should be easy to interpret (a  minimum of crossing lines). The cognitive structure map for low involvement consumers  accounted for 70% of all direct and indirect relations, while the maps for medium and high  involvement consumers account for 82% and 80% of the relationships, respectively.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The purpose of this research was to explore differences in means-end  knowledge structures for consumers with different levels of involvement. We examined both  the content and structure of means-end knowledge. Content refers to the specific means-end  concepts mentioned by subjects, while structure refers to the interrelationships between  concepts. Both are necessary to understand the cognitive structure basis for involvement. Content of Means-End Knowledge First, we examined whether the total number of unique concepts mentioned  across the four ladders varied with level of involvement. An analysis of variance revealed  a significant main effect of involvement (Hi=9.8, Med=8.1, Lo=8.0; F[2,55]=3.61,  p<.05). A Scheffe test revealed significant differences between high involvement and  both low and medium involvement, but no differences between low and medium levels of  involvement. This result suggests that high involvement consumers activate more  product-related knowledge during decision-making than do medium and low involvement  consumers. This difference in knowledge content was reflected in the average length  of the means-end chains. High involvement subjects had somewhat longer chains on average  than did low and medium involvement subjects (Hi=3.4, Med=2.8, Lo=2.8; F[2,55]=8.18,  p<.01). This suggests that high involvement subjects have better defined (more complex  or more complete) means-end chains than less involved consumers do. Next, we looked for differences in the types of knowledge concepts used to  make decisions about tennis racquets. We found no overall differences in the average  number of attributes mentioned as choice criteria by subjects. Neither were there any  differences in the average number of values linked to those product attributes. Perhaps  because tennis racquets have a limited number of observable attributes, tennis players,  regardless of their involvement, "know" use about the same amount of attribute  information. Likewise, perhaps there is a limited number of values which one can satisfy  in playing tennis, whether one is an involved or casual player.  Consumers did mention differing numbers of intermediate level, consequence  concepts in their laddering "interviews." High involvement subjects mentioned  more unique consequences than the medium and low involvement consumers who did not differ  (Hi=4.1, Med=2.8, Lo=3.1; F[2,55]=4.98, p<.01). This suggests that highly involved  subjects may have a better understanding of how specific product attributes influence  their playing (functional consequences), and how these consequences will help them achieve  their end goals (values). Essentially, the product knowledge structure for the highly  involved subjects (see Figure 4) is more "interconnected" and  "complex" as reflected in the greater number of linked consequences and the  longer means-end chains. The more complex means-end chains of highly involved consumers  may be due to their greater "product familiarity," as they play more frequently  and thereby learn which product attributes provide personally relevant consequences. Finally, we examined whether specific means-end concepts at the attribute,  consequence, and value levels were mentioned more often by a specific involvement group.  Logistic regression was used to model the probability that a person would mention a  certain concept, given their level of involvement. Model fit was evaluated using the -2  Log L statistic. Differences between the levels of involvement were evaluated using the  Maximum Likelihood Estimates (see SAS 1992). As would be expected, we observed more differences between involvement  levels at the consequence level. For instance, quality/durability was much more likely to  be mentioned by low involvement consumers than high involvement consumers (82% versus 42%;  p<.05). On the other hand, high involvement consumers were more likely to mention  comfort in their means-end chains than moderate and lower involvement consumers (53%  versus 18% and 23%; p<.05). High involvement consumers also mentioned feel more often  than less involved consumers (58% versus 29% and 32%) and they mentioned concentrate more  often (26% versus 6% and 5%; p<.15 in both cases). The attribute racket material was  mentioned more often by highly involved consumers than less involved consumers (p<.05).  Head size and brand name also differed in levels of mention (p<.15). Finally, at the  value level, play my best was mentioned more often by highly involved consumers (52.6%)  than low involved consumers (17.7%; p<.15). FIGURE 2 HIERARCHICAL VALUE MAP - LOW INVOLVEMENT Structure of Means-End Knowledge Next, we compared the structural linkages between means-end concepts in  the cognitive maps for the three involvement groups (see Figures 2, 3 and 4). The overall  knowledge structures for the three involvement groups are similar in many respects, but  there are interesting differences in meaning at the level of individual means-end chains.  For example, low involvement consumers seem to have a simple means-end hierarchy: they use  brand name as the main cue to infer racket quality and durability. High involvement  consumers, in contrast, are less likely to use brand name as a cue for quality. This does  not necessarily mean that quality is less important to highly involved consumers. Rather,  unlike low involvement consumers who think about "quality" as a global, abstract  attribute, highly involved consumers understand and articulate the specific meaning of  what constitutes a high quality tennis racket. Thus, high involvement consumers consider  the head size, grip and the material when evaluating a racket. Compared to their lower  involvement counterparts, high involvement consumers link these attributes to the benefits  of comfort, racket feel and ability to concentrate. These factors in turn, are seen as  instrumental in achieving their key goal of playing their-best.  FIGURE 3 HIERARCHICAL VALUE MAP - MEDIUM INVOLVEMENT FIGURE 4 HIERARCHICAL VALUE MAP - HIGH INVOLVEMENT The content and structure of the other means-end chains vary across levels  of involvement, reflecting different levels and types of expertise. For example, low  involvement consumers have a simple means-end chain associated with the attribute, low  weight. They view low weight as a means of playing better, so they can satisfy their end  goal of fun & excitement. In contrast, high involvement consumers have a more complex  chain of meaning associated with racket weight. First, low weight is seen as a means of  making play more comfortable, which produces better control, which allows them to play  better so they can win, the end goal or value. A second means-end chain linked weight to  avoiding injury, which allows the person to play more and to experience fun &  excitement. Although these same concepts also appear on the low involvement cognitive map,  they are not connected to product attributes; thus the meaning is not the same. The same  pattern occurs with other consequences such as confidence, feel and comfort. As mentioned earlier, the thickness of the lines on the map represents the  number of subjects who associated the linked concepts. Not only do high involvement  consumers have more relationships between salient concepts, but these relationships are  stronger. This phenomenon is particularly evident in the relationships between play better  and the values of winning, play my best, and fun & excitement. The greater number of  lines represented on the maps of high involvement consumers reflects the greater  complexity of their means-end knowledge structures compared to lower involvement  consumers.  Although this cross-sectional study did not explore the development of  means-end chains over time, the results are suggestive. Apparently, the knowledge  structures of highly involved consumers have evolved to the point where most concepts are  interrelated. The rather subtle implications between many product attributes and  functional consequences (feel, control, comfort) are appreciated by involved experts. In  addition, end goals and values tend to be interconnected for the high involvement  consumer. We could speculate that highly involved consumers form a "unit" of  self-relevant goals and values associated with playing tennis such as winning, play my  best, and fun & excitement. Perhaps the entire means-end structure relating  product-knowledge to these personally-relevant consequences is activated for use during  decision-making. Implications for Future Research  The objective of this paper was to explore means-end knowledge structures  associated with different levels of involvement. Of course, the specific results have  limited generalizability due to the subject group, the sample size, and the particular  product and activity we examined. Our goal is to generate interest in studying involvement  from a means-end perspective and stimulate future research aimed at understanding the  cognitive basis for involvement. The means-end knowledge structures provide much richer data about personal  relevance or involvement than do broad measures such as PII, which fail to provide insight  into the underlying reasons for involvement. It is possible for consumers to have equal  levels of involvement (measured by the PII), but perceive the self-relevance of the  product in completely different ways. Knowledge of the basis for perceived self-relevance  is useful for many marketing applications. For instance, advertisements that communicate  an entire chain of meaning, rather than isolated facts and concepts are likely to be more  effective (Gengler 1990, Reynolds and Rochon 1990, Young and Feigin 1976).  The present study is cross-sectional. Further research is required to  investigate how personal relevance (the relationship between consumers and products)  develops over time. We need to understand the evolution of involvement in terms of how  product and self knowledge become linked with experience. This will require longitudinal  designs and individual-level analyses. Rummelhart and Norman's (1978) work on cognitive  learning could be useful in designing such a study. Finally, researchers should investigate how consumers use their means-end  knowledge in tasks such as making decisions. Do they use individual concepts in a  means-end chain as choice criteria, or do they treat the entire means-end chain as a  single "unit" of meaning? Hayes-Roth (1977) suggested that complex knowledge  structures may become "unitized," so that an entire means-end network of meaning  could be represented by a "short-hand" representation of the meaning. If so,  abstract concepts such as quality, play better, and value may be used as umbrella concepts  that "stand for" the whole means-end chain of related concepts. The challenge to  researchers is to describe the unitization process, uncover the conditions under which  unitization occurs, and develop methods of decomposing the unitized meaning. Once this is  done, we will have the means to develop a better understanding of how general concepts as  quality and value are used by consumers in decision making.

Toward a Cognitive Structure Conceptualization of Product Familiarity



Larry J. Marks, Pennsylvania State UniversityJerry C. Olson, Pennsylvania State University

ABSTRACT -     Product familiarity is conceptualized in terms of the cognitive structures  of knowledge concerning the product that are stored in memory. Such knowledge could have  been derived from direct or indirect experiences with the product in question (e.g.,  product use vs. advertisements or word-of-mouth). Different amounts and types of product  experience should be reflected by variation in cognitive structure. Theoretically,  differences in cognitive structures should influence the cognitive processes and outcomes  that involve those cognitive structures and, thereby, should also affect overt behavior.  Data from an existing study are used to illustrate these ideas. Suggestions for future  research are offered.

Such knowledge could have  been derived from direct or indirect experiences with the product in question (e.g.,  product use vs. advertisements or word-of-mouth). Different amounts and types of product  experience should be reflected by variation in cognitive structure.

INTRODUCTION Concepts such as product familiarity, product experience or expertise,  and/or prior information have been popular as mediating variables in many models of  consumer behavior. However, despite the frequency with which product familiarity has been  proposed as an individual difference variable affecting choice behavior, the concept has  not yet been clearly conceptualized in a compelling manner. The resulting confusion is apparent in the variety of terms researchers  have used to describe this general concept. For example, Berelson and Steiner (1964) found  that "pre-existing information" was one of several predisposing factors in  determining audience receptivity to "congenial and noncongenial messages". Park  (1976) measured product familiarity in terms of subjects' agreement with statements  designed to operationalize Howard and Sheth's (1969) concepts of extensive, limited, and  routinized problem solving. Based on the Bayesian concept of prior distribution, Woodruff  (1972) used subjects' evaluations of a brand-attribute combination and their uncertainty  about this rating to operationalize "prior information'' about brand attributes.  Laatovicka (1979) measured "knowledge about the product class" by asking  subjects if they could "talk about a general group of products for a long time."  He also measured "remembered personal experience" by subjects' responses to 'I  can remember having purchased something in this general group of products." Raju and  Reilly (1979) measured product familiarity in terms of subjects' self-reported  "frequency of use, overall familiarity, and knowledge of how to select the best  brand." These studies exemplify the diverse and occasionally vague approaches taken  in much of the past research on "familiarity." Thus far, this research has  emphasized developing predictive models of consumer choice, where measures of product  familiarity are one element in such models. Unfortunately this approach has not produced a  clear conceptualization of the construct of product familiarity. The purposes of this paper are to propose a broad conceptualization of  product familiarity, defined in terms of the cognitive structures of product knowledge  that are derived from past product-related experiences, and to present initial data  regarding its usefulness and validity. Our broad objectives are to begin to develop a  better understanding of how product experiences are represented in cognitive structure,  and of how cognitive structures influence the cognitive processes involved in handling  product information (e.g., making purchase choice decisions). PRODUCT FAMILIARITY AS COGNITIVE STRUCTURE Product familiarity has often been operationalized in terms of  product-related behavior, perhaps most often in terms of self-reported product usage  experience or frequency of use (of. Anderson, Engledow and Becker 1979, Jacoby, Chestnut  and Fisher 1978). An information processing approach, however, provides a different  perspective. From this point of view, the construct of interest is not the past product  experience per se, but the cognitive representations of that experience that are stored in  memory (see Bettman 1979, Olson 1978b, Russo and Johnson 1980). These representations can  be considered to be organized in memory as a pro-duct-related cognitive structure or  schema. Product schemas contain knowledge in the form of coded representations of brands,  product attributes, usage situations, general product class information, as well as  evaluations and choice rules. This coded information can be considered to be organized or  linked together and stored in memory as a structural framework of knowledge (Norman and  Bobrow 1975). Thus, product cognitive structures or schemas may contain not only factual  knowledge about the product, but also evaluations or affect, and in well developed  schemas, purchase criteria and even decision rules or strategies (Olson 1978a). Given this information processing perspective, product familiarity can be  defined in terms of consumers' cognitive structures for a product that were presumably  caused by various product-related experiences. Consumers with different amounts or types  of product-related experience probably have acquired cognitive structures with differing  characteristics. These variations in cognitive structure are assumed to cause the observed  behaviors previously attributed to the vague concept of "product familiarity."  Specific features or characteristics of cognitive structure are addressed later. Although this line of reasoning may be conceptually compelling, it will  not have much impact on our research unless we can develop reliable and valid measures  which tap, at least relatively directly, these cognitive structures for products and  brands. Before addressing operational issues, however, consider the developmental aspects  of product familiarity. EFFECTS OF PRODUCT-RELATED EXPERIENCES ON COGNITIVE STRUCTURE Several authors have called for a theoretical explanation regarding how  product-related experiences create cognitive structures and/or influence existing  cognitive structures (cf. Olson and Mitchell 1975, Russo and Johnson 1980). Hayes-Roth  (1977) presented such a conceptual framework which seems useful for considering the  effects of product experience on cognitive structure (see Olson and Dover 1978). According  to her model, processing information about a product creates the elementary coded  representations of knowledge--the concept nodes or cogits--of a product schema. As more  product-related experiences occur, these coded representations are  "strengthened" in memory and associations between the knowledge nodes develop  and become stronger (i.e., learning occurs). Eventually, presumably after multiple  experiences with the product, the configuration of associated representations has  developed to a point that it can be considered a well-developed, reasonably stable  structure. Moreover, substructures of the now "well-developed" schema may  be recoded, a chunking or "unitization" process (cf. Miller 1956, Simon 1974) by  which several separate components of the cognitive structure come to be treated  (cog-natively) as a single representation. Thus, this newly created concept or chunk  represents several other concepts. Chunking can be considered as a process of forming  abstract concepts by creating more general concepts to represent several more concrete  concepts. According to Hayes-Roth (1977), a chunk usually can be cognitively decomposed  into its "original" components, given appropriate instructions and processing,  although under ordinary circumstances it would be treated as a unitized representation. Consumers who are quite familiar with a product due to multiple past  experiences might be expected to have formed a stable, complex cognitive structure (or set  of structures) of product knowledge, perhaps containing multiple chunks (Olson and Dover  1978). At least one published study provides indirect support for the chunking  propositions discussed above. Edell and Mitchell (1978) found that subjects with  experimentally-manipulated prior experience regarding a previously unfamiliar product  category generated fewer total thoughts in response to an advertisement for a brand in  that product class than did subjects with little or no prior experience. From the  perspective discussed above, the experienced subjects may have generated ad-stimulated  thoughts about more abstract concepts--chunks if you will, "bigger" concepts  with "extra'' meaning--and thus they produced fewer total responses. Certainly this  interpretation is only speculative; however, as a partial test of this notion, subjects'  cognitive responses could be analyzed in terms of their level of abstractness or  concreteness. EFFECTS OF COGNITIVE STRUCTURE ON INFORMATION PROCESSING It is generally accepted that people use information from long-term memory  to perceive, interpret, and store new information (cf. Bettman 1979, Mitchell 1978, Olson  1978b, 1980). From the perspective advocated here, product-related schemas are activated  and provide the necessary cognitive structure for interpreting product information or new  product experiences (see Olson 1978a). In this sense, cognitive structures have a  fundamental influence on the processes of attention, encoding, evaluating, storing and  using information. For instance, differences in memory schemas should be evidenced by  variations in how consumers process information for which those cognitive structures are  relevant, whether the information is contained in ads, for instance, or is derived from  product use experiences. Thus, consumers' cognitive responses to an advertisement (Wright  1973) could provide clues about how cognitive structures influence encoding processes  (Olson 1980). In sum, peoples' existing cognitive structures should exert a 'powerful  influence on their cognitive processes and on their subsequent overt behavior. MEASURING COGNITIVE STRUCTURES Perhaps the major stumbling block in doing research on cognitive  structures is the measurement problem. How does one measure the content and organization  of a memory scheme for a product? This issue is too large for a thorough discussion here.  Briefly, however, Olson (1978b) has advocated "free elicitation" as a possible  measurement technique. In this procedure, subjects are given cue stimuli or memory probes  (usually words) and asked to "Tell me everything that comes to mind when I  say..." Presumably, the verbal responses elicited in response to product and/or  situation-specific probe cues can provide (admittedly imperfect) indicants of the content  and perhaps the organization of cognitive structures. [Russo and Johnson (1980) use a  thought protocol task similar to free recall tasks and the free elicitation task used  here, but that may provide a somewhat different perspective on product cognitive  structures.] In our research program thus far, we have had some success with this  technique (see Kanwar, Olson and Sims 1981, Olson and Muderrisoglu 1979). A simple free  elicitation procedure was used in this research to provide indices of two characteristics  of a product cognitive structure. RESEARCH PURPOSE The study described below serves only as an initial, exploratory  investigation of the ideas discussed above. It is exploratory because the research was  designed primarily for other purposes; however, part of the original design produced data  that are relevant for our objective. Specifically, there are two broad issues of major  interest. First, what differences in cognitive structures result from varying levels of  product experience or familiarity? That is, do our presumed measures of cognitive  structure reflect differences in product familiarity? Second, how do these cognitive  structure variables effect subsequent information processing operations and the formation  of product attitudes and purchase intentions? METHODS Product and Subjects The product was an innovative office chair. The chair had been designed to  orthopedically accommodate and support the user's body in a manner that would be both  healthful and comfortable. Moreover, the chair was intended to enhance the worker's task  performance while working at a desk. The specific chair was totally unfamiliar to all  subjects, although it was being marketed in other regions of the country. Subjects  consisted of 34 business students (mostly MBA's with some senior undergrads) and 20  secretaries from the University. Subjects were volunteers selected on a convenience basis.  They were paid $4.00 for their participation. Design The part of the original study examined here can be represented as a  simple 2 x 2 between-groups design. Two levels of product experience or familiarity (lower  and higher) were represented by the student and secretary groups. The second factor was  manipulated by exposing half of the subjects in each group (on a random basis) to a fairly  elaborate sales promotion message for the desk chair; the remaining subjects received no  product message. An after-only design was used because taking pre-exposure measures was  considered to be too sensitizing, and besides, subjects had no pre-experimental knowledge  of this particular chair that could be measured, Product Familiarity.  The main focus of interest is the cognitive  structure representation of product familiarity. To maximize inferential rigor, it might  have been preferable to experimentally manipulate familiarity, and thus cognitive  structure. However, it is difficult to create major differences in product familiarity and  related cognitive structures in the context of a controlled experiment. These variables  develop naturally in the real world over relatively long periods of time and many  experiences. Moreover, for the initial studies in a program of research on cognitive  structure, it seemed most efficient to first establish whether differences in existing  cognitive structures could be measured. Later, after we learn more about cognitive  structures, we can make better attempts to manipulate them. Therefore, we chose to use the  secretary and student groups as a classification variable, a surrogate  "manipulation" of familiarity with office desk chairs. It seemed reasonable to  assume that secretaries have greater amounts of experience and familiarity with office  desk chairs than do students. Exposure to Product Message.  The second independent variable was  exposure or not to a sales presentation for the new chair. Half of the subjects in each  group saw a 6-minute slide show of professional quality, produced by the manufacturer, and  accompanied by a synchronized tape-recorded sales presentation. In the promotion message,  the product was presented as of high quality and innovative in design. Four major sales  points were described verbally and portrayed visually (the chair is accommodating to one's  body, health giving, task motivating, and comfortable). Procedures Subjects were run individually. To enhance their motivation and to provide  a context for the experimental procedures, subjects were told to imagine that they were  part of an employee committee at their company which was to recommend the type and style  of furniture to be used in a remodeling of their offices. In fact, the chair is sometimes  sold in this way. After completing an informed consent form, subjects in the exposure  condition were shown the slide show presentation. Immediately after, they were asked to  record "all the thoughts you had while watching the presentation." Then,  concepts were elicited in response to three probe cues that were presented via the  instruction, "tell me all the characteristics that come to mind when you think about  buying an office desk, ... an office desk chair, ... a filing cabinet." Desk chair  was always the second probe. The interviewer recorded all responses verbatim. Following  the third probe, subjects rated their attitudes ("o and purchase  intentions (BI) regarding the advertised chair. The nonexposed subjects served as an internal control group to provide an  index of peoples' normative cognitive structure regarding the three probe cues,  uninfluenced by any persuasive message. After completing the informed consent form, these  subjects received the free elicitation procedures. No other measures were taken (no  cognitive responses, "o or BI). Dependent Variables Cognitive Structure.  To measure differences in cognitive structure  due to variation in product familiarity, we examined the results of the free elicitation  instruction, "Tell me all the characteristics that cone to mind when you think about  purchasing an office desk chair." Empirical indicators of two cognitive structure  characteristics were developed (see Kanwar, Slash and Sims 1981). The number of concepts  elicited served as an indicator of cognitive structure dimensionality and the  percentage of the elicited concepts judged more "abstract" (rather than more  concrete) was used as a measure of abstractness of cognitive structure. [In another  study, we obtained adequate levels of agreement for these two judgments between two  independent coders (r = .85 for total number of thoughts; r = .87 for judgment of abstract  vs. concrete; see Kanwar, Olson and Sins 1981)] Whether a concept was considered abstract  or concrete was based on experimenter judgment. Significant differences in these  indicators were expected between the secretary and the student groups due to their  presumed differences in product experience. However, exposure to the promotional message  might also produce some variation. Cognitive Processing.  Immediately following the message subjects  were given four minutes to write down the thoughts they had while watching the  presentation." These cognitive responses were coded in terms of the numbers of  counterarguments, support arguments, and total thoughts produced. As discussed earlier,  the cognitive responses of the more and less experienced groups were expected to vary  because of their different product-related cognitive structures. Attitude and Intentions.  Attitude toward the chair ("o)  was measured by the mean of three bipolar, 5-point scales labeled good-bad, high  quality-low quality, and like-dislike (coefficient alpha = .82). Behavioral intention (BI)  was measured on a 7-point bipolar scale by asking the subjects how likely they would be to  recommend purchase of the chair (not at all likely-very likely). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Check on Familiarity Classification Intuitively, it seemed reasonable to assume that secretaries, by virtue of  their daily experiences with office desk chairs, would be more familiar with the general  product class than students. Thus, secretaries' cognitive structures regarding desk chairs  should be different from those of students. To establish that their past experiences with  desk chairs did indeed differ, we asked both secretaries and students to report several  past behaviors. As expected, 1001 of the secretaries had worked at a job "that  involved desk work," while only 65% of the students had. Moreover, secretaries  reported that 85% of their work time was spent working at a desk, compared to 67% for  those students who had ever had a "desk job." [Two independent judges agreed on  85% of these judgments.] Differences in Cognitive Structure Next, it is important to establish that the secretary-student distinction,  as a surrogate "manipulation" of product familiarity, produced variation in our  measures of cognitive structure. Empirically, differences between secretaries and students  might be reflected in (a) the total number of salient characteristics of desks elicited,  and (b) the level of abstraction of the elicited concepts. Moreover, we need to determine  whether or not exposure to the persuasive sales material influenced these elicitation  measures. To enhance the study's low power caused in part by the relatively small cell  sizes (n's = 17 and 10), and because the exploratory nature of this research makes us  relatively more sensitive to Type II than Type I errors, we adopted an alpha level of .15  for statistical significance (cf., Cohen 1977). A 2-way, Familiarity by Exposure ANOVA showed that exposure to the sales  promotion did not affect the number of concepts elicited (p > .50, M's =  6.1 for exposed and 5.8 for not exposed, respectively), or the abstractness of the  elicited concepts (p > .20, M's = 44% and 36%). Although not  statistically reliable, the modest increase in abstract concepts due to exposure was to be  expected, since the sales promotion message did describe and portray several abstract  ideas (regarding the comfort, healthfulness, and accommodating properties of the chair)  that subjects probably were not aware of prior to message exposure. The ANOVA also  revealed that the total number of elicitations for students was somewhat greater than that  produced by the secretaries (M's = 6.2 vs. 5.2, F = 6.60, df = 1/50, p  = .0l), This difference is consistent with the proposition that greater product  familiarity results in the chunking of cognitive elements, which in turn causes fewer  verbalized responses to the elicitation probe. Implicit in this notion, however, is the  requirement that those fewer, chunked concepts represent higher levels of abstraction. In  fact, the presumably less familiar students did produce a lower percentage of abstract  concepts than did the secretaries, but not significantly so (M's = 41% and 34%, p  > .20). In sum, the present data provide weak support that the surrogate  "manipulation" of familiarity produced differences in cognitive structure.  [Parenthetically, it might be noted that an office chair is not a highly complex product.  Thus the degree of abstraction that logically can be expected may be somewhat limited. If  so, the variance in the percentage of abstract concepts to be discovered might be rather  small for a product of this type. For more complex products, differences in level of  abstraction might be more apparent.] Effects of Cognitive Structure and Product Message Next, we examine the effects that subjects' cognitive structures had on  their responses to the promotional material. The following results are based only on those  17 students and 10 secretaries who were exposed to the sales promotion message. Cognitive Responses.  Consistent with Edell and Mitchell's (1978)  results and the chunking proposition, we found that the presumably more experienced  secretaries produced marginally fewer cognitive responses to the product promotion than  the less experienced students (M's = 7.0 vs. 8.0, F = 1.51, df =  1/26, p = .23). Secretaries produced no more support arguments than students (M's  = 2.2 versus 2.0, p > .70), but did have fewer counterarguments (M's = .4  versus 1.8, F = 6.16, df = 1/26, p > .02) than the students. These results provide weak support for the notion that cognitive  processing of a product message is influenced by one's product-related cognitive  structures, which in turn reflect differences in product familiarity. By this perspective,  secretaries may possess better integrated, more abstract, and presumably more effective  product structures. Therefore, they might be expected to better understand and appreciate  the rather complex information presented in the sales promotion massage. Since the product  was convincingly described as of high quality, secretaries would be expected to perceive  it as such and support argue for the message, which they did, although not significantly  more so than students. Moreover, secretaries would not be expected to find as many points  with which to disagree in the apparently accurate product message. In contrast, students  with less-well developed, product-related schemas, may not have clear criteria on which to  judge the product. Thus, they might be expected to have some difficulty in relating the  information in the advertisement to their personal experiences. If so, they would be more  likely to disagree with the information and produce more counterarguments, which they in  fact did. Alternatively, however, students may simply have been more cynical or critical  than the secretaries, or may have felt greater "demands" to appear critical  during the experimental task. Attitude and Intentions Toward the Chair.  Cognitive responses,  especially counterarguments, have been shown to mediate the formation of attitudes and  intentions (e.g., Olson, Toy and Dover 1978, Wright 1974). Therefore, it was expected that  the secretaries would be more likely than the students to perceive the chair as being of  high quality and to recommend its purchase. This was indeed the case. Secretaries had more  favorable product attitudes than the students (M's = 4.6 versus 4.l, F =  3.03, df = 1/26, p < .10). And, consistent with their more positive  attitudes toward the chair, secretaries were more likely than students to recommend  purchase of the chair (M's = 6.0 vs. 5.1, F = 2.93, df = 1/26, p  < .10). These results lend additional credence to the presumed casual flow between  cognitive responses, attitudes, and intentions (cf. Edell and Mitchell 1978. Olson, Toy  and Dover 1978, Wright 1974). CONCLUSIONS AND SUGGESTIONS Like many initial investigations of new conceptualizations and measures,  the present research generates more questions than it answers. The paper's basic value is  probably in raising the issue of how "product familiarity" is to be treated as a  construct in consumer behavior theory. Although weak, we believe that the pattern of  obtained results are sufficiently interesting to warrant further investigation. Although the present data were derived from a larger study primarily  intended to address other issues, this does not invalidate the obtained results, In  particular, the elicitations were carried out about as we would do in a study specifically  designed to investigate cognitive structure issues. There are, however, problems in  interpreting the product familiarity/experience, student-secretary factor. Because levels  of familiarity were not manipulated, a variety of other differences exist between the two  groups besides their past experiences with desk chairs. These confoundings become serious  if one or more of these other factors can account for the observed pattern of results. A series of internal analyses revealed that neither age, nor sex, nor  marital status could consistently account for the obtained results. A stronger rival  explanation involves the experimental demand characteristics that may have been felt by  the secretary subjects. Perhaps the secretaries felt that they were "expected"  to react favorably to the positive information provided by the advertisement because they  had job experience with the product class. While this could account for their favorable  attitudes and purchase intentions, it is not clear why students would not also feel  "obligated" to react favorably. Additionally, if the secretaries felt that their  "expertise" was an issue, it seems likely that they would have sought other ways  to demonstrate their expertise. Thus, compared to students, the secretaries should have  produced more, not fewer, verbal elicitations, and more, not less, counterarguments in  response to the product message. Perhaps the most compelling alternative explanation for  the elicitation results is that students--especially MBA students--are rather verbal, and  therefore likely to produce more concepts in a free elicitation task than secretaries.  This explanation, however, cannot account for the other effects that were obtained. For  instance, why should "high verbalness" have a negative effect on "O  or BI? In summary, although of course it cannot be proposed with high confidence,  the most parsimonious explanation for the entire range of obtained results is that members  of the two groups had different cognitive structures. Interestingly, a similar study,  recently published by Anderson and Jolson (1980), obtained some of the same patterns of  results as found here. They found that advertisements for 35mm cameras containing  relatively technical information produced more favorable beliefs and attitudes for more  experienced consumers than for less experienced consumers. We would hypothesize that  greater product experience produced more complex cognitive structures containing abstract  concepts (chunks) and strong, clear interrelationships between concepts. Such memory  schemas seem necessary in order to comprehend complex information in a meaningful way.  Stated simply, complex information is mere persuasive for people who are able to more  fully comprehend it. Future Research Directions This study introduces the idea of conceptualizing product familiarity,  product experience, and product expertise in terms of the cognitive structures produced by  past product experience. Clearly, additional theorizing and empirical research is  necessary before this conceptualization can be generally accepted for use in other  research. In particular, we need a more explicit model of cognitive structure. What are  the relevant characteristics of a product cognitive structure or memory schema? What  measures can serve as empirical indicators of these constructs? How do these aspects of  cognitive structure affect other cognitive processes such as the encoding/comprehension  process or the information integration processes involved in judgment or decision making?  In short, how is past experience represented in a cognitive structure? Answers to such  questions will require an extensive research program focused on the construct validity of  a model of cognitive structure. We have begun such a program (cf. Olson and Dover 1978, Olson and  Muderrisoglu 1979, Olson and Sims 1980) which recently has produced signs of progress  (Kanwar, Olson and Sims 1981). Thus far, we have proposed three characteristics of  cognitive structure: dimensionality, the number of salient concepts scored in  memory, articulation, the number of discriminable categories along each dimension,  and abstraction, the level of abstractness of the dimensions. In addition to free  elicitations, the repertory grid procedure and a knowledge test appear to provide  potential measures of these cognitive structure elements (see Kanwar, Olson and Sims  1981). These developments also indicate a need for further improvements in methodology in  order to facilitate further research on cognitive structure. The first stage of future research could use the three cognitive structure  characteristics just mentioned to establish the aspects of cognitive structure that are  related to varying degrees of product familiarity. It does not seem important at this time  to attempt the actual manipulation of product familiarity. Rather, we should establish the  differences in structure that are associated with differences in experience. Presumably,  the constructs of dimensionality, articulation and abstraction vary not only across levels  of familiarity, but also for types of products. If so, of course, the data patterns  obtained in this preliminary research may not hold for very simple or very complex  products. Future research should attempt to replicate the present design in order to  establish the generalizability of these results. For instance, differences in cognitive  structures should be found between groups of subjects who a priori have different,  hopefully more extreme levels of product familiarity for several products of varying  complexity. Once this step is accomplished, it is necessary to demonstrate that the  measured differences in cognitive structure are related to differences in information  processing behavior, to attitudes and behavioral intentions, and to overt behavior. While  experimental simulations are useful for much of this research, actual field observations  in a natural environment will be necessary to establish external validity. Finally, research should focus on the developmental aspects of product  familiarity created by product experience or consumer socialization or consumer education.  Essentially, in a longitudinal study, subgroups of subjects could be brought to various  levels of product familiarity through product experience. Both cognitive and behavior  measures, which presumably would possess known reliabilities and validities by this rims,  should reflect the levels of product familiarity. In sum, a wide variety of interesting questions regarding the cognitive  structure representation of product familiarity can be addressed, once we have suitable  criterion measures. Of course, these questions have not been answered by the present  research. We have merely introduced the idea of conceptualizing product experience and  product familiarity in terms of cognitive structure and have produced some data that point  to the potential usefulness of this point of view. We hope that others will become  interested in developing these concepts and measurement procedures further. REFERENCES Anderson, Ralph E. and Jolson, Marvin A.

AbstractPrice, nonprice product information, and purchase intention, together with the intervening variables of perceived price, perceived quality, and perceived value, are empirically examined. The results indicate that perceived price is positively influenced by objective price and negatively influenced by reference price. They support the positive price-perceived quality relationship found in previous studies and, further, show that the influence of price on perceived quality is lessened in the presence of substantial direct product information. Finally, the results demonstrate that a trade-off between perceived price and perceived quality leads to perceived value, and perceived value is a primary factor influencing purchase intention.He received his Ph.D. from the University of Missouri.

Publisher's Summary
"Consumer Behavior" provides students with the knowledge and skills necessary to perform consumer analyses that can be used for understanding markets and developing effective marketing strategies. The authors have developed what they call the Wheel of Consumer Analysis, which is a tool to help the reader understand how consumer affect and cognition, consumer behavior, consumer environment, and marketing strategy interact. The wheel is a powerful tool for analyzing consumer behavior and can be used to understand consumers and to guide the development of effective marketing strategies.
