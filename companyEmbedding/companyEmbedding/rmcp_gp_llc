	PURPOSE OF TRANSACTION.








	Item 4 of
	this Schedule 13D is hereby amended to include the following information:





	As discussed in further detail in the Current
	Report on Form 8-K filed by Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (BBBY) with the SEC on May 10, 2012 (the BBBY 8-K) and the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Cost Plus with the SEC on May 10, 2012, BBBY, Cost Plus and Blue Coral
	Acquisition Corp. (Blue Coral), a wholly owned subsidiary of BBBY, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger on May 8, 2012 (the Merger Agreement) pursuant to which Blue Coral will merge with and into Cost Plus, subject to
	the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement (the Acquisition).




	On May 8, 2012, in connection with the
	Acquisition, each of RMCP II and RMCP III entered into a separate Support and Tender Agreement with BBBY and Blue Coral (collectively, the Support Agreements), pursuant to which RMCP II and RMCP III have agreed, among other things, to
	tender all of their shares of Common Stock (as well as to cause to be tendered 29,500 shares of Common Stock held by RMCP LLC and, if applicable, certain deferred stock units held by Mark Genender, a Partner of RMCP LLC who serves on the board of
	directors of Cost Plus) in the tender offer contemplated by the Merger Agreement and, if requested by BBBY, to vote such shares in favor of the merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Support
	Agreements. The Support Agreements also grant to certain officers of BBBY a proxy to vote such shares in favor of such merger and certain related matters. The Support Agreements will terminate upon certain circumstances, including upon (x) the
	termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, (y) an amendment of the Merger Agreement that reduces the consideration, changes the form thereof from all cash or materially and adversely affects, as applicable, RMCP II or RMCP
	III, or (z) November 9, 2012.




	The foregoing description of the Support Agreements is a summary only and it is qualified in its
	entirety by reference to the full text of the Support Agreements, which are filed as Exhibits 99.2 and 99.3 to the BBBY 8-K and incorporated by reference into this Schedule 13D as, respectively Exhibits 5 and 6 to this Schedule 13D.




	The Reporting Persons currently intend for RMCP II and RMCP III to comply with their obligations under the Support Agreements and do not
	currently expect to file any further amendment to this Schedule 13D to report the actual taking of any action taken by them, including the tendering of any shares in such tender offer or the voting of any shares in support of such merger, that is
	required to be taken by the RMCP II or RMCP III under the Support Agreements.

	ITEM  5.






	INTEREST IN SECURITIES OF THE ISSUER.








	Items 5(a) and 5(b) of this Schedule 13D is hereby amended and restated as follows:




	 















	(a)-(b)






	  







	RMCP II beneficially owns, in the aggregate, 1,542,150 shares of Common Stock, which represent approximately 6.9% of the
	outstanding Common Stock.



	(1)



	Except as otherwise provided
	in the Support Agreements, RMCP II has the sole power to vote or direct the vote, and the sole power to dispose or direct the disposition, of all such 1,542,150 shares of Common Stock.



	 



	RMCP III beneficially owns, in the aggregate, 1,656,961 shares of Common Stock,
	which represent approximately 7.4% of the outstanding Common Stock. Except as otherwise provided in the Support Agreements, RMCP III has the sole power to vote or direct the vote, and the sole power to dispose or direct the disposition, of all such
	1,656,961 shares of Common Stock.



	 



	RMCP LLC holds directly 29,500 shares of
	Common Stock, which represent approximately 0.1% of the outstanding Common Stock. Except as otherwise provided in the Support Agreements, RMCP LLC has the sole power to vote or direct the vote, and the sole power to dispose or direct the
	disposition, of all such 29,500 shares of Common Stock.



	 



	The shares of
	Common Stock beneficially owned by RMCP II and RMCP III, when aggregated together, total 3,199,111 shares of Common Stock, which represent approximately 14.2% of the outstanding Common Stock. The shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by RMCP II,
	RMCP III, and RMCP LLC, when aggregated together, total 3,228,611 shares, which represent approximately 14.4% of the outstanding Common Stock.



	 



	As the general partner of each of RMCP II and RMCP III, RMCP GP controls RMCP II and RMCP III and therefore may be deemed to beneficially own all shares
	of Common Stock beneficially owned by RMCP II and RMCP III. As the managing member of RMCP GP, RMCP LLC controls RMCP GP (and thus may be deemed to control indirectly RMCP II and RMCP III) and therefore may be deemed to beneficially own all shares
	of Common Stock beneficially owned by RMCP GP (including all shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by II and RMCP III).



	 



	Because each of RMCM and Mr. Mesdag may be deemed to control RMCP LLC (and thus may be deemed to control indirectly RMCP GP, RMCP II and RMCP III), each of RMCM and Mr. Mesdag may be deemed to
	beneficially own, and to have the power to vote or direct the vote, or dispose or direct the disposition of, all of the Common Stock beneficially owned by RMCP LLC, RMCP GP, RMCP II and RMCP III.



	 



	Each of RMCP LLC, RMCP II, RMCP III and RMCP GP affirms membership in a group with
	each other but disclaims membership in a group with RMCM or Mr. Mesdag. Each of RMCM and Mr. Mesdag disclaims membership in a group with any person.



	 



	Mr. Genender, a Partner of RMCP LLC who serves on the board of directors of Cost Plus, holds 11,060 deferred stock units, each of which represents a
	contingent right to one share of Common Stock, which were issued by Cost Plus to Mr. Genender as director compensation for board






	 








	(1)

	 







	All calculations of percentage ownership in this Schedule 13D are based on (i) 22,490,362 shares of Common Stock outstanding as of April 6, 2102, as
	reported in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2012, which was filed by Cost Plus with the SEC on April 10, 2012, plus (ii) the shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of all stock options (if any)
	exercisable within 60 days of the date of this filing that may be deemed to be beneficially owned by the person(s) whose percentage ownership is being calculated.

	service. Such deferred stock units are currently unvested and are excluded from the shares described
	above as being beneficially owned (or deemed to be beneficially owned) by any of the Reporting Persons.




	The filing of this
	Schedule 13D shall not be construed as an admission that any Reporting Person is the beneficial owner of any of the shares of Common Stock that such Reporting Person may be deemed to beneficially own. Without limiting the foregoing sentence, RMCM
	disclaims beneficial ownership of all shares of Common Stock reported in this Schedule 13D, and Mr. Mesdag disclaims beneficial ownership of all shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by RMCP II and RMCP III. In addition, the filing of this
	Schedule 13D shall not be construed as an admission that any partner, member, director, officer or affiliate of any Reporting Person is the beneficial owner of any of the shares of Common Stock that such partner, member, director, officer or
	affiliate may be deemed to beneficially own. Without limiting the foregoing sentence, each of Mr. Teets and Mr. Genender disclaims beneficial ownership of all shares of Common Stock reported in this Schedule 13D.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year
