First Commonwealth branch in downtown New Castle, Pennsylvania.


First Commonwealth Financial Corporation is a financial services company based in Indiana, Pennsylvania, primarily serving the Western and Central Pennsylvania as well as Canton and Columbus, Ohio.
First Commonwealth has long served the Central Pennsylvania region, but began aggressively expanding into the Western part of the state in the early 2000s (decade), particularly Pittsburgh. In 2016, the bank purchased several Ohio-based banks growing its footprint. It is currently the fifth-largest bank in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area behind PNC Financial Services, Citizens Financial Group, First Niagara Bank, and privately held Dollar Bank.[1]
First Commonwealth is one of the few stronger banks that did not accept TARP funds in 2008.[2]

First Commonwealth branch in downtown New Castle, Pennsylvania.


First Commonwealth Financial Corporation is a financial services company based in Indiana, Pennsylvania, primarily serving the Western and Central Pennsylvania as well as Canton and Columbus, Ohio.
First Commonwealth has long served the Central Pennsylvania region, but began aggressively expanding into the Western part of the state in the early 2000s (decade), particularly Pittsburgh. In 2016, the bank purchased several Ohio-based banks growing its footprint. It is currently the fifth-largest bank in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area behind PNC Financial Services, Citizens Financial Group, First Niagara Bank, and privately held Dollar Bank.[1]
First Commonwealth is one of the few stronger banks that did not accept TARP funds in 2008.[2]

First Commonwealth branch in downtown New Castle, Pennsylvania.


First Commonwealth Financial Corporation is a financial services company based in Indiana, Pennsylvania, primarily serving the Western and Central Pennsylvania as well as Canton and Columbus, Ohio.
First Commonwealth has long served the Central Pennsylvania region, but began aggressively expanding into the Western part of the state in the early 2000s (decade), particularly Pittsburgh. In 2016, the bank purchased several Ohio-based banks growing its footprint. It is currently the fifth-largest bank in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area behind PNC Financial Services, Citizens Financial Group, First Niagara Bank, and privately held Dollar Bank.[1]
First Commonwealth is one of the few stronger banks that did not accept TARP funds in 2008.[2]

"Our Rewards and Student cards will allow cardholders the opportunity to receive credit for future purchases, while our Secured card can help build or improve credit. An added convenience is that our cards launched with Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Android Pay capability."Customers using the Rewards and Student cards will receive 1 percent back as a statement credit at the end of each quarter. The Secured card is for those individuals who have not established credit or have a credit score that prohibits them from obtaining credit. All primary cardholders for the three MasterCard options will have access to FICO® Score, updated quarterly, through statements.The credit cards have an EMV® chip that encrypts information for increased data security for transactions at terminals or ATMs that are chip-enabled. Customers can also sign up for MasterCard's SecureCode on www.fcbanking.com. SecureCode is a private code for a MasterCard account that gives an additional layer of online shopping security.First Commonwealth credit cards can be opened online at www.fcbanking.com or in person at any First Commonwealth Banking office. Cardholders can review account information and make payments through online banking. In addition, alerts can be sent via text or email to monitor account activity.First Commonwealth is offering promotions during the credit card launch. All of the cards will have a $0 balance transfer fee for the first three months the account is open, and the Rewards and Student cards will have a 0 percent APR for purchases and balance transfers for the first six months.About First Commonwealth Financial CorporationFirst Commonwealth Financial Corporation (FCF), headquartered in Indiana, PA, is a financial services company with $6.7 billion in total assets and 109 banking offices in 17 counties throughout western and central Pennsylvania and central Ohio, as well as a Corporate Banking Center in northeast Ohio and mortgage offices in Stow and Dublin, Ohio.
