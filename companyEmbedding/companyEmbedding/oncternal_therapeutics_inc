Oncternal Therapeutics | TK216



















TK216



We began 16 years ago to create a drug that targeted an ideal Achilles' heel in Ewing sarcoma. This target was EWS-FLI1, which is only found in Ewing sarcoma tumor cells and has been called 'undruggable'. Now, TK216 demonstrates that not only is EWS-FLI1 druggable, but that the potential of TK216 inhibiting a broader range of tumors driven by similar oncogenes is a real unexpected benefit.
— Dr. Jeffrey Toretsky, Georgetown University —

ets-Family Transcription Factor Inhibitor
TK216 is a small molecule that inhibits the biological activity of ets-family transcription factor oncoproteins in a variety of tumor types, stopping cancer cell growth and tumor formation. Following the successful filing of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application in the U.S., we are opening a phase 1 study of TK216 to begin in the second quarter of 2016 in patients with relapsed Ewing sarcoma (ES), a rare bone cancer that strikes children and young adults with a typical onset between 10 and 25 years of age. 
Targeting Known Oncogenes 
The ets-transcription factor family includes  four members implicated as oncogenes, or genes that have been identified as initiators  of cancer. While they are active in embryogenesis, the ets-family transcription factor proteins are not commonly expressed  after birth, presenting an ideal target for researchers hoping to exclusively  affect cancer cell growth. In Ewing sarcoma (ES), the cancer is caused by a  single and well-characterized genetic mutation that leads to a chimeric ets protein, which enables patients to  be easily identified with DNA-based testing. The ets-family transcription factor proteins are also expressed in  various other cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia, glioblastoma and  prostate cancer.
  
Ewing Sarcoma Has High Unmet Medical Need We are initially advancing TK216 in development for ES  because of the tremendous need for new, targeted therapies for this devastating  disease and the hope that it can be made available for patients with an  expedited approval pathway. In the last 30 years, no new therapies have been  approved specifically for ES. Despite advances in chemotherapy and local  control measures, many patients have very poor outcomes. We are planning subsequent  studies to investigate TK216 in patients with other cancers whose tumors carry  mutant or overexpressed levels of ets-family  oncogenes. 
Collaboration with Georgetown University
TK216 was developed  based on the discoveries of Jeff A Toretsky, MD, at Georgetown  University, who identified a small molecule that was shown to kill Ewing  sarcoma cells and inhibit growth of tumors in preclinical studies. Oncternal scientists  developed and tested a large series of derivatives of the research molecule,  and, after extensive evaluation, TK216 was selected as our lead product  candidate. TK216 has been extensively evaluated in preclinical studies, where  it has been shown to kill ES cells. We continue to collaborate with Dr.  Toretsky and his colleagues in order to advance the research underlying the  molecular pathways of TK216 and optimize its development across multiple tumor  types.

Oncternal Therapeutics | Cirmtuzumab



















Cirmtuzumab




The ROR1 pathway holds great promise in terms of generating a new wave of first-in-class, targeted cancer therapies for patients with a number cancers, including leukemia, lymphoma, and solid tumors such as ovarian and breast cancers.— Dr. Thomas J. Kipps, University of California San Diego —






AboutOverviewOur TeamPartnership OpportunitiesBackPipelineOverviewCirmtuzumabTK216PreclinicalBackScienceOverviewPublications on CirmtuzumabPublications on TK216BackPatientsInvestors & MediaOverviewPress ReleasesBackIn the NewsContact

Humanized mAb to ROR1
Cirmtuzumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody designed and developed to bind with high affinity to a biologically important epitope on the extracellular domain of Receptor-tyrosine kinase-like Orphan Receptor 1 (ROR1).  Cirmtuzumab is currently being tested in a phase 1 trial for patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most common form of leukemia in adults that contributes to approximately 4,650 U.S. deaths annually.  We’re also working to rapidly advance cirmtuzumab into additional clinical trials to bring forward this novel therapeutic to patients with other types of cancer.
   
ROR1 is a marker for many cancers
ROR1 is a type 1 transmembrane protein expressed on the plasma membrane with an extracellular domain that is essential for ligand binding and signal transduction. This novel target is highly expressed in many hematologic malignancies, including CLL and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), as well as by a number of solid tumors, including lung, ovarian, and triple-negative breast cancer.  Binding of cirmtuzumab to ROR1 on tumor cells inhibits Wnt5a signaling, a pathway important for blocking tumor-cell proliferation, migration, and survival.  Blocked Wnt5a signaling leads to tumor cell death by apoptosis.
  
Unmet Need in CLL
CLL is the most common type of leukemia in adults, with approximately 15,000 new cases diagnosed per year in the US.  A diagnosis of CLL has been shown to shorten the life expectancy of all patients and the disease is not curable with standard therapies.  While many patients can live with CLL for years, there remains a strong need for therapies to manage CLL, particularly in patients with advanced disease who may face rapid progression and a median survival of not more than 2 years.  As a highly targeted, first-in-class therapy, cirmtuzumab has the potential to be used either alone or in combination to treat CLL and other cancers where ROR1 is expressed.
Collaboration with University of California San Diego
Cirmtuzumab was developed at the University of California San Diego based on the pioneering scientific research of Thomas Kipps, MD PhD,  and his colleagues at the Moores Cancer Center. Oncternal holds an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize antibodies and antibody-related binding agents recognizing ROR1.

Working with UC San Diego, Oncternal is also conducting preclinical research on several potential ROR1-directed antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), with early evidence of promising anti-tumor efficacy and specificity. A further collaboration between Oncternal and UC San Diego focuses on a Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cells (CAR-T) program, which is evaluating several potential CAR-T vectors that can be introduced into a cancer patient’s T-cells, directing them to recognize and kill tumor cells that express ROR1.

Oncternal Therapeutics Merges With Tokalas to Form Clinical-Stage Biotechnology Company







Oncternal Therapeutics, Inc. and Tokalas, Inc., recently announced the two companies have completed a merger to create a new world-class clinical-stage oncology company with two promising, first-in-class pipeline products. The transaction was approved by both companies' shareholders, and results in the combination of all assets, research and developments programs and operations under the name Oncternal Therapeutics, Inc.
"We are merging two San Diego companies developing clinical-stage therapeutic candidates against novel and important cancer targets, creating an exciting new oncology company with a clinical-stage pipeline spanning multiple technologies and cancer indications," said Dr. James Breitmeyer, President and CEO. "Common regulatory and development strategies result in significant synergies for the combined company. Our highly experienced management team will lead Oncternal forward and rapidly advance our two products, cirmtuzumab and TK216, into additional clinical trials for some of the most devastating and underserved forms of cancer."
The Oncternal board of directors and management team has extensive experience in the formation and successful development of biotechnology companies and innovative pharmaceutical products. The company announced key leadership appointments including: 
-President and CEO will be James B. Breitmeyer, MD, PhD, an oncologist with over 25 years in the industry who has led efforts resulting in approval of eight US or international product approvals. 
-The board of directors will be chaired by Dave Johnson, who most recently led Acerta to a strategic transaction with AstraZeneca valued at up to $7 billion. The other initial board members will be David Hale, Cam Garner, Scott Glenn, and James Breitmeyer, who have been involved in founding and/or developing over 30 successful life sciences companies.
As a combined company, Oncternal Therapeutics will hold exclusive worldwide development and commercialization rights to two clinical-stage oncology products with potential across a range of cancer indications:
-Cirmtuzumab, a first-in-class anti-ROR1 monoclonal antibody, currently in a Phase I clinical trial for patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Cirmtuzumab was developed by Thomas Kipps, MD, at the Moores Cancer Center of UC San Diego, who conducted extensive research to characterize the function and expression of ROR1, which may identify cancer stem cells in a number of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. Oncternal and UC San Diego are planning studies in CLL, breast cancer and mantle cell lymphoma this year. Oncternal also has rights to develop antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), genetically modified effector immune cells, such as chimeric antigen receptor T-cells (CAR-T), and bispecific antibodies related to ROR1. 
-TK216, a first-in-class small molecule ets-family transcription factor inhibitor, about to enter Phase I testing for patients with Ewing sarcoma. TK216 is based upon the discoveries of Jeffrey A. Toretsky, MD, at Georgetown University, who conducted extensive research on the ets-family oncogenic translocations that cause or drive tumor growth in a number of solid and hematologic malignancies. Oncternal and Georgetown are planning clinical studies in Ewing sarcoma, glioblastoma, and prostate cancer in the next year.

Press Releases



Oncternal Therapeutics Awarded Exclusive Worldwide License to ROR1 Antibody and Related Programs from UC San Diego

Pioneering Research at UC San Diego Provides Foundation for New Cancer Focused Start-Up




Apr 12, 2016, 2:36pm EDT














SAN DIEGO, April 12, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Oncternal Therapeutics, Inc., a new oncology-focused biotechnology company, today announced that it has received an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize antibodies and antibody-related binding agents recognizing Receptor-tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1) from University of California San Diego.  The licensing agreement also encompasses rights for all therapeutic indications to cirmtuzumab, an anti-ROR1 monoclonal antibody that is currently in a clinical trial for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), as well as rights to develop antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), genetically modified effector immune cells, such as chimeric antigen receptor T-cells (CAR-T), and bispecific antibodies.  
The formation of Oncternal Therapeutics is based upon the pioneering research of UC San Diego scientist and clinician, Thomas J. Kipps, M.D. Ph.D., Evelyn and Edwin Tasch Chair in Cancer Research, Distinguished Professor UC San Diego, and Deputy Director, Research Operations, Moores Cancer Center.  As one of the most wide-ranging licensing transactions executed by UC San Diego's Office of Innovation and Commercialization, the agreement includes upfront and milestone payments, research funding for the Kipps laboratory, clinical support, product royalties, and an equity position in Oncternal.  Specific financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed.
"We are delighted to complete this agreement with Oncternal Therapeutics, as it furthers our goal of developing effective therapies for patients with any one of a number of types of cancer, including leukemia and lymphoma, as well as solid tumors, such as ovarian or breast cancer," said Dr. Kipps. "We are very pleased to see our discovery, research and early clinical development program trigger the formation of a new biotechnology company in San Diego led by an experienced leadership team." 
"The scientific work done by Dr. Kipps and his colleagues has been extraordinary and holds great promise to generate a new wave of first-in-class, targeted cancer therapies," said David F. Hale, Chairman of Oncternal Therapeutics.  "We are excited to build a world-class company focused on the development of these promising ROR1 programs, which feature novel science and a strong intellectual property portfolio that we plan to enhance in the future.  We look forward to rapidly advancing cirmtuzumab into additional clinical trials and bringing forward novel therapeutics for the treatment of patients with these devastating diseases."
The anti-ROR1 monoclonal antibody, cirmtuzumab, was developed at UC San Diego by Dr. Kipps, with funding from the US National Institutes of Health, the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM), and the Blood Cancer Research Fund.  Cirmtuzumab is currently being tested in a phase 1 clinical trial for patients with relapsed/refractory CLL.  Studies have shown that ROR1 is expressed by a number of hematologic malignancies as well as by a number of solid tumors. 
"Creating a treatment that will help patients is not just a matter of good scientific work, it's also a matter of good business planning and leadership. This agreement brings those two elements together," says C. Randal Mills, President and CEO of CIRM.  "We are hopeful this alliance will help accelerate the progress of Dr. Kipps research, and we congratulate him and his team at UC San Diego."
Oncternal will also continue development of several preclinical development programs initiated by UC San Diego, including potential ROR1-directed ADCs, with early evidence of promising anti-tumor efficacy and specificity, and several potential CAR-T vectors, which can be introduced into a cancer patient's T-cells, enabling the cells to recognize and kill tumor cells that express ROR1.  Oncternal Therapeutics intends to continue the development of the CAR-T program in collaboration with the Moores Cancer Center.  
"One of our missions as a public university is to translate our research into public benefit," said Paul Roben, Associate Vice Chancellor for Innovation at UC San Diego. "This successful collaboration exemplifies that commitment to social responsibility."
Cirmtuzumab Cirmtuzumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that was designed and developed to bind with high affinity to a biologically important epitope on the extracellular domain of ROR1. Binding of cirmtuzumab to ROR1 on tumor cells inhibits Wnt5a signalling, a pathway that is important for tumor-cell proliferation, migration, and survival. Blockade of this Wnt5a signaling leads to tumor cell death by apoptosis.
About ROR1Receptor-tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 – also known as ROR1 -- is a type 1 transmembrane protein that is expressed on the plasma membrane with an extracellular domain that is essential for ligand binding and signal transduction.  High-level expression of ROR1 has been found in many cancers.  The highest and most consistent expression of the ROR1 protein is in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) where virtually all patient samples express ROR1, and CLL, where 95 percent express ROR1 on the cell surface.  ROR1 is also expressed at high frequency in many solid tumors, including lung and ovarian cancers, as well as triple-negative breast cancer.
About Oncternal TherapeuticsOncternal Therapeutics has been formed around the groundbreaking research at UC San Diego of Dr. Thomas Kipps on the ROR1 signaling system, and the development of antibodies and related binding agents to treat ROR1-expressing cancers.  The Oncternal leadership team has extensive experience in the formation and successful development of biotechnology companies and innovative pharmaceutical products.  The founders and initial board members include David F. Hale, Cam Garner, Scott Glenn, and James B. Breitmeyer, who have been involved in founding and/or development of a number of life sciences companies in San Diego.  Hale and Garner were members of the senior management team of Hybritech with its subsequent sale to Eli Lilly and Company.  One or more of the founders have had key roles with Gensia, Dura, CancerVax, Santarus, SkinMedica, Quidel, Dexcom, Neurelis, Cadence, Evoke Pharma, Zogenix, and a number of other life sciences companies in San Diego.  For more information, visit www.oncternal.com.
