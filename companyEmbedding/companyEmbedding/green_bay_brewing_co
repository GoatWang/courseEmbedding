Overview

AboutThe craft beer industry continues to grow and Green Bay is emerging as one of the premier destinations in the Midwest for breweries, brew pubs, alehouses, and craft focused bars, restaurants, and retailers. The brewing industry also continues to grow adding more breweries and taprooms throughout the greater Green Bay area.

As a result, the first ever Green Bay Craft Beer Week was held in May of 2015. Due to its largely successful participation and welcome from the community, the celebration continues onto its second year with hopes of becoming one of the most anticipated weeks in Northeast Wisconsin.

Founders Krystina Engebos, Andrew Fabry, and Heather Ludwig invite you to join them and all the participating Green Bay Craft Beer Week sponsors and venues during this week long celebration of all things craft beer!About the Founders:

Krystina - Krystina continues her career in the craft beer industry as the Distribution and Production Manager at Titletown Brewing Company in downtown Green Bay. She spends her days there coordinating the packaging and shipping of draft and bottled product as well as continuing education for their brewpub staff. A self-proclaimed advocate of the craft industry, Krystina loves talking beer over a pint.

Heather - Heather began working in the craft beer industry first at Hereford & Hops in Wausau, then at Titletown Brewing Co. in 2008 where she served, bartended and brewed on their 15 barrel pub system. In 2015, she began working for Pabst Brewing Company as Head Brewer of their Innovation Brewery, but has since returned to brewing operations at Titletown Brewing Co. Heather enjoys being back in Green Bay and is proud to be part of a brewing community with a rich brewing history and passionate beer connoisseurs.

			Stillmank Brewing Company
		
	
Brad Stillmank, the master mind behind the beer, runs every aspect of this microbrewery on Green Bay’s east side. Stillmank Brewing has certainly made a name for itself with their most popular brew, Wisco Disco, a deep amber colored beer brewed with five different malts and four giant hop additions finished with cold-conditioning (not pasteurized) which leaves it naturally cloudy and refreshing. Continually experimenting with new beers and other variations of successful ones, the passion that goes into each beer is evident upon first sip.

 Take a tour of the brewing area to learn the science behind craft beer. Belly up to the tap room bar to order a flight sampling several Stillmank beers. Order a Perky Porter (made with locally roasted coffee at La Java Roasting House) in a coffee mug and get a donut hole on the side. Good news porter fans, the Perky Porter is now a full-time brew after seeing so much success in season and demand for it throughout the year! The taproom and brewing space can even be rented out to host small parties and events. 

 Stillmank’s taproom is open Wednesday thru Saturday, but you can find their beer in many Green Bay bars and liquor stores. Even Lambeau Field proudly pours Green Bay craft beer!

 Wednesday – Friday 4:00pm – 8:00pm
Saturday 2:00pm – 8:00pm
