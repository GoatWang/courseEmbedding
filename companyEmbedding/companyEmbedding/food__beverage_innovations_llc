+ What are the dimension and weight?
The unit is approximately 16” W x 17” D x 20” H and similar in size to other backbar machines currently in the market (i.e. shot chilling machines). The final production weight is under 100lbs. 

+ How do I clean it?
We’ve got you covered. Jevo is 98% self-cleaning with an automated water flushing system that cleans Jevo at the end of every batch, ensuring your Jevo shots taste perfect every time.

+ What is JevoChill?
JevoChill is a quick-chilled shot machine specifically designed to work with Jevo. Unlike common liquor chilling machines, it dispenses a variety of spirits, tracks the number of shots poured, and uses the same Precise Pour technology used in Jevo to prevent waste from overpour, helping you bring down your liquor costs! Learn more here. 

+ What flavors are available?
Jevo’s proprietary flavor pods are designed to work specifically with Jevo. Each Jevo pod contains everything but your liquor of choice to simplify the process of making 20 shots in just minutes.

+ What flavors are available?
Our goal is to keep your customers coming back for more and right now we have 10 great tasting flavors perfected with more to come. We currently have 3 categories of shots, from traditional gelatin shots like Lemon and Cherry, cocktail-inspired varieties like Piña Colada and Margarita, and even Birthday Cake. 

+ Can I create my own flavor pod?
Beginning in 2016, Jevo partners will be able to work with us to build custom, proprietary flavor profiles optimized for their brand. Not only will this increase brand consumption, it will help bartenders and mixologists to create perfectly tasting Jevo gelatin shots, which will, in turn, drive incremental new revenue for the accounts. Please contact us at info@foodbevinnovations.com for more information.

+ How do the Jevo shots taste?
Great! Our flavors elevate the taste and experience for everyone involved: consumers, our clients and our brand partners. Jevo adds exactly half an ounce of spirit to each shot and makes each Jevo shot  perfect;u with just the right amount of flavor spirit consistency.

The cups are supplied with the flavor pods at no additional cost.

+ How many gelatin shots can Jevo make?
Jevo makes 20 gelatin shots per round in minutes with no need for standby time in between batches.  After a quick clean, Jevo is ready to go again.

+ How much do the Jevo shots cost?
The national average is $2.50 per gelatin shot, but there are a lot of variables that can influence the price, including the local market and spirit used to make the shots. Promotional pricing encourages volume sales, so it is not uncommon to see promotions offering multiple Jevo shots for a discounted price. Jevo shots are estimated to generate 70%-80% profit margins for the location on average. We recommend viewing the pricing chart on this page to understand how your shot price impacts your net annual profit. 

+ Jevo shots Vs. Edible cocktails, what's the difference?
Jevo shot is a branded term and specifically refers to the gelatin shots made using Jevo's patented process and the high-quality ingredients. Gelatin shots and edible cocktails are synonymous and used at the discretion of the account based on the experience created for their patrons. Sometimes gelatin shots are called "jelly" shots, especially outside of the U.S. Gelatin shots usually feature a range of traditional flavors, such as lemon, orange and cherry and are traditionally paired with vodka. Edible cocktails have a broader range of sophistication, entailing flavors like margarita and pina colada and are commonly enhanced with a garnish. The term itself can refer to products not necessarily involving gelatin. The Jevo shot process uses precisely measured ingredients, a proprietary perfectly-flavored gelatin blend, and quick chill technology to ensure consistency. They pair with almost any spirit you can imagine.

+ Is there an easy method to serving them?
The tray is designed with the bartender's time in mind. It is used with Jevo's shot cups, enabling the 20 Jevo shots to be served as fast as they can come out of the chilling drawer. With the patented tray system, bartenders can easily promote and serve individual Jevo shots around the bar or serve all 20 to a group of patrons at once. The trays come with a lid and stack nicely for a tiny 10.5" x 10.5" footprint. Now, fridge space is no longer an issue.
+ How long are gelatin shots good for?  
For an optimal experience, gelatin shots are intended to be consumed usually within 1-3 days, if not the same day. For the best customer experience, we recommend serving them as fresh as possible and keeping them well chilled. 

+ Are Jevo shots gluten free?
Yes. Jevo flavor pod blends do not contain any wheat gluten. 

+ What types of liquor can I put into the machine?
Nearly any liquor can be used in Jevo, creating unlimited mixology for the bartender. Of course, we can't test every liquor on the planet. So, be conscious of cream based, gold flake or any other liquor that has a low viscocity or elements that could potentially clog Jevo's system. 

+ Where does the water come from?
Jevo is hard plumbed, similar to your fridge or coffee maker. We will send out our installer to meet Jevo and get you all set up and ready to make money!

+ Is Jevo available in countries outside the US?
We are focused on launching Jevo in the North American markets; however, we are currently in discussions with multiple partners globally. If you are located outside of the U.S., please email us at info@foodbevinnovations.com for more information.

+ Are the flavor pods and serving cups recyclable?
Yes. Unlike many of the other pod systems in the market, Jevo serving cups and flavor pods are made from polypropylene and are recyclable. We are super excited about that. 

+ How do I become a partner?
Please contact us at info@foodbevinnovations.com for more information. 
+ Can I buy a Jevo for my home?
The Jevo Home unit is currently in development and is expected to be available in 2017. For more information about Jevo Home, please visit www.jevohome.com. 

+ What happens if something breaks? Is there a warranty?
We hope that never happens, but if it does we have your covered. Jevo has a built-in set of features that proactively monitors the machine and alerts us of any performance issues, allowing us to react quickly and minimize any potential down-time. Jevo comes with a 1-year comprehensive warranty on parts and labor for defective components. 

+ What is Jevomedia™?
JEVOMEDIA™ is an easy to use web based digital advertising platform and  is located on the front of Jevo. JEVOMEDIA lets you rotate static digital ads or video promotions in real-time to the large digital screen. For more information, please visit the JEVOMEDIA™ page. 

+ Where do you recommend I place my Jevo unit?

Why We Started This CompanyTo revolutionize the process of making jello.  Food & Beverage Innovations has developed the first ever fully automated jello making machine, called Jevo. Similar in concept to the Keurig coffee systems & Soda Stream, Jevo provides an automated and easy to use solution to the market that eliminates the current manual, time consuming and messy process.  Jevo reduces the 4-5 hour manual process of making jello to about 10 minutes!  What Sets Us ApartOur extremely innovative and easy to use product + technology coupled with our revolutionary design, strong IP portfolio and massive market appeal, really sets us apart. Jevo is a multifaceted product that will initially launch in the food & beverage industry with jello + edible shots, followed by our healthcare and home launch with supplement jello cups.  Users simply choose one of our proprietary flavor pods, insert, and press go, resulting in 20 great tasting jello cups in about 10 minutes. Our Keys To SuccessOur product portfolio is both innovative & disruptive, the market opportunity is massive and we have an executive team with over 40 years of combined experience in launching & growing start-ups, and building innovative product & technology companies.  We have a highly leveraged business model with predictable recurring revenue streams, high gross and net margins and low cost of customer acquisition allowing us to scale and grow quickly across multiple markets globally.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Taking Food and Beverage Innovation to a Higher Level through Improving Product Development Practices, Mitigating Risks and Ultimately Addressing Ever-Changing Consumer Demands throughout the Food Supply from Supplier to Manufacturer to Table

 

ABOUT THE CONFERENCE
Food and beverage companies throughout the industry must continually re-invent products in order to remain fresh, retain market share, and maintain a presence in consumer shopping baskets. Increasingly, consumers are stepping up demands on the foods purchased by asking for clean labels, transparency from manufacturers as well as great taste and the highest quality and safety.  In addition, consumers are relying less on branded products and loyalty, are shopping in non-traditional channels for food and often purchase based on immediate gratification and price. As such, traditional products need reinvention, and new products must be finely developed, strategically placed and marketed in order to succeed in a highly competitive marketplace. Fortunately, there are numerous strategies that companies can apply in order to develop such innovative products and retain market share; from playing on consumer desires for healthier food choices, organic options, elimination of allergens in foods, as well as the increasing trend and reliance on semi-prepared foods. The sky is the limit for executives within food & beverage companies looking to innovate and recreate products, and this conference program will provide executives with a unique opportunity for insights into what other companies are doing, as well as a very relevant educational opportunity.
