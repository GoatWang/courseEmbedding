For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Fitch Rates Nissan Auto Receivables 2016-C Owner TrustHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreTry Yahoo Finance on Firefox »YahooSearchSearchSign inU.S. Markets open in 2 hrs 13 minsS&P Futures2,478.50+5.25 (+0.21%)Dow Futures21,679.00+33.00 (+0.15%)Nasdaq Futures5,979.25+31.25 (+0.53%)Fitch Rates Nissan Auto Receivables 2016-C Owner TrustBusiness WireAugust 10, 2016ReblogShareTweetShareNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings and Rating Outlooks to the Nissan Auto Receivables 2016-C Owner Trust notes:--Class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';--Class A-2a notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Class A-2b notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Class A-4 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Certificates 'NR'.KEY RATING DRIVERSConsistent Collateral Pool: The collateral composition and credit quality of 2016-C are generally consistent with those of prior pools. The weighted average (WA) Fair Isaac Corp. (FICO) score is 774, and new vehicles total 91.0%. At 98.7%, this pool has the highest concentration of Nissan brand vehicles. The pool is geographically diverse.Extended-Term Loans: Loans with terms of more than 60 months total 55.7% of the pool, lower than 60.7% in 2016-B. For 2016-C, this includes 73-75-month original term loans that total 4.1%. This is the eighth NAROT pool to include 73-75-month loan terms.Sufficient Enhancement: 2016-C incorporates a sequential-pay structure and initial hard credit enhancement (CE) totals 4.25%, consistent with recent transactions. CE is sufficient to cover Fitch's 'AAAsf' stressed lifetime cumulative net loss (CNL) assumption.Stable Portfolio/Securitization Performance: NMAC portfolio and securitization delinquencies and losses are currently stable and were within historical levels through early 2016.Stable Origination, Underwriting and Servicing: NMAC demonstrates adequate abilities as originator, underwriter, and servicer to service 2016-C, as evidenced by its historical portfolio and securitization performance.Integrity of Legal Structure: The legal structure of a transaction should provide that a bankruptcy of NMAC would not impair the timeliness of payments on the securities.RATING SENSITIVITIESUnanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case. This in turn could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to all classes of 2016-C to increased losses over the life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the notes display some sensitivity to increased defaults and losses. Under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario the notes would be unlikely to experience any downgrade. However, the notes could experience downgrades of up to two rating categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10Fitch was provided with Form ABS Due Diligence-15E ("Form 15E") as prepared by Ernst & Young LLP. The third-party due diligence described in Form 15E focused on comparing or recalculating certain information with respect to 125 loans from the final data file. Fitch considered this information in its analysis and it did not have an effect on Fitch's analysis or conclusions.REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMSA description of the transaction's representations, warranties and enforcement mechanisms (RW&Es) that are disclosed in the offering document and which relate to the underlying asset pool is available by accessing the appendix referenced under "Related Research" below. The appendix also contains a comparison of these RW&Es to those Fitch considers typical for the asset class as detailed in the Special Report titled "Representations, Warranties and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global Structured Finance Transactions," dated May 31, 2016.Additional information is available at www.fitchratings.com.Applicable CriteriaCounterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered Bonds (pub. 18 Jul 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=884963Criteria for Interest Rate Stresses in Structured Finance Transactions and Covered Bonds (pub. 17 May 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=879815Criteria for Servicing Continuity Risk in Structured Finance (pub. 17 Dec 2015)https://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=875586Global Structured Finance Rating Criteria (pub. 27 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=883130Read MoreRating Criteria for U.S. Auto Loan ABS (pub. 21 Mar 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=878723Related ResearchNissan Auto Receivables 2016-C Owner Trust -- Appendixhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=885715Additional DisclosuresDodd-Frank Rating Information Disclosure Formhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/content/ridf_frame.cfm?pr_id=1010209Solicitation Statushttps://www.fitchratings.com/gws/en/disclosure/solicitation?pr_id=1010209Endorsement Policyhttps://www.fitchratings.com/jsp/creditdesk/PolicyRegulation.faces?context=2&detail=31ALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.

Agreement.

(ii) Power and Authority

deliver this Agreement and to carry out its terms; and the

A purchase and sale agreement is a document used in real estate transactions, when a seller property owner (''Seller'') sells a property to a company or individual (''Buyer''). This document outlines the terms and conditions of transaction. Information contained in the document includes the names of both parties, the address and description of the property the agreement concerns, and the purchase price. The closing details of the transaction are included in the document outlining where and when closing on the property shall occur. When purchasing a property, particularly with a cash payment, a real estate investor may provide earnest money as a deposit. This information will be present in the contract and will include details on the amount and how it shall be paid to the seller. If a loan is being used to purchase the property, details of the lender and the amount will be included in the document.There may be clauses regarding property taxes and disclosures of potential issues of the property.  If the seller agrees to perform certain repairs before transfer of ownership to the buyer, the repairs may be contained within the agreement. Some buyers may request fixtures or furnishings along with the sale of the property, and these will be listed within the document.  A purchase and sale agreement may also contain warranties, waiver of claims, and information about the title insurance policy.

Fitch to Rate Nissan Auto Receivables 2016-C Owner Trust; Issues PresaleHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreTry Yahoo Finance on Firefox »YahooSearchSearchSign inU.S. Markets open in 2 hrs 13 minsS&P Futures2,478.50+5.25 (+0.21%)Dow Futures21,679.00+33.00 (+0.15%)Nasdaq Futures5,979.50+31.50 (+0.53%)Fitch to Rate Nissan Auto Receivables 2016-C Owner Trust; Issues PresaleBusiness WireJuly 28, 2016ReblogShareTweetShareNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings expects to assign the following ratings and Rating Outlooks to the Nissan Auto Receivables 2016-C Owner Trust notes:--Class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';--Class A-2a notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Class A-2b notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Class A-4 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Certificates 'NR'.KEY RATING DRIVERSConsistent Collateral Pool: The collateral composition and credit quality of 2016-C are generally consistent with those of prior pools. The weighted average (WA) Fair Isaac Corp. (FICO) score is 774, and new vehicles total 91.3%. At 98.7%, this pool has the highest concentration of Nissan brand vehicles. The pool is geographically diverse.Extended-Term Loans: Loans with terms of more than 60 months total 55.7% of the pool, lower than the 60.7% in 2016-B. For 2016-C, this includes 73?75-month original term loans that total 4.1%. This is the eighth NAROT pool to include 73?75-month loan terms.Sufficient Enhancement: 2016-C incorporates a sequential-pay structure and initial hard credit enhancement (CE) totals 4.25%, consistent with recent transactions. CE is sufficient to cover Fitch's 'AAAsf' stressed lifetime cumulative net loss (CNL) assumption.Stable Portfolio/Securitization Performance: NMAC portfolio and securitization delinquencies and losses are currently stable and were within historical levels through early 2016.Stable Origination, Underwriting and Servicing: NMAC demonstrates adequate abilities as originator, underwriter, and servicer to service 2016-C, as evidenced by its historical portfolio and securitization performance.Integrity of Legal Structure: The legal structure of a transaction should provide that a bankruptcy of NMAC would not impair the timeliness of payments on the securities.RATING SENSITIVITIESUnanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case. This in turn could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to all classes of 2016-C to increased losses over the life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the notes display some sensitivity to increased defaults and losses. Under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario the notes would be unlikely to experience any downgrade. However, the notes could experience downgrades of up to two rating categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.DUE DILIGENCE USAGEFitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from Ernst & Young LLP.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
