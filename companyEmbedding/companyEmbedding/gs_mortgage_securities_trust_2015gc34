      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      Sept. 30, 2015. Fitch does not expect to rate the $39,238,739 class G.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 57 loans secured by 75 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $848.4 
      million as of the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by Citigroup Global Markets Realty Corp., Goldman Sachs Mortgage 
      Company, MC-Five Mile Commercial Mortgage Finance LLC, Starwood Mortgage 
      Funding I LLC, and Cantor Commercial Real Estate Lending, L.P.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 75.9% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 80.9%, and asset summary reviews on 100% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      High Fitch Leverage: The transaction has higher leverage than other 
      recent Fitch-rated transactions. The pool's Fitch debt service coverage 
      ratio (DSCR) of 1.09x is below both the year to date 2015 average of 
      1.20x and the 2014 average of 1.19x. The pool's Fitch loan to value 
      (LTV) of 112.3% is above both the year to date 2015 average of 109.1% 
      and the 2014 average of 106.2%.
    

      Above-Average Pool Concentration: The largest 10 loans account for 55.3% 
      of the pool by balance. This is greater than the year to date 2015 
      average of 48.5% and the 2014 average of 50.5%. The pool's above-average 
      concentration resulted in a loan concentration index (LCI) of 467, which 
      is greater than the year to date 2015 and 2014 averages of 352 and 387, 
      respectively.
    

      High Quality Collateral: Fitch performed site inspections for properties 
      that secured loans representing 75.9% of the total pool balance. Of the 
      properties that Fitch inspected, 39.2% of received a property quality 
      grade of 'B+' or better. Three properties (750 Lexington Avenue, 
      Parkside at So7 and LA Fitness Powell) comprising 23.3% of the inspected 
      pool were assigned a property quality grade of 'A-'. Only 10.6% of the 
      inspected pool was assigned property quality grades of 'B-' or 'C+', 
      indicating below average property quality.
    

      Minimal Additional Debt: One loan (1.4% of the pool) has nonpooled 
      subordinate debt held outside the trust. Furthermore, Hammons Hotel 
      Portfolio (8.5% of the pool) has a partial pledge of equity on a line of 
      credit. The Fitch stressed DSCR and LTV for the pool on the total debt 
      are 1.07x and 113.5%, respectively.
    

      Below-Average Amortization: The pool is scheduled to amortize by 11.9% 
      of the initial pool balance prior to maturity. This is slightly below 
      the averages of year to date 2015 and 2014 of 12.3% and 12%, 
      respectively. Three loans (8.5%) are full-term interest only and 30 
      loans (62.5%) are partial interest only, with the remaining 24 loans 
      (29%) being balloon loans.
    

      Pari Passu Loans: Five loans in the pool (34.1%) are part of a 
      split-loan, pari passu structure. The 750 Lexington Avenue (9.96% of the 
      pool) and DoubleTree Hotel (2.2% of the pool) loan combinations will be 
      serviced under the pooling and servicing agreement for this transaction. 
      The controlling note for Illinois Center (11.8% of the pool) and Hammons 
      Hotel Portfolio (8.5% of the pool) was contributed to the CGCMT 
      2015-GC33 transaction. The controlling note for the Hyatt Place Texas 
      Portfolio (1.6% of the pool) is expected to be contributed to the JPMBB 
      2015-C32 transaction.
    

      Loan Mortgage Coupons: The pool's weighted average coupon is 4.68%, 
      which is well below historical averages. Fitch accounted for increased 
      refinance risk in a higher interest rate environment by reviewing an 
      interest rate sensitivity that assumes an interest rate floor of 5% for 
      the term risk for most property types, 4.5% for multifamily properties, 
      and 6% for hotel properties, in conjunction with Fitch's stressed 
      refinance rate, which was 10.11% on a weighted-average basis.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 11.5% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a 
      full year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period). The following rating sensitivities describe how the 
      ratings would react to further NCF declines below Fitch's NCF. The 
      implied rating sensitivities are only indicative of some of the 
      potential outcomes and do not consider other risk factors to which the 
      transaction is exposed. Stressing additional risk factors may result in 
      different outcomes. Furthermore, the implied ratings, after the further 
      NCF stresses are applied, are more akin to what the ratings would be at 
      deal issuance had those further stressed NCFs been in place at that time.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to GSMS 
      2015-GC34 certificates and found that the transaction displays average 
      sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF 
      declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the senior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB+sf' could result. In a more severe 
      scenario, in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a 
      downgrade of the senior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB-sf' could result. 
      The presale report includes a detailed explanation of additional 
      stresses and sensitivities on pages 10 - 11.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from Ernst 
      & Young LLP. The third-party due diligence information was provided on 
      Form ABS Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and 
      re-computation of certain characteristics with respect to each of the 57 
      mortgage loans. Fitch considered this information in its analysis and 
      the findings did not have an impact on our analysis. A copy of the ABS 
      Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this 
      transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the bottom of 
      the related rating action commentary.

Fitch Affirms GSMS 2015-GC34 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms GSMS 2015-GC34
    





October 19, 2016 11:47 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed 15 classes of GS Mortgage Securities Trust 
      (GSMS) commercial mortgage pass-through certificates, series 2015-GC34. 
      A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this press 
      release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations are due to overall stable performance. The stable 
      performance reflects no material changes to pool metrics since issuance; 
      therefore, the original rating analysis was considered in affirming the 
      transaction. As of the October 2016 distribution date, the pool's 
      aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 0.5% to $844.6 million 
      from $848.4 million at issuance. Currently, there is one specially 
      serviced loan (8.5% of pool). No loans are defeased and all loans are 
      current. There is currently a $46,908 interest shortfall affecting class 
      G related to a special servicing fee and a small reimbursement for 
      advance interest. The Fitch debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and loan 
      to value (LTV) at issuance were 1.09x and 112.3%, respectively.
    

      Specially Serviced Loan: The third largest loan in the pool, Hammons 
      Hotel Portfolio (8.5% of the pool), transferred to special servicing in 
      July 2016 due to the borrower and its parent company filing for Chapter 
      11 bankruptcy in June 2016. The filing was made in connection with 
      litigation, which was ongoing at issuance, related to a complex deal 
      made in 2005 to reprivatize Hammons Hotels. The hotels and loan are 
      performing better than expected with year-end 2015 net operating income 
      (NOI) across the collateral properties 10.6% above bank underwriting. 
      The weighted average RevPAR penetration for the collateral properties 
      was 138.3% as of the June 2016 trailing 12 month (TTM) period. This loan 
      is a non-controlling pari passu loan with the remaining notes 
      securitized in CGCMT 2015-GC33, GSMS 2015-GS1, and CGCMT 2015-GC35.
    

      Stable Performance With No Material Changes: All loans in the pool are 
      current as of the October 2016 distribution with property level 
      performance generally in line with issuance expectations and no material 
      changes to pool metrics.
    

      It should be noted that, at issuance, 750 Lexington Avenue, the second 
      largest loan in the pool (10% of pool), was facing a large imminent 
      lease roll; Locke Lord, which occupied 31% of the net rentable area 
      (NRA; 22% if revenue), subsequently vacated the property at lease 
      expiration in June 2016. The loan includes a $7.75 million upfront 
      leasing reserve related to this space. Fitch will continue to monitor 
      the leasing status of the space.
    

      Above-Average Pool Concentration: The largest 10 loans account for 55.4% 
      of the pool by balance. This is greater than the year-to-date (YTD) 
      October 2015 average of 48.5% and the 2014 average of 50.5%. It was also 
      noted at issuance that the loan concentration index (LCI) was higher 
      than average for this transaction.
    

      High Quality Collateral: At issuance, Fitch performed site inspections 
      for properties that secured loans representing 75.9% of the total 
      original pool balance. Of the properties that Fitch inspected, 39.2% 
      received a property quality grade of 'B+' or better. Three properties 
      (750 Lexington Avenue, Parkside at So7 and LA Fitness Powell), 
      comprising 23.3% of the inspected pool, were assigned property quality 
      grades of 'A-'. Loans representing 10.6% of the inspected pool were 
      assigned property quality grades of 'B-' or 'C+', indicating 
      below-average property quality.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      The Rating Outlooks on all classes remain Stable. Fitch does not foresee 
      positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic or 
      asset-level event changes the transaction's overall portfolio-level 
      metrics.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.
    

      Fitch has affirmed the following classes:
    

      --$30,283,000 class A-1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$28,822,000 class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$185,000,000 class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$284,382,000 class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$65,382,000 class A-AB at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$634,167,000* class X-A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$48,782,000* class X-B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$40,298,000 class A-S at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$48,782,000 class B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$131,499,000 class PEZ at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$42,419,000 class C at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$51,964,000 class D at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$51,964,000* class X-D at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$23,331,000 class E at 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$8,483,000 class F at 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      *Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      Class A-S, B and C certificates may be exchanged for class PEZ 
      certificates, and class PEZ certificates may be exchanged for class A-S, 
      B, and C certificates. Fitch does not rate the $39,238,739 class G.

      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.
    

      For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia 
      Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 
      337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale 
      clients only. Credit ratings information published by Fitch is not 
      intended to be used by persons who are retail clients within the meaning 
      of the Corporations Act 2001.

      Trust (GSMS) 2015-GC34 Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, 
      Series 2015-GC34
    

      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as 
      follows:
    

      --$30,283,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$28,822,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;

      B, and C certificates.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      Sept. 30, 2015. Fitch does not expect to rate the $39,238,739 class G.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 57 loans secured by 75 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $848.4 
      million as of the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by Citigroup Global Markets Realty Corp., Goldman Sachs Mortgage 
      Company, MC-Five Mile Commercial Mortgage Finance LLC, Starwood Mortgage 
      Funding I LLC, and Cantor Commercial Real Estate Lending, L.P.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 75.9% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 80.9%, and asset summary reviews on 100% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      High Fitch Leverage: The transaction has higher leverage than other 
      recent Fitch-rated transactions. The pool's Fitch debt service coverage 
      ratio (DSCR) of 1.09x is below both the year to date 2015 average of 
      1.20x and the 2014 average of 1.19x. The pool's Fitch loan to value 
      (LTV) of 112.3% is above both the year to date 2015 average of 109.1% 
      and the 2014 average of 106.2%.
    

      Above-Average Pool Concentration: The largest 10 loans account for 55.3% 
      of the pool by balance. This is greater than the year to date 2015 
      average of 48.5% and the 2014 average of 50.5%. The pool's above-average 
      concentration resulted in a loan concentration index (LCI) of 467, which 
      is greater than the year to date 2015 and 2014 averages of 352 and 387, 
      respectively.
    

      High Quality Collateral: Fitch performed site inspections for properties 
      that secured loans representing 75.9% of the total pool balance. Of the 
      properties that Fitch inspected, 39.2% of received a property quality 
      grade of 'B+' or better. Three properties (750 Lexington Avenue, 
      Parkside at So7 and LA Fitness Powell) comprising 23.3% of the inspected 
      pool were assigned a property quality grade of 'A-'. Only 10.6% of the 
      inspected pool was assigned property quality grades of 'B-' or 'C+', 
      indicating below average property quality.
    

      Minimal Additional Debt: One loan (1.4% of the pool) has nonpooled 
      subordinate debt held outside the trust. Furthermore, Hammons Hotel 
      Portfolio (8.5% of the pool) has a partial pledge of equity on a line of 
      credit. The Fitch stressed DSCR and LTV for the pool on the total debt 
      are 1.07x and 113.5%, respectively.
    

      Below-Average Amortization: The pool is scheduled to amortize by 11.9% 
      of the initial pool balance prior to maturity. This is slightly below 
      the averages of year to date 2015 and 2014 of 12.3% and 12%, 
      respectively. Three loans (8.5%) are full-term interest only and 30 
      loans (62.5%) are partial interest only, with the remaining 24 loans 
      (29%) being balloon loans.
    

      Pari Passu Loans: Five loans in the pool (34.1%) are part of a 
      split-loan, pari passu structure. The 750 Lexington Avenue (9.96% of the 
      pool) and DoubleTree Hotel (2.2% of the pool) loan combinations will be 
      serviced under the pooling and servicing agreement for this transaction. 
      The controlling note for Illinois Center (11.8% of the pool) and Hammons 
      Hotel Portfolio (8.5% of the pool) was contributed to the CGCMT 
      2015-GC33 transaction. The controlling note for the Hyatt Place Texas 
      Portfolio (1.6% of the pool) is expected to be contributed to the JPMBB 
      2015-C32 transaction.
    

      Loan Mortgage Coupons: The pool's weighted average coupon is 4.68%, 
      which is well below historical averages. Fitch accounted for increased 
      refinance risk in a higher interest rate environment by reviewing an 
      interest rate sensitivity that assumes an interest rate floor of 5% for 
      the term risk for most property types, 4.5% for multifamily properties, 
      and 6% for hotel properties, in conjunction with Fitch's stressed 
      refinance rate, which was 10.11% on a weighted-average basis.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 11.5% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a 
      full year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period). The following rating sensitivities describe how the 
      ratings would react to further NCF declines below Fitch's NCF. The 
      implied rating sensitivities are only indicative of some of the 
      potential outcomes and do not consider other risk factors to which the 
      transaction is exposed. Stressing additional risk factors may result in 
      different outcomes. Furthermore, the implied ratings, after the further 
      NCF stresses are applied, are more akin to what the ratings would be at 
      deal issuance had those further stressed NCFs been in place at that time.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to GSMS 
      2015-GC34 certificates and found that the transaction displays average 
      sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF 
      declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the senior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB+sf' could result. In a more severe 
      scenario, in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a 
      downgrade of the senior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB-sf' could result. 
      The presale report includes a detailed explanation of additional 
      stresses and sensitivities on pages 10 - 11.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from Ernst 
      & Young LLP. The third-party due diligence information was provided on 
      Form ABS Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and 
      re-computation of certain characteristics with respect to each of the 57 
      mortgage loans. Fitch considered this information in its analysis and 
      the findings did not have an impact on our analysis. A copy of the ABS 
      Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this 
      transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the bottom of 
      the related rating action commentary.

Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Challenging Retail Environment Weights on REITsMixed economic news is weighing on retail markets, pushing REIT performance down in 2015.

This news came on the heels of a report from the Commerce Department stating that retail sales declined 0.3%... 
US REITs Feeling Effects from Turmoil in Greece and ChinaInternational economic forces have taken center stage this week, affecting both US stock markets and REITs.

What Does Increased Construction Mean for Apartment REITs?REITs so far this year have raised $17.1 billion of capital through the sale of unsecured notes, bringing the total raised over the past two and a half years to just more than $75 billion.

A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this press release.KEY RATING DRIVERSThe affirmations are due to overall stable performance. The stable performance reflects no material changes to pool metrics since issuance; therefore, the original rating analysis was considered in affirming the transaction. As of the October 2016 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 0.5% to $844.6 million from $848.4 million at issuance. Currently, there is one specially serviced loan (8.5% of pool). No loans are defeased and all loans are current. There is currently a $46,908 interest shortfall affecting class G related to a special servicing fee and a small reimbursement for advance interest. The Fitch debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and loan to value (LTV) at issuance were 1.09x and 112.3%, respectively.Specially Serviced Loan: The third largest loan in the pool, Hammons Hotel Portfolio (8.5% of the pool), transferred to special servicing in July 2016 due to the borrower and its parent company filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in June 2016. The filing was made in connection with litigation, which was ongoing at issuance, related to a complex deal made in 2005 to reprivatize Hammons Hotels. The hotels and loan are performing better than expected with year-end 2015 net operating income (NOI) across the collateral properties 10.6% above bank underwriting. The weighted average RevPAR penetration for the collateral properties was 138.3% as of the June 2016 trailing 12 month (TTM) period. This loan is a non-controlling pari passu loan with the remaining notes securitized in CGCMT 2015-GC33, GSMS 2015-GS1, and CGCMT 2015-GC35.Stable Performance With No Material Changes: All loans in the pool are current as of the October 2016 distribution with property level performance generally in line with issuance expectations and no material changes to pool metrics.It should be noted that, at issuance, 750 Lexington Avenue, the second largest loan in the pool (10% of pool), was facing a large imminent lease roll; Locke Lord, which occupied 31% of the net rentable area (NRA; 22% if revenue), subsequently vacated the property at lease expiration in June 2016. The loan includes a $7.75 million upfront leasing reserve related to this space. Fitch will continue to monitor the leasing status of the space.Above-Average Pool Concentration: The largest 10 loans account for 55.4% of the pool by balance. This is greater than the year-to-date (YTD) October 2015 average of 48.5% and the 2014 average of 50.5%. It was also noted at issuance that the loan concentration index (LCI) was higher than average for this transaction.High Quality Collateral: At issuance, Fitch performed site inspections for properties that secured loans representing 75.9% of the total original pool balance. Of the properties that Fitch inspected, 39.2% received a property quality grade of 'B+' or better. Three properties (750 Lexington Avenue, Parkside at So7 and LA Fitness Powell), comprising 23.3% of the inspected pool, were assigned property quality grades of 'A-'. Loans representing 10.6% of the inspected pool were assigned property quality grades of 'B-' or 'C+', indicating below-average property quality.RATING SENSITIVITIESThe Rating Outlooks on all classes remain Stable. Fitch does not foresee positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic or asset-level event changes the transaction's overall portfolio-level metrics.USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to this rating action.Fitch has affirmed the following classes:--$30,283,000 class A-1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$28,822,000 class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$185,000,000 class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$284,382,000 class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$65,382,000 class A-AB at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$634,167,000* class X-A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$48,782,000* class X-B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$40,298,000 class A-S at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;Read More--$48,782,000 class B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$131,499,000 class PEZ at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$42,419,000 class C at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$51,964,000 class D at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$51,964,000* class X-D at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$23,331,000 class E at 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$8,483,000 class F at 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable.*Notional amount and interest-only.Class A-S, B and C certificates may be exchanged for class PEZ certificates, and class PEZ certificates may be exchanged for class A-S, B, and C certificates.

Telephone: 1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale clients only.
