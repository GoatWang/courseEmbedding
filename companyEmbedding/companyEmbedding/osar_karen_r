Karen R. Osar to Succeed Crompton CFO upon Retirement



Published on 2004-05-04. Author :
SpecialChem












 MIDDLEBURY, Conn. -- Crompton Corporation (NYSE: CK)
announced that Peter Barna, senior vice president and chief financial
officer, who has been with the company for 30 years, has elected to retire
following completion of Crompton's current refinancing effort and that
Karen R. Osar will succeed him. Crompton also announced that Gregory E.
McDaniel has been named senior vice president of Strategy & New Business
Development.
 Karen R. Osar, 54, who joined Crompton today, most recently served as
senior vice president and chief financial officer of Meadwestvaco Corporation,
where she was instrumental in the execution of the $8 billion merger of
Mead Corporation and Westvaco and in implementing new financial control
procedures required to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
 Before the merger, Osar served as senior vice president and chief financial
officer of Westvaco Corporation, a $4-billion packaging, paper and specialty
chemicals company, where she directed acquisitions resulting in the creation
of a $1-billion global market-leading consumer packaging business and
the addition of a complementary plastics-based packaging product platform.
 Osar's 29 years of experience in financial management also include serving
as vice president and treasurer of $12 billion Tenneco Inc., where she
led financing for the successful sale or spin offs of several new public
companies. Osar spent the first 19 years of her career at J.P. Morgan
and Company, serving most recently as managing director, Investment Banking
Group.
 Osar earned a B.A. in Latin American studies from Smith College and an
M.B.A. in finance from Columbia University. She is a director of Allergan
Inc., BNY Hamilton Funds and Encore Medical Corporation.
 Crompton also announced that Gregory E. McDaniel, 52, has been appointed
senior vice president of Strategy & New Business Development, effective
immediately. McDaniel replaces interim Strategy & Development Senior
Vice President Al Ingulli, who heads Crompton's Crop Protection business.
 McDaniel comes to Crompton after holding various management positions
over the past 28 years with The Dow Chemical Company. He most recently
served as vice president and director of new business development and
mergers and acquisitions within Dow's Polyurethane and Thermosets Group,
aligning new business growth with the overall portfolio strategy. He also
was chairman of Dow Bio-Products Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Dow
Canada.
 Prior to his most-recent position at Dow, McDaniel led several of Dow's
global agricultural joint ventures. He also served as global business
and marketing manager of Phenoxy Herbicides. In addition, McDaniel held
other high-level marketing, sales and communications positions.
 McDaniel has a B.A. in liberal arts from Hampton University, and attended
the Babson School of Executive Education in Wellesley, Mass.
 "We are fortunate to be gaining exceptional talent to fill these
key positions at a time when we are losing a Crompton veteran. We are
grateful for Pete Barna's many contributions during his decades of service
and are appreciative of his willingness to assist in an orderly transition
before he departs for what we hope will be a long and healthy retirement,"
said Robert L. Wood, president, chairman and chief executive officer.
 "We are excited to have a financial executive of Karen Osar's caliber
joining Crompton. Her broad-ranging experience includes service as CFO
of a public company as well as work in investment banking, treasury, audit
and mergers and acquisitions. She is a strategic leader who will serve
as an excellent liaison to our important financial constituents, including
shareholders, bankers and analysts.
 "I've worked closely with Greg for several years and have found
him to be an exceptional strategist with excellent business modeling and
cost optimization skills. His chemical industry experience will be very
valuable as we refine our portfolio and focus on the continued creation
of differentiated products to serve customer needs.
 "I am confident that Karen and Greg will play important roles in
our drive to reshape Crompton and deliver the improved shareholder value
that we all seek," Wood concluded.
 Crompton Corporation, with annual sales of $2.2 billion, is a producer
and marketer of specialty chemicals and polymer products and equipment.
