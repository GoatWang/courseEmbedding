SandRidge Mississippian Trust I - PV-10 Update Reveals 'Pig In A Poke' - SandRidge Mississippian Trust I (NYSE:SDT) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»SandRidge Mississippian Trust I - PV-10 Update Reveals 'Pig In A Poke'Mar.17.14 | About: SandRidge Mississippian (SDT) Daniel R Moore Portfolio strategy, bonds, oil & gas, long-term horizonFinancialRelativity.comSummarySDT PV-10 Report published on 3/14/2013 shows a major 3032 MBOE reduction (22.3% year-to-year) due to well performance.Since IPO, the Trust has reported a 25.7% reduction in reserves due to well performance.Combined product mix changes due to lower oil production and continued well performance risk make these units unattractively overpriced at price levels above the $6.23 PV-10.For the second year in a row, a major downward reserve adjustment was recorded at the SandRidge Mississippian Trust I (NYSE:SDT). On March 14, 2014, the Trust published its 10-K report, which contained an updated standardized measure of proven reserves (PV-10). The updated report showed continued deterioration in reserves due to poor well performance. As shown in the table below, the total reported net reduction in proven reserves since the IPO of the Trust in April of 2011 is 4,874 MBOE, a loss of 25.7% of the estimated reserve level presented by SandRidge Energy (NYSE:SD) to potential unitholders when capital was being raised to fund the Trust.

But the loss of reserves is not the only issue plaguing the Trust. Performance is also hindered by the change in the mix of resources being recovered or expected to be recovered in the future. Initially, the Trust was portrayed as having an oil/gas mix of 48/52. Through time, the PV-10 report has been adjusted to reflect the reality that the Trust will deliver far less oil than expected, instead delivering a higher concentration of far less valuable natural gas. Additionally, the initial reserve reports (IPO and 2011) showed no indication of NGL in the production, thus making the 2012 report downward adjustments very steep, as the mix change was introduced to investors along with well performance reductions. As of 12/31/2013, the reported reserve mix expected for the remaining life of the Trust is 22/20/58, oil/NGL/Natural Gas.

The PV-10 standardized measure per unit as of 12/31/2013 fell to $6.23. On March 14, 2014, the Trust units were trading at a value of $7.64 on the NYSE, 1.22 times the PV-10. The price level of the units traded down sharply throughout 2013 and early 2014 as market participants adjusted expectations to the reality that the Trust was far less valuable than portrayed in its initial SEC filings. The remainder of this report will focus on the current reported performance of the Trust to provide information about whether the current traded unit value is reasonable investment, or remains a "pig in a poke".
Quarterly Distribution Downward Trend in 2013 Signaled PV-10 Adjustment
The recently reported quarterly results by SandRidge Mississippian Trust I showed a continuation of deteriorating production volume and poor earnings performance. On January 30th, SDT announced its quarterly distribution for production during the time period of September through November 2013. During the fall, the energy market showed relatively high oil prices throughout, but weaker natural gas as oversupply in the market continued. NGL prices began to improve during the period. Major improvements in natural gas and NGL prices are expected to be exhibited in the results that will be announced in the winter quarter (May distribution).
In the context of a generally healthy energy market, SDT's common unit distribution of $0.50 was 34.2% below target. Overall, earnings on a fully dilutive basis, for the 4th quarter in a row, could not cover the subordination threshold for the Trust, leaving the common units with a lower than threshold distribution. Subordinated unitholders continued to receive no distribution at all.


As the above graph shows, SDT's distribution level showed a steep decline in the recent quarter. The severity of the decline is particularly troubling because the common unitholders continue to be protected by a subordination threshold that will expire after the next distribution.
The Trust press release references lower sales volumes as the cause for the miss. This statement is made relative to the Trust IPO prospectus, which projected a higher overall MBOE production volume in both crude oil and natural gas than was eventually discovered. SDT is on a course for constant (30%)+ below-target results near-term, and even worse intermediate-term performance relative to its IPO distribution target levels, as the subordination period expires in 2014.
SDT Earnings Performance Analysis
In the press release announcing the latest Trust results, management pointed to "lower oil sales volume" than the estimate in the IPO prospectus as the reason that the distribution target was missed. The PV-10 released on 3/14/2014 in the Trust 10-K showed a continued decrease in MBOE proven reserves of -21.3% (year-over-year) during 2013 due to well performance. The degradation in results was exacerbated by a shift in product mix from 25% oil to 22% oil expected in the future. The quickening pace of loss of oil production is to some extent a by-product of horizontal drilling. The output of shale wells drops faster too, falling by 60 to 70 percent in the first year alone, according to Austin, Texas-based Drillinginfo Inc. Traditional wells take two years to fall by about 55 percent, before flattening out. SDT has no more wells which are being drilled; therefore, oil production loss can be expected to remain particularly acute in the coming quarters.
During the last quarter, production volume was 244 MBOE, 17.5% lower than production in the June-August quarter (the latest quarter distribution reflects September-November production). The production level was down 41.8% compared to the same production quarter in 2012. The drop in production can be linked to the completion of the drilling obligation (May production quarter/August distribution, as shown in the graph below) to the Trust by the operating general partner, SandRidge. A large number of the wells drilled by the operator for the Trust appear to have resulted in initial high-pressure output, which subsequently declined rapidly, resulting in poor well performance.


In addition to poor well performance, the degradation in earnings performance is also directly linked to the decreasing percentage of liquids (crude, NGL) in Trust production.
Drilling Progress
Drilling was completed by SandRidge in the spring of 2013. The work was completed at an accelerated pace, well ahead of the schedule set at the IPO.

Based on the date that drilling was completed, the subordination period will end beginning with the August distribution in 2014. Investors need to be aware of this date, particularly since the Trust is not earning enough currently to fully cover the subordination threshold. Based on the current earnings trend, even if natural gas and NGL prices improve, common unitholders will see a substantial drop in distribution level in the August distribution.
Production Mix Analysis
The PV-10 published in the most recent SDT 10-K made a major adjustment in the Trust production mix. As shown in the graph below, the oil & gas mix was split into component oil/NGL/gas parts. During 2013, the percentage of oil expected in the future results was lowered from 23.3% of production to 22.1%. Additionally, the NGL portion of the mix was raised 4.9% to 19.9%, while natural gas was lowered 3.6% to 58.1%. The expected loss of oil production in the PV-10 report had the highest impact on the overall PV-10 value change.


In the graph above, the natural gas and oil percentage mix over the last year is plotted to see if the trend line is actually matching the PV-10 expectation. The trend line is not a positive sign for investors. The result in the previous two quarters was (34% oil/66% gas). The odd part about the reported results is that only 3.8% of total production in the latest September to November 2013 results was NGL, far lower than the published PV-10. This means that it can be expected that oil production will fall very sharply in the near future, displaced by a pickup in NGL production.
Market & Realized Trust Pricing Trends
In the graph below, you can see the actual market prices for oil, gas and NGL during the past year and the last production period. Pricing in the overall market was strong for oil production; however, the price of natural gas was in line with price levels experienced in the fall of last year. The one bit of good news for Trust unitholders is that when the futures price curve for natural gas is reviewed, the current expectations are for a breakout above $4 natural gas through the next several years. Additionally, in the upcoming distribution quarter, which will be based on production volume in the winter months, both NGL and natural gas prices showed sustained high levels, which should be favorable for results.

The weighted average realized price for Trust production during the fall of 2013 was $45.15 per BOE. This is a (0.8%) decrease over the $45.55 per BOE realized in the prior quarter. Year-over-year, the realized price level declined (0.0%).


The minor declines in realized price levels at the Trust can be attributed primarily to lower natural gas prices being off-set by improving realized prices on NGL production, as the differential tightened during the quarter.
Effect of Trust Derivative Contracts
The Trust has oil hedges in place for substantially all of its oil production at $101-$102 through December of 2015. It also carries hedges on approximately 20% of its natural gas volume.

The realized price levels for the latest quarter (oil $95.21, gas $3.38) contain the benefit from the hedges, adjusted for the differentials for delivery of production. The Trust forecasts a differential of approximately $5.00 in the oil price realized and the oil hedge price due to delivery basis risk. The Trust oil production is estimated to be 78% WTI and 28% WTS, and the spread between the two products in the latest quarter was not substantial and should not have affected the realized price above normal expectations. The $95.21 realized price level shows a return to more typical market conditions for product delivery. The improvement in the realized price level for oil production reflects the improving price levels for NGL production.
The natural gas collar contract was supportive to the realized gas price during the latest quarter, although a substantial amount of the production volume is not hedged. If natural gas prices continue to go higher, the realized price level at the Trust will improve. Currently, a $.50 move up in gas prices is giving a 1% move up in realized average BOE price levels.
The Trust has no hedge contracts in place beyond December 2015. Presently, the forward price curve for oil in the 1st production quarter of 2016 shows an average price per barrel of $82.12, and $4.34 per mcf of natural gas. The forward expectations for production sales price levels in the years beyond the current hedged production at the Trust show risk in the oil price curve, and generally high probability natural gas prices will rise above $4 per mcf. (These prices do not reflect the Trust-specific negative differential for underlying product delivery). As hedge expiration gets closer, this risk will need to be continually monitored to adjust expectations.

PV-10 Updated
In the Trust 10-K published in on March 14, 2014, the 2013 year-end PV-10 was supplied, which showed a per share value of $6.23. This value reflects the expected cash flows from the remaining proven reserves held by the Trust, discounted at 10%. The PV-10 calculation uses constant price level assumptions for the life of the proven reserves, as shown in the table below.

The table below reflects the yearly erosion of the PV-10 due to depletion, change in price levels used in the computation and the reduction in reserves due to on-going well performance issues. Since April 2011, 4118 MBOE of the 8992 reduction in MBOE since the Trust IPO, or 45.8%, can be attributed to actual production, while the remaining 54.2% is due to well performance and production mix adjustments. In total, Trust production depletion accounts for 21.7% of the proven reserve decline since IPO, while well performance-related reductions account for a 25.7% reduction relative to the IPO estimate.

Overall, price changes in the PV-10 were more favorable than in 2012 for oil and natural gas, while NGL prices were lower. The 2013 PV-10 report utilized a delivered price level of $3.10 per MBOE for natural gas production, which was an improvement from the $2.26 used in the calculation in 2012. NGL pricing of $30.69 used in the PV-10 was virtually the same in 2013 as 2012. Expectations are that NGL price levels will likely recover to the historical 50% of crude price levels through time, particularly once NGL exports begin to increase.

Trust Fair Value Estimation
The PV-10 is a static price level valuation model of proven reserves. To incorporate the value of potential changes in price levels going forward, as well as the value of the derivative contracts and the subordination threshold protection for common unitholders, it is necessary to use a discounted cash flow valuation model. The information contained below in this article is based on the valuation model I utilize to evaluate the fair market value of SDT.
The table below summarizes the information used in the model to derive a go forward distribution forecast when combined with the expected depletion of remaining proven reserves held by the Trust.

The product price assumptions in the model use levels derived from the current forward price curve for oil and gas, combined with the Trust hedge contracts in place through the end of 2015. The price forecast for WTI Crude Oil for NYMEX delivery is shown in the graph below. The out year price levels beyond the 1st quarter of 2016 are grown at a rate of 2.5% annually up to a cap level, which in this model are not reached before Trust termination for Natural Gas, and are reached in the last distribution period for oil. NGL prices are assumed to be 50% of the traded price of oil, and the percentage mix of NGL in production is raised to the PV-10 expected level of 19.9%. All prices are adjusted for delivery based on the average differential which is typically realized by the Trust.


The model uses the production mix forecasted in the 12/31/2013 PV-10 of 22.0% oil, 19.9% NGL and 58.1% Natural Gas.
When the price and mix assumptions are combined with the current proven reserves remaining at the Trust and the expected production curve, the distributions a unitholder can expect through the end of life of the Trust can be forecast as shown in the graph below.

Through the February 2014 distribution, the Trust showed depletion of 30.4% of its proven reserves. Total remaining proven reserves are estimated at 9,966 MBOE as of the start of the winter production period.
Based on this model, at the current price level of $7.64 on 3/14/2014, the implied rate of return on the Trust, if bought and held to termination, is 9.20%.

If you expect a 10% return, a fair price level for an SDT common unit is $7.34.
Because of the poor track record of the Trust and the elevated tail risk for a continued decline in reserves due to well performance that horizontally drilled wells are systemically exhibiting in the industry, my fair market estimate at this time is $6 per unit, which implies a 15% rate of return, more consistent with the risk profile for this type of investment. In general, my opinion is that buying this asset at any price above the current PV-10 continues to be a "pig in a poke".

SandRidge Mississippian Trust I Announces Quarterly Distribution






                    	July 27, 2017 04:15 PM Eastern Daylight Time 
                    	



AUSTIN, Texas--(EON: Enhanced Online News)--SANDRIDGE MISSISSIPPIAN TRUST I (NYSE: SDT) today announced a quarterly 
      distribution for the three-month period ended June 30, 2017 (which 
      primarily relates to production attributable to the Trust’s interests 
      from March 1, 2017 to May 31, 2017) of approximately $1.3 million, or 
      $0.0482 per unit. The Trust makes distributions on a quarterly basis on 
      or about the 60th day following the completion of each quarter. The 
      distribution is expected to occur on or before August 25, 2017 to 
      holders of record as of the close of business on August 11, 2017.
    

      During the three-month production period ended May 31, 2017, combined 
      sales volumes were slightly lower than the previous period and oil, 
      natural gas and natural gas liquids (“NGL”) prices decreased. As no 
      additional development wells will be drilled, the Trust’s production is 
      expected to decline each quarter during the remainder of its life.
    

      The Trust owns royalty interests in oil and natural gas properties in 
      the Mississippian formation in Alfalfa, Garfield, Grant and Woods 
      counties in Oklahoma and is entitled to receive proceeds from the sale 
      of production attributable to the royalty interests. As described in the 
      Trust’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), 
      the amount of the quarterly distributions is expected to fluctuate from 
      quarter to quarter, depending on the proceeds received by the Trust as a 
      result of actual production volumes, oil and natural gas prices and the 
      amount and timing of the Trust’s administrative expenses, among other 
      factors. All Trust unitholders share distributions on a pro rata basis.
    

      Volumes, price and distributable income available to unitholders for the 
      period were (dollars in thousands, except per unit):

      Pursuant to IRC Section 1446, withholding tax on income effectively 
      connected to a United States trade or business allocated to foreign 
      partners should be made at the highest marginal rate. Under Section 
      1441, withholding tax on fixed, determinable, annual, periodic income 
      from United States sources allocated to foreign partners should be made 
      at 30% of gross income unless the rate is reduced by treaty. This is 
      intended to be a qualified notice by SandRidge Mississippian Trust I to 
      nominees and brokers as provided for under Treasury Regulation Section 
      1.1446-4(b), and while specific relief is not specified for Section 1441 
      income, this disclosure is intended to suffice. Nominees and brokers 
      should withhold at the highest marginal rate, currently 39.6% for 
      individuals, on the distribution made to foreign partners.
    

      This press release contains statements that are “forward-looking 
      statements” within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange 
      Act of 1934, as amended. All statements contained in this press release, 
      other than statements of historical facts, are “forward-looking 
      statements” for purposes of these provisions. These forward-looking 
      statements include the amount and date of any anticipated distribution 
      to unit holders. The anticipated distribution is based, in part, on the 
      amount of cash received or expected to be received by the Trust from 
      SandRidge Energy, Inc. (“SandRidge”) with respect to the relevant 
      period. Any differences in actual cash receipts by the Trust could 
      affect this distributable amount. The amount of such cash received or 
      expected to be received by the Trust (and its ability to pay 
      distributions) has been and will be significantly and negatively 
      impacted by prevailing low commodity prices, which could remain low for 
      an extended period of time or decline further. Other important factors 
      that could cause actual results to differ materially include expenses of 
      the Trust and reserves for anticipated future expenses. Statements made 
      in this press release are qualified by the cautionary statements made in 
      this press release. Neither SandRidge nor the Trustee intends, and 
      neither assumes any obligation, to update any of the statements included 
      in this press release. An investment in Common Units issued by SandRidge 
      Mississippian Trust I is subject to the risks described in the Trust’s 
      Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and all 
      of its other filings with the SEC. The Trust’s annual, quarterly and 
      other filed reports are or will be available over the Internet at the 
      SEC’s web site at http://www.sec.gov.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Real-time prices are provided by Bats Exchange on individual U.S. equities quote pages. During market hours, the real-time Bats price displays and new trade updates are updated on the page (as indicated by a "flash"). Volume always reflects consolidated markets. If the symbol has pre-market or post-market trades, that information will also be reflected along with the last (closing) price from the symbol's exchange. Real-time prices are available during market hours (9:30 AM to 4:00 PM EST).  Note: The Bats Exchange currently accounts for approximately 11-12% of all U.S. equity trading each day. As a result, the real-time prices displayed may have minor discrepancies when comparing the information with other sites offering real-time data, or with brokerage firms. If you require comprehensive real-time bids/asks/quotes, we offer a no-risk trial to one of our real-time products. Summary Quoteboard The Summary Quoteboard displays snapshot quote data. When available, Bid and Ask information from the Bats exchange is updated as new data is received. Volume is also updated but is the delayed consolidated Volume from the symbol's exchange. Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.  Chart Snapshot A thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company. Price Performance This section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Related Stocks For comparison purposes, find information on other symbols contained in the same sector.Most Recent Stories View the latest top stories from the Associated Press or Canadian Press (based on your Market selection).
