IMPORTANT NOTICE:

Real estate investments involve risk. Economic and market forces and unforeseen costs may adversely affect the ability of an investor to recoup its initial investment. Consequently, only an investor that can afford to lose its entire investment should consider the investments offered by SKB.

Other risks associated with an investment in real estate include limited transferability of membership interests, illiquidity, uncertainties relating to the financial analysis, risk of members' capital, risk of leverage, financing risks, income/operating risks, environmental risks, reliance on third party management companies, absence of regulatory oversight, construction risks, capital expenditures which are not offset by cash flow, constructions risks, lack of fund operating history, cash flow, potential conflicts of interest, overbuilding of properties in competitive locations, uninsured and under insured losses, tax liability not limited to distributions, changes in tax laws, uncertain ability to meet capital needs.
This is not an offer to sell or a solicitation to buy. The Private Placement Memorandum for each investment opportunity contains more complete information, including a full explanation of all the risks associated with investing. Please read it carefully before investing.

Marietta is located in Cobb County and as one of Georgia's largest suburbs, has over 60,000 residents. Ty Pennington, of the popular show Extreme Home Makeover grew up in this thriving town. Located just 20 miles from the city of Atlanta and convenient to major interstates, Marietta is a great suburb to call home. 
Notable points of interest in the area include the Gone with the Wind museum and the Kennesaw House, one of two buildings not burned in Sherman's March to the Sea. Both are symbols of the area's rich past and exhibit a commitment to preserving important Georgia history. The Big Chicken in Marietta is one of the Atlanta area's most popular landmarks. Formerly a local eatery, the 56 feet tall metal structure built in 1963 has since been adopted by a local Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise. Dobbins Air Reserve Base is also located here. 
Marietta has lots of shopping options for its residents to enjoy. Nearby malls and shopping centers are ample with hundreds of popular retailers. Town Center Mall and Cumberland Mall are just a short drive away as well as other nearby shopping establishments. 
Students will attend Marietta City Schools as well as schools in the Cobb County Schools District. Within city limits are Marietta High School, Marietta Middle School, and several elementary schools. The schools in the district have received several awards and accolades, including being recognized as Georgia Schools of Excellence. Several private schools are convenient to the area and notable colleges and universities are nearby. Southern Polytechnic State University is a four-year college based in Marietta and is noted as one of the first colleges in the nation to offer the bachelor of Engineering Technology degree. 
Marietta has a vast array of homes to choose from. Whether you're interested in an all brick ranch near great schools or a magnificent gated French country estate on acreage, you'll find it in this expansive suburb.  The area boasts numerous high dollar homes, however families will find more modest buys in the low $100s as well.
