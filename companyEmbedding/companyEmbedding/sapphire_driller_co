SUMMARYBULLSBEARSTOPICSDATA CENTRALSTOCK CHARTSEC FILINGSBALANCEINCOMECASH FLOWVTG » Topics » Sapphire DrillerThis excerpt taken from the VTG 8-K filed Dec 8, 2009.Sapphire Driller  The Sapphire Driller is currently subject to two separate drilling
contracts with Foxtrot International and one drilling contract with VAALCO Energy, Inc. (VAALCO). The first of the Foxtrot International contracts has a term of four months, with operations commencing in August 2009. Under the terms of
the first contract, we are entitled to a fee of $5.0 million upon mobilization of the rig to West Africa, and an operating dayrate of $100,000. The second of these contracts has a term of six months, with operations expected to commence in 2011.
Under the terms of the second contract with Foxtrot International, we are entitled to a cost reimbursement of up to a maximum of $2.0 million upon mobilization of the rig to West Africa, and an operating dayrate of $132,500. In the event that we are
able to secure a towing contract on better terms, the mobilization reimbursement will be adjusted according to the terms of the contract. Both of the contracts contain provisions allowing Foxtrot International to unilaterally terminate the contract
if, among other things, any of the following occur: (i) the Sapphire Driller is not ready to commence operations on schedule; (ii) occurrence of an extended work stoppage; (iii) the Sapphire Driller is damaged and not
replaced; (iv) we file a petition for bankruptcy or reorganization or (v) we materially breach our obligations under the contract. Foxtrot International also has the right to terminate at any time for convenience, subject to payment of a
termination fee based on the remaining term of the contract to us. Further, both contracts contain provisions allowing either party to terminate its obligations if there is an occurrence of a force majeure event.  The VAALCO contract has a term of five months, with operations expected to commence in the first quarter of 2010 in the waters offshore of Gabon, West
Africa. This contract will remain in effect until the Sapphire Driller has drilled and completed four wells. Additionally, if VAALCO provides us with notice, at least three months prior to the anticipated termination date of this contract,
then they have the right to extend the contract for two additional wells. Further, upon providing us with thirty days notice, VAALCO has the right to terminate this contract in the event the duration of the contract has exceeded five months, even if
the four required wells have not yet been drilled. Under the terms of this contract, we are entitled to an operating dayrate of $115,500 per day and a moving rate of $113,190 per day. There is no mobilization fee associated with this contract. The
contract shall terminate upon the occurrence of, among other things, the following events: (i) completion of the Sapphire Drillers operational requirements under the contract, (ii) the total loss of the Sapphire
Driller, (iii) a force majeure event that causes the suspension of operations for fourteen days under the contract and (iv) a default by us under our obligations set forth in the contract, and after being given thirty days to cure any
such default, VAALCO chooses to terminate the contract.

Vantage secures work for Sapphire Driller








01/13/2011





































Offshore staff HOUSTON -- Vantage Drilling Co. has entered into a letter of intent for the Sapphire Driller to conduct a three-well program offshore West Africa, with an option for a fourth well. Work on the four-month contract will start as soon as the rig can mobilize to the new location. Vantage estimates revenues from the initial term of the contract at $15.2 million. The company has signed a contract amendment with a client in Côte d'Ivoire which would allow reinstatement of the existing contract for the Sapphire Driller once political conditions in the country improve. The option must be exercised before April 15. 01/13/2011
