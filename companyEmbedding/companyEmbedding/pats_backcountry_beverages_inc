 Real 2 days shipping, no difficult payment, easy communication
 "After having a bad experience with another online shop, and finally cancelled my order, I went to this online shop. I read some bad reviews, so I was a bit sceptical. I needed my order to be delivered fast, since I was only visiting USA. But I was still interested in their "Free 2-Day Shipping on Orders Over $50“, plus they were also having 20% off, so I ordered it, and I'm really satisfied. And no difficulty with the online payment at all!I used the life chat function on their website, it was useful. I double checked their "2 days shipping", and also the availability of the item I'd like to order. And yeah, it arrived in 2 days!!! I think I'll buy from them again next time."

 Quick and easy!
 "I ordered by phone.  The representative I spoke to was very pleasant and courteous.  I ordered two Alps Mountaineering King Kong chairs at a good price.  The chairs were shipped out on the same day and arrived here in two days.  I will do business with them again."

 Fantastic personalized customer service
 "I must be either the luckiest shopper or just caught them on the up-and-up, because if you read most of these reviews you wouldn't have expected the level of customer service I've received from them on recent orders.  Orders came in a timely manner, securely packed and with a free gift of sustainably harvested trail mix snacks or something like that!  (super cute and very unnecessary, but appreciated)  I had a follow up email from a "customer account manager" which I guess is the new norm.  I believe maybe this change in direction probably is a direct response to the kind of reviews I see here on RR.  The only other time I've purchased from them is about a year ago, and ended up having to cancel and return the order due to my boss changing his mind.  I don't recall it being much hassle nor having to pay the return cost as they provided me an RMA number.  Though, I did feel bad about refunding the $1.00 donation I made to The Nature Conservacy, lol.  Overall, very good prices with nice selection of outdoorsy stuff, and tech stuff in the way of GoPro gear.  Definitely will be shopping here again!"

 Best customer service ever!!
 "Not sure what all the negative reviews are about. I have placed multiple orders without any hiccups. Ivan is my customer service rep and goes above and beyond to ensure that my online experience with backcountry.com met my expectations. It is very rare to experience customer service on this level, I have received a follow-up phone call from Ivan the day after my online orders were placed every single time to give me shipping confirmation and verify I had a smooth online transaction. I have never been this satisfied with an online retailer before, I have zero complaints.. "

 Terrible terrible unbelievably BAD customer service!
 "I ordered 2 pairs of leggings - the picture of both the colors I ordered shows them to be full ankle length. Nowhere in the description of the item does it say what length they were. Maybe I should have been wary but it was my first time ordering with them and I didn't expect to be ripped off. When they arrived they were cropped - calf length. I wanted them for winter & traveling so I had to return them but didn't want to pay the $7 return fee because they had clearly misrepresented what I was buying. The guy (Ian B.) I was put through to was snarky with me straight away & said I had to pay the fee - telling me that the description said mid-rise (thats a waist description not a length description). That all the pictures in the reviews showed calf length - there were no pictures on my review feed. It remains to be seen whether they actually process my return at all."

 Snarky Customer service
 "If you are in for open box items and terrible customer service, then backcountry.com is for your.  Terrible and deceitful.  They charge for returns and even for even exchanges come at a fee.  Avoid at all cost.  No worth the aggravation."

 "I have spent thousands of dollars with Backcountry.com, and will likely spend thousands more. The site and service have always been top quality. I've spoken on the phone and via real-time chat with representatives and always had success with them. I'm only speaking from my personal experience, but BC is the one place I check first for any outdoor apparel, generally because of the price and customer service. There are other options for shopping when it comes to outdoor gear, but Backcountry.com is always top-notch. "

 "Order 2 simple bicycle parts --> Confirm order.One week later, not received anything --> follow the order --> Require "call customer service"The person explain that they are not comfortable doing business with me. (i bought 2 bicycle hanger for a value of 30$).I asked the reason --> She send me an email with another order confirmation. I reask why she send me the confirmation while she still says the order is cancelled. She answers that she can't give the reason and stop the conversation...To sum up, no information update sent about the status of the order. After i find out and contact them, they refuse to give any reason or inform about actions i could do to solve the issue."

 "Dear Sirs:I am writing in reference to a recent order purchased through Amazon, assold by Backcountry as the third party merchant. When speaking to Mark, hewas somewhat adamant or indifferent as to my statement regarding falseadvertisement and misrepresentation. Mark thought it was funny as hecontinued to argue with me, then disconnected the call purposely. Mark'sversion said that I was hollering at him which was not true. The phone callcan be corroborated verbatim. I called back and spoke with Leroy who triedto snow me in saying that the prepaid return label was a gift fromBackcountry, when in fact Backcountry had no other option than to supply aprepaid label free of charge according to the stipulations on the Amazonwebsite. Leroy did provide a variety of apologies, all containingmeaningless words. Leroy did not provide any adjustment, rather offering me2 day air.The call was logged and can be corroborated verbatim. This type of management by a retailer shall only bring poor sales in the near future.The gloves were defective (one) as specified above (Picture enclosed), andone picture of the good glove, irrespective of the wrong color (palms)which were gray and not "Black" as ordered and pictured. We've ordered fromBackcountry in past years, family and friends. However, we will no longerbe looking to Backcountry to purchase anything and shall send the word toeveryone. I wish a full refund and have no intentions, none of everpurchasing from Backcountry ever again. May Yahweh bless Backcountry andthe staff and personnel.* I have contacted Amazon.com several times regarding annoying, harassing emails after the purchase was cancelled. Backcountry.com continues to send harassing emails through Amazon. We believe the Attorney General can assist in this area. All information has been fully documented and can be verified verbatim. Do not purchase from Backcountry, for they are nothing more than snakes in the grass."

 "Just would like all to know that the free returns policy on the sunglasses is a scam. Your charged 6.99 shipping when all along you are led to believe in free returns! The sun glasses were so large they were falling off my face, if that isn't a legitimate reason for returns what is? Have a large family of 7 and any further sales will be purchased elsewhere. If you say free returns that should mean free."

 "Not only did they ship it to an address that I didn't type nor was on my account when I checked it, they said they would do nothing about getting it to me.  It was shipped to Ohio and I live in TN.  On Steap and Cheep they sent me a pair of sunglasses that were suppose to have 3 sets of lenses; they came with one and said it was a mistake.  Ya think.  The headache isn't worth the lack of organizational skills and poor customer service.  "

Home » Frequently Asked Questions










Frequently Asked Questions
Is this real?
Yes…100%.

How does it taste?
Incredible. Our sodas are all natural, gourmet, out of this world awesome, and our patent pending modified brewing process is capable of producing the same great tasting beer as a standard brewing process… without the water.

How concentrated is it?
Very. However, not all beers have the same percent alcohol concentration. Therefore, a higher alcohol content beer will appear less concentrated because there remains a larger volume of alcohol present after most of the water has been removed. Conversely, lower alcohol beer will appear much more concentrated, because in its natural state it contains a higher percentage of water. Our process does not result in a beer that is 100% void of water. It does however, result in a beer with nearly no water content. Some of our most concentrated beers will be at a nearly a 1:15 concentrate level. Our sodas on the other hand are concentrated to approximately a 1:11 ratio (concentrate: finished beverage)

How do you carbonate it?
We recommend using our Pat’s Backcountry™ Carbonator. It is ultra lightweight, compact, and easy to use.

How do I get some?
The Carbonator Bottle and Soda Concentrates is now available through our online store. We will also be regularly updating a store locator page of retailers throughout the country that carry the Pat’s line up.

When will it be available?
Our carbonator and soda concentrates are now available through our online store. We anticipate launching our beer concentrates in early 2013.

Is this just for backcountry use?
No. Backcountry use was just the catalyst to create the process and products. The potential for these beverages reaches far beyond the backcountry. They require less energy to produce, less to ship/transport, and are better for the environment. Consider the global implications and let your imagination wander for a moment.

Pro Camping Tips
									June 28, 2015 by Tristan Burnham - No Comments



We could make a list of 1,000 average tips for camping, about what to eat, what to bring, what to wear, how to pack, ect. But you’re rad, you already know these things and you don’t need any soccer mom tips about how to roast starbursts over a fire. So we decided to make a small list with just the best. So here they are, the Top 5 Pro Camping Tips.
5. Hand Sanitizer to Start a Fire

I usually carry some hand sanitizer with me on trips. It’s pretty small, lightweight and is really useful. It’s nice to wash your hands with after an amazing nature poop and I use it to clean my feet at night too. There’s a lot of camping hack sites saying Doritos can start a fire, but I’ve never tried that because I’ve never brought Doritos with me on a backpacking trip. Using a little bit of hand sanitizer is a much easier way to start a fire. But try as you might, no mater how much a mountain man you are, there’s been at least one time you had a hard time getting it raging. Hand sanitizer is about 90% alcohol so it burns really well, but don’t try and drink it, that’s what Pat’s Backcountry Beers are for.
4. Frozen Water Bottles

Freeze water bottles for your cooler to keep your food and beer cold. Ditch the old blue ice packs and bags of ice that are just going to melt and get thrown away. Instead freeze some water bottles and then you’ll have cold water too. Even for daytrips I’ll freeze bottles for a day of hiking or mountain biking. I think there’s a science behind drinking cold water; it doesn’t hydrate you as much as water at room temperature but I’ll drink way more water if it’s colder and it feels so much more refreshing. Wow, now I just sound like Bobby Boucher from The Waterboy. Anyways, if you’re on a longer trip and need to keep stuff colder than just a few days, refill your bottles with ice from a soda fountain. Most places will give you free ice. In the picture above we poured the ice from the bag into some water bottles.
3. Plan Your Trip

Google satellite view is an awesome way to plan your trip. I screen shot a bunch of landmarks and potential campsites with my phone. Even when you don’t have service, the location sometimes works on your phone. For rock climbing long multipitch routes I’ll take pictures of the guide book so I can leave that in the car and go a little bit lighter. It’s way easier to take a peek at your phone than to whip out a guide book 200 feet up. Remember to take a picture of the approach and descent as well as the route description. For most backpacking trips you should still bring a normal paper map, but your phone is an awesome tool you should take advantage of in the backcountry.
2. Hot Water Bottle Trick

For really cold nights boil some water and pour it in a Nalgene bottle and then put the bottle in a sock and then throw it in your sleeping bag. It can preheat your bag so when you climb in its all nice and toasty. It will also keep you warmer for most of the night. Make two, one for your feet and one to snuggle with. Dogs love this trick too.
1. Poach a Campsite

If you’re car camping you don’t need to stay at an actual campsite and pay $40 per night. Most places have dispersed camping which means you can camp for free almost anywhere in the forest. Like a backpacking trip you can stop wherever you want and stay the night, but you can do the same thing car camping. You won’t get the same amenities, but who needs a stinking bathroom anyways. BLM land is usually free to camp at too. Even national parks have wilderness permits where you can hike 5 minutes from the road and set up tent for the night for free. Just make sure you check the rules at the area you plan to stay at.
Now get out and enjoy the great outdoors and put these tips to use. You’ll be more comfortable and have more money for a longer adventure or better beer. Click here to learn more about our Brew Concentrate and Carbonator Bottles.

Cooking With Pat’s 
Backpacking Santa Cruz Island 















Lost Coast Trail
									March 1, 2015 by Tristan Burnham - No Comments



If you’re looking to plan a backpacking trip in March or April, there are quite a few options. One of our favorite springtime destinations is Northern California’s Lost Coast; a 53-mile stretch of rugged, undeveloped, and mountainous coastline. The Lost Coast trail is a beautiful and unique backpacking experience that combines stunning coastline, old-growth Redwoods, and black sand beaches. 
Driftwood on an empty, sandy beach. Not the scenery we usually associate with backpacking in California.
The Lost Coast is made up of two places: Its northern reaches are part of the Kings Range Conservation Area, and the southern portion is the Sinkyone Wilderness State Park. If you want to bring your dog (we always do), you’ll be hiking the 25 miles of trail that make up the Kings Range Conservation Area. If you’re not bringing a pup, either section of the Lost Coast Trail is an option. While the main trails (especially in the Kings Range) take you along the beach, there are many opportunities to head inland, which means you’ll be gaining some elevation. If you time the tides wrong, these inland detours will be your only option on the northern portions of trail. 
There are trails that will take you inland, and most of them involve some solid elevation gain. Bring a map, and be prepared to find yourself in a maze of cattle trails (if you’re hiking the King’s Range). The views are worth the extra effort.
The Kings Range portion has two access points: Shelter Cove and Mattole Beach. You’ve got the options of a 25-mile point-to-point (you’ll need a shuttle), or an out-and-back. Bring a tide chart, and be prepared to plan your hike accordingly: there are spots that you can’t get through (and certainly don’t want to be) during high tide. There are also a handful of creek crossings, which can get pretty rowdy during heavy rains. 
One of the many creeks you’ll be crossing on the Lost Coast Trail. Even during a relatively dry period (it only rained on us for a few hours the entire week we were there), all of the creeks were flowing. Although they were never more than knee deep, they can get tricky (and dangerous) during heavy rains.
If you’re hiking the Sinkyone Wilderness State Park, your access points are the Usal Beach Campground (at the southern reaches of the state park), or Shelter Cove. Your options include a point-to-point (again, you’ll need to arrange a shuttle), or an out-and-back. The ultimate challenge – something we are yet to do – is an out-and-back of the entire Lost Coast Trail. 
Most of what is now the Sinkyone Wilderness State Park and Kings Range Conservation area was privately owned land that was acquired by the BLM and the State of California. There are still remnants of private resisdences, as well as cattle ranches. BLM land is also leased for grazing purposes, so don’t be surprised if you see cattle on the inland portions of trail.
Remnants of the Lost Coast before it was acquired by the BLM.
The cattle we came across were generally unfazed by our presence, and didn’t make an effort to avoid us. We did find ourselves in a maze of cattle trail, but fortunately, navigating is easy when you can see the coastline. Head in the general direction of where you’re going, be mindful of cliffs, and you’ll eventually find your way back on familiar sand. 
There are still private ranches that escaped the BLM’s land acquisition. While cattle are generally docile, it’s always wise to exercise caution when they’re with young calves.
There are plenty of beautiful spots to stop and camp along the trail. Some of them are nearly on the beach, while others are slightly further inland. Our favorite spot was on the banks of a creek crossing, with an excellent fire ring and a tremendous view of the ocean. 
You wouldn’t know from this photo, but our campsite on night two was just a few feet from a creek, and a few-hundred yards from the pacific ocean. Still one of the greatest campsites we’ve ever found.
There is some surf along the Lost Coast. The hike in is worth the effort, but if it’s firing, there’s a chance (surprisingly) that you won’t be alone. On our most recent visit, the surf was head-high, and there was a lone soul having a great session on a perfect left. 
Lost Coast Surf Spot – If you’re willing to find it, it’s worth the effort. It goes without saying that a remote break in the Northern Pacific demands respect, so be smart.
Pack rain gear and a tide chart, and if you’re planning on going May-June, be ready for a lot of ticks to end up on you and your dog (this is why we enjoy the lost coast in March – we’ll take rain over ticks any day). 
And don’t forget to visit the Lost Coast Brewery in Eureka; they’ve got good food and solid beer (not that we usually need to convince people to visit a brewery, anyways…)

Summary
This is a product for those for whom a little extra expense and a little extra weight is money well spent and weight well carried if it can produce the comfort of a soda or beer in the backcountry. Not for beer snobs or ultralighters, but cheers to the rest!

Pros

Soda and beer in the backcountry without the weight!
Well-made system
Easy to use



Cons

Activator flavor detectable in some beverages
System-specific bottle required
Convenience comes at a price: more expensive than store-bought beverages




This winter holiday season I tested Pat’s Backcountry Beverages Carbonator Bottle, a 12-pack box of Activator Packets, and a generous supply of Pat’s All-Natural Cola, Pat’s All-Natural Root Beer, and the Pale Rail (5.2% ABV) and Black Hops (6.1% ABV) beers. While I used my own experience to test the beers, I enlisted the palates of my children to test the sodas—kids are always honest about foods and drinks they like or dislike, and their takes on Pat's sodas were no exception.
I am fortunate to live in the central Piedmont area of North Carolina, a region with more than 80 miles of greenways and watershed trails and one that sits in close proximity to the 50,000 plus acres of the Uhwharrie National Forest. It was to these haunts I turned for testing, for they offered me the opportunity to go on kid-friendly treks with my boys (and to be a super dad capable of producing sodas mid-hike) as well as allowing me to experience solo wilderness travel.
For purposes of familiarity for comparison, I also tested Pat's sodas and beers at home in the environment where I experience their store-bought counterparts in mugs or glasses. I also toted a plastic glass into the wilderness, too, just to be fair.

The Pat’s Backcountry System
Three purchased components are required to make backcountry beverage magic with this system:
the Pat’s Backcountry Beverages Carbonator Bottle,
a beverage concentrate, and
an activator packet.

You will need your own preferred choice of potable water, too.
The Carbonator Bottle is a 20 oz./ 592 ml BPA-free bottle that weighs in at 8.92 oz/ 253 g.
 A clear plastic exterior is marked with the pertinent measurements for using the bottle as a carbonating device—16 oz.—and more: 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 oz., too, measurements that could be handy for backcountry cooking (though metric measurements are not provided).
Naturally, the bottle can be used as a water bottle if one wishes, too, by simply unscrewing the lid, which has a loop of plastic that would allow one to fasten it to a pack with a carabiner. One unique and essential aspect of this bottle is this lid, though, which contains a pump that draws a sufficient amount of water into the lid to later cause a reaction with the Activator Packet’s contents. It also has attached to the lid a blue carbonation chamber.
Into this clear bottle go water and Beverage Concentrate, a base mixture (at right, below) that will eventually produce a carbonated beverage. The average beverage concentrate weighs 2.12 oz./ 60g. Mixing concentrate and water is as simple as filling the bottle with water and one concentrate packet to the 16 oz. line and shaking the closed bottle.

A blue plastic interior container attaches to the lid, and it is this carbonation chamber wherein the Activator Packets (above, at left) are emptied when one wishes to carbonate a beverage. Each Activator Packet contains separate compartments of Potassium Bicarbonate (7.9 g) and Citric Acid (5.1 g) which—when mixed together—react with water to provide carbonation for the bottle’s contents, whether that is a soda or beer concentrate. Activator packets weigh .5 oz./ 14 g.
The Procedure
The procedure is simple after a few times through it. First, potable water is drawn by way of the lid’s pump lever into the lid. Then the activator mix is added to the dry carbonation chamber, which is reattached to the lid and set aside.
Next, one empties a packet of concentrate into the bottle and fills the remaining space with potable water, reattaching the lid to the bottle (see image, below).

The pump lever in the lid is then used to squirt water into the carbonation chamber. As things start to fizz, one shakes the whole contraption side to side for a minute or two, then opens the pump lever one more time to release excess carbonation before unscrewing the lid an enjoying. Pour in your favorite glass or just drink from the bottle itself as one would from a Nalgene. Voilà!

Below is the Black Hops, carbonated and ready to have the pressure released . . .
. . . with the lifting of a lever.
A handy plastic glass adds a touch of on-the-trail luxury!In practice, this procedure becomes like any camp routine such as pitching a tarp or building a fire—virtually automatic. But if my explanation is unclear, take a look at this video wherein I demonstrate the bottle at the core of the system.

Reviewing the Sodas
My team of experts—my boys—and I found the sodas to be palatable. “Not as fizzy, dad, as my regular root beer,” said my sixth grade expert, and this critique is one that holds true for all the Pat’s Backcountry beverages I made using this system.
The carbonation the system produces is finer than carbon dioxide-injected, store-bought beverages or most naturally fermented beverages. I would call it subtle but apparent, like a beverage in a two-liter bottle that has been open for a day or two.
Soda flavors are rich and recognizable given their labels—All-Natural Root Beer tasted like what I think of as being root beer, All-Natural Cola tasted like cola (maybe more like Pepsi than Coke). We’ll call them more or less true to taste, but with less effervescent carbonation. The low carbonation did cause hesitance from my kids: while they loved the wow factor of being able to make these drinks in the wilderness, they said they were “different” due to the lower carbonation.
Fair enough. But testing the root beer again on an unseasonably warm day in the Uhwharrie Mountains (64˚ F), I found the root beer to be perfect: carbonated enough to tickle the tongue, rich in flavor, and satisfying after a brisk hike to camp. Context influences perception.

Reviewing the Beers
Like the sodas, the beers had a smoother, subtler carbonation than most store-bought brews. The beers both had a distinctive flavor (not unpleasant) that I attributed to the activator ingredients, something that the soda concentrates seemed to mask more effectively with their thicker, more syrupy concentrates. Initially, this flavor got my attention, but after a few sips, the effect was less obvious. Pinning down the exact flavor of this activator is elusive—it is a vaguely citrusy-soda-watery.
The Black Hops (6.1% ABV/ pint) is described by Pat’s as “hand crafted using the world's most environmentally friendly brewing process. Generous additions of Cascade hops combined with a bold blend of dark roasted malts creates a smooth yet robust craft brew.” This was the richer, heavier, and maltier of the two brews. That also translated into less susceptible to having the activator flavors intrude.
For me that was a bonus, but I also like  dark beer, and this has a dark chocolate hue. I enjoyed relaxing in my hammock with a Black Hops on a clear 33˚ F day!

The Pail Rail (5.2% ABV/ pint) is the lighter brew, reddish in color and described by Pat’s as being “hand crafted using the world’s most environmentally friendly brewing process. A delicate blend of aromatic malts and Cascade hops delivers a complex, yet well-balanced, craft brew.”
This was to my palate the milder of the two brews. Review Corps member KiwiKlimber noted that it sounded like the Pail Rail was a summer brew, and I think that is a fair description. I'd love to try one of these mid-July after a brutal uphill climb.

Because Pail Rail is the milder one, it was also a bit more subject to the flavor infusion I attributed to the activator ingredients. I found myself wanting to have the second and third sip to lessen this curious flavor, but never did this keep me from finishing a brew: I liked Pail Rail, but I would have liked to have the activator ingredients assume a less prominent role in the flavor synthesis. I can only imagine what a dice roll it is to brew beer, knowing that the final product will be carbonated with an infusion—part-science, part-art. I imagine Pat’s will keep toying with recipes.
Conclusions
The product quality of this system is good. The bottle feels as solid as any Nalgene, although after some use, the threads on the lid got a little quirky—be careful not to over tighten the carbonation chamber. Activator packets and beverage concentrates come in easy-tear, air-tight packaging with adequate directions included. Nothing feels cheap about this system. 
Let’s talk weight and let’s get the obvious out of the way: no ultralight purist would sanction carrying the extra weight required to make your own carbonated sodas or beer in the backcountry. But for those who may want a little refreshment beyond potable water, the weight is this: for 11.5 oz./ 327 grams, you can tote the bottle, an activator packet, and a beverage concentrate along on your quest.
This weight does not include water weight—you’ll be toting or finding that anyway—but in comparison, a single bottled beer (I am out of canned beverages as I write) weighs about 19.7 oz./ 558 g. Given a ready supply of water, a second beverage of choice—just the activator and concentrate packets—would cost you only an additional 2.6 oz./ 74 g.
Gram weenies earn the admiration and envy of this lightweight camper on many a climb, but if I were to hoist a pint of Pat's Backcountry beer in camp, the tables might be turned.
Flavor-wise, this system offers some intriguing backcountry options. I will confess that I am probably too much on the lightweight side of the scales to bring this system with me to carbonate soda (sans kids, anyway). It isn’t that these aren’t passable backcountry options: if one wanted a soda at the end of a long day, and if one recognized that these are somewhat different than store-bought, pre-carbonated sodas, I say go for it! It is the kid-friendly option, too.
But the more spirited aspects of Pat’s beers would and did induce me to tote them along on my own treks after testing them once or twice. Pail Rail and Black Hops are unmistakably beer. Backcountry beer, yes, but the differences I noted between backcountry carbonation and other brews are ameliorated by one key ingredient in these beverages, especially if one pint becomes two (or if, as I did, you only use about 14 oz. of water).
If you like beer for all of the usual reasons, you will understand my own satisfaction at pulling out this system, making a brew, and settling into my hammock to watch Mother Nature do her thing. A pint made from cold water after a long hike—that is the stuff that dreams are made of.
Additional Reflections
KiwiKlimber asked me about temperature. I tested these beverages in weather ranging from the low 30s to the mid-60s degrees Fahrenheit. I saw no discernible difference in the effectiveness of the carbonation process based on any particular temperature range. 
Another Trailspace Review Corps member, Bill Heiser, inquired about altitude, relaying an anecdote about one of his own JMT experiences wherein he ingested quite a lot of carbonated beverages and subsequently rued his decision. I have little altitude around me, sitting as I write this at 920 feet above sea level. If anyone has tried these at noticeable altitude, please add a comment below.
 







G00SE
MODERATOR Very nice review, Bentbrook. My problem with a product like this is increasingly we (mankind) bring the conveniences of home to the outdoors, rather than taking nature as it is. I don't want to hike a trail with headphones on (or worse, the guy who brought external speakers for his iPod). I don't want to check FaceBook or make phone calls. And I'd rather hike into a bar to get a burger & a beer that I've been craving for a week than finish every day with a drink in hand. I know some will disagree with me, and I respect that, but I enter the outdoors to get away from my daily life--the soda, the processed food, the constant noise. Again, though, this was a very good review! 3 years ago









Bentbrook
Thanks, G00SE. I share your perspective in many regards. My own evolution as a backpacker has led me to shed gear, to be more purposeful in choosing that gear which I carry (thank you, Trailspace, for an excuse to reflect!), and to develop my knowledge (natural awareness, navigation, tracking, etc.). Like you, I never listen to music in the wilderness (Nature trumps anything I could bring to those environs), and while I carry a phone to calm my wife's concerns when I'm solo and to snap the occasional pic, I am much happier returning to nature's rhythm with my surroundings than fretting with technology (geeky navigational toys aside--I love to see elevation profiles and waypoints once I'm back home). Let's get back to Muir and Thoreau! But I think each person should HYOH, and thus I think this is a niche product for special circumstances. Clearly, it demands responsible use, both in terms of LNT and in terms of personal safety if one is opting for beer over soda. I would not carry this very often. I am not one to carry alcohol with me into the backcountry (save what I use in my caldera cone stove) for a variety of reasons--safety, weight, and the need to distance myself from that world, the daily life as you put it. But I am also a fan of innovation, and Pat's has definitely come up with something interesting here. I can think of the end of one truly grueling day on the trail last year when having this option would have been welcome after the day's ardor was past. It was the last night on the trail followed by a short hike out the next morning, and every muscle and bone in my body raged against me for pushing them as I had done the whole day and, indeed, for the previous week. Yet for all I've had that sort of moment, I've had many more when freshly filtered stream water tasted like ambrosia, when I drank with regret the last drop of mountain spring water in my car on my way back to the routine of everyday existence. I think you raise an excellent point: what we take with us is in some ways indicative of what we seek to take from a wilderness experience. To escape from one's escape is certainly ironic! 3 years ago









FromSagetoSnow
This sounds fun.  When carrying beer becomes a weight issue you can have a celebratory brew made from mountain water.  I hope this company does well.   3 years ago









FromSagetoSnow
I'd love to try this at 10,000 feet or so this summer to see what altitude does to it.  I drank a Rainier beer at the summit of the same mountain (14K) and it was a little messy but otherwise fine.   3 years ago









Ashleigh
MODERATOR Thanks for the awesome review, Bentbrook! I've been very curious to hear an honest review of this product for quite some time now. I think it is a really awesome and fun concept. My only concern about this is that I am really picky about having my beer COLD. It seems that I could only use it during the late fall/winter/early spring. 3 years ago









Bentbrook
Jeff, I remain curious about the altitude aspect, too. I hope someone adds a comment based on personal experience. And thank you, Ashleigh. I understand the cold beer need. For the record, I think the Black Hops lends itself more to less-than-icy drinking than the Pail Rail for those for whom iciness is less of an issue. In my opinion, though, either would be more palatable than a less-than-cold mainstream domestic beer. 3 years ago









Alicia
TRAILSPACE STAFF Thanks for doing the arduous testing on these, Bentbrook! I've been very curious to see how they actually worked out and was eager to read your review. I admit, I probably wouldn't carry them myself, except for a special occasion, but I bet you could make a lot of friends if you did. 3 years ago









Sean Van Cleve
GUIDE/OUTFITTER Mmmmmmmm... Beer... Although I am in agreement with most everybody here about not carrying this, it might be a very different story staying at a basecamp for an extended time! Thanks for the hard work, and excellent review on something that a lot of us here have been waiting for! I have heard of people who stash a couple of cold ones in a stream for the return to the trailhead! 3 years ago









Bentbrook
Yes, Sean, there is definitely a time and place for everything, including beer, and if part of a trek is spending time with a close friend, hoisting a pint makes a lot of sense, certainly more so than if I am seeking solitude in nature. Nice to have a viable, lightweight option. 3 years ago









Lah
It seems to me to be a very interesting and innovative niche product. I can see guide companies using this to improve clients' experiences at base camps and beyond. As independent outdoors-persons, we forget that others go into the outdoors for reasons other than to simply enjoy nature. It's a sad fact but as such, I can definitely see there being a market for this product. Look-out box wine, you now have a competitor! 3 years ago









FromSagetoSnow
If there were a drinking game where you drank every time someone said, "I wish there was dehydrated beer to drink hiking" I think I'd be dead 3 years ago

																			Pat's Backcountry Beverage Carbonator. I love sipping…																	

May 17, 2013





CTL


31 reviewer rep



Rating: 
Source: bought it new						
Price Paid: $39.95 for Starter Kit


Summary
Pat's Backcountry Beverage Carbonator. I love sipping back a cold soda after a hard day's hike, climb, etc. but hate carrying the weight. With Pat's Backcountry Carbonator now you can have an ice cold soda without having to pack all the weight of a 6 pack. Beer is coming soon too!

Pros

Eco friendly
Lightweight
Did I mention you can make your own soda?



Cons

Takes a little bit of practice to learn.
Company response to emails is slow.



 

It's been a long hot hike and now it's time to settle down, camp is set up, sun is setting and the moon is rising. Suddenly you wish you had a cold soda or an ice cold beer. Then you remember you've been drinking water from your CARBONATOR! You head down to the ice cold stream that is fed from the melting snow and begin to purify some water right into the Carbonator. In a few minutes you're sipping a Bear Foot Root Beer watching the sun set over the peaks, thinking "What a life!"
Pat's Backcountry Beverage Portable Carbonator rocks! Love having soda (soon beer) in the backcountry but hate the hassle of carrying a 6 pack of bottles? Convenient, eco friendly, and TASTY!
The Carbonator is a little smaller than a Nalgene bottle. Using the soda concentrate which comes in a pack about the size of GU, the eco2activator pack, and clean, purified water you can now conveniently make a 16 oz size soda in the backcountry. The process takes about 3 minutes once you get the steps down. (If my 9-year-old can figure it... you know.)
The Carbonator Kit (which is a starter kit for $39.95) comes with everything to get you started. The Carbonator bottle, 5 tasty and creative soda concentrates; the flavors are Terra Cola, Poma Granite Cola, Lemon Clime, Bear Foot Root Beer (my favorite), and Ginger trail. Plus 6 packets of Eco2 Activator powder and easy to follow instructions. They also have instructions on how to make your own soda concentrate! The soda concentrate is made with cane juice, contains vitamins and has natural flavors. There is nothing artificial.
There is a learning curve with this but as I stated above if my 9-year-old can figure it you should be able to as well. Practice before you go out. The company keeps pushing back the date on the Beer Concentrate. Disappointing, but I think it's due to the difference in laws from state to state. Pat's Backcountry is a small business based in Alaska according to its website.
Enjoy! 







Peter1955
Just a question, but wouldn't the beer have to be non-alcoholic? 4 years ago









Alicia
TRAILSPACE STAFF Peter, this is from the Pat's FAQ about alcohol content:

How concentrated is it?

Very. However, not all beers have the same percent alcohol concentration. Therefore, a higher alcohol content beer will appear less concentrated because there remains a larger volume of alcohol present after most of the water has been removed. Conversely, lower alcohol beer will appear much more concentrated, because in its natural state it contains a higher percentage of water. Our process does not result in a beer that is 100% void of water. It does however, result in a beer with nearly no water content. Some of our most concentrated beers will be at a nearly a 1:15 concentrate level. Our sodas on the other hand are concentrated to approximately a 1:11 ratio (concentrate: finished beverage) 4 years ago









Seth Levy
TRAILSPACE STAFF I should say that there are some "dehydrated" alcohols in development, so, theoretically, it would be possible to reduce beer to something close to a solid.  Actually, a lot of the big brewers do something similar with high gravity brewing and vacuum distillation. Whether this produces a beer that's worth drinking is an entirely different story! 4 years ago









CTL
Yes. I love my carbonator and am curiously awaiting the beer. Of course I want to test first! Their sodas are good. Hoping the beer would be too. I'll just have to make sure my son doesn't accidentally use a beer concentrate thinking it's soda.  4 years ago









Peter1955
So the concentrates aren't powdered but liquid, and in a beer the remaining fluid would be alcohol not water. Okay. That makes sense.  4 years ago









CTL
Yes peter1955 the concentrates are liquid and come in small packages that look like a package of GU. At least the soda concentrates are. Haven't seen the beer yet.  4 years ago

				Klean Kanteen Insulated Classic 20oz			


								The Klean Kanteen insulated water bottle keeps liquids cold for days or hot for hours. Super strong stainless steel inside and out, it can take a beating and is easy to clean. I have had the Klean Kanteen insulated classic  20-ounce water bottle for six months now and I continue to be amazed at how well the bottle works. Because it looks like an ordinary water bottle it's easy to forget that it isn't. I first noticed how well the insulated bottle works when I started leaving it in my truck for…				Full review


				CamelBak Chute 1.2L			


								This water bottle is an amazing day hike and everyday bottle. It definitely keeps your drink cold or warm for a long time! It is cheaper than a Hydro Flask, but performs just as well. I got this water bottle on Amazon for a really good deal, and am very impressed by its quality! I've had it for just about two years, and everything is still in working order! I would first like to mention its insulating properties. If you fill the thing with ice and top it off with water, it will stay cold for three…				Full review


				Hydrapak SoftFlask 150 ml			


								This small collapsible bottle is ideal for transporting petite amounts of liquids such as energy gel, olive oil, or electrolyte drink mixes. HydraPak SoftFlask bottles come in small sizes to accommodate energy gels or liquids. Made of soft thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), the collapsible, flexible material is remarkably strong and resistant to abrasion, even when abused on the backpacking trail. The company states that if used for gels, the 150 ml flask can hold five servings and the 250 ml flask…				Full review


				RTIC 18oz Bottle			


								This bottle, made by rticcoolers.com has been a Eureka! find for me. Finally, an insulated bottle that keeps my iced coffee cold for 24 hours, and keeps my hot coffee HOT for more than 6 hours! This is an economy priced bottle, that has proven to exceed my expectations, and has become my go-to bottle to take beverages with me on my day paddling adventures. This bottle was given to me as part of a prize package from the blog Happily Ever Outdoors. I admit, I was unfamiliar with the RTIC cooler brand,…				Full review


				CamelBak Chute .75L			


								A great water bottle. The new Chute cap with the threading on the inside of the mouth piece is ingenious. Unscrew the entire cap to fill and unscrew the spout to drink. A little heavy for the ultra-lighters, but more reliable than store bought filled water bottles. You can carry wine in one (the .75 liter size is the amount of liquid in a bottle of wine), and when the wine has been consumed use it for water. Its slim profile makes it perfect for water bottle pockets. Always make sure the spout is…				Full review


				Platypus SoftBottle			


								Compact and easily packed when empty, a stronger than it looks one-liter water bottle. I have seven and love them: 2 blue, 1 red, 1 mountains, etc. The different colors help me keep track of water being purified. I'll pump or squeeze a couple of bottles of water around camp that night, and then use Katadyn Micropur tablets to purify in others overnight. I carry a few when backpacking, especially if I carry wine in a couple .75 liter Camelbak Chutes. After the wine is gone the .75's replace the…				Full review


				Hydrapak Stash 750 ml			


								The Hydrapak Stash Collapsible bottle is great for conserving pack space and going UL. However, most of the time it can be hard to drink out of and is difficult to use. While this bottle takes up minimal pack space and is very light, it definitely is not user friendly. I have only had this bottle for about a month, but it is easy to tell how it performs.   The bottom is made of stiff plastic, which provides good stability but makes it a challenge to open. You have to press on the sides once they…				Full review


				Platypus SoftBottle			


								The Platypus SoftBottle caught my attention as something practical for excursions requiring lightweight, tightly packed gear. I admit that I really thought I could get the bottle to leak. As it turns out, the bottle soared to the top of my list of water bottles to carry for any excursion. One liter equals about 34 ounces. In a Platypus 1L soft bottle, weighing in at a hefty 1.2 ounces, the total weight tips the scale at a little over two pounds. I suppose you could go lighter, like carry water in…				Full review


				SmarTube The SmarTube			


								I really wanted to like this product as I think the concept is great, but the bite valve included with the system has very poor flow when compared to other hydration bite valves currently available from other manufactures. I have been very focused on trying to whittle away at excess weight in my pack and I came across this product and thought it might enable me to eliminate the bladder I currently use to carry water. I like drinking from a tube/bite valve system when I am hiking, so I have always…				Full review

Recent Water Bottle Reviews

				Klean Kanteen Insulated Classic 20oz			


								The Klean Kanteen insulated water bottle keeps liquids cold for days or hot for hours. Super strong stainless steel inside and out, it can take a beating and is easy to clean. I have had the Klean Kanteen insulated classic  20-ounce water bottle for six months now and I continue to be amazed at how well the bottle works. Because it looks like an ordinary water bottle it's easy to forget that it isn't. I first noticed how well the insulated bottle works when I started leaving it in my truck for…				Full review


				CamelBak Chute 1.2L			


								This water bottle is an amazing day hike and everyday bottle. It definitely keeps your drink cold or warm for a long time! It is cheaper than a Hydro Flask, but performs just as well. I got this water bottle on Amazon for a really good deal, and am very impressed by its quality! I've had it for just about two years, and everything is still in working order! I would first like to mention its insulating properties. If you fill the thing with ice and top it off with water, it will stay cold for three…				Full review


				Hydrapak SoftFlask 150 ml			


								This small collapsible bottle is ideal for transporting petite amounts of liquids such as energy gel, olive oil, or electrolyte drink mixes. HydraPak SoftFlask bottles come in small sizes to accommodate energy gels or liquids. Made of soft thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), the collapsible, flexible material is remarkably strong and resistant to abrasion, even when abused on the backpacking trail. The company states that if used for gels, the 150 ml flask can hold five servings and the 250 ml flask…				Full review


				RTIC 18oz Bottle			


								This bottle, made by rticcoolers.com has been a Eureka! find for me. Finally, an insulated bottle that keeps my iced coffee cold for 24 hours, and keeps my hot coffee HOT for more than 6 hours! This is an economy priced bottle, that has proven to exceed my expectations, and has become my go-to bottle to take beverages with me on my day paddling adventures. This bottle was given to me as part of a prize package from the blog Happily Ever Outdoors. I admit, I was unfamiliar with the RTIC cooler brand,…				Full review


				CamelBak Chute .75L			


								A great water bottle. The new Chute cap with the threading on the inside of the mouth piece is ingenious. Unscrew the entire cap to fill and unscrew the spout to drink. A little heavy for the ultra-lighters, but more reliable than store bought filled water bottles. You can carry wine in one (the .75 liter size is the amount of liquid in a bottle of wine), and when the wine has been consumed use it for water. Its slim profile makes it perfect for water bottle pockets. Always make sure the spout is…				Full review


				Platypus SoftBottle			


								Compact and easily packed when empty, a stronger than it looks one-liter water bottle. I have seven and love them: 2 blue, 1 red, 1 mountains, etc. The different colors help me keep track of water being purified. I'll pump or squeeze a couple of bottles of water around camp that night, and then use Katadyn Micropur tablets to purify in others overnight. I carry a few when backpacking, especially if I carry wine in a couple .75 liter Camelbak Chutes. After the wine is gone the .75's replace the…				Full review


				Hydrapak Stash 750 ml			


								The Hydrapak Stash Collapsible bottle is great for conserving pack space and going UL. However, most of the time it can be hard to drink out of and is difficult to use. While this bottle takes up minimal pack space and is very light, it definitely is not user friendly. I have only had this bottle for about a month, but it is easy to tell how it performs.   The bottom is made of stiff plastic, which provides good stability but makes it a challenge to open. You have to press on the sides once they…				Full review


				Platypus SoftBottle			


								The Platypus SoftBottle caught my attention as something practical for excursions requiring lightweight, tightly packed gear. I admit that I really thought I could get the bottle to leak. As it turns out, the bottle soared to the top of my list of water bottles to carry for any excursion. One liter equals about 34 ounces. In a Platypus 1L soft bottle, weighing in at a hefty 1.2 ounces, the total weight tips the scale at a little over two pounds. I suppose you could go lighter, like carry water in…				Full review


				GSI Outdoors 10 Oz. Flask			


								If you are like me and enjoy a daily dram or shot of your favorite beverage in the back country, I highly recommend looking into this GSI flask. Drink responsibly, but enjoy comfort in the knowledge that your whisky (or other favorite beverage) will be safe and sound no matter where you store it or if you drop it. I rarely strap a pack on my back for a trip to the wilderness without slipping a flask into a side pocket with just the right amount of my favorite single malt scotch. A daily dram after…				Full review

Review: Pat’s Backcountry BeveragesSub Title: Brewskis in the Bush


 Josh Valcarcel/WIRED 


Hike to the top of your favorite mountain, kick back, put up your feet and you may find yourself thinking that the only possible way to make it better would be with a tall, cold one. That’s a dream for many hardcore hikers, and the tale spun by Patrick Tatera, founder of Pat’s Backcountry Beverages in Alaska. Tatera thought long and hard about how to make it work.

Learn How We Rate

Wired
Impressive technology and clever engineering. If you're a hiker and a beer fanatic this could make your day. At $40 for the carbonator, $6 for a 12-pack of activator packets and, $10 for a four-pack of brew concentrate, it's not prohibitively priced.
Tired
Beer concentrates and the carbonator make brews that can be good, but they aren't great. Then again, you might not care after a long day of hiking.

That meant he’d need a way to carbonate mountain stream water, and combine that with a syrupy sort of “brew concentrate.” There are so many variables at play that can make a huge difference with carbonation in general—the temperature of the liquid and the amount of sugar in it, for example—that it’s amazing his creation works at all, even if the results are mixed.
The setup, now dubbed the Portable Beverage Carbonator, looks like a futuristic Nalgene bottle. The bottle is $40, the carbonation packs are $6 for 12, and four-pack of beer concentrate is $10. You start by filling the bottle with water and the syrup from a flavor packet. Then you pump water from a secret compartment hidden inside the lid into another compartment—the “reactor cup” which is filled with packets citric acid and potassium bicarbonate—and the fizzing begins immediately. You shake the whole bottle for a couple of minutes, transferring the pressure to the drink, and suddenly, you’ve got a carbonated beverage.

There are non-alcoholic options. Try making Pat’s All-Natural Cola, add some ice cubes when its done, and it tastes impressively like Coke or Pepsi. The lemon-lime flavor tastes like something halfway between Sprite and the original powdered Gatorade. It’s nice enough.
Pat’s “brew concentrates” are something different altogether. In an overly simplified nutshell, regular beer is typically brewed by adding grain to hot water, adding yeast to the resulting liquid (the wort), allowing it to ferment, then carbonating if necessary.

	Considering that it was squeezed from a tube, the Pale Rail is impressive, sort of like a decent homebrew.	

During that process, sugar in the wort feeds the yeast, and the yeast creates alcohol. Too high a percentage of alcohol causes the yeast to slow down and eventually stop. To create the beer syrup, Pat’s uses a proprietary technique it calls “nested fermentation,” where the brewers continually add sugars and remove alcohol. It makes for some very happy yeast. Using Pat’s method, the brewers add the alcohol back to the mixture at the end of the process. It yields a syrup with close to 50 percent alcohol by volume, which Pat’s refers to as a 10:1 concentrate. Combine the syrup, water, and carbonate, and a glass of the resulting concoction has a similar flavor and percentage of alcohol to “normal” beer.
It’s enough of a change in the brewing that the packets can’t legally be called beer, so Pat’s gets clever and calls it “brew.” Regardless, there’s a ton of potential and it has a much longer shelf life than bottled beer. Brewers could use this idea to create fountain-style beer, similar to the way fountain soda is made from syrup, which saves Coke and Pepsi millions in shipping costs. The work Pat’s is doing now with 6:1 ratios allows them to “clone” a beer. (The curious can watch for an announcement about this at the 2016 National Restaurant Association show in Chicago at the end of May.)
The Taste Test
The proof, however, is in the packets. After testing the sodas, it was sufficiently close enough to 5 pm to call my brother-in-law, Ben, and start shaking up some beer. I had samples of Pat’s Pale Rail (a type of pale ale) and Pat’s dark, hoppy Black Hops. I picked up a growler of real pale ale at Seattle’s Flying Lion Brewery and, keeping it in the Pacific Northwest, a porter from Tacoma’s Wingman Brewers—not perfect matches, but close enough to provide nice comparisons.
Considering that it was squeezed from a tube, the Pale Rail is impressive, sort of like a decent homebrew. The Flying Lion was of course fantastic, full of lovely peach and apricot notes, a balanced bitterness and a purposeful, well-calibrated carbonation. “The Flying Lion tastes more complete,” Ben remarked, though he and I reasoned that at 6,000 feet, you’d gladly overlook any sort of defect in the Pale Rail.
Pat’s founder Tatera admits to the limitations of the beer made in the carbonator, saying that the 10:1 ratio helps keep it as light as possible for long hikes. If the furthest you’re heading is your fridge and you still want to try beer from a squeeze tube, Tatera suggests using a home carbonator like a SodaStream or the DrinkMate.
I handed the carbonator and a packet of Black Hops over to Ben and he looked around for a way to set the round-bottomed reactor cup down on the counter.
I offered to help.
“I’ll get it,” he said. “You can’t ask a bear to hold your reactior cup out in the woods.”
Fair enough.
Though Ben was I bigger fan than I was, the Black Hops wasn’t our favorite, particularly stacked up against the porter from Tacoma. But again, after a long day of hiking, it would still be nice. (I may have also considered just bringing a flask of Scotch.)
Is Pat’s carbonator and beer for you? It’s not really for home drinking, but if you’ve got a long hike ahead and need a light pack, the answer might lie at the end of a long trail.

The SoCal Bowhunter: Product Review: Pat's Backcountry Beverages

Product Review: Pat's Backcountry Beverages








Dry trail dust layered on your tongue. Sore feet. Aching legs. A tired body. Whether you have reached the summit of a mountain or completed a grueling hike in steep terrain. You did it! How do you cap it all off? An ice cold, carbonated beverage would be perfect! Even 12 miles deep in the backcountry, Pat’s Backcountry Beverages makes that a reality. Yes, you can make your own soda or brew your own beer in the backcountry, and it is surprisingly easy to do! Two months ago, after reading about this unique system, I spoke with Pat’s Backcountry Beverages regarding the product and was intrigued. Founded by Pat Tatera nearly two decades ago, the company was built to produce an eco-friendly way to make beverages with a much smaller carbon footprint.From their website: 

Introducing the most environmentally-responsible carbonated beverage system on earth! This awesome little addition to your gear list is engineered with an emphasis on rugged durability and first of it's kind functionality. In it's more docile state, it functions as your standard, everyday water bottle (yawn). However, when you decide to kick it into high gear and unleash the technology hiding under it's cap, you get a burst of refreshing carbonation to energize any beverage of your choice. So no matter how far your wanderlust leads you down the trail, you can still enjoy a crisp, carbonated beverage anywhere on the planet. Cheers!
The carbonator bottle is lightweight and well constructed. It can be used to make your soda or beer, but also as an ordinary water bottle (but who wants to do that). It even has a carabiner clip attachment to be sure you don’t lose it on the trail (that would be a travesty). The activator packets are small and so are the concentrated beverage. Both will fit in your hand. I took two activator packets and two concentrated beverage packs and stuck them inside the bottle on the hike. It’s an excellent way to reduce space and protect the kit. I ordered two types of concentrated beer, the 1919 Pale Rail and the Black Hops because I had to do a thorough review for you guys.  

 


Let’s get down to brass tacks. How does it work!? The paper instructions that comes with the orange carbonator bottle are to the point, but can seem overwhelming as the paper is folded up like a giant map. There is an easy to follow demonstration on the PBCB website by Pat himself. I’ll be honest, I watched the video that Pat put together showing how to use it and I then watched it again to be sure I knew exactly how to do it. The second time was much easier to follow as I was sure to hold the bottle in my hands and repeat what Pat did.





After hiking 12 miles of steep terrain and enduring a barrage of rain, Brett and I were ready for a cold beverage. I chose to bring a 1919 Pale Rail and a Black Hops for us to share. PBCB highly recommends you use chilled or cold water to brew. I will be honest and say that while I had water frozen in my container, we hiked twelve miles and not only did the ice thaw, the water warmed up to slightly warmer than chilled. I only realized this after brewing the first beer, the Pale Rail. I won’t go through the directions in detail (you can get that from the video), but I repeated them and in less than two minutes we had a cold beer ready to drink. We split the 16 oz. and enjoyed it thoroughly. I made the Black Hops a few minutes later and when that was ready we split that, too.





Everyone has been asking me, how does it taste? The 1919 Pale Rail tastes great! Even with less than ideal chilled water, the flavor and aroma was excellent! We both agreed that if I had ice cold water it would have been even better. We both thought the Black Hops was ok, but not what we expected and it wasn’t as strong in flavor as the PR. Both were good, but the Pale Rail took top honors.Overall, this is one of the coolest products I have reviewed and it is certainly one of the most unique. There are different ways to combine the different products available for purchase. I purchased the orange carbonator bottle for $29.99, the 12-pack activator for $5.99, and the beer concentrate was $9.99 for each 4/pk. I think that overall, the system is offered at a very reasonable price. Just imagine how incredible it would be to hike into the backcountry and use cold spring water to make your own beer? I eagerly await what new products the Pat's Backcountry Beverages team creates and I happily offer up my taste buds as test subjects.

																			Perfect companions to their highly acclaimed Carbonator…																	

June 11, 2015
updated Jan 21, 2016






NJHiker


139 reviewer rep



Rating: 
Source: bought it new						
Price Paid: $59.99 for the kit - bottle, 10 activators and 4 packs of each flavor


Summary
Perfect companions to their highly acclaimed Carbonator Bottle, these flavors give the user the ability to "brew" fresh adult beverages.

Pros

Nice to have a choice of adult beverages once camp is set
A LOT lighter than carrying a pint of ale!
Rather tasty, once you get used to the process
Shipping varies by state, but always requires a signature by an adult over 21 years of age



Cons

The instructions are a little daunting at first
Only 3 flavors currently available(updated)
Shipping requires a signature by an adult over 21 years of age
(arrange delivery to a place you WILL be)



I'm not a huge proponent of imbibing on the trail, but on a hot summer night after a day long hike, there's nothing quite as satisfying as a cool, frothy ale by the fire pit to set the night off right. 
I'll review the two "adult beverages" here, with hopes that someone more experienced with the soda flavors might chime in! The mixing and carbonation process takes a little practice, but once you've mastered it, it's not too bad (and is the same for these as the available soda flavors).
1919 Pale Rail Ale is a blend of mild and aromatic malts and Cascade hops that delivers a complex, well-balanced, craft styled brew. Its initial taste is that of a sweeter, malty ale with a sharp (not overpowering) snap of hops. I noted slight, flowery nuances of vanilla, cardamom, and coriander in the aftertaste.
It's really quite delicious and refreshing when made with (filtered) cold spring water, and compares to commercial or boutique brands quite favorably. Different, slightly smokey flavor elements are present when this mix is made with warmer water.
Black Hops iPA is crafted using generous portions of Cascade hops combined with a bold blend of dark, roasted malts to create a smooth yet robust dark brew. This is NOT a typical stout or porter, but more of a tribute to those styles with a heavy dose of hops.
In the tradition of India Pale Ales, this iPA is big — in a surprising combination of flavors. Dark, smokey, roasted, and sweet elements are offset by a slightly bitter aftertaste not unlike northwestern IPA's. This was a pleasant surprise, and again, presents different flavor components with different water temperatures.
Now onto the mixing process: Same for either brew (and sodas) and takes only about 5 minutes.
1) Open the bottle and remove the Carbonator cup from the cap. Add a few ounces of water to the bottle, replace the cap (not Carbonator cup) and invert the bottle. Open and close the lever on the cap to half way (45 degrees) 6-10 times until a little fluid seeps out. This measures the correct amount of fluid into a small reservoir in the cap for the CO2 activator packet. Uncap and add water to the bottle, just below the 16oz mark.
2) Open the Concentrated syrup and add the contents of the pouch (in your choice of flavor) to the pint of water, rolling the packet like and energy gel pouch or toothpaste. Gently swirl the container to mix. 
3) Open and pour in the activator pack into the carbonator cup. Fit that cup tightly back onto the underside of the cap. 
4) Recap the bottle, lift the lever 6-10 times to seep the reserved liquid into the activator powders. Lock the lever down and then shake back and fourth HORIZONTALLY (avoid inverting or shaking the bottle up and down) for about two minutes.
5) Here's where I go rogue and stray from instructions. After carbonation and mixing, I let the bottle sit for about a minute with the carbonator lever half open (*45 degrees*). This allows enough pressurized CO2 to dissipate so that the brew remains nicely carbonated and ends up in you...instead of all over you! 
Then open the bottle, and enjoy the fresh taste of your own craft brewing...wherever your adventures take you!
Aug. 2015 Update - New Flavor!! - American Logger - The Lumberjack of beers!
They've done it again. This nicely hopped, flavorful beverage is an excellent addition to the originals. I found it to carbonate a little bit better, and enjoyed several with some thru-hikers on the Appalachian Trail. Traveler, Spitz and "Mike"...if you read this, it was great meeting you all and talking around the fire.
My hope is that Pat's Backcountry Beverages will continue to bring us more variety!

This is touted on their WEBSITE as:
"the most environmentally-responsible carbonated beverage system on earth! This awesome addition to your gear list is engineered with an emphasis on rugged durability and really is first of it's kind - fun. Basically, it's your standard, everyday water bottle (yawn). However, when you decide to kick it into high gear and unleash the technology hiding under its cap, you get a burst of refreshing carbonation to energize any beverage of your choice. So no matter how far your wanderlust leads you down the trail, you can still enjoy a crisp, carbonated beverage anywhere on the planet."
Check out their other soda flavors too.
Cheers!

TRAILSPACE STAFF Thanks for reviewing the adult brews, NJHiker. 2 years ago









NJHiker
Thanks Alicia...this was my birthday present to me! I figured it was worth trying...and I was spot on! While these are pretty good, I look forward to more flavors. 2 years ago









FromSagetoSnow
Has anyone just eaten the concentrate, kinda like energy goo?  Would that just be gross or scathingly brilliant and much more efficient?  I'm willing to try it 2 years ago









NJHiker
Jeff, it's not for the faint of heart (or palette). The undiluted concentrate won't give you any different results(ie: buzz) other than tasting rather...um...bad. These are beverages for a reason. Nothing wrong with hydrating after a hike...but if you're willing to try, I DOUBLE DAWG DARE YOU (and please, post your results - I could use the laugh) 2 years ago

								Sturdy pack with amazing ventilation and many perks. From the built in rain cover to the easy access sections you can't go wrong with this model. Hydration bag ready - 2 water bottle compartments - great for Florida summer backpacking! This pack comes in at just over 2 lbs. I needed something smaller for day/overnight hikes as my Deva 60 was just too much of a pack for these trips. Fits my petite (short person) frame very well and is designed specifically for women. Waist belt fits where it should…				Full review


				JanSport Alaska 115			


								Great heavy duty pack. Perfect for heavy loads/hunting big game. It fits more weight than you can carry. I love this pack.  I have about a thousand miles on it, it fits elk quarters perfectly, and would buy another in a heartbeat if I could find one, as it is starting to show wear.  The buckle finally broke with a 200+ pound load of meat last season, and the waterproofing is all but gone on the inside.  This is a TOUGH pack, zippers still going strong.  I acquired it at a garage sale about…				Full review

								Ultra light weight coffee in the back country that tastes better than Starbucks. Buy at any local Trader Joes. Pack in as many as you think you'd drink, they're ultralight.  Boil 2 cups of water your favorite way. The waterproof packets are filled with ground coffee. The container has a built-in filtration system. Open the "ziplock" style top. Slowly add water. The side tells you how much to add Mild to Strong. Let sit and cool down. If I'm near water I set mine in a stream for a min. Break off…				Full review


				  Maurice Sporting Goods Air Horn			


								Indispensable manually operated bear alert horn that does not run on compressed (expensive canned) air. Reusable, reliable, reasonable cost and VERY loud. Packs small and lightweight. Purchased (#SL57223) from Amazon for $15.00 (see attached ad) awhile back for smaller backwoods hikes in Northern Wisconsin. We've used these in Wisc. for years without 'close encounters'. We are now in Glacier Park and would not go ANYWHERE in Glacier (even to heavily peopled areas like the NPS Headquarters /campgrounds…				Full review


				Seek Outside Unaweep 6300			


								This bag is designed as a load hauler for backcountry big game hunting, so large, heavy loads are not an issue. Made to be comfortable with 100 lbs or more, smaller loads ride very well on or off trail. Great for cold weather gear, expedition style multi-week food bags, and can be used to carry hard to pack loads outside the bag. Note: Seek Outside is constantly updating their product lines, adding and removing features as they react to customer input. This review is for a pack I had made to order…				Full review

				Good To-Go Granola			


								Delicious, nutritious meal. Much better tasting than other granola varieties. The pros of taste, prep ease, and nutrition far outweigh any cons. I received this product as a gift for being a past Reviewer of the Month at Trailspace. Taste: This was easily the best tasting prepackaged breakfast I've had to date. It was sweet, nutty, fruity, and hearty all at the same time. The ingredients combined perfectly for my palate. A few of the ingredients are figs, blueberries, almonds, oars, and flax seed.				Full review


				Trailfoody The Wanderer			


								The Trailfoody subscription services provides a monthly mailing of a variety of healthy, minimally process snacks. Trailfoody is a subscription service that provides a variety of healthy, flavorful snacks to fuel outdoor recreation whether it’s hiking, skiing, paddling, fishing, or other fun. It’s like a Christmas stocking full of treats every couple of weeks. There are different subscription levels that dictate the time interval between deliveries. I got to sample Trailfoody treats that arrived…				Full review


				Mountain House Just In Case 5-Day Kit			


								I first used the product because it was an easy way to get meals on the trail while backpacking. Now, I continue to use them because of the taste and amazing shelf life! As a Ranger with TheDyrt, I sometimes get the chance to try out different products and recently had the opportunity to try out some more Mountain House meals. I've used these freeze dried meals before, and was excited to get some more in to my backpacking closet. When I first started backpacking about 10 years ago I ran to these…				Full review


				Packit Gourmet Trailside Black Bean and Cheese Burrito			


								Another affordable, filling, easy to make meal from Packit Gourmet. I haven't had a single thing from them that I've been disappointed with. Always full of flavor without the giant dose of sodium like many competitors. Taste: I was expecting a fairly bland burrito but was pleasantly surprised to find some good flavors hiding inside. Lots of onion, cumin, and garlic pop. I chose to heat it up with some hot sauce I brought along as well as a small packet of sour cream. This was a nice change from…				Full review


				Packit Gourmet Texas State Fair Chili			


								This is a staple in my pack now for over a year—hydrates well, tastes almost as good as home cooked chili, and fills the corners without leaving me overstuffed. I haven't found a better dinner entree, except packing in fresh food. I finally decided to review what I consider to be one of the best prepackaged dehydrated meals on the market: Packit Gourmet's Texas State Fair Chili (TSFC from here on). TSFC is easy to prepare, and provides good, satisfying taste and nutrition on the trail. The natural…				Full review


				Good To-Go Oatmeal			


								Yummy and different take on a classic backcountry breakfast. We have all eaten our share of oatmeal breakfasts in the backcountry. Many opt for the grocery store bought packets, which aren't necessarily great, and are usually loaded with sugar, and not much else. I have been in the habit of creating my own ziploc oatmeal packets with oats, nuts, cranberries, raisins, and brown sugar, which is decent, but not perfect. Good To-Go has had great success with their tasty dinners, and steps into the breakfast…				Full review


				Mountain House Lasagna with Meat Sauce Pro-Pak			


								Easy to make and a very tasty option for long hikes and backpacking trips. It is great because it saves room and weight in your pack. This is a great option for long backpacking trips or even quick camping trips. I got several different entrees of Mountain House meals to test as a Ranger for The Dyrt. It was easy to make and tasted great. I like the Pro-Pak versions. They seem a little light and take up less space. I tried this meal out at a campground in Michigan at Ludington State Park. It is…				Full review


				Alpine Start Original Blend Instant Coffee			


								If you’re looking for instant coffee you’ll do well finding Alpine Start. Upmarket of center, Alpine Start offers a boldness, a complexity of flavor not often found outside of the fresh-ground-and-lovingly-brewed set. For those not married to the traditional method of coffee brewing, Alpine Start also allows a greatly reduced base weight and packed size in comparison. Best For: Well, you know—alpinists, apparently. Fast-packers, thru-hikers, college students, and commuters, also. All those…				Full review

Recent Drink Reviews

				Hammer Nutrition Endurolytes Fizz Tube			


								Hammer Fizz is my go-to ingredient in my bottles. Replenishes electrolytes and helps prevent cramps. I give it 4 stars. If the taste was completely non-bitter, it would be 5 stars. Highly recommended. I am a road cyclist, and Hammer Fizz has become the primary ingredient in my water bottles. For many years I have used maltodextrin (et al)-based drink mix. No matter how I prepared them, even combining several mixes, I found them either too light or too syrupy.  For long rides here in the Northeast…				Full review


				Hammer Nutrition Perpetuem			


								This has been my secret to sustained energy and endurance on very long hikes and bike rides. It has everything you need to not "hit the wall" in your last mile! I swear by it! I have tried almost every sports drink on the market and this still tops out at #1 for me. Single serving packages seen here. This is marketed as a fuel source for extreme athletes and a product that will utilize fat storage for energy sparing the muscles of increased rate of atrophy. I have used this and other Hammer products…				Full review


				Packit Gourmet Mango-Kale Jump-Start Smoothie			


								Despite ALL of the rest of their products being THE BEST, this one's a swing and a miss. I FINALLY FOUND IT!!! A Packit Gourmet product that I don't love... Just gotta say that I really miss the "Eat a Peach Fruit Smoothie". The berry and tropical are BOTH GREAT, but that peach smoothie was my favorite. One of these fruit smoothies, a Clif bar (or equivalent), and a cup of coffee in the morning and I'm ready for the trail.   And now, as the late, great Paul Harvey would say, the rest of the story...				Full review


				  Black Box Cabernet Sauvignon 500ml			


								A delicate complex vintage with just a hint of vinegar and preservatives. Plus, it packs great. Black Box has a delectable assortment of 500 ml box wines. You can usually find them at the Walgreens. I have never had one leak in my pack. The taste is always the same, which is good. Would hate to hike in and find out my wine has gone bad. Haven't had one freeze on me yet, either, down to about 20 degrees. Here is a picture of a hotel party just off trail somewhere: It. Is. On! Don't have any pictures…				Full review


				Vitalyte Electrolyte Replacement Drink Mix			


								Grape has become the house favorite over the years. Vitalyte is nether an energy drink or a source of calories, it is an electrolyte replacement and best "utliliized" to prevent and recover from dehydration. We have been drinking Vitalyte for over twenty (20) years (we still call it Gookinaid!) there is always a two litre container in our fridge and a second container in the summer. I sold it in my bicycle shoppe for twenty years. We have tried all the flavors, Orange, Fruit Punch, Lemon and *No…				Full review


				  Ambronite			


								IN PROGRESS - NOT FINAL Ambronite; the soylent based super-meal that can run a person to the next meal or through that next workout and is drunken from a bottle. The Drink is composed of all organic and whole foods resourced and developed into Ambronite in Finland. The mix is considered all vegan and nutritious, and on the companies website it claims to be a meal substitute and supplement that can be made by the busiest silicon valley for weeks at a time, to the occasional trail snack for the weekend…				Full review


				  Alacer Emergen-C			


								Who could have guessed that this well known Vitamin C source and cold remedy would make a super electrolyte and restorative drink for hikers? I've taken this on and off for decades as a pick-me-up to ward off getting sick when run down. It is sold as an immune system builder. After running out of our standard electrolyte mix for bicycling that we had been using up for hiking, I tried this by chance. And I quickly found that it worked even better for me than just electrolytes for energy recovery…				Full review


				  Zipfizz			


								The stuff works! Sustained energy quickly from healthy ingredients. Easy to carry and mix. Tastes great, in choice of flavors, in multiflavor packs, that seem to be expanding. I gave this 5-star product 4.5 stars, because I would prefer to have less throw away plastic in the packaging. Also I want potential users to help ensure that they use any stimulant wisely. If too much taken or taken too late, spontaneous circle walking and/or a sleepless night(s) might occur. What a single dose looks like. …				Full review


				Skratch Labs Exercise Hydration Mix			


								An excellent hydration mix that tastes great, supplies balanced electrolytes, and won't slow you down. Skratch Labs hydration mix started life in the professional cycling peloton. Alan Lim was the nutritionist for several pro cycling teams including BMC, Garmin, and Radio Shack, and had received many complaints about the electrolyte drinks that riders had to use. They complained about rotten taste, too much sugar, and the tendency for it to sit in the "bottom of your gut." So he developed this drink…				Full review

Description

 

        When you've hiked all the way to a beautiful campsite and you're all settled in under a clear blue sky, there's only one thing that could make the scene even better: a refreshing beer or soda in hand. Unfortunately, you left all of that stuff in the car because you don't want to lug the heavy cans all the way to your campsite. What if there was another way? That's the question that Patrick Tatera asked back in 1997, and now his vision has finally come to fruition: a portable carbonating system that you can use to make beer and soda, anytime, anywhere.     

Making beer from a powder doesn't sound very appetizing, but Pat's Backcountry Beer isn't just beer that is made and then has its water removed. Thieir modern process (patent pending) allows them to start with almost no water, and carefully control the environment of the fermentation. The result… concentrated beer with all the same great taste you’re used to in a premium micro brew. All you do is add water, carbonate, and enjoy.  Unfortunately, we can't sell the beer concentrate at Outdoor Gear Exchange, because we don't have a liquor license. We do carry various flavors of Pat's Soda, so grab the carbonator system, some soda, and you're ready for backcountry refreshment!

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
