Information on Patents




What is a Patent Search?
A patent search is performed to identify the most relevant existing and published U.S. Patents to your invention (referred to as “prior art”). Typically, searches are conducted in the early stages of the application process by an independent patent search firm.
Who should conduct a patent search?
Generally, a patent search should be conducted by a professional patent search firm or registered patent attorney / agent who understands “class and subclass” patent searching, as well as statutory requirements for patentability. All InventionHome patent searches are conducted by independent patent attorneys or agents.


Why is a Patent Search important?
A patent search of all existing U.S. Patents can provide excellent information to help an inventor make a decision on whether or not to move forward with an idea. The search is primarily focused on determining whether a patent on a similar invention has already been issued or published with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Although patent searching is a valuable step in the process, it is important to understand that it can never guarantee with certainty that your invention will or will not be approved by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

Information on Provisional Patents




What is a Provisional Patent Application (PPA)?
 A Provisional Patent Application (PPA) is a quick, easy and cost-effective way to get your invention on file with the US Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO). A PPA enables you to establish a priority filing date for your patent, and provides 12 months of protection to further develop, market, or prepare a Utility Application. Once you file a PPA, a 12-month clock starts in which time a non-provisional patent application must be filed before the end of the 12-month provisional application period. A provisional application is not examined by the USPTO and does not automatically convert to a non-provisional patent.
How does InventionHome simplify the application process?
InventionHome uses a network of highly qualified patent attorneys and agents to assist our clients in filing Provisional Patent Applications at the lowest possible cost. Our streamlined system allows us to compile, edit and communicate invention information between inventors and patent attorneys / agents. Therefore we can offer a cost-effective service for preparing and filing Provisional Patent Applications.


What is a non-provisional patent?
The non-provisional patent is what is traditionally thought of as the “full” patent. It can be of either a “utility” or a “design” variety, and it establishes the filing date and begins the USPTO’s patent review process. It is the only type of application that will result in the issuance of a patent, whereas, a provisional patent application acts as a placeholder for the priority date and allows you to retain “patent pending” status for your invention.
Why do you need a patent in the first place?
Patents protect your idea for a limited amount of time, and prevent others from copying, making and selling your idea as their own. The patent gives you the right to make, use and sell your invention and essentially provides you with a competitive advantage or monopoly on your invention for the length of the patent term. If you do not have patent protection, your idea or invention can be quickly replicated and reproduced, without your consent. When a company licenses an invention, they are typically licensing the patent rights, not the invention itself.

Information on Patents




What is a Patent Search?
A patent search is performed to identify the most relevant existing and published U.S. Patents to your invention (referred to as “prior art”). Typically, searches are conducted in the early stages of the application process by an independent patent search firm.
Who should conduct a patent search?
Generally, a patent search should be conducted by a professional patent search firm or registered patent attorney / agent who understands “class and subclass” patent searching, as well as statutory requirements for patentability. All InventionHome patent searches are conducted by independent patent attorneys or agents.


Why is a Patent Search important?
A patent search of all existing U.S. Patents can provide excellent information to help an inventor make a decision on whether or not to move forward with an idea. The search is primarily focused on determining whether a patent on a similar invention has already been issued or published with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Although patent searching is a valuable step in the process, it is important to understand that it can never guarantee with certainty that your invention will or will not be approved by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

Information on Provisional Patents




What is a Provisional Patent Application (PPA)?
 A Provisional Patent Application (PPA) is a quick, easy and cost-effective way to get your invention on file with the US Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO). A PPA enables you to establish a priority filing date for your patent, and provides 12 months of protection to further develop, market, or prepare a Utility Application. Once you file a PPA, a 12-month clock starts in which time a non-provisional patent application must be filed before the end of the 12-month provisional application period. A provisional application is not examined by the USPTO and does not automatically convert to a non-provisional patent.
How does InventionHome simplify the application process?
InventionHome uses a network of highly qualified patent attorneys and agents to assist our clients in filing Provisional Patent Applications at the lowest possible cost. Our streamlined system allows us to compile, edit and communicate invention information between inventors and patent attorneys / agents. Therefore we can offer a cost-effective service for preparing and filing Provisional Patent Applications.


What is a non-provisional patent?
The non-provisional patent is what is traditionally thought of as the “full” patent. It can be of either a “utility” or a “design” variety, and it establishes the filing date and begins the USPTO’s patent review process. It is the only type of application that will result in the issuance of a patent, whereas, a provisional patent application acts as a placeholder for the priority date and allows you to retain “patent pending” status for your invention.
Why do you need a patent in the first place?
Patents protect your idea for a limited amount of time, and prevent others from copying, making and selling your idea as their own. The patent gives you the right to make, use and sell your invention and essentially provides you with a competitive advantage or monopoly on your invention for the length of the patent term. If you do not have patent protection, your idea or invention can be quickly replicated and reproduced, without your consent. When a company licenses an invention, they are typically licensing the patent rights, not the invention itself.
