Luxor Capital Group issues open letter to shareholders of Crocodile Gold

Feb 16, 2012, 10:22 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Luxor Capital Group, LP 











 
















































 

 




















 



NEW YORK, Feb. 16, 2012 /PRNewswire/ - Luxor Capital Group, LP ("Luxor"), a
 U.S.-based investment fund manager, has issued the following open
 letter to shareholders of Crocodile Gold Corp. ("Crocodile Gold").


To the shareholders of Crocodile Gold Corp.:


On February 7, 2012, we acquired, through a formal take-over bid,
 approximately 54% of the outstanding common shares of Crocodile Gold. 
 These acquired shares, when added to our existing position prior to the
 bid, leave us controlling approximately 69.5% of the issued and
 outstanding common shares of Crocodile Gold.  I write this letter to
 address some of the questions our fellow shareholders have asked
 Crocodile Gold's management with respect to Luxor's role within the
 company and our intentions now that Luxor (together with its
 affiliates) is the controlling shareholder of Crocodile Gold.


Why did Luxor launch a formal take-over bid for Crocodile Gold shares?


The combination of our common stock and warrants put our share ownership
 in Crocodile Gold at 19.9% prior to the tender.  With our stock and
 warrant position at this level, we were unable, as a practical matter
 under Canadian securities laws, to materially increase our position in
 Crocodile Gold without making a formal take-over bid to all
 shareholders.  The take-over bid process was not an indictment of
 existing management or the Board of Directors; rather it was the best
 available means for us to acquire significantly more shares of
 Crocodile Gold.


Why did Luxor bid for only 85% of Crocodile Gold?


Retaining a listing was (and is) an important requirement for us. 
 Crocodile Gold will require additional capital in 2012, and having
 access to the listed equity markets will help facilitate the raising of
 that capital should alternate forms of financing not avail themselves. 
 In addition, should Crocodile Gold consider acquisitions in the future,
 a liquid and easily-valued currency will help enable those
 acquisitions.  Finally, our ultimate exit envisions a potential
 refloating of our shares in the public markets at a materially higher
 share price, making retaining the listing an important, ongoing
 requirement for us.


Will Luxor seek to take the remaining minority stake private at some
 point?


#  As mentioned above, retaining a listing requirement is critical to
 us.  Even if we were so inclined to take the company private (and we
 aren't), the process of doing so would require, at minimum, approval by
 a "majority of the minority shareholders" (i.e., a majority of
 non-Luxor shareholders would have to agree to this).


How does Luxor view the minority shareholders?


We view minority shareholders as equal partners with goals identical to
 our own - maximizing per-share, shareholder wealth.  As previously
 mentioned, Luxor's ultimate exit from Crocodile Gold is most likely a
 refloating of our shares in the marketplace. To effect this strategy,
 it will be critical to ensure the stock price accurately reflects the
 fair value of the company.  The only way to do this is to respect all
 shareholders, maintain openness with the shareholder base and, whenever
 possible, align Luxor's incentives with minority shareholder
 incentives.


How will Luxor communicate with shareholders going forward?


Most likely we won't.  This will probably be our only formal
 communication with shareholders.  We are however, asking the company to
 significantly increase its transparency to shareholders, a suggestion
 warmly embraced by the company's CEO, Chantal Lavoie.  We are working
 with the company on the format for a monthly update to be publicly
 released to all shareholders on the same day of every month.  We hope
 that good news or bad, the increased transparency will allow
 shareholders to better understand the operations of Crocodile Gold and
 at the same time attract new shareholders to our story.


What is Luxor's plan for management and the Board?


We are pleased to report that all senior management of Crocodile Gold
 have agreed to new contracts with the company, including Mr. Lavoie,
 who signed a committed contract for 2.5 years on February 8, 2012. 
 Crocodile Gold is fortunate to be under the leadership of someone with
 Chantal's significant experience and strength.  We look forward to
 working with him over the coming years.  The Board, in accordance with
 the support agreement entered into in connection with the take-over
 bid, will initially be constituted as follows: Chantal Lavoie, two
 independent, continuing Board members and two appointees designated by
 Luxor.  We expect the two appointees to be designated by Luxor will be
 identified by us and appointed by the Board by the end of the month.


What is the ongoing relationship with Forbes & Manhattan?


Forbes continues to provide back office, financial and technical support
 for Crocodile Gold.  We expect the company will negotiate a transition
 services agreement with Forbes that will allow Crocodile Gold some time
 to replicate those services in-house.  Forbes also provides us access
 to technical support and industry knowledge not obtainable otherwise by
 a company of Crocodile Gold's size.


* * * *


I hope this addressed some of the concerns of current shareholders.  We
 are excited by the prospects of Crocodile Gold, and we hope you are as
 well. I will make myself available to shareholders at the company's
 next annual meeting, but ask that in the meantime shareholders address
 any questions or comments to the company's investor relations
 department and not Luxor.


I look forward to working together with the Crocodile Gold team and
 hopefully increasing shareholder wealth together with each of you.


Respectfully yours,


Michael Conboy
Luxor Capital Group, LP


Certain statements in the news release and schedule constitute
 forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable Canadian
 securities laws and are prospective in nature. Forward-looking
 information is not based on historical facts, but rather on current
 expectations and projections about future events, and is therefore
 subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to
 differ materially from the future results expressed or implied by the
 forward-looking information. Forward-looking information generally can
 be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as "may",
 "should", "will", "could", "intend", "estimate", "plan", "anticipate",
 "expect", "believe" or "continue", or grammatical variations thereof.
 Such statements are qualified in their entirety by the inherent risks
 and uncertainties surrounding future expectations. Important factors
 that could cause actual results to differ materially from the
 expectations of Luxor include, among other things, general business and
 economic conditions globally or in particular geographic regions in
 which Crocodile Gold and its subsidiaries conduct business, the
 inability to attract and retain qualified employees, competition,
 regionally and internationally, changes in law, disruptions in business
 operations due to reorganization activities, and interest rate and
 foreign currency fluctuations. Such forward-looking information should
 therefore be construed in light of such factors, and Luxor is not under
 any obligation, and expressly disclaims any intention or obligation, to
 update or revise any forward-looking information, whether as a result
 of new information, future events or otherwise.
