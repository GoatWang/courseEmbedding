            Product Liability
The lawyers in the Product Liability Group focus on protecting the integrity of manufactured products, which are the life blood of our economy. Questions of potential liability involve issues such as state-of-the-art, knowledge of danger, prior injuries, testing, inspections, warnings, labels, marketing literature, recommended pre- and post-accident changes, quality control, consumer expectation, and risk-versus-utility analysis.
Our products lawyers represent manufacturers, distributors and retailers. They have tried cases involving products ranging from heavy industrial equipment to the most common household appliances.
In all cases, the first objective in handling an alleged product defect is to establish close client contact and to become familiar with the product and its manufacturer. When justified, our product lawyers visit the manufacturing facility and solicit clear explanations by in-house personnel as to the rationale for any design, warning, etc. Our lawyers always work closely with risk managers and corporate counsel to identify the company representative who will best meet the needs of the particular case and, when necessary, to reach mutual agreement on the best available outside experts.
The lawyers in the Product Liability Practice Group provide an objective evaluation of the case at the earliest possible time and, in conjunction with corporate counsel or risk managers, set up plans for an aggressive, innovative defense and prepare a realistic defense budget. We are particularly alert, during the discovery phase of a case, for any issues that may be of national significance to the client or that may enable the client to avoid future litigation.
All the lawyers in this group have been and will continue to be instrumental in reforming product liability law through their work in organizations such as the International Association of Defense Counsel, the Defense Research Institute and various tort reform committees.

Position Yourself to Experience Holy Spirit Outpouring!
Ask the LORD for rainIn the time of the latter rain. (Zechariah 10:1)
God is pouring out His Spirit and revival rain is falling across the Earth. How should you respond? Ask for more!
How can revival impact your everyday life? Maybe you've thought revival is for "super-charged" Christians-not for everyday people going through everyday life. Wrong. God wants your everyday to be overflowing with Holy Spirit power.Do you feel like there is more to being a Christ-follower than rhetoric, rules and regulations? The truth is, you were created for a dynamic relationship with the living God. Don't settle for scattered showers when there is a great outpouring available.
God is seeking ready ground to pour out His revival rain on.

Product Description
James T.Brown – The Handbook of Program Management

 
As a program manager, you are first and foremost a leader–one who must create, manage, and continually improve a culture that ensures the success of your project managers. Establishing and maintaining processes that greatly reduce the chances of project failure is paramount to achieving the competitive edge your company seeks.
The Handbook of Program Management gives program managers at all levels the techniques to put such processes in place as well as consistently integrate new technology and new people into these processes, thus producing superior products and services. Dr. James Brown, an internationally recognized authority in program and project management, explains how to strike a crucial balance between operations and project implementations-the precise point where you must nurture repeatable success.
Outlining the differences between the roles of program and project managers, Dr. Brown provides proven principles for establishing a successful program management culture that is supported by enthusiastic personnel and stakeholders. He shows you how to develop the attributes of an effective program manager, from having a vision and strategy for long-term improvement to assessing people and building relationships to analyzing a myriad of means for accomplishing program objectives. You’ll see how to

Readily adapt to changing business conditions and turn chaos into clarity
Mentor and coach project managers in terms of stakeholder management
Make strategic program process decisions that positively impact your culture
Build strong teams on multiple levels
Plan an effective program execution
Manage risk in an environment of uncertainty

You’ll also learn the keys to proper portfolio management and how to capitalize on positive program outcomes. Nowhere else will you find such comprehensive, authoritative information on meeting the new standards of program management–Dr. Brown’s The Handbook of Project Management is the definitive resource.

History[edit]
H. Winslow & Company[edit]




Lewis T. Brown



William Wentworth Brown




In 1852, a group of Portland, Maine, businessmen, John B. Brown, Josiah S. Little, Nathan Winslow, and Hezekiah Winslow, purchased and built a large sawmill on the property known as the "Thomas Green Privilege" at the head of Berlin Falls in Berlin, New Hampshire. In 1854, they expanded their operations by constructing the H. Winslow & Company branch railway to the Grand Trunk Railway, and, in 1858, they built a dam and a gristmill.
Berlin Mills Company[edit]

By 1866, John Little had died, and the Winslows had sold their interests in the H. Winslow & Company. A new partnership was formed and a new name chosen, the Berlin Mills Company.[2] In 1868, William Wentworth Brown and Lewis T. Brown purchased a controlling interest in the company and remodeled their sawmill, making it even larger than before. W. W. Brown later purchased the stock owned by Lewis T. Brown in the 1880s, acquiring complete control of the company.
Brown Company[edit]

The company changed its name again in 1917 during World War I to the Brown Company. The Brown family owned land that spanned from Canada to Florida, which they used for logging.[3] In the 1940s the Brown Company went through bankruptcy and never recovered. In 1954, European business began to purchase large amounts of stock in the company, therefore the Brown Company began to buy European businesses in England, Wales, and Italy.[4] The closing of the company came in the 1980s, when the Brown Company was bought out by the James River Corporation. The paper mills stayed in Berlin under various companies until closing in 2006. The other plant in Gorham is now operated under the name of Gorham Paper and Tissue, which is managed by Patriarch Partners.[5]

Beyond Brown Paper[edit]
In the 1970s, Bill Taylor, associate professor of history at Plymouth State University, arranged for 11,000 photographs taken by the Brown Company photographers from 1870–1965 to be transferred to the said university for archival usage.[6] In 2006, images were scanned, and the Beyond Brown Paper website was formed.[7] In September 2012, a partnership between Historic New England, the Berlin and Coos County Historical Society, Timberlane Regional High School, and Plymouth State University created an award-winning documentary called At the River’s Edge: An Oral History of Berlin, New Hampshire.[8]
Scientific research[edit]
During the early 1900s, the Brown Company created a new department known as "research and development" and constructed a building for this to take place. In 1954, there were over 150 projects that were kept recorded in their books.[9] The objective for this new department was to "demonstrate that the future of the Brown Company didn't lie in the achievements of the past, but in the development of products and process that were yet to come."[10]
Some products that were the result of the R&D department were Bermico piping, Cellulose floc, and Nibroc towels. In January 1927, work began in the Everglades in Florida by Dr. R.V. Allison to work on soil problems and to reclaim lands that were taken by two railroads.[11] At its peak, the Brown Company's R&D department held over 100 scientists and eventually earned 600 U.S. patents.[12]
Inventions and products[edit]

H. Winslow & Company[edit]

William Wentworth Brown




In 1852, a group of Portland, Maine, businessmen, John B. Brown, Josiah S. Little, Nathan Winslow, and Hezekiah Winslow, purchased and built a large sawmill on the property known as the "Thomas Green Privilege" at the head of Berlin Falls in Berlin, New Hampshire. In 1854, they expanded their operations by constructing the H. Winslow & Company branch railway to the Grand Trunk Railway, and, in 1858, they built a dam and a gristmill.

History[edit]
H. Winslow & Company[edit]




Lewis T. Brown



William Wentworth Brown




In 1852, a group of Portland, Maine, businessmen, John B. Brown, Josiah S. Little, Nathan Winslow, and Hezekiah Winslow, purchased and built a large sawmill on the property known as the "Thomas Green Privilege" at the head of Berlin Falls in Berlin, New Hampshire. In 1854, they expanded their operations by constructing the H. Winslow & Company branch railway to the Grand Trunk Railway, and, in 1858, they built a dam and a gristmill.
Berlin Mills Company[edit]

By 1866, John Little had died, and the Winslows had sold their interests in the H. Winslow & Company. A new partnership was formed and a new name chosen, the Berlin Mills Company.[2] In 1868, William Wentworth Brown and Lewis T. Brown purchased a controlling interest in the company and remodeled their sawmill, making it even larger than before. W. W. Brown later purchased the stock owned by Lewis T. Brown in the 1880s, acquiring complete control of the company.
Brown Company[edit]

The company changed its name again in 1917 during World War I to the Brown Company. The Brown family owned land that spanned from Canada to Florida, which they used for logging.[3] In the 1940s the Brown Company went through bankruptcy and never recovered. In 1954, European business began to purchase large amounts of stock in the company, therefore the Brown Company began to buy European businesses in England, Wales, and Italy.[4] The closing of the company came in the 1980s, when the Brown Company was bought out by the James River Corporation. The paper mills stayed in Berlin under various companies until closing in 2006. The other plant in Gorham is now operated under the name of Gorham Paper and Tissue, which is managed by Patriarch Partners.[5]

Beyond Brown Paper[edit]
In the 1970s, Bill Taylor, associate professor of history at Plymouth State University, arranged for 11,000 photographs taken by the Brown Company photographers from 1870–1965 to be transferred to the said university for archival usage.[6] In 2006, images were scanned, and the Beyond Brown Paper website was formed.[7] In September 2012, a partnership between Historic New England, the Berlin and Coos County Historical Society, Timberlane Regional High School, and Plymouth State University created an award-winning documentary called At the River’s Edge: An Oral History of Berlin, New Hampshire.[8]
Scientific research[edit]
During the early 1900s, the Brown Company created a new department known as "research and development" and constructed a building for this to take place. In 1954, there were over 150 projects that were kept recorded in their books.[9] The objective for this new department was to "demonstrate that the future of the Brown Company didn't lie in the achievements of the past, but in the development of products and process that were yet to come."[10]
Some products that were the result of the R&D department were Bermico piping, Cellulose floc, and Nibroc towels. In January 1927, work began in the Everglades in Florida by Dr. R.V. Allison to work on soil problems and to reclaim lands that were taken by two railroads.[11] At its peak, the Brown Company's R&D department held over 100 scientists and eventually earned 600 U.S. patents.[12]
Inventions and products[edit]




Early paper towels


The following items were created and produced by the Brown Company:

Onco leather – artificial leather used mostly for shoes[13]

Kream Krisp, a substance like Crisco, which led to the lawsuit known as Procter and Gamble vs. the Brown Company[17]
Powder containers used for weapons during World War II[18]
Raw Peanut Oil – cooking oil in which the oil had been extracted from peanuts[19]
Solka Pulp – developed into Solka Floc, which was made into a variety of different substances[20]
Nibroc Paper Towels, developed by William E. Corbin[21]
Peanut Flakes – A type of breakfast cereal[22]

											Insurance Law
										


												As house counsel for a major insurance company, I manage bodily injury insurance defense litigation in connection with seven branch offices in four states (Missouri, Nebraska, Iowa, and Florida) and have had experience in the past with branch offices in a couple of other states as well (Michigan and Ohio). Over the past 15 years I have dealt with many different defense firms and attorneys, but I have encountered none that come close to the competence of Brown & James and none that give me the supreme level of confidence that I enjoy knowing that they are handling a matter.

											Professional Malpractice Law - Defendants
										


												I have worked with Brown & James for almost 29 years, and I have the utmost respect for their capabilities and dedication. I believe the medical malpractice defense attorneys I have worked with are as good as they come.
