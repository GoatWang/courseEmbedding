History[edit]
DST was founded in the 1960s as a subsidiary of Kansas City Southern Industries (KCSI) to track movements on their railroad. KCSI also owned a mutual fund management company and leveraged technology to automate the administration of mutual funds, creating the industry's first online shareholder accounting system.
To handle the growing processing and data storage demands seen in the 1980s, DST built several data centers, including one called Winchester that was built in 1985, which was one of the most sophisticated such centers in the United States at the time.
In the 1990s, DST was spun off as an independent entity from KCSI and began trading on the NYSE in 1995 as NYSE: DST.
In 1990, DST first released the Automated Work Distributor (AWD[3]), a business process management product that has been widely adopted by banks, insurance companies, healthcare companies, brokerages and mutual fund companies looking for a paperless environment.
In 1989, DST acquired a 50% interest in Argus Health Systems, at the time focused on pharmacy benefit administration. On March 31, 2009, DST acquired the remaining equity interest of Argus Health.
In 2005 and 2006, DST acquired CSC's Health Plan Solutions group and Amisys Synertech, Inc,[4] allowing DST to provide claims administration, software applications and business process outsourcing (BPO) solutions. This became the newly established DST Health Solutions, a sister company to Argus Health.
In 1991, DST created a wholly owned subsidiary eventually known as DST Customer Communications (formerly DST Output) to handle the design, printing, sorting, mailing and electronic presentment of the voluminous output of its product management systems.
In July 2016, DST sold their North American Customer Communications business to Broadridge Financial Solutions.
Expansion, Partnerships & Investments[edit]
Since 1973, DST has offered many services through substantial joint venture enterprises with State Street Corporation. DST and State Street joint venture activities now include significant international operations.
In 1992, DST formed International Financial Data Systems (IFDS), UK, as a joint venture with State Street Corporation. The UK venture later expanded to locations in Germany and Ireland to provide financial service recordkeeping services for its clients.
In 2001, IFDS combined with International Financial Data Systems (Canada) Ltd.
In 2008, Bluedoor Technologies, a provider of software solutions for participant accounting for the superannuation markets in Australia, was acquired.[13] DST Retirement Solutions was formally established that year.
In 2011, UK-based Lateral Group was acquired to create what is now called DST Applied Analytics. That same year, DST Brokerage Solutions and DST Market Services were established. Also acquired in 2011 was ALPS Holdings, Inc. (ALPS), a Denver-based provider of servicing and asset gathering solutions to the asset management industry. ALPS began in 1991 and became the first service providers of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) beginning in 1995. In 2007, ALPS expanded their capabilities to asset management, specializing in satellite and alternative investment strategies.
DST acquired New York-based kasina LLC in January 2015. kasina is a strategic advisory firm to the asset management industry and provides business analytics, consulting and research to asset managers. DST kasina is now part of DST Distribution Services.
In July 2015, DST acquired Wealth Management Systems Inc. (WMSI), a leading provider of technology-based rollover services in the retirement industry offering wealth management solutions. WMSI is now part of DST Retirement Solutions.
February 24, 2016, DST completed an acquisition of alternative fund service provider Kaufman Rossin Fund Services (KRFS).[5] KRFS is a full-service provider of specialized administration services to the global financial community and has expertise in the hedge fund business. KRFS is part of the asset servicing division of ALPS.
March 27, 2017, DST to acquire remaining interest in Joint Ventures, Boston Financial Data Services, Inc. (BFDS) and International Financial Data Services Limited ("IFDS U.K."), from State Street Corporation.[6]
May 7, 2017, DST Systems reports new $300 MLN share repurchase program.[7]

History[edit]
DST was founded in the 1960s as a subsidiary of Kansas City Southern Industries (KCSI) to track movements on their railroad. KCSI also owned a mutual fund management company and leveraged technology to automate the administration of mutual funds, creating the industry's first online shareholder accounting system.
To handle the growing processing and data storage demands seen in the 1980s, DST built several data centers, including one called Winchester that was built in 1985, which was one of the most sophisticated such centers in the United States at the time.
In the 1990s, DST was spun off as an independent entity from KCSI and began trading on the NYSE in 1995 as NYSE: DST.
In 1990, DST first released the Automated Work Distributor (AWD[3]), a business process management product that has been widely adopted by banks, insurance companies, healthcare companies, brokerages and mutual fund companies looking for a paperless environment.
In 1989, DST acquired a 50% interest in Argus Health Systems, at the time focused on pharmacy benefit administration. On March 31, 2009, DST acquired the remaining equity interest of Argus Health.
In 2005 and 2006, DST acquired CSC's Health Plan Solutions group and Amisys Synertech, Inc,[4] allowing DST to provide claims administration, software applications and business process outsourcing (BPO) solutions. This became the newly established DST Health Solutions, a sister company to Argus Health.
In 1991, DST created a wholly owned subsidiary eventually known as DST Customer Communications (formerly DST Output) to handle the design, printing, sorting, mailing and electronic presentment of the voluminous output of its product management systems.
In July 2016, DST sold their North American Customer Communications business to Broadridge Financial Solutions.
Expansion, Partnerships & Investments[edit]
Since 1973, DST has offered many services through substantial joint venture enterprises with State Street Corporation. DST and State Street joint venture activities now include significant international operations.
In 1992, DST formed International Financial Data Systems (IFDS), UK, as a joint venture with State Street Corporation. The UK venture later expanded to locations in Germany and Ireland to provide financial service recordkeeping services for its clients.
In 2001, IFDS combined with International Financial Data Systems (Canada) Ltd.
In 2008, Bluedoor Technologies, a provider of software solutions for participant accounting for the superannuation markets in Australia, was acquired.[13] DST Retirement Solutions was formally established that year.
In 2011, UK-based Lateral Group was acquired to create what is now called DST Applied Analytics. That same year, DST Brokerage Solutions and DST Market Services were established. Also acquired in 2011 was ALPS Holdings, Inc. (ALPS), a Denver-based provider of servicing and asset gathering solutions to the asset management industry. ALPS began in 1991 and became the first service providers of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) beginning in 1995. In 2007, ALPS expanded their capabilities to asset management, specializing in satellite and alternative investment strategies.
DST acquired New York-based kasina LLC in January 2015. kasina is a strategic advisory firm to the asset management industry and provides business analytics, consulting and research to asset managers. DST kasina is now part of DST Distribution Services.
In July 2015, DST acquired Wealth Management Systems Inc. (WMSI), a leading provider of technology-based rollover services in the retirement industry offering wealth management solutions. WMSI is now part of DST Retirement Solutions.
February 24, 2016, DST completed an acquisition of alternative fund service provider Kaufman Rossin Fund Services (KRFS).[5] KRFS is a full-service provider of specialized administration services to the global financial community and has expertise in the hedge fund business. KRFS is part of the asset servicing division of ALPS.
March 27, 2017, DST to acquire remaining interest in Joint Ventures, Boston Financial Data Services, Inc. (BFDS) and International Financial Data Services Limited ("IFDS U.K."), from State Street Corporation.[6]
May 7, 2017, DST Systems reports new $300 MLN share repurchase program.[7]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

History[edit]
DST was founded in the 1960s as a subsidiary of Kansas City Southern Industries (KCSI) to track movements on their railroad. KCSI also owned a mutual fund management company and leveraged technology to automate the administration of mutual funds, creating the industry's first online shareholder accounting system.
To handle the growing processing and data storage demands seen in the 1980s, DST built several data centers, including one called Winchester that was built in 1985, which was one of the most sophisticated such centers in the United States at the time.
In the 1990s, DST was spun off as an independent entity from KCSI and began trading on the NYSE in 1995 as NYSE: DST.
In 1990, DST first released the Automated Work Distributor (AWD[3]), a business process management product that has been widely adopted by banks, insurance companies, healthcare companies, brokerages and mutual fund companies looking for a paperless environment.
In 1989, DST acquired a 50% interest in Argus Health Systems, at the time focused on pharmacy benefit administration. On March 31, 2009, DST acquired the remaining equity interest of Argus Health.
In 2005 and 2006, DST acquired CSC's Health Plan Solutions group and Amisys Synertech, Inc,[4] allowing DST to provide claims administration, software applications and business process outsourcing (BPO) solutions. This became the newly established DST Health Solutions, a sister company to Argus Health.
In 1991, DST created a wholly owned subsidiary eventually known as DST Customer Communications (formerly DST Output) to handle the design, printing, sorting, mailing and electronic presentment of the voluminous output of its product management systems.
In July 2016, DST sold their North American Customer Communications business to Broadridge Financial Solutions.
Expansion, Partnerships & Investments[edit]
Since 1973, DST has offered many services through substantial joint venture enterprises with State Street Corporation. DST and State Street joint venture activities now include significant international operations.
In 1992, DST formed International Financial Data Systems (IFDS), UK, as a joint venture with State Street Corporation. The UK venture later expanded to locations in Germany and Ireland to provide financial service recordkeeping services for its clients.
In 2001, IFDS combined with International Financial Data Systems (Canada) Ltd.
In 2008, Bluedoor Technologies, a provider of software solutions for participant accounting for the superannuation markets in Australia, was acquired.[13] DST Retirement Solutions was formally established that year.
In 2011, UK-based Lateral Group was acquired to create what is now called DST Applied Analytics. That same year, DST Brokerage Solutions and DST Market Services were established. Also acquired in 2011 was ALPS Holdings, Inc. (ALPS), a Denver-based provider of servicing and asset gathering solutions to the asset management industry. ALPS began in 1991 and became the first service providers of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) beginning in 1995. In 2007, ALPS expanded their capabilities to asset management, specializing in satellite and alternative investment strategies.
DST acquired New York-based kasina LLC in January 2015. kasina is a strategic advisory firm to the asset management industry and provides business analytics, consulting and research to asset managers. DST kasina is now part of DST Distribution Services.
In July 2015, DST acquired Wealth Management Systems Inc. (WMSI), a leading provider of technology-based rollover services in the retirement industry offering wealth management solutions. WMSI is now part of DST Retirement Solutions.
February 24, 2016, DST completed an acquisition of alternative fund service provider Kaufman Rossin Fund Services (KRFS).[5] KRFS is a full-service provider of specialized administration services to the global financial community and has expertise in the hedge fund business. KRFS is part of the asset servicing division of ALPS.
March 27, 2017, DST to acquire remaining interest in Joint Ventures, Boston Financial Data Services, Inc. (BFDS) and International Financial Data Services Limited ("IFDS U.K."), from State Street Corporation.[6]
May 7, 2017, DST Systems reports new $300 MLN share repurchase program.[7]

                            Moderate Outflows and Market Appreciation Drive Record AUM in First Quarter 2017
                        

                            After three consecutive quarters of sequential improvement, operating margins fell in the first quarter of 2017 by 200 basis points (compared to the fourth quarter of 2016) for the 15 publicly-traded asset management firms that comprise the DST Asset Manager Composite.
                        








                            What’s the Matter with Advisor Engagement by Channel?
                        

                            Many asset managers organize their sales teams by channel. But is this really the most effective strategy? Wirehouse advisors and RIAs have more similarities across channels than within.
                        








                            Five Things Asset Management CMOs Should Know about Marketing Attribution
                        

                            Marketing attribution isn’t about hits, clicks and visitors. It’s about measuring and demonstrating meaningful impact on the firm’s goals and priorities.
