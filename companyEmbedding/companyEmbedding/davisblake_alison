    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Dean, Ross School of Business
University of Michigan


Alison Davis-Blake is the Edward J. Frey Dean of the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. Davis-Blake is the school’s first female dean, and at the time of her appointment she was the highest-ranking female dean at any U.S. business school.
Dr. Davis-Blake is an expert on strategic human resource management and organizational design for effective management of human capital. Her research interests include the effects of outsourcing on organizations and employees, organizational employment, salary and promotion systems, and the determinants and consequences of using contingent workers. Prior to joining Ross in 2011, Dr. Davis-Blake was dean of the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota from 2006 to 2011. She was the first female dean at both Carlson and Ross.
Dr. Davis-Blake obtained her PhD in organizational behavior from Stanford University and her undergraduate and master's degrees from Brigham Young University.
About Alison
Alison is married and has two sons. She and her family have a great passion for travel, art, and theater.
“The next generation of leaders genuinely wants to change the world and many see business as the best path to do so. Therefore, it's essential that business schools build an educational experience that incorporates positive business, focusing on developing leaders who can create economic value, build great places to work, and contribute to their local and global communities.”
To learn about about Alison, connect with her on LinkedIn and subscribe to her blog to read up on the latest business trends.
About 2015 Partners in Business Ethics Conference:
Corporate leaders consistently emphasize the importance of ethics and integrity in the workplace. Yet, they are concerned that business schools are not graduating students with the depth of understanding nor educational experiences necessary to recognize and address complex ethical situations when they arise. This conference provides one of the only opportunities available for corporate leaders to play a critical role in discussing and refining the business ethics education provided at top schools around the country.

Abstract
Outsourcing arrangements continue to evolve from peripheral activities, such as food services and back office transaction processing, to encompass more core activities such as new product development. Some arrangements maintain a clear lead organization while others, such as open source networks, are less centralized. We develop a framework identify the specific impact of different outsourcing arrangements on the search, selection, transformation, and coordination processes involved in new product development new product development.

Scott DeRue is the Edward J. Frey Dean of the Stephen M. Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. He is also the Stephen M. Ross Professor of Business.
 


About Scott DeRue​
DeRue joined Michigan Ross in 2007, taking on multiple leadership roles across the school over time. Prior to his deanship, DeRue served as the associate dean for Executive Education, professor of management, director of the Sanger Leadership Center, and faculty director of the Emerging Leaders Program.
With a background in private equity, management consulting, and academia, DeRue believes that business is the most powerful force for economic and social impact -- and it is the responsibility of Michigan Ross to develop the next generation of business leaders. He is an award-winning researcher and instructor, and is widely considered a thought leader in business education and action-based learning.
Driven by the Ross mission to develop leaders who make a positive difference in the world, DeRue is committed to creating transformative student experiences.
During his tenure as associate dean of Executive Education, DeRue led the program to its best performance in a decade; expanding its portfolio to more than 30 open enrollment and dozens of custom programs. The Financial Times recently ranked Michigan Ross among the top five global executive education providers. He also led the creation and launch of Alumni Advantage, a new initiative connecting Ross alumni to the school and university. Offerings include free tuition for executive education programming, access to livestreamed school events, and the opportunity to attend #ROSSTALKS, a series of global events where faculty present TED-style talks on hot-button business topics.
As an expert in leadership, team and organizational development, and HR/talent strategy, DeRue is considered one of the world’s most influential business professors. His award-winning research has been published in top academic journals, including the Academy of Management Review, Academy of Management Journal, Journal of Applied Psychology, Leadership Quarterly, the Human Resource Management Journal, and more.
DeRue is also a highly respected thought leader that has been featured in national and international media publications including Bloomberg, The New York Times, Harvard Business Review, The Guardian, Forbes, and The Huffington Post, sharing his insights on leadership, change management, human resource management, and more.
Prior to joining Ross, DeRue worked at the Monitor Group (now Monitor Deloitte). He received his PhD in management from Michigan State University and his Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Managing Outsourced Product Design: The Effectiveness of Alternative Integration Mechanisms
Anderson, Edward G., Jr. and Davis-Blake, Alison and Parker, Geoffrey G. (2007) Managing Outsourced Product Design: The Effectiveness of Alternative Integration Mechanisms. [Industry Studies Working Paper:2007-01]552KbAbstractMany firms have moved from outsourcing only manufacturing and staff support activities (e.g., janitorial services) to
outsourcing more complex and central activities such as product and process development. Outsourcing these more
complex, nuanced, and time-sensitive activities increases the difficulties of coordinating with suppliers. We examine the
frequency with which firms use various interorganizational integration mechanisms and project coordination tools to
coordinate outsourced product development. We further examine the impact of these mechanisms and tools on project
performance. We report descriptive and some preliminary regression statistics from the first three years of a four-year
multi-firm, multi-industry research project. These preliminary results suggest that nearly all firms employ personnel
dedicated to managing the outsourcing relationship. However, firms also use other integration modalities concomitantly.
Specifically, firms initially rely on ad hoc face-to-face communication rather than co-location to manage the interface with
outsourcing partners. However, over time, firms move to co-location to manage relationships with non-domestic suppliers.
Surprisingly, firms make relatively little use of either sophisticated information technology or modular product designs. We
find that the effects of a single integration mechanism or tool can vary dramatically across different outcomes. For example,
co-locating employees appears to improve product quality but are associated with poor schedule peformance. Given the
frequency with which firms employ dedicated individuals to manage the interface, we also present some preliminary
evidence on the skills and training of these individuals; this evidence suggests that (1) they have received little formal
training in key skills and that firms rely solely on experiential learning to train these individuals and (2) for the training they
have received, whether they received it from their university training or from company-sponsored initiatives may have
differential effects on project outcomes.Industry Studies Series #:2007-01Item Type:Industry Studies Working PaperUncontrolled Keywords:industry studies, industry studies working paper, industry studies association, industry studies researchID Code:118Deposited By:Mr Robin PetersonDeposited On:23 Feb 2010 14:47Last Modified:07 Jun 2010 10:45Repository Staff Only: item control page

Ross Dean To Step Down After One Term

Alison Davis-Blake, the dean of the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business, today (May 18) said she plans to step down from the job once her first five-year term ends on June 30, 2016.
“After much consideration and consultation with my closest advisers, friends, and family, I have decided that I want to turn the focus of my professional service to the broader problems and opportunities facing universities,” she said in a memo to the Ross community.
Her four-year tenure as dean has been somewhat controversial, especially among the school’s old guard faculty. Since her arrival in 2011, several of Michigan’s academic stars left the school, including Karl E. Weick, a world renown organizational behavior expert, and Claes Fornell, one of the most influential academics in customer satisfaction measurement, and Robert Kennedy, who had been executive director of the school’s William Davidson Institute, a leader in research into emerging market economies. 
It’s unclear whether her decision not to seek a second term was at least partially motivated by faculty complaints to the university administration about her leadership style. Since the start of her term in 2011, the top two leaders of the university–President Mary Sue Coleman and Provost Phil Hanlon who hired Davis-Blake–have since left their jobs.
ACCEPTANCE RATES TO ROSS’ FULL-TIME MBA PROGRAM HIT A RECORD HIGH UNDER THE DEAN
During her stint as dean, Ross’ full-time MBA program has had something of a roller coaster ride. The school’s ranking has improved to 11th among the best U.S. MBA programs in Poets&Quants’ composite list from 13th when she arrived at Ross. But in 2012, the school’s acceptance rate for its full-time program hit a record high 40.6%—well above any other prestige public university business school. The spike was caused when the school shut down its co-signer loan program for international students. Ross admitted more candidates to offset the expected decline in offers from admits who decided not to go to Michigan because of the loan issue.
While Ross has since brought its acceptance rate down to 35.9% last year, it is still higher—if not substantially higher—than Berkeley, UCLA, Virginia, Texas, and Indiana University, even though Michigan has reduced the size of its class to 447 last year from 502 in 2012. Ross was the only U.S. school in the Top 50 that failed to provide acceptance data to U.S. News & World Report for its latest annual ranking published in January. Applications to its MBA program last year fell to 2,443 from 2,647 a year earlier.
An MBA in last year’s graduating class told Poets&Quants that today’s news is “bittersweet.” “She did get a lot of money and helped cut down the class size but she was never very engaged with the students,” the alum said. “I never saw her come down from her office to shake a hand in the Winter Garden and ask how the classes were going. Her involvement with the section leaders was minimal and mostly patronizing.”
‘EAGER TO CONTRIBUTE SOLUTIONS TO THE UNIVERSITY’S LARGER CHALLENGES’
She took over the deanship of Ross at a difficult time. The school was in the red, largely a result of the then still lingering impact of the Great Recession which forced two of the big three U.S. automakers in Detroit into bankruptcy. The economic mess particularly wrecked havoc with Ross’ executive education business, which insiders say, saw revenues plunge from roughly $30 million annually to close to a low of $11 million. Because Ross’ exec ed profits go entirely to the school, the collapse of those offerings plunged the entire institution into a deficit. In her memo, Davis-Blake said her team has restored the school to a “healthy financial position” after a 70% increase in executive education revenue and a return to the school of nearly $3 million this year.
Davis-Blake noted that the 2015-2016 academic year would mark her tenth year as a business school dean at both Ross and the University of Minnesota’s Carlson School of Management. “During the past decade, I have learned that I particularly enjoy working with faculty, staff, and students to stabilize challenging situations and then create momentum towards extraordinary positive performance,” she said. 
“Together, we have created that momentum at the Ross School. Beyond the business school realm, there are significant challenges that face all universities, in both professional and liberal education. I find myself eager to contribute solutions to these larger challenges during what will surely be a time of significant change in higher education.”
The dean said she was letting the Ross community know about her decision a full year earlier “to facilitate an orderly dean transition that will allow the Ross School to maintain its positive momentum. I have discussed my decision with Provost Martha Pollack, who will convene a search committee to select the next dean. I am confident that, with your help and support, Provost Pollack and President (Mark) Schlissel will be able to conduct a very successful search.”
