OPERATIONS & INVESTMENTS > Operations>Imperial Resources LLC

IMPERIAL RESOURCES LLC
In 2006 Imperial Resources, a 100% owned subsidiary entered into a joint venture with American Natural Resources LLC ("ANR"), to identify and acquire oil and natural gas opportunities in the Appalachian Basin (NE USA). The Joint Venture undertook a series of natural gas development (drilling) programs at Carrolltown, Cambria County, Pennsylvania. Twenty successful wells have been drilled. In 2007 the partners formed Empire Energy. 

The Carrolltown Prospect offered a low-cost, low risk opportunity to undertake a natural gas development program. The 20 development wells undertaken by the Joint Venture are expected on average to produce gas "typical” to that of an Indiana, PA, shallow  devonian gas well. In September 2009 Imperial Resources transferred 5 of the 20 wells to Empire Energy USA LLC.
Imperial Resources holds a 75% working interest, generating a 60.9375% net revenue interest in the Joint Venture.

Imperial Resources, Inc.; Oklahoma Test Well Update

Oct 17, 2012, 08:30 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Imperial Resources, Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


AUSTIN, Texas, Oct. 17, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Imperial Resources, Inc. (OTCQB: IPRC) and its wholly owned subsidiary, Imperial Oil & Gas, Inc. (together the "Company", "Imperial") is pleased to announce an update on the production from a well in which Imperial owns a nominal interest ("Test Well") and is producing from the same formation targeted in the Company's Area of Mutual Interest ("AMI") in Oklahoma.
The Company has recently updated its reserve analysis for the Test Well based on the history of the well since production began. The Test Well came onto production in November 2011 and achieved flow rates in excess of 360 barrels of oil and 850 McF of gas per day. After predicted initial production declines the well has continued to produce in line with expectations with cumulative production through July 31, 2012 of 42,539 barrels of oil and 152,586 McF of gas. Based on that historical production the Company is able to establish a better idea as to the ultimate recovery of the well. The results of this analysis indicates that the Test Well will have an ultimate recovery of 182,213 barrels of oil and over 2 billion cubic feet of gas with a productive life of approximately 25 additional years. To be conservative, the analysis was performed using July prices assuming a cost of $85.69 per barrel of oil and $3.67 an McF for gas over the life of the well, with no escalation. This means that if the prices rise above those numbers the productive life of the well will be extended.   
In parallel work has been ongoing with a local geologist to identify prime spots within the Oklahoma AMI. Subject to funding, the Company intends to commence a leasing program to purchase an initial 5,000 acres with the aim of commencing a drilling program. The geology confirms that the AMI displays similar characteristics to the geology of the land where the Test Well is located and the Company believes that there is enormous potential to replicate the results of the Test Well over a large areal extent.
The Oklahoma resource play and Green Tide Water Disposal are two key projects identified as transformational for Imperial. 
About Imperial Resources, Inc.
Imperial Resources, Inc., through its wholly owned subsidiary, Imperial Oil & Gas, Inc. has a highly focused, risk-averse strategy of building a substantial portfolio of oil and gas assets through its access to niche, low risk oil and gas opportunities in the onshore U.S. Imperial aims to exploit projects which can deliver cash flows normally associated with higher risk projects but without exposure to high risk failure rates.

We estimate that the net proceeds to us from our issuance and sale of securities
in this offering will be approximately $   million (or approximately $   million
if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full), assuming an
initial public offering price of $   per share and accompanying warrant, which
is the midpoint of the price range listed on the cover page of this prospectus,
and $0.01 per corresponding warrant after deducting estimated underwriting
discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us. If all of the
warrants issued in this offering are exercised for cash, then we will receive an
additional $   million of proceeds. It is possible that the warrants may be
exercised on a cashless basis or expire prior to being exercised, in which case
we will not receive any additional proceeds.

A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of $  
per share and accompanying warrant would increase (decrease) our net proceeds
from this offering by approximately $   million, assuming that the number of
shares offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains
the same and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and
commissions and offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and
financial flexibility, create a public market for our common stock and warrants
and enable access to the public equity markets for us and our stockholders. We
intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate
purposes, including working capital, operating expenses and capital
expenditures. We estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering
as follows:

• approximately $   million for drilling;

• approximately $   million for future acquisitions;

• approximately $   million for general capital expenditures(1); and

• approximately $   million for general corporate purposes.

(1) General capital expenditures shall include computers, leasehold             
    improvements, gathering systems, and equipment.

Investors are cautioned, however, that expenditures may vary substantially from
these uses. Investors will be relying on the judgment of our management, who
will have broad discretion regarding the application of the proceeds of this
offering. We are reserving the right to change our use of proceeds. The overall
corporate strategy is to develop our existing assets through our drilling
program and to acquire producing assets with development opportunities (“New
Assets”). If any New Assets are identified that meet our acquisition metrics, we
may reallocate proceeds from this offering to acquire New Assets. The amounts
and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous factors,
including the amount of cash generated by our operations, the amount of
competition and other operational factors. We may find it necessary or advisable
to use portions of the proceeds from this offering for other purposes.

From time to time, we evaluate these and other factors and we anticipate
continuing to make such evaluations to determine if the existing allocation of
resources, including the proceeds of this offering, is being optimized.
Circumstances that may give rise to a change in the use of proceeds include:

• a change in the size of this offering;

• a change in our acquisition plan or strategy;

• technical delays;

• delays or difficulties with our capital expenditure plan;

• the availability and operating cost of drilling rigs;

• oil and gas pricing;

• cost of oil and gas extraction;

• availability and market for existing production;

• failure to achieve sales as anticipated; and

• the availability of other sources of cash, including cash flow from        
  operations and new bank debt financing arrangements, if any.  

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
short-term, investment grade, interest bearing instruments and U.S. government
securities.


The oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive, and we compete with
other companies in our industry that have greater resources than we do. Many of
these companies not only explore for and produce natural gas, but also carry on
refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional,
national or worldwide basis. These companies may be able to pay more for
productive natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or define, evaluate,
bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our
financial or human resources permit and may be able to expend greater resources
to attract and maintain industry personnel. In addition, these companies may
have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low
natural gas market prices. Our larger competitors may be able to absorb the
burden of existing, and any changes to, federal, state and local laws and
regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our
competitive position. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to
discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate
and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly
competitive environment.

In Appalachia, our main competitors are Stedman Energy, Chautauqua Energy,
Cotton Drilling Atlas Energy, and Snyder Brothers. In Mid-Con our main
competitors are White Horse Resources, Third Oil, Tex Can Energy, and Flying J
Resources. The Company’s personnel have excellent reputations, have worked for
decades in the industry and have an almost inexhaustible supply of industry
contacts, which enable us to avail ourselves of goods, services, information and
opportunities that are not so readily available to others.


Company Description
We are an independent returns-focused exploration and production company focused
on the acquisition, exploration and development of conventional oil and natural
gas reserves in the Kansas (Mid-Continent), New York and Pennsylvania
(Appalachia) regions. We operate approximately 300 producing wells


 in the
Mid-Continent and approximately 1,700 producing wells in the Appalachian Basin.
Our drilling activity is currently focused on the Arbuckle and Lansing/Kansas
City formations located in Central Kansas (Mid-Continent) and the Upper Devonian
Bradford Group, which is an oil and liquids-rich producing formation located in
Upstate New York (Appalachia). We also have a significant number of natural gas
producing Medina formation development locations which are marginally economic
at current natural gas prices. Additionally, we have significant acreage in the
Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale, value extraction from which is dependent upon
the lifting of the New York moratorium on high volume hydraulic fracturing
(“fracking”) of horizontal wells. We intend to position ourselves to take
advantage of our New York State shale resources if and when the moratorium is
lifted.

We were founded in 2006 by a group of individuals with extensive experience in
the oil and gas and finance industries. With an average of over 20 years of
industry experience, our expanded management team has a proven track record of
working as a team to acquire, develop and exploit oil and natural gas reserves
in the Mid-Continent and Appalachian regions.

Our acreage position was 305,878 gross (278,180 net) acres at June 30, 2014,
which we group into two primary areas based on geographic locations:
Mid-Continent (sometimes also referred to as Mid-Con) and Appalachia, which are
comprised of approximately 21,521 gross (16,571 net) acres and 284,537 gross
(261,608 net) acres, respectively.

Since our inception, we have completed three significant acquisitions, four
bolt-on acquisitions and one divestiture. In December 2006, the Company acquired
for $9.4 million DK Gas, located in Hawthorn, Pennsylvania where the Company
continues to maintain an operations facility today. The acquisition included
approximately 150 operating gas wells and 6,000 leased acres in Jefferson,
Clarion and Armstrong Counties in Pennsylvania. In December 2009, the Company
purchased approximately 1,600 operating wells (predominantly gas) and 300,000
leased acres located in upstate New York from Range Resources Corporation for
$38.0 million. The wells and leases are located in Chautauqua, Cattaraugus,
Erie, Wyoming, Ontario, Seneca, Cayuga and Wayne Counties in New York and Erie
County in Pennsylvania. The Company maintains an operations facility in
Mayville, New York. In December 2010, the Company purchased approximately 300
operating wells (predominantly oil) and 22,000 leased acres located in central
Kansas from Amadeus Petroleum for $55.9 million. The Company maintains
operations facilities in Great Bend, Plainville, and Wichita, Kansas. With
respect to the bolt-on acquisitions, the Company consummated one bolt-on
acquisition in the Mid-Con region in June 2012 for $1.7 million and three
bolt-on acquisitions in Appalachia in each of September 2011, April 2012 and
August 2012 for an aggregate of $0.4 million. With respect to the divestiture,
in 2010, the Company sold the deep drilling rights for the acreage acquired from
DK Gas to a third party for $24.6 million.

From the time we began operations in December 2006 through June 30, 2014, we
have drilled 38 gross operated vertical wells on our properties with an 84%
success rate and we have drilled no horizontal wells.

In 2013, due to our strategy of building up cash reserves for potential proved
developed producing (PDP) heavy acquisitions, our development capital was only
approximately $1.3 million and we drilled a total of 7 gross (6 net) wells. In 
2014, we plan to invest at least $5.0 million of development capital to drill 
21 gross (20 net) wells. Following this offering, we would seek to increase the
investment of wells drilled in 2014 by at least $2.5 million, which should 
result in the drilling of an additional 8 gross (5 net) wells.

Business Profile
Imperial Resources, Inc. (the Company), was incorporated in the Philippines on September  5, 1969 primarily to engage in the mining and oil exploration business with a capitalization of Php 25 million.  The shares of the Company were listed in the Philippine Stock Exchange in 1970.  During the 70’s it conducted onshore drilling in Cebu and participated in twelve (12) offshore oil drilling in the South Sulu and Reed Bank area conducted three (3) world-renowned oil companies.  All onshore and offshore drillings conducted did not result to discovery of gas and oil in viable commercial quantity.  This prompted the Company to abandon its oil exploration project.
The Company in 2000 amended its articles of incorporation making the business of Information Technology (IT) as its primary purpose and the mining and oil exploration as one of its secondary purposes.  This led to the incorporation of Philippine Cyber College Corporation (PCC) a 99 % per cent –owned subsidiary of the Company which operated two (2) I.T. learning centers, one in Baguio City and another  at Malolos City, Bulacan until 2008.  During the same year PCC opened a techno-vocational training project in Pasay City to train students to become world class welders.  However, it operated only until the latter part of 2009.
In 2007 the change of the par value of the Company’s common shares of stock from Php 0.01 to Php 5.00 was implemented in the Philippine Stock Exchange.
A Memorandum of Agreement was executed by and between the Company and P.T. Aspal Buton Nasional, an Indonesian company, which owns about 2,900 hectares of Asphalt Mining Concession in Sulawesi, Indonesia, whereby the Company was given exclusive rights to explore and evaluate the mining property and subsequently exploit, develop and bring it to commercial production.  Series of geophysical and geologic studies and surveys were conducted in the ensuing years as basis for the preparation of a Project Feasibility Report.
During the special meeting of the Board of Directors held on March 29, 2011, the change of par value of the shares of stock of the Company from Five Pesos (Php5.00) to one Peso (Php1.00) per share was approved and ratified by the stockholders during the regular annual stockhloders’ meeting held on July 14, 2011. At present the Company is in the process of preparing all the requirements needed by SEC and PSE for its approval and implementation.
