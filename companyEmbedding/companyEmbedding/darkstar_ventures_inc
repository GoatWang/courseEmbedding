	NOTES
	TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)




	 




	NOTE
	1 - GENERAL




	 




	Darkstar
	Ventures, Inc. (“the Company” or “we”) was incorporated on May 8, 2007 under the laws of the State of
	Nevada. 




	 




	The
	Company established a wholly-owned subsidiary in Israel, Bengio Urban Renewals Ltd ("Bengio")., to focus its limited
	resources in the area of real estate development, particularly focusing on the urban renewal market in Israel.




	 




	The
	Company’s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including failing to secure additional funding
	to operationalize the Company’s current business plan.




	  




	NOTE
	2 - INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	 




	The
	accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements as of January 31, 2017 and for the six months then ended, have
	been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States relating to the preparation of
	financial statements for interim periods. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required for annual
	financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary
	for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the six months ended January 31, 2017 are not necessarily indicative
	of the results that may be expected for the year ending July 31, 2017.




	 




	The
	July 31, 2016 Condensed Balance Sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures
	required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements should be read
	in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for
	the year ended July 31, 2016.




	 

	 






	NOTE
	3 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES






	 





	The
	significant accounting policies applied in the annual financial statements of the Company as of July 31, 2016, are applied consistently
	in these financial statements.

	NOTES
	TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)





	 






	NOTE
	4 - GOING CONCERN






	 





	The
	Company has not commenced planned principal operations. The Company had an accumulated deficit of $694,081 as of January 31, 2017.
	In addition, the Company continues to have negative cash flows from operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the
	Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.




	 




	There
	can be no assurance that sufficient funds required during the next year or thereafter will be generated from operations or that
	funds will be available from external sources such as debt or equity financings or other potential sources. The lack of additional
	capital resulting from the inability to generate cash flow from operations or to raise capital from external sources would force
	the Company to substantially curtail or cease operations and would, therefore, have a material adverse effect on its business.
	Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any such required funds, if available, will be available on attractive terms or that
	they will not have a significant dilutive effect on the Company’s existing stockholders.




	 




	The
	accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability or classification of asset-carrying
	amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.




	 





	NOTE
	5 - NEWLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS:






	 





	No
	new accounting standards have been adopted since the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July
	31, 2016 was filed.




	 





	NOTE
	6 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS:






	 





	As
	of January 31, 2017 other current assets includes loans to an officer of the Company in the amount of $56,951. The loan is due
	on demand with no interest.



	 




	NOTE
	7 - COMMON SHARES:





	 




	On
	April 14, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company has approved the issuance of 150,000,000 restricted shares under a subscription
	agreement with investors for total consideration of $150,000. During the period ended October 31, 2016, the Company received $120,000
	of such subscription amounts.




	 





	NOTE
	8 - LONG-TERM LOAN:





	 




	On
	February 28, 2016, Bengio and TCSM INC signed a loan agreement according to which TCSM would grant the Company a loan of up to
	$256,016 (NIS 1,000,000). As of January 31, 2017 the Company received loan installments of NIS 925,000. The loan bears interest
	at an annual rate of 25%. The principal and interest will be repaid at March 1, 2019.




	 




	On
	February 28, 2016 TCSM INC assigned its rights in the above loan agreement to a third party. The loan is secured by Avraham Bengio,
	the Company's majority holder of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock and its Sole Director, CEO and CFO in an amount
	of up to $172,826 (NIS 650,000).

	Corporate
	Background and Business Overview






	 




	We
	were incorporated on May 8, 2007 in the State of Nevada. We are a development stage company that was originally established to
	offer eco-friendly health and wellness products to the general public via the internet. As we had previously disclosed, on November
	20, 2012, we entered into a binding letter of intent (“LOI”) with Real Aesthetic, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Real
	Aesthetic”), to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock in exchange for common stock of the Company.
	The closing of the transactions contemplated by the LOI was subject to the completion of the due diligence investigation of both
	parties, execution and delivery of documentation for the transaction, consents from the respective boards of directors of both
	companies and any third parties and the delivery of audited financial statements by Real Aesthetic. Subsequently, we decided not
	to pursue the contemplated transaction with Real Aesthetic. The Company has since abandoned its business plan.




	  




	The
	Registrant has recently determined, through its recently established, wholly-owned new Israeli subsidiary, Bengio Urban Renewals
	Ltd to focus its limited resources in the area of real estate development, particularly focusing on the urban renewal market in
	Israel. We believe, based upon the current real estate market in Israel, that urban renewal projects present an opportunity for
	us to generate revenues and profits, which we have never experienced since our inception.  The basis for our belief is that
	in several major Israeli cities, there is virtually no more room to grow. As a result, several municipal governments have allowed
	older buildings to be renovated, thereby giving their respective cities the opportunity to develop new apartments to be added
	to or replacing existing buildings. 




	 




	Additionally,
	municipalities have express their concern that many buildings constructed before 1980 will be unable to withstand earthquakes.
	In Israel, very few apartment buildings are owned by a single person or entity and since the majority of apartments within buildings
	are privately owned, the burden to renovate buildings in order to render them safer in the event of a major earthquake primarily
	falls on the multiple owners of various apartment buildings and complexes. 




	 




	“Tama
	38” is an Israeli national zoning plan whereby a contractor assumes the responsibility of renovating an apartment building.
	In exchange for covering all costs of renovations, securing building permits and paying requisite taxes, the contractor has is
	granted the right to build additional floors to the existing building and sell the apartments built on these floors. 




	 




	The
	apartment owners benefit by receiving a modernized building, strengthened against earthquakes, as well as the additional apartments
	added to their buildings. In some cases balconies, storage rooms, parking spaces and elevators may be added as well, further enhancing
	the building’s value.




	 




	“PinuiBinui”
	projects are defined as development where the residents of apartments are temporarily evacuated so that the buildings may be demolished
	and rebuilt.  The tenants then return to new apartments in the newly finished and renovated building.  The contractor
	pays all costs for demolition, construction, relocating apartment owners and renting their temporary homes during construction. 
	In exchange, the contractor adds new apartments in the building which are sold to generate profit.




	 







	 



	3



	 







	 









	  




	As
	with “Tama 38,” the value of the apartments in the building is increased thereby benefitting the owners and the tenants
	return to a new, often larger and safer apartment in a building often with more amenities.




	 




	Since
	February 2016, the Registrant’s Board of Directors authorized the establishment of a new  wholly-owned Israeli
	subsidiary, Bengio Urban Renewals Ltd (“Bengio Urban”) to focus its limited resources in the area of real estate development,
	particularly focusing on the urban renewal market in Israel. To that end, the Registrant raised $150,000 from the sale of restricted
	shares to investors to fund the new real estate development operations of Bengio Urban, which has recently hired employees
	and has signed contracts with the current tenants of three buildings who have agreed to vacate the buildings so that they can
	be redeveloped into modern state of the art new residential buildings .




	 




	On
	February 16, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company and the holder of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of
	common stock of the Company (the "Majority Consenting Stockholder"), together, executed a joint written consent to authorize
	and approve a Certificate of Amendment to the Company's Articles of Incorporation to increase the authorized capital stock of
	the Company from 505,000,000 shares (the "Capital Stock"), consisting of 500,000,000 shares of common stock, par value
	$0.0001 (the "Common Stock") and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 (the "Preferred Stock"),
	to an authorized capital stock of the Corporation of 2,005,000,000 shares consisting of 2,000,000,000 shares of Common Stock and
	five million 5,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock. It was also decided that the Board of Directors shall have the authority to
	establish one or more series of Preferred Stock and fix relative rights and preferences of any series of Preferred Stock, without
	any further action or approval of our stockholders.




	    




	Other
	than our current director and officer, we have no employees January 31 2017




	 






	Transfer
	Agent






	 




	We
	have engaged Vstock Transfer LLC, 77 Spruce Street, Suite 201, Cedarhurst, NY, 11516 as our stock transfer agent. Their telephone
	number is (212) 828-8436 and their fax number is (646) 536-3179. The transfer agent is responsible for all record-keeping and
	administrative functions in connection with our issued and outstanding common stock.




	  





	Results
	of Operations





	 





	Results
	of operations for the six months ended January 31 2017







	 






	The
	Company did not generate any revenues from operations for the six months ended January 31 2017




	 




	During
	the six months ended January 31 2017 the operating expenses and the net loss was $65,066 and $94,956 respectively. The operating
	expenses and net loss was primarily the result of professional fees, legal, auditing and other consulting fees associated with
	SEC compliance and operating expenses in the subsidiary from its commencement of its business activities .




	 




	We
	expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses. As a result, we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve
	profitability, which may not occur. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may be unable to sustain or increase profitability
	on a quarterly or annual basis in the future.




	  






	Liquidity
	and Capital Resources






	 




	Our
	cash balance as of January 31 2017 was $2,514. The Company is currently seeking to raise additional equity thru private placements
	to enable the continuation of its current TAMA 38 business plan ..




	  






	Going
	Concern Consideration






	 




	Our
	auditors have issued an opinion on our annual financial statements which includes a statement describing our going concern status.
	This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain
	additional capital to pay our bills and meet our other financial obligations. This is because we have not generated any revenues
	and no revenues are anticipated until we begin marketing the product which cannot be guaranteed.

	Off-Balance
	Sheet Arrangements






	 




	We
	do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
	condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
	resources that are material to investors.

	of Disclosure Controls and Procedures







	 





	The
	Company's Chief Executive Officer, who is also the Chief Financial and Accounting Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the
	Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period
	covered by this quarterly report. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that
	any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the
	desired control objectives, and our management is required to apply their judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship
	of possible controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, the CEO  concluded that, as of January 31 2017 , the Company’s
	disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed
	in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
	the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to management, including
	the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.   As a result of this evaluation,
	management identified the following deficiencies, which are deemed to be material weaknesses:





	  








	☐       
	Due to the size of the Company, there is a lack of segregation of duties, which would allow for proper processing, review
	and approval of transactions and events that have an impact on the Company’s financial results.




	 




	☐       
	The Company lacks a system to allow for the review and monitoring of internal control over financial reporting, which
	would mitigate concerns related to management’s override of controls.




	 




	☐       
	The Company lacks an independent Audit Committee, which can provide oversight of management and the financial reporting
	process.







	   




	Changes
	in Internal Control over Financial Reporting




	 




	There
	were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting for the six months ended January 31 2017 that have materially
	affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

If we sell all of the shares offered, we estimate that the net proceeds from our
offering of common stock under this prospectus will be approximately $3,395,500,
after deducting estimated offering expenses (which include legal and
professional fees and expenses related to public company filings) payable by
us. We intend to use the proceeds of this offering for working capital and
general corporate purposes. Currently there is no purchase agreement executed
between Real Aesthetics and Darkstar; the transaction has not yet closed and
still remains subject to all the conditions provided for in the LOI. If we
consummate the acquisition of Real Aesthetics, for which the sole consideration
is shares of our common stock, a portion of the proceeds of this offering would
be used to pay legal and accounting fees of DarkStar in connection with the
acquisition. We estimate such amount to be $30,000.

The net proceeds to us from the sale of up to 3,400,000 shares offered at a
public offering price of $1.70 per share will vary depending upon the total
number of shares sold. Regardless of the number of shares sold, we expect to
incur offering expenses estimated at approximately $4,500 for legal, accounting
and other costs in connection with this offering.

The following table sets forth the uses of proceeds assuming the sale of 25%,
50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of the maximum securities offered for sale by
the Company. The offering scenarios presented are for illustrative purposes
only, the actual amount of proceeds, if any, may differ. There is no assurance
that we will raise the full $3,400,000 as anticipated.

If we are successful at selling the Minimum Amount, we will issue 14,700 shares,
generate $24,990 in gross proceeds and $20,490 in net proceeds.

% of total shares offered         25%             50%             75%            100%

Our offering expenses are comprised of legal and accounting expenses, and SEC
and EDGAR filing fees, transfer agent fees and any necessary state registration
fees. Our officers and directors will not receive any compensation for their
efforts in selling our shares.
 
If we are not successful at consummating the transaction with Real Aesthetics
but are successful at raising funds in this offering, we do not currently have
any intended use of such net proceeds.

If however we do consummate the transaction with Real Aesthetics, set forth
below are our estimated use of the net proceeds of this offering in connection
with the business of Real Aesthetics. Since we are currently a shell company and
have nominal operations, our sole business will consist of the business of Real
Aesthetics and therefore all net proceeds from this offering will be used by us
in connection with the business of Real Aesthetics.
 
All amounts listed below are estimates. The amounts below are net of a portion
of the proceeds of this offering which would be used to pay legal and accounting
fees of DarkStar in connection with the proposed acquisition, which we estimate
such amount to be $30,000 for legal and accounting expenses that we would have
to incur if the acquisition is consummated.

Our offering expenses are comprised of legal and accounting expenses, and SEC
and EDGAR filing fees, transfer agent fees and any necessary state registration
fees. Our officers and directors will not receive any compensation for their
efforts in selling our shares.
 
We intend to use the proceeds of this offering in the manner set forth above. No
material amount of the proceeds is to be used to discharge indebtedness or to
acquire assets or finance the acquisition of any business, including Real
Aesthetic.


The eco-friendly product industry is highly competitive. The products we provide
encounter strong competition from many other companies, including many with
greater financial resources than ours. As the eco-friendly product market
continues to expand, we expect there to be significant competition from
companies similar to ours, as well as from larger and more established
companies. Our competitors include:
 
1. Greenandmore.com, a private company that has been an online retainer for
healthy home products since 1999 The Green Store - www.thegreenstoreonline.co.uk
– An eco-friendly product retailer based in England. Products include home and
garden, body care, recycling, gadgets and shopping bags.
 
2. LiveEcoFriendly - www.livecofriendly.com - a privately-owned online
retailer allowing the general public to purchase eco-friendly products. The
company has been operating since December 2008.
 
4. LetsGoGreen.biz – www.LetsGoGreen.biz - is an online store selling
eco-friendly Green products for home, business or office. Products include
lighting, cleaning products, plastics, paper and household products. The company
has been operating since 2007.


Company Description
We were incorporated on May 8, 2007 under the laws of the State of Nevada. From
the date of our formation until our website became operational, we did not have
any business activity except for the development of our website and locating
companies through which we can offer products. We are a


 development stage
company and since our proprietary website was launched in July 2011 we have been
offering eco-friendly health and wellness products to the general public via the
internet. Current products being offered include air and water filtration
systems, organic baby products and eco-friendly beds and linens. We currently
have no employees other than our officers, both of whom are also directors. We
have never intended and do not intend to be a blank check company. We have a
specific business plan and do not intend to engage in any merger, acquisition or
business reorganization with any entity. We do not have revenues, have minimal
assets and have incurred losses since inception.

Since we will not be offering these products directly to the public, we will not
maintain inventory of the products we market. Our website will act as a conduit
to our merchant partners’ websites, where customers order product and complete
their online purchase.

Currently, we have one merchant partner, Green Nest LLC (“Greeen Nest”). A Green
Nest promotional web banner leading to the designated portion of greennest.com
is posted on our website. We will earn 10% commission from every purchase
generated from this banner.

In view of the growing public awareness of the welfare of the ecological
environment, management believes that consumers are opting to purchase
eco-friendly goods on-line. The Company believes that this market will continue
to grow and that the consumer’s need for easy online purchasing offers value to
its potential customer base. We designed our online store to combine the best
traditional retailing practices with innovative and convenient features made
possible by the internet. As an online commerce and content provider, the
Company intends to provide a compelling and enjoyable online shopping experience
that includes a broad selection of products at reasonable prices, an intuitive
store layout, a visually pleasing environment and the convenience of shopping
from home in a store that is always open. For further customer convenience,
search technology has been incorporated into the website allowing for customers
to locate quickly the items which interest them.

We entered into an affiliate service agreement with Shareasale.com, Inc., an
Illinois corporation ("Shareasale.com"), pursuant to which we became an
affiliate of Shareasale.com, which has developed and operates a service which
allows affiliates to participate in performance marketing programs. As an
affiliate of Sharesale.com, we have established and will continue to establish
affiliate relationships with merchants. We will be able to earn commissions
through our membership in the Sharesale.com network. It is through this
agreement with Shareasale that we will obtain 10% commissions on each purchase
of an item through our website which is bought from Green Nest.

According to information provided to us by Sharesale.com, there are thousands of
online merchants that participate in the Sharesale.com Network
providing products in all major consumer categories. If our agreement with
Sharesale.com terminates, we will no longer link to merchants that have
agreements with Sharesale.com and we will have to seek new merchant
relationships. Currently we are able to offer the products of Green Nest as a
result of this affiliation program with Sharesale.com.

When a customer visits our website and decides to purchase a given product, the
customer will simply click the “Buy Now!” button near the bottom right corner of
the product description. Upon clicking the “Buy Now!” button, the customer will
automatically be taken to the merchant’s web page where the customer will then
be able to make a secure purchase of the product through our merchants’ website
that we will link to our website. We will earn 10% commissions on all such
purchases.

We utilize technology and the Internet to market eco-friendly health and
wellness products directly to our customers. By offering products through
affiliate arrangements with our suppliers, we market a wide range of products
and brands while avoiding the usually high costs associated with acquiring and
maintaining a large inventory. We have the current ability to display an almost
limitless number of items to a global audience in a cost-effective manner.
Through the use of our website and an effective internet marketing program, we
believe that our web site will appeal to consumers by offering an easy to use
personalized shopping experience.

The selling shareholders are selling shares of common stock covered by this 
prospectus for their own account. We will not receive any of the proceeds from 
the resale of these shares. We have agreed to bear the expenses relating to the
registration of the shares for the selling shareholders.


The eco-friendly product industry is highly competitive. The products we 
provide encounter strong competition from many other companies, including many 
with greater financial resources than ours. 
  
As the eco-friendly product market continues to expand, we expect there to be 
significant competition from companies similar to ours, as well as from larger 
and more established companies. Our competitors include: 
  
1.  Greenandmore.com, a private company that has been an online retainer for 
    healthy home products since 1999 The Green Store - 
    www.thegreenstoreonline.co.uk – An eco-friendly product retailer based in 
    England. Products include home and garden, body care, recycling, gadgets 
    and shopping bags. 
  
2.  LiveEcoFriendly - www.livecofriendly.com - a privately-owned online 
    retailer allowing the general public to purchase eco-friendly products. The
    company has been operating since December 2008. 
  
   2.  LetsGoGreen.biz – www.LetsGoGreen.biz - is an online store selling eco-
       friendly Green products for home, business or office. Products include 
       lighting, cleaning products, plastics, paper and household products. The
       company has been operating since 2007.


Company Description
Darkstar Ventures, Inc. was incorporated on May 8, 2007 under the laws of the 
State of Nevada. From the date of our formation until May 2011 when our website
became operational, we did not have any business activity except for the 
development of our website and locating companies through which we


 can offer 
products. We do not have revenues, have minimal assets and have incurred losses
since inception. We are a development-stage company, and once our proprietary 
website was launched in July 2011, we have been engaged in the business of 
marketing eco-friendly health and wellness products, such as air and water 
filtration systems, organic baby products and eco-friendly beds and linens 
through affiliate marketing. By offering products through an affiliate 
arrangement with a supplier, we can market a wide range of products and brands 
while avoiding the usually high costs associated with acquiring and maintaining
a large inventory. Our website acts as a conduit linking consumers to merchants
offering eco-friendly health and wellness products. We currently have no 
employees other than our officers, both of whom are also our directors. We have
never intended and do not intend to be a blank check company. We have a 
specific business plan and do not intend to engage in any merger, acquisition 
or business reorganization with any entity. 
-----

Although we do not currently maintain a physical office, our mailing address is
410 Park Avenue, 15 th Floor, New York, New York 10022 and our telephone number
is 866-360-7565. Our website address is www.darkstaronline.org.
