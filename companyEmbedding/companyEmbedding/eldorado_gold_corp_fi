	Eldorado Provides Updated Outlook



	 



	VANCOUVER, BC, September 7, 2016 – Eldorado
	Gold Corporation, (“Eldorado” or “the Company”) is hosting an Analyst Day, where the plans for continued
	sustainable growth, comprehensive technical sessions, an exploration program review, and an outline of its 2020 financial and operational
	targets are to be presented. Eldorado remains focused on its four strategic pillars: quality assets, operational excellence, accountability,
	and capital discipline.


	 


	Highlights of the topics to be presented today
	include:


	 



	Turkey: Kisladag Expansion



	 







	·




	Plans to proceed with the expansion to
	crush 20 million tonnes a year (from the current 12.5 million tonnes per year).










	·




	With completion forecasted in 2018, the
	Company expects to produce between 310,000 – 320,000 ounces of gold per year through 2020 at average cash costs of $490 per
	ounce.










	·




	Remaining capital for the expansion is
	budgeted at $63 million, to be spent over a two year implementation period.





	 



	Greece: Olympias:



	 







	·




	Parameters around

	Phase 2,

	targeting
	initial production in the first quarter 2017. Production during this Phase will average approximately 72,000 ounces of gold, with
	cash costs during the first full five years expected to range between $180 and $350 due to significant by-product credits.










	·




	The capital cost associated with the
	final stages of Phase 2 construction are estimated at $101 million.










	·




	Parameters around

	Phase 3

	are
	under development with the engineering ongoing.





	 



	Greece: Skouries



	 









	·




	Decision to develop Skouries in a

	two
	phased approach

	.










	·





	Phase 1

	: a combination of open
	pit and underground mining over 9 years, producing a total of 1.4 million ounces of gold and 620 million pounds of copper (or 2.8
	million gold equivalent ounces), at average cash costs of -$255 per ounce due to the copper by-product credits. Total development
	capital over the life of this phase is budgeted at $710 million and includes all mine development and process facilities.










	·





	Phase 2

	: preliminary analysis
	shows underground mining over the next 15 year period once Phase 1 is complete. Total gold production during this phase is expected
	to be an additional 1.7 million ounces, at average cash costs of $165 per ounce due to the copper by-product credits. Total development
	capital over the life of this phase is expected to be approximately $460 million.





	 






	 









	1






	 



	Brazil: Tocantinzhino



	 







	·




	Average annual gold production is planned
	at approximately 170,000 ounces at cash costs of approximately $535 per ounce, with initial production planned for 2019. Total
	development capital costs are estimated at $464 million and conditional upon Eldorado Board of Directors approval, construction
	will commence in 2017.





	 



	Financial Outlook



	 







	·




	The Company’s financial flexibility
	is expected to grow, with over $1 billion in total liquidity expected for year-end 2016 post the close of the previously announced
	Chinese asset sale transactions. The Company’s approach to capital investments remains prudent, and the funds are currently
	being allocated to the robust internal growth pipeline.

	Qualified Person




	 



	Paul Skayman, Chief Operating Officer of
	Eldorado Gold Corporation, is the “Qualified Person” for the purposes of National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of
	Disclosure for Mineral Projects of the Canadian Securities Administrators who has reviewed, approved and verified the scientific
	and technical information herein.



	 




	Forward Looking Statements





	 




	Certain of the statements made herein may
	contain forward-looking statements or information within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform
	Act of 1995 and applicable Canadian securities laws. Often, but not always, forward-looking statements and forward-looking information
	can be identified by the use of words such as "plans", “targets”, “targeted”, "expects",
	"is expected", "budget", "scheduled", "estimates", "forecasts", "intends",
	"anticipates", or "believes" or the negatives thereof or variations of such words and phrases or statements
	that certain actions, events or results "may", "could", "would", "might" or "will"
	be taken, occur or be achieved. Forward-looking statements or information herein include, but are not limited to the proposed use
	of the funds anticipated from the sale of the Company’s Chinese assets, information with respect to our strategy, plans,
	goals and outlook for our properties, including expansions and production, our future financial and operating performance and targets,
	and our proposed mine development and exploration and other events.




	 




	Forward-looking statements and forward-looking
	information by their nature are based on assumptions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which
	may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from any future results, performance
	or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements or information. We have made certain assumptions about
	the forward-looking statements and information, including assumptions about closing of both Chinese sale transactions, including
	liability and timing of meeting the closing conditions, the political and economic environment that we operate in, the future price
	of commodities, anticipated costs and expenses and impact of the disposition on the business. Even though our management believes
	that the assumptions made and the expectations represented by such statements or information are reasonable, there can be no assurance
	that the forward-looking statement or information will prove to be accurate. Furthermore, should one or more of the risks, uncertainties
	or other factors materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described
	in forward-looking statements or information. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, among others, the following:
	closing of the transactions not occurring or delayed, political, economic, environmental and permitting risks, gold price volatility,
	discrepancies between actual and estimated production, estimated mineral reserves and resources and metallurgical recoveries, mining
	operational and development risks, litigation risks, regulatory restrictions, including environmental and permitting regulatory
	restrictions and liabilities, internal and external approval risks, risks of sovereign investment, risks related to advancing the
	Chinese monetization process, currency fluctuations, speculative nature of gold exploration, global economic climate, dilution,
	share price volatility, competition, loss of key employees, additional funding requirements, and defective title to mineral claims
	or property, as well as those factors discussed in the sections entitled “Forward-Looking Statements” and "Risk
	Factors" in the Company's Annual Information Form & Form 40-F dated March 30, 2016.




	 




	There can be no assurance that forward-looking
	statements or information will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated
	in such statements. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements or information contained
	herein. Except as required by law, we do not expect to update forward-looking statements and information continually as conditions
	change and you are referred to the full discussion of the Company's business contained in the Company's reports filed with the
	securities regulatory authorities in Canada and the U.S.




	 




	All forward-looking statements and information
	contained herein are qualified by this cautionary statement.




	 





	Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors:





	 




	Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources -
	The terms "mineral reserve", "proven mineral reserve" and "probable mineral reserve" referred to
	in the Company's disclosure are Canadian mining terms as defined in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure
	for Mineral Projects under the guidelines set out in the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (the "CIM")
	Standards on Mineral







	 









	3







	 




	Resources and Mineral Reserves, adopted
	by the CIM Council as amended from time to time by the CIM. These definitions differ from the definitions in the United States
	Securities & Exchange Commission ("SEC") Guide 7. Under SEC Guide 7 standards, a “final” or “bankable”
	feasibility study is required to report reserves, the three-year historic average price is used in any reserve or cash flow analysis
	to designate reserves and the primary environmental analysis or report must be filed with the appropriate governmental authority.




	 




	The terms "mineral resource",
	"measured mineral resource", "indicated mineral resource", "inferred mineral resource" used in the
	Company's disclosure are Canadian mining terms used in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for
	Mineral Projects under the guidelines set out in the CIM Standards. Mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have
	demonstrated economic viability.  

	While the terms "mineral resource", "measured mineral resource," "indicated
	mineral resource", and "inferred mineral resource" are recognized and required by Canadian regulations, they are
	not defined terms under standards in the United States and normally are not permitted to be used in reports and registration statements
	filed with the SEC. As such, information contained in the Company's disclosure concerning descriptions of mineralization and resources
	under Canadian standards may not be comparable to similar information made public by U.S companies in SEC filings. With respect
	to "inferred mineral resource" there is a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and a great uncertainty
	as to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an "inferred mineral resource"
	will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of mineral deposits in
	these categories will ever be converted into reserves.

	January 20, 2015








	 





	 



	Eldorado Achieves Record Annual Production

	with All-In-Sustaining-Costs of $780/oz


	 



	VANCOUVER, BC – Eldorado Gold Corporation,
	(“Eldorado” or “the Company”) is pleased to report the Company’s 2014 operating results and preliminary
	cash costs, and to provide production and cash cost guidance for 2015.


	 




	Highlights




	 








	§





	Record gold production of 789,224
	ounces

	(including Olympias production from tailings retreatment), in-line with original 2014 guidance of 730,000-800,000 ounces
	of gold.










	§





	2014 all-in sustaining cash costs

	averaged

	$780 per ounce;

	cash operating costs averaged

	$500 per ounce.











	§





	Significant advancement of construction
	at Skouries

	: completion of the mill foundations; installation of the SAG and ball mills; and construction of the tailings dam
	began during the fourth quarter.










	§




	Closed the year with

	total liquidity
	of approximately $875 million

	, including $500 million in cash, cash equivalents and term deposits, and $375 million in lines
	of credit.










	§




	2015 forecast gold production estimated
	to be

	640,000-700,000


	ounces of gold

	at an average cash cost ranging between

	$570-615


	per ounce

	, and
	an all-in sustaining cash cost between

	$960-995


	per ounce.











	§




	An eligible

	dividend

	of CDN $0.01
	per common share will be paid on February 16, 2015.





	“The Company delivered another solid
	year with all of our mines either meeting or exceeding the original 2014 guidance. Costs were kept within the lower quartile of
	the industry average, crucial when we are faced with a period when metal prices remain depressed across the board.” said
	Paul Wright, Chief Executive Officer of Eldorado.


	 


	“We are driving our development projects
	forward and I would like to highlight the significant progress made during 2014 at Skouries. The mill foundations and the installation
	of the SAG and regrind mills were completed and installation of the ball mill will be completed in the second quarter. We look
	forward to advancing Skouries throughout 2015, along with commencing construction on the Olympias Phase II Project. These are two
	mines of exceptional quality, which will add significantly to Eldorado’s growth profile in 2017. Progress also continues
	to be made in resolving the outstanding permit approvals at our Eastern Dragon project where the Company plans on commencing operations
	prior to year-end 2015.”

	are scheduled to be released on February 19, 2015. The final calculation of capital and operating costs has not yet been completed,
	but all-in sustaining costs for the fourth quarter and 2014 are expected to be approximately $764 and $780 per ounce of gold, respectively.
	Cash costs for the year averaged approximately $500 and $505 for the fourth quarter 2014.

	Turkey



	 


	In 2015,

	Kisladag

	is expected to place
	17.5 million tonnes of ore on the leach pad at a grade of 0.70 grams per tonne gold, including 4.6 million tonnes of run of mine
	(ROM) ore. The increase in costs are mainly grade related due to ore being mined from a lower grade portion of a new pit phase.
	Sustaining capital expenditures for the year are estimated to be $70 million, mainly on capitalized waste stripping and construction
	projects. The Company has decided to defer the completion of the Phase Four expansion as a result of prioritizing capital allocation
	in a period of weaker gold prices. This decision will result in a smaller open pit and subsequent reduction in reserves.

	Efemcukuru

	is expected to mine and
	process 450,000 tonnes of ore at a grade of 7.69 grams per tonne gold. Sustaining capital expenditures for 2015 are estimated to
	be approximately $25 million, spent primarily on underground mine development, equipment to mine narrower veins, equipment rebuilds
	and tailings dam construction.


	 



	Greece



	 


	During 2015

	, Stratoni

	is expected to
	process 190,000 tonnes of ore at grades of 6.6% lead, 9.3% zinc and 184 grams per tonne silver. Sustaining capital costs for the
	year are expected to total $6 million, which includes underground equipment rebuilds and replacement, environmental infrastructure
	and exploration.



	 



	Development work at

	Skouries

	is planned
	to continue through 2015. Approximately $200 million in development capital has been budgeted for the year’s development
	plans, which includes advancing the plant construction, continuing with construction of the tailings dam and the exploratory drift
	for delineation and exploration drilling underground. Construction at Skouries is expected to be completed in late 2016.


	 



	Olympias

	Phase I tailings re-processing
	will continue during 2015 and an additional 20,000 ounces of gold are expected to be recovered. Capital spending in 2015 is planned
	for $110 million. This includes continuing the Stratoni-Olympias access decline, underground mine development, another phase of
	construction on the Kokkanolikas tailings dam, and Phase II plant construction. Commissioning of the plant is expected in mid-2016.
	A total of 350,000-400,000 tonnes per year of ore will be treated during Phase II to recover three products consisting of lead/silver
	concentrate, zinc concentrate and a gold concentrate. These products will go to market as per our current arrangements for both
	Stratoni and Olympias concentrates.


	 



	China



	 


	At

	White Mountain

	, the Company expects
	to process 830,000 tonnes of ore at a grade of 3.28 grams per tonne gold. Sustaining capital costs will be approximately $20 million
	in 2015. This includes underground mine development, tailings dam lift and some underground equipment rebuilds.


	 



	Jinfeng

	will process 1.3 million tonnes
	of ore at a grade of 3.95 grams per tonne gold. The ore will be primarily sourced from the underground operations, with the open
	pit operations being completed early in 2015. Sustaining capital costs for 2015 are estimated at $30 million. Major capital items
	include underground development, underground equipment rebuilds and a new ventilation shaft.



	 



	At

	Tanjianshan,

	the Company


	expects
	to process 1.1 million tonnes of ore at a grade of 3.36 grams per tonne in 2015. Sustaining capital spending is budgeted at $20
	million in 2015. This will be spent on capitalised waste stripping, underground development at Qinlongtan and tailings dam expansion.


	 


	Finally, at

	Eastern Dragon

	, the Company
	plans to spend approximately $35 million in development capital over the summer months of 2015 to complete the construction of
	the waste dump, tailings facility and pre-stripping works. The Company expects to process 22,000 tonnes of ore at a grade of 14.75
	grams per tonne gold. Initial 2015 production is scheduled
	for late in the year, and the Company expects to produce between 5,000-10,000 ounces of gold.

	Romania



	 


	The Company’s plans for

	Certej

	are progressing on schedule. The Feasibility study that commenced during the third quarter 2014 is scheduled for completion in
	the second quarter of this year. For 2015, the Company expects to spend approximately $25 million at Certej, primarily on land
	acquisition, the feasibility study and site development costs.



	 




	Brazil



	 


	At

	Vila Nova

	, the Company has moved
	forward with the decision to place the iron ore mine on care and maintenance due to the depressed iron ore market price.


	 


	The

	Tocantinzhino

	project, which had
	been undergoing a feasibility study optimization throughout 2014, has also been placed on hold. The Company will spend $4 million
	in capital during 2015, primarily on permitting, engineering and general site costs.



	 




	 




	2015 Financial Outlook



	 


	The Company’s balance sheet remains
	one of the strongest amongst its peers, with approximately $500 million in cash, cash equivalents and term deposits and $375 million
	in undrawn credit lines. Sustaining capital for gold mining operations in 2015 is estimated to be approximately $165 million, of
	which approximately $65 million is associated with sustaining production in years subsequent to 2015. Planned expenditures for
	new mining development total $345 million which includes $200 million for the continued construction of the Skouries project.


	 


	Exploration expenditures in 2015 are budgeted
	at $40 million, with a balanced focus on resource delineation and brownfield drilling at existing operations, testing known structures,
	and project generation.


	 


	Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense
	is expected to be approximately $260 per ounce of gold sold, subject to the Company completing its year end 2014 reserve and resource
	calculation.


	 



	Dividend



	 


	The Company is declaring that it will pay
	an eligible dividend of CDN $0.01 per common share on February 16, 2015 to the holders of the Company’s outstanding shares
	as of close of business on the record date of February 2, 2015.

Operations[edit]
Eldorado has two operating gold mines, Kisladag and Efemcukuru, both of which are in western Turkey. Together, these produce about 40% of Turkey's total annual gold production.
Eldorado also operates a small silver-lead-zinc mine in Greece: Stratoni.
Eldorado produced just over 485,000 ounces of Au in 2016 at average cash operating costs of US$578 per ounce and all in sustaining costs of approximately $915 per ounce.[7]
At the end of 2015, the company had proven and probable gold reserves of approximately 25 million ounces.[8]
The company estimates it will produce between 365,000-400,000 ounces of gold at cash operating costs between $485–535 per ounce in 2017.[9]
Eldorado operates in Turkey under its subsidiary: Tuprag and in Greece under its subsidiaries: Hellas Gold and Thracean Gold Mining.
Eldorado produced 486,025 ounces of gold in 2016 at all-in sustaining costs of approximately $900 per ounce. The Company generated $605.9 million in revenue and reported a loss of $344.2 million for full year 2016. [10]
In Q1 2017 Eldorado produced 75,172 ounces of gold at all-in sustaining cash costs of $791 per ounce. The Company reported adjusted net earnings for the quarter of $8 million and also announced it had commissioned phase II development at its Olympias gold mien in Greece. [11]
Developments[edit]
Eldorado has three development projects in Greece, one in Romania and one in Brazil.
Greece Hellas Gold's three assets are located in the Halkidiki peninsula in northern Greece. Hellas Gold operates Stratoni, an underground, silver-lead-zinc mine and is developing Olympias, a polymetallic deposit and Skouries, a gold-copper porphyry. All three projects have full environmental approvals, that have been challenged and upheld on multiple occasions by the Council of State, Greece’s Supreme Court on environmental and administrative affairs.[12]
Thracean Gold Mining holds Perama Hill, a gold-silver vein deposit in Thrace, which is currently on care and maintenance pending receipt of the Environmental Impact Assessment permit.
In Romania, Eldorado is working to develop the Certej project, an epithermal gold-silver deposit in the Apuseni Mountains. In Brazil, Eldorado is developing the Tocantinzinho gold project in the Tapajos district in Para State.
Divestitures[edit]
Eldorado completed the sale of its four Chinese assets in Q3/Q4 2016.

In May 2017 Eldorado announced it would acquire junior explorer Integra Gold Corp. in a cash and share transaction valued at CA$590 million. [13]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.

Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

	Certain of the statements made herein may
	contain forward-looking statements or information within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform
	Act of 1995 and applicable Canadian securities laws.  Often, but not always, forward-looking statements and forward-looking
	information can be identified by the use of words such as “plans”, “expects”, “is expected”,
	“budget”, “scheduled”, “estimates”, “forecasts”, “intends”, “anticipates”,
	or “believes” or the negatives thereof or variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions,
	events or results “may”, “could”, “would”, “might” or “will” be taken,
	occur or be achieved. Forward-looking statements or information herein include, but are not limited, to statements or information
	with respect to the Company’s 2014 Third Quarter Financial and Operating Results.









	 


	 


	 









	 


	 


	 







	Forward-looking statements and
	forward-looking information by their nature are based on assumptions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and
	other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from
	any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements or information. 
	We have made certain assumptions about the forward-looking statements and information, including assumptions about the legal
	restrictions regarding the payment of dividends by the Company; assumptions about the price of gold; anticipated costs and
	expenditures; estimated production, mineral


	reserves and metallurgical recoveries; financial position, reserves and
	resources and gold production;


	and the ability to achieve our goals. Although our management believes that the
	assumptions made and the expectations represented by such statements or information are reasonable, there can be no assurance
	that the forward-looking statements or information will prove to be accurate.  Furthermore, should one or more of the

	VANCOUVER, BC – Eldorado Gold Corporation,
	(“Eldorado” or “the Company”) today reported the Company's financial and operational results for the third
	quarter ended September 30, 2014. During the quarter, the Company generated $263.5 million in revenues from metal sales, and adjusted

	per share).


	 



	“The Company delivered another solid
	quarter with all of our mines performing to plan, notable progress at development projects, and advancement of our exploration
	targets. Combined with our strong operational performance, Eldorado continues to have a first-rate balance sheet and we closed
	the quarter with total liquidity of $937.3 million while continuing to grow our business.” said Paul Wright, Chief Executive
	Officer of Eldorado. “We are driving our development projects forward and I would like to highlight the significant progress
	made this quarter at Skouries. The mill foundations were completed and the SAG and ball mill installations are now underway. Eldorado
	continues to successfully position itself as a leading low-cost operator of high quality assets, boding well in today’s volatile
	markets.”

	Financial Results



	 


	Net income attributable to shareholders
	of the Company for the quarter was $19.8 million (or $0.03 per share), compared with $36.4 million (or $0.05 per share) in the
	third quarter of 2013. Net income was impacted by a non-cash $7.6 million iron ore inventory write-down related to Vila Nova. Gold
	revenues of $241.2 million were nine percent lower year over year due to lower gold prices and ounces sold. Gross profit from gold
	mining operations was seventeen percent lower than that of the third quarter of 2013 reflecting lower profit margins and sales
	volumes. Total cash cost per ounce increased three percent year over year. Adjusted net earnings were $36.1 million or $0.05 per
	share compared with $54.4 million or $0.08 per share in the third quarter of 2013.


	 


	Exploration expenses fell $6.4 million
	year over year reflecting changes in the Company’s exploration program in response to lower gold prices. The Company reported
	a foreign exchange loss of $4.5 million for the quarter as compared to a gain of $0.9 million for the third quarter of 2013 mainly
	as a result of the impact on cash deposits of the weakening of the Canadian, Brazilian and Turkish currencies against the US dollar.
	Interest and financing costs fell $2.9 million year over year, reflecting an increase in capitalization of interest on the Company’s
	Greek development projects.


	 


	The effective tax rate for the quarter
	was sixty-four percent as compared to a rate of fifty percent in the third quarter of 2013. The increase in the effective tax rate
	year over year was due to the impact of the fall in the Turkish lira on the deferred tax balances of the Company’s Turkish
	entity as well as an increase in the percentage of unrecognized tax losses due to lower profits.

	Gold production for the quarter at Kisladag
	was lower year over year due to lower average head grade of ore placed on the leach pad. Run of mine ore contributed to increased
	tonnes placed on the pad during the quarter. Cash costs were higher than in the same period in 2013 due to an increase in production
	waste mining (2014 – 6.4 million tonnes versus 2013 – 0.2 million
	tonnes). Capital expenditures during the quarter
	included waste stripping and leach pad construction.

	Gold production during the quarter at Efemcukuru
	was higher year over year due to higher mill throughput and average treated head grade. Sales during the quarter were lower year
	over year due to the timing of concentrate shipments. Cash operating costs per ounce were lower due to higher average treated head
	grade and continued cost reduction efforts. Capital spending during the quarter included costs related to capitalized underground
	development, mobile equipment, surface infrastructure, and process improvements.

	Combined metal concentrate production at Stratoni
	for the quarter was the same year over year, with lower lead concentrate production offset by higher zinc concentrate production
	as a result of changes in metal head grades. Concentrate sales were higher year over year due to the timing of sales. Prices received
	for lead and zinc concentrates were both higher year on year.


	 


	 


	 



	Development Project Update




	 




	Kisladag Mine Expansion



	During the third quarter work began
	at Kisladag on the engineering of an additional 7.5 million tonne per annum (Mtpa) crushing/screening circuit and its integration
	with the new gyratory crusher station. Work also began on the design of a new stockpile facility to provide feed to the existing
	crushing/screening circuit as well as the additional 7.5 Mtpa circuit. Total capacity for crushed ore will be raised to 20 Mtpa
	as per the expansion plan approved during the second quarter. Work continued during the quarter on upgrading the overland conveyor
	and stacking system that feeds the leach pad to handle the additional crushed throughput. Capital spending totaled $6.8 million
	during the quarter.



	 




	Skouries



	The mill foundations at Skouries were completed
	during the quarter. These include the semi-autogenous grind (SAG) mill, ball mill, and the regrind mills. A key milestone of the
	project was also achieved, with the transportation to site, and start of installation, of the SAG and ball mill shells. Placement
	of the mills is scheduled to be completed during the fourth quarter. During the quarter the project received approval of the technical
	study for the construction of the first tailings dam which has allowed construction work to start in the fourth quarter. Piling
	also commenced in the flotation building area. During the quarter, pit preparation work continued with the removal of topsoil and
	overburden from the open pit. The pit work will increase during the fourth quarter as waste material is mined for construction
	of the tailings dam facility. The procurement process for the open pit mining contractor also began during the quarter with a site
	visit by potential bidders on the contract.

	Progress continued on the underground decline
	with the advancement rate improving. Capital spending totaled $35.4 million during the quarter.



	 




	Olympias



	A total of 137,566 tonnes of tailings were
	reprocessed during the quarter at a grade of 2.69 grams per tonne and a total of 4,772 payable ounces of gold in concentrate were
	produced. Cash proceeds from the sale of concentrate generated $6.5 million during the quarter on 5,393 ounces of gold in concentrate.
	Capital spending totalled $27.9 million during the quarter including: $8.4 million related to tailings reprocessing, production
	royalties and transportation and selling costs; $2.2 million related to capitalized interest; and the remainder on mine development
	as well as Phase II engineering.


	 


	Plans for transitioning the plant operation
	from Phase l tailings retreatment to Phase II processing of underground ore continued to be studied during the quarter. The plans
	are based on upgrading the existing plant facilities to handle a throughput of up to 650,000 tonnes per year of ore to produce
	gold, lead/silver and zinc concentrates.



	 




	Perama Hill



	Preliminary engineering was complete with
	the final front end engineering design report received during the quarter. The Company continues to work with Greek government
	authorities to facilitate approval of the environmental impact assessment (EIA). Capital spending totaled $1.6 million during the
	quarter.



	 




	Certej



	During the quarter the feasibility study commenced
	in order to optimize the expanded resource and improve the metallurgical design. Construction permits were obtained for the 2014
	site works program allowing mobilization of the site earthworks contractor to begin rough grading of the south plant site and construction
	of the pilot water treatment plant. Capital spending totaled $3.6 million during the quarter.


	 



	Tocantinzinho



	During the quarter work continued on optimization
	of the Tocantinzinho feasibility study. Following a review of the geological model, which updated the overall tonnes and grade
	in the deposit, a rework of the mine design and plant throughput has been incorporated into the ongoing optimization analysis.
	Construction on a portion of the recently approved forest road began, which will allow 4x4 access in the dry season. Capital spending
	totaled $1.2 million during the quarter.


	 



	Eastern Dragon



	The Eastern Dragon site continued under care
	and maintenance during the quarter with permitting activities ongoing. The Company was informed that the approval process for the
	project EIA is to be conducted by the Heilongjiang Provincial Environment Protection Bureau, an interim step to approval of the
	Project Permit Approval (PPA) by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). Site personnel continued to provide support
	to the permitting team, particularly at the local and provincial level.

	Exploration Update



	 


	During the third quarter, a total of 19,000
	metres of exploration drilling were completed at the Company’s mine sites, development projects, and exploration projects.


	 



	Greece



	In the Halkidiki District, a 6,000 metre drilling
	program continued during the quarter at the Piavitsa deposit, which is located 2 kilometres west of the Stratoni project. This
	program consists largely of infill drillholes, designed to confirm the continuity of mineralization delineated in widely-spaced
	drillholes drilled during 2012 and 2013. Results to date showed grades and thicknesses in general agreement with the resource model.


	 


	At the Stratoni mine, step-out drilling targeted
	the western and down-dip extensions of the orebody. The best results were obtained from just below the current production levels
	where thick massive sulfide intercepts indicate down-dip continuity of the orebody.


	 


	In the Perama and Sapes district, exploration
	activities during the quarter focused on updating the geological model for the Sapes deposit for the purposes of refining the resource
	model and identifying exploration drilling targets.


	 



	Romania



	In the Certej project area, exploration drilling
	during the quarter tested satellite targets at Magura and Bocsa, both of which were sites of historical underground exploration.
	No significant results were obtained from the first three drillholes on these targets. These prospects will be further tested during
	the fourth quarter, upon receipt of required drilling permits.


	 


	At Muncel, located 15 kilometres southwest
	of Certej, the final three drillholes of the first phase of exploration drilling were completed. One of these drillholes was abandoned
	after intersecting underground workings, while the other two cut zones of sulfide stringer veinlets.


	 


	The Certej deposit is currently the subject
	of a detailed geological reinterpretation program, which will be completed in the fourth quarter with updated deposit geology and
	resource models.


	 



	Turkey



	Exploration drilling during the quarter in
	Turkey was limited to the Efemcukuru project, where 2,900 metres of drilling tested the Dedebag vein system and segments of the
	Kokarpinar vein. The best results were obtained from the central and northern portions of the Kokarpinar vein, where sulfide-rich
	rhodochrosite vein intercepts of several metres in width were obtained.


	 


	Reconnaissance exploration activities included
	mapping and sampling of volcanic centres in the greater Kisladag region to evaluate potential for buried porphyry systems, and
	evaluations of regional prospects in the northern part of the country.


	 



	China



	At Tanjianshan, drilling programs were completed
	at the Dushugou prospect and at the Qinlongtan (QLT) deposit. At QLT, drilling confirmed the continuity of the QLT Northwest zone
	in the previously untested gap between the 2013 drillholes and the QLT open pit.


	 


	Exploration drilling at the White Mountain
	mine (4,700 metres completed) tested step-outs along-strike and down-plunge from the ore body. Mining grades and thicknesses were
	confirmed in five separate areas, with highest grades encountered in
	the North and North Deep ore zones. Surface drilling of the North Deep zone also commenced during the quarter.

	Brazil



	Exploration drilling during the quarter in
	Brazil tested two projects in the Tapajos region. At the Ruben Zilio project, located along strike southeast of Tocantinzinho,
	soil geochemical anomalies were tested in three target areas; none of this drilling identified significant mineralization. At Tocantinzinho,
	additional sampling extended the Cu-Mo-Au mineralization over a 6 km trend. Four drillholes tested different areas of this anomaly,
	and all encountered intervals of quartz and sulfide vein mineralization.

	“budget”, “scheduled”, “estimates”, “forecasts”, “intends”, “anticipates”,
	or “believes” or the negatives thereof or variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions,
	events or results “may”, “could”, “would”, “might” or “will” be taken,
	occur or be achieved. Forward-looking statements or information herein include, but are not limited, to statements or information
	with respect to the Company’s 2014 Third Quarter Financial and Operating Results.




	Forward-looking statements and forward-looking
	information by their nature are based on assumptions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which
	may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from any future results, performance
	or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements or information.  We have made certain assumptions
	about the forward-looking statements and information, including assumptions about the legal restrictions regarding the payment
	of dividends by the Company; assumptions about the price of gold; anticipated costs and expenditures; estimated production, mineral
	reserves and metallurgical recoveries; financial position, reserves and resources and gold production;


	and the ability to
	achieve our goals. Although our management believes that the assumptions made and the expectations represented by such statements
	or information are reasonable, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements or information will prove to be accurate. 
	Furthermore, should one or more of the risks, uncertainties or other factors materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove
	incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described in forward-looking statements or information.  These risks,
	uncertainties and other factors include, among others, the following: gold price volatility; risks of not meeting production and
	cost targets;  discrepancies between actual and estimated production, mineral reserves and resources and metallurgical recoveries;
	mining operational and development risk; litigation risks; regulatory restrictions, including environmental regulatory restrictions
	and liability; risks of sovereign investment and operating in foreign countries; currency fluctuations; speculative nature of gold
	exploration; global economic climate; dilution; share price volatility; competition;  loss of key employees; additional funding
	requirements; and defective title to mineral claims or property, as well as those factors discussed in the sections entitled “Forward-Looking
	Statements” and "Risk Factors" in the Company's Annual Information Form & Form 40-F dated March 28, 2014 




	 




	There can be no assurance that forward-looking
	statements or information will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated
	in such statements.  Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements or information contained
	herein.  Except as required by law, we do not expect to update forward-looking statements and information continually as conditions
	change and you are referred to the full discussion of the Company's business contained in the Company's reports filed with the
	securities regulatory authorities in Canada and the U.S.

	Eldorado Gold Corporation



	Notes to the
	unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements


	(Expressed in thousands of U.S.
	dollars, unless otherwise stated)




	 





	1.






	General Information





	Eldorado Gold Corporation (“Eldorado”
	or the “Company”) is a gold exploration, development, mining and production company. The Company has operations and
	ongoing exploration and development projects in Turkey, China, Greece, Brazil and Romania. The Company acquired Glory Resources
	Ltd (“Glory”) in March 2014. Glory has the Sapes project in Thrace, Greece.


	Eldorado is a public company
	which is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange and is incorporated and domiciled in Canada.


	 





	2.






	Basis of preparation










	a)




	Statement of compliance





	These unaudited condensed consolidated
	interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 ‘Interim Financial
	Reporting’. They do not include all of the information and footnotes required by the International Financial Reporting Standards
	(“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board for full annual financial statements and should
	be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2013.


	The same accounting policies
	are used in the preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements as for the most recent audited
	annual financial statements and reflect all the adjustments necessary for fair presentation in accordance with IFRS for the interim
	periods presented.







	b)




	Judgement and estimates





	The preparation of these unaudited
	condensed consolidated interim financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and
	assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense.
	Actual results may differ from these estimates.


	The significant judgements made
	by management in applying the Company’s accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as
	those that applied to the consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2013.


	 





	3.






	Adoption of new accounting standards





	The following interpretation
	of a standard has been adopted by the Company commencing January 1, 2014:







	·




	IFRIC 21 ‘

	Levies

	’ – This interpretation of IAS 37, ‘Provisions

	,
	Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets’,

	applies to the accounting for levies imposed by governments. IAS 37 sets
	out criteria for the recognition of a liability, one of which is the requirement for the entity to have a present obligation as
	a result of a past event (“obligating event”). IFRIC 21 clarifies that the obligating event that gives rise to a liability
	to pay a levy is the activity described in the relevant legislation that triggers the payment of the levy. There was no impact
	on these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements as a result of the adoption of this standard.





	The following standards have
	been published and are mandatory for Eldorado’s annual accounting periods no earlier than January 1, 2017:







	·




	IFRS 9

	‘Financial Instruments’

	– This standard
	was published in July 2014 and replaces the existing guidance in IAS 39, ‘

	Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’

	.
	IFRS 9 includes revised guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments, including a new expected credit
	loss model for calculating impairment on financial assets, and the new general hedge accounting requirements. It also carries forward
	the guidance on recognition and derecognition of financial instruments from IAS 39. IFRS 9 is effective for annual reporting periods
	beginning on or after January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the extent of the impact
	of the adoption of this standard.

	3.




	Adoption of new accounting standards


	(continued)











	·




	IFRS 15

	‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’

	–
	This standard contains a single model that applies to contracts with customers and two approaches to recognising revenue: at a
	point in time or over time. The model features a contract-based five-step analysis of transactions to determine whether, how much
	and when revenue is recognized. New estimates and judgmental thresholds have been introduced, which may affect the amount and/or
	timing of revenue recognized. This standard is effective for fiscal years ending on or after December 31, 2017, with early adoption
	permitted. The Company does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its financial statements.





	 





	4.






	Acquisitions and other transactions










	a)




	Acquisition of Glory





	Eldorado completed the acquisition
	of all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Glory that it did not already own on March 14, 2014. As a result, Eldorado
	acquired a 100% interest in the Sapes project in Thrace, Greece. Prior to the transaction, Eldorado owned 19.9% interest in Glory
	and the investment was accounted for as an investment in associate.


	Total consideration of $39,219
	included cash for 179,504,179 shares in the amount of $27,583, an option buy-out payment of $1,590 to holders of Glory options,
	and $10,046 related to the 44,595,920 shares of Glory that Eldorado had purchased prior to the off-market takeover bid. A total
	of $1,229 was incurred as transaction costs and was capitalized as property, plant and equipment.


	This transaction has been accounted
	for as an acquisition of assets and liabilities as Glory did not constitute a business, as defined in IFRS 3. Other than a small
	working capital amount the remainder of the value for this transaction was assigned to property, plant and equipment.


	Eldorado paid net cash of $30,318
	as a result of the transaction. This net reduction of cash was a result of an acquired cash balance of $84 less cash consideration
	of $29,173 and transaction costs of $1,229.







	b)




	Eastern Dragon agreement





	In March 2014, the Company,
	through one of its subsidiaries, entered into a Subscription and a Shareholders agreement (“Agreements”) with a third
	party (“Third Party”).


	As a result of these Agreements,
	Third Party acquired 21.5% of the total ordinary shares of Sino Gold Tenya (HK) Limited (“Tenya”), a subsidiary of
	the Company, and indirectly a 20% interest in the Eastern Dragon Project.


	Under the terms of the Agreements,
	Third Party has the right to require Eldorado to purchase or procure the purchase by another party of Third Party’s shares
	in Tenya at a fixed price (“Put Option”) for 90 days following the second anniversary of the Agreements.


	The Agreements include other
	rights and obligations of the Company and Third Party associated with the advancement of the Eastern Dragon Project.


	This transaction has been accounted
	as an equity transaction with the recognition of a non-controlling interest in the amount of $40,000 representing the consideration
	received. A liability in the amount of $46,970 has been recorded at the transaction date, representing the present value of the
	redemption amount of the Put Option and $2,654 of transaction costs were recorded against equity. Future changes in the present
	value of the redemption amount of the Put Option are being charged against equity. The present value of the liability representing
	the Put Option as of September 30, 2014 is $48,452.

	(a) Jinfeng CMB working
	capital loan



	On January 16, 2013, Jinfeng entered into a RMB
	100.0 million ($16,254) working capital loan with CMB. Each drawdown bears fixed interest at the prevailing lending rate stipulated
	by the People’s Bank of China on the date of drawdown. The Facility had a term of up to one year, from January 16, 2013 to
	January 14, 2014. In January 2014, the term of the facility was extended to January 28, 2015. This facility is unsecured.


	During the quarter ended September 30, 2014, Jinfeng
	repaid the full amount under this facility and concurrently drew down RMB 50.0 million ($8,127) and has used the proceeds to fund
	working capital obligations. All tranches of the loan have a term of six months and a fixed interest rate of 5.6%.




	(b) Senior notes




	On December 10, 2012, the Company completed an
	offering of $600.0 million senior notes (“the notes”) at par value, with a coupon rate of 6.125% due December 15, 2020.
	The notes pay interest semi-annually on June 15 and December 15. Net deferred financing costs of $13,348 have been included as
	an offset in the balance of the notes in the financial statements and are being amortized over the term of the notes.


	The fair market value of the notes as at September
	30, 2014 was $600.4 million.



	(c) Entrusted loan




	In November 2010,
	Eastern Dragon, HSBC Bank (China) and Qinghai Dachaidan Mining Ltd (“QDML


	”)


	,
	our 90% owned subsidiary, entered into a RMB 12.0 million ($1,950) entrusted loan agreement, which has been increased to RMB 720.0
	million ($117,026) through a series of amendments.



	Under the terms of the entrusted loan, QDML with
	its own funds entrusts HSBC Bank (China) to provide a loan facility in the name of QDML to Eastern Dragon. The loan can be drawn
	down in tranches. Each drawdown bears interest fixed at the prevailing lending rate stipulated by the People’s Bank of China
	on the date of drawdown. Each draw down has a term of three months and can be rolled forward at the discretion of
	QDML. The interest
	rate on this loan as at September 30, 2014 was 4.59%.


	As at September 30, 2014, RMB 647.1 million ($105,177)
	had been drawn under the entrusted loan.


	Subsequent to September 30, 2014, RMB 0.7 million
	($117) was drawn under this loan.


	The entrusted loan has been recorded on a net
	settlement basis.

	Fair value of financial instruments





	Fair values are determined directly by reference
	to published price quotations in an active market, when available, or by using a valuation technique that uses inputs observed
	from relevant markets.


	The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are
	described below:







	·




	Level 1 – Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement
	date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.










	·




	Level 2 – Inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, but do not qualify
	as Level 1 inputs (i.e., quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities).










	·




	Level 3 – Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant
	to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e., supported by little or no market activity).





	The only assets measured at fair value as at
	September 30, 2014 are marketable securities. No liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as at September 30,
	2014.


	The fair value of financial instruments traded
	in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date. A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are
	readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, and those
	prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis. The quoted market price used
	for financial assets held by the group is the current bid price. These instruments are included in Level 1. Instruments included
	in Level 1 comprise primarily publicly-traded equity investments classified as held-for-trading securities or available-for-sale
	securities.


	With the exception of the fair market value of
	our senior notes (note 5b), all carrying amounts of financial instruments approximate their fair value.

	Segment information





	Identification of reportable
	segments


	The Company has identified its
	operating segments based on the internal reports that are reviewed and used by the chief executive officer and the executive management
	(the chief operating decision makers or CODM) in assessing performance and in determining the allocation of resources.


	The CODM considers the business
	from both a geographic and product perspective and assesses the performance of the operating segments based on measures of profit
	and loss as well as assets and liabilities. These measures include gross profit (loss), expenditures on exploration, property,
	plant and equipment and non-current assets, as well as total debt. As at September 30, 2014, Eldorado had six reportable segments
	based on the geographical location of mining and exploration and development activities.


	10.1	 Geographical
	segments	


	Geographically, the operating
	segments are identified by country and by operating mine or mine under construction as follows:







	·




	The Turkey reporting segment includes the Kişladağ and the
	Efemçukuru mines and exploration activities in Turkey.










	·




	The China reporting segment includes the Tanjianshan (“TJS”),
	Jinfeng and White Mountain mines, the Eastern Dragon project and exploration activities in China.










	·




	The Brazil reporting segment includes the Vila Nova mine, Tocantinzinho
	project and exploration activities in Brazil.










	·




	The Greece reporting segment includes the Stratoni mine, the Olympias,
	Skouries, Perama Hill and Sapes projects and exploration activities in Greece.










	·




	The Romania reporting segment includes the Certej project and exploration
	activities in Romania.










	·




	Other reporting segment includes operations of Eldorado’s corporate
	office and exploration activities in other countries.





	Financial information about
	each of these operating segments is reported to the CODM on at least a monthly basis.

	Net income attributable to shareholders of the Company for
	the quarter was $19.8 million (or $0.03 per share), compared with $36.4 million (or $0.05 per share) in the third quarter of 2013.
	Net income was impacted by a non-cash $7.6 million iron ore inventory write-down related to Vila Nova. Gold revenues of $241.2
	million were nine percent lower year over year due to lower gold prices and ounces sold. Gross profit from gold mining operations
	was seventeen percent lower than that of the third quarter of 2013 reflecting lower profit margins and sales volumes. Total cash
	cost per ounce increased three percent year over year. Adjusted net earnings were $36.1 million or $0.05 per share compared with
	$54.4 million or $0.08 per share in the third quarter of 2013.


	 


	Exploration expenses fell $6.4 million year over year reflecting
	changes in the Company’s exploration program in response to lower gold prices. The Company reported a foreign exchange loss
	of $4.5 million for the quarter as compared to a gain of $0.9 million for the third quarter of 2013 mainly as a result of the impact
	on cash deposits of the weakening of the Canadian, Brazilian and Turkish currencies against the US dollar. Interest and financing
	costs fell $2.9 million year over year, reflecting an increase in capitalization of interest on the Company’s Greek development
	projects.


	 


	The effective tax rate for the quarter was sixty-four percent
	as compared to a rate of fifty percent in the third quarter of 2013. The increase in the effective tax rate year over year was
	due to the impact of the fall in the Turkish lira on the deferred tax balances of the Company’s Turkish entity as well as
	an increase in the percentage of unrecognized tax losses due to lower profits.

	Gold production for the quarter at Kisladag was lower year over year
	due to lower average head grade of ore placed on the leach pad. Run of mine ore contributed to increased tonnes placed on the pad
	during the quarter. Cash costs were higher than in the same period in 2013 due to an increase in production waste mining (2014
	– 6.4 million tonnes versus 2013 – 0.2 million tonnes). Capital expenditures during the quarter included waste stripping
	and leach pad construction.

	Combined metal concentrate production at Stratoni for the quarter
	was the same year over year, with lower lead concentrate production offset by higher zinc concentrate production as a result of
	changes in metal head grades. Concentrate sales were higher year over year due to the timing of sales. Prices received for lead
	and zinc concentrates were both higher year on year.


	 


	 



	Development project update




	 




	Kisladag Mine Expansion



	During the third quarter work began at Kisladag on the engineering
	of an additional 7.5 million tonnes per year (“Mtpa”) crushing/screening circuit and its integration with the new gyratory
	crusher station. Work also began on the design of a new stockpile facility to provide feed to the existing crushing/screening circuit
	as well as the additional 7.5 Mtpa circuit. Total capacity for crushed ore will be raised to 20 Mtpa as per the expansion plan
	approved during the second quarter. Work continued during the quarter on upgrading the overland conveyor and stacking system that
	feeds the leach pad to handle the additional mine crusher throughput. Capital spending totaled $6.8 million during the quarter.



	 




	Skouries



	The mill foundations at Skouries were completed during the quarter.
	These include the semi-autogenous grind (“SAG”) mill, ball mill, and the regrind mills. A key milestone of the project
	was also achieved, with the transportation to site, and start of installation of the SAG and ball mill shells. Placement of the
	rest of the mills is scheduled to be completed during the fourth quarter. During the quarter the project received approval of the
	technical study for the construction of the first tailings dam which has allowed construction work of the tailings dams to start
	in the fourth quarter. Piling also commenced in the flotation building area. During the quarter, pit preparation work continued
	with the removal of topsoil and overburden from the open pit. The pit work will increase during the fourth quarter as waste material
	is mined for construction of the tailings dam facility. The procurement process for the open pit mining contractor also began during
	the quarter with a site visit by potential bidders on the contract.

	for the three and nine-month periods ended September30, 2014







	 





	 


	Progress continued on the underground decline with the advance rate
	improving. Capital spending totaled $35.4 million during the quarter.


	 



	Olympias



	A total of 137,566 tonnes of tailings were reprocessed during
	the quarter at a grade of 2.69 grams per tonne. A total of 4,772 payable ounces of gold in concentrate were produced. Cash proceeds
	from the sale of concentrate generated $6.5 million during the quarter on 5,393 ounces of gold in concentrate. Capital spending
	totalled $27.9 million during the quarter including $8.4 million related to tailings reprocessing, production royalties and transportation
	and selling costs, $2.2 million related to capitalized interest, and the remainder on mine development as well as Phase II engineering.


	 


	Plans for transitioning the plant operation from Phase l tailings
	retreatment to Phase II processing of underground ore continued to be studied during the quarter. The plans are based on upgrading
	the existing plant facilities to handle a throughput of up to 650,000 tonnes per year of ore to produce gold, lead/silver and zinc
	concentrates.



	 




	Perama Hill



	Preliminary engineering was completed with the final front end engineering
	design report received during the quarter. The Company continues to work with Greek government authorities to facilitate approval
	of the Environmental Impact Assessment (“EIA”). Capital spending totaled $1.6 million during the quarter.



	 




	Certej



	During the quarter the feasibility study commenced in order to optimize
	the expanded resource and improve the metallurgical design. Construction permits were obtained for the 2014 site works program
	allowing mobilization of the site earthworks contractor to begin rough grading of the south plant site and construction of the
	pilot water treatment plant. Capital spending totaled $3.6 million during the quarter.


	 



	Tocantinzinho



	During the quarter work continued on optimization of the Tocantinzinho
	feasibility study. Following a review of the geological model, which updated the overall tonnes and grade in the deposit, a rework
	of the mine design and plant throughput has been incorporated into the ongoing optimization analysis. Access to the site was upgraded
	to improve surface conditions and drainage. Construction on a portion of the recently approved forest road was begun. Capital spending
	totaled $1.2 million during the quarter.


	 



	Eastern Dragon



	The Eastern Dragon site continued under care and maintenance during
	the quarter with permitting activities ongoing. The Company was informed that approval of the project EIA is to be conducted by
	the Heilionjiang Provincial Environment Protection Bureau. Site personnel continued to provide support to the permitting team,
	particularly at the local and provincial level.



	 




	 




	Exploration update



	 


	During the third quarter, a total of 19,000 metres of exploration
	drilling were completed at the Company’s mine sites, development projects, and exploration projects.


	 



	Greece



	In the Halkidiki District, a 6,000 metre drilling program continued
	during the quarter at the Piavitsa deposit, which is located 2 kilometres west of the Stratoni project. This program consists largely
	of infill drillholes, designed to confirm the continuity of mineralization delineated in widely-spaced drillholes drilled during
	2012 and 2013. Results to date showed grades and thicknesses in general agreement with the resource model.

	for the three and nine-month periods ended September30, 2014







	 





	 


	At the Stratoni mine, step-out drilling targeted the western and
	down-dip extensions of the orebody. The best results were obtained from just below the current production levels where thick massive
	sulfide intercepts indicate down-dip continuity of the orebody.


	 


	In the Perama / Sapes district, exploration activities during the
	quarter focused on updating the geological model for the Sapes deposit for the purposes of refining the resource model and identifying
	exploration drilling targets.


	 



	Romania



	In the Certej project area, exploration drilling during the quarter
	tested satellite targets at Magura and Bocsa, both of which were sites of historical underground exploration. No significant results
	were obtained from the first three drillholes on these targets. These prospects will be further tested during the fourth quarter,
	upon receipt of required drilling permits.


	 


	At Muncel, located 15 kilometres southwest of Certej, the final three
	drillholes of the first phase of exploration drilling were completed. One of these was abandoned after intersecting underground
	workings, while the other two cut weak to moderate zones of sulfide stringer veinlets.


	 


	The Certej deposit is currently the subject of a detailed geological
	reinterpretation program, which will be completed in the fourth quarter with updated deposit geology and resource models.


	 



	Turkey



	Exploration drilling during the quarter in Turkey was limited to
	the Efemcukuru project, where 2,900 metres of drilling tested the Dedebag vein system and segments of the Kokarpinar vein. The
	best results were obtained from the central and northern portions of the Kokarpinar vein, where several metres of sulfide-rich
	rhodochrosite vein intercepts of several metres width were obtained.


	 


	Reconnaissance exploration activities included mapping and sampling
	of volcanic centres in the greater Kisladag region to evaluate potential for buried porphyry systems, and evaluations of regional
	prospects in the northern part of the country.


	 



	China



	At Tanjianshan, drilling programs were completed at the Dushugou
	prospect and at the Qinlongtan (“QLT”) deposit. At QLT drilling confirmed the continuity of the QLT Northwest zone
	in the previously untested gap between the 2013 drillholes and the QLT open pit.


	 


	Exploration drilling at the White Mountain mine (4,700 metres completed)
	tested step-outs along-strike and down-plunge from the ore body. Mining grades and thicknesses were confirmed in five separate
	areas, with highest grades encountered in the North and North Deep ore zones. Surface drilling of the North Deep zone also commenced
	during the quarter.


	 



	Brazil



	Exploration drilling during the quarter in Brazil tested two projects
	in the Tapajos region. At the Ruben Zilio project, located along strike southeast of Tocantinzinho, soil geochemical anomalies
	were tested in three target areas; none of this drilling identified significant mineralization. At Tocantinzinho, additional sampling
	extended the Cu-Mo-Au mineralization over a 6 km trend. Four drillholes tested different areas of this anomaly, and all encountered
	intervals of quartz and sulfide vein mineralization.

	All-in sustaining cash cost



	Effective January 31, 2014 the Company, in conjunction with an initiative
	undertaken within the gold mining industry and set out in the guidance note released by the World Gold Council on June 27, 2013,
	has adopted an all-in sustaining cost performance measure. All-in sustaining costs are calculated by taking total cash costs as
	indicated in the reconciliation above and adding sustaining capital expenditures, corporate administrative expense, exploration
	and evaluation costs, and reclamation cost accretion. The Company believes that this measure represents the total costs of producing
	gold from current operations, and provides the Company and other stakeholders of the company with additional information of the
	Company’s operational performance and ability to generate cash flows. As the measure seeks to reflect the full cost of gold
	production from current operations, new project capital is not included. Certain other cash expenditures, including tax payments,
	dividends and financing costs are also not included. The Company reports this measure on a gold ounces sold basis. The table below
	provides additional detail on the calculation of the Company’s all-in sustaining cash cost for the current periods.

	Cash flow from mining operations before changes in non-cash working
	capital



	We use

	cash flow from mining operations before changes in non-cash
	working capital

	to supplement our consolidated financial statements, and calculate it by not including the period to period
	movement of non-cash working capital items, like accounts receivable, advances and deposits, inventory, accounts payable and accrued
	liabilities.


	 



	Adjusted net earnings



	The Company has included non-IFRS performance measures,

	adjusted
	net earnings

	and

	adjusted net earnings per share

	, throughout this document. Adjusted net earnings excludes gains/losses
	and other costs incurred for acquisitions and disposals of mining interests, impairment charges, unrealized and non-cash realized
	gains/losses of financial instruments and foreign exchange impacts on deferred income tax as well as significant non-cash, non-recurring
	items. The Company also excludes net earnings and losses of certain associates that the Company does not view as part of the core
	mining operations. The Company excludes these items from net earnings to provide a measure which allows the Company and investors
	to evaluate the results of the underlying core operations of the Company and its ability to generate cash flow. Accordingly, it
	is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance
	prepared in accordance with IFRS.

	As at September 30, 2014, Hellas Gold had entered into off-take agreements
	pursuant to which Hellas Gold agreed to sell a total of 8,325 dry metric tonnes of zinc concentrates, 7,400 dry metric tonnes
	of lead/silver concentrates over the next three years, and 15,480 dry metric tonnes of gold concentrate through December 31, 2014.


	 


	In April 2007, Hellas Gold agreed to sell to Silver Wheaton (Caymans)
	Ltd. (Silver Wheaton) all of the silver metal to be produced from ore extracted during the mine-life within an area of approximately
	seven square kilometres around Stratoni, up to 15 million ounces, or 20 million ounces if additional silver is processed through
	the Stratoni mill from areas other than the current producing mine. The sale was made in consideration of a prepayment to Hellas
	Gold of $57.5 million in cash, plus a fee per ounce of payable silver to be delivered to Silver Wheaton of the lesser of $3.90
	and the prevailing market price per ounce. As at September 30, 2014 approximately 6.4 million ounces of silver have been delivered
	of the original 15 million ounce commitment.



	 




	Debt



	Significant changes in our debt from that disclosed in our December
	31, 2013 annual MD&A and consolidated financial statements are as follows:


	 




	Jinfeng
	CMB working capital loan





	On January
	16, 2013, Jinfeng entered into a RMB 100.0 million ($16.3 million) working capital loan with
	CMB. Each drawdown bears fixed interest
	at the prevailing lending rate stipulated by the People’s Bank of China on the date of
	drawdown. The Facility had a term
	of up to one year, from January 16, 2013 to January 15, 2014. In January 2014, the term of the facility was extended to January
	28, 2015. The facility is unsecured.



	 



	During
	the quarter ended September 30, 2014, Jinfeng repaid the full amount under this facility and concurrently drew down RMB 50.0 million
	($8.1 million) and has used the proceeds to fund working capital obligations. All tranches of the loan have a term of six months
	and a fixed interest rate of 5.6%.




	 





	Senior
	notes





	On December
	10, 2012, the Company completed an offering of $600.0 million senior notes (“the notes”) at par value, with a coupon
	rate of 6.125% due December 15, 2020. The notes pay interest semi-annually on June 15 and December 15. Net deferred financing costs
	of $13.3 million have been included as an offset in the balance of the notes in the financial statements and are being amortized
	over the term of the notes.



	 



	The fair
	market value of the notes as at September 30, 2014 was $600.4 million.



	 




	Entrusted
	loan





	In November
	2010, Eastern Dragon, HSBC Bank (China) and Qinghai Dachaidan Mining Ltd (“QDML”), our 90% owned subsidiary, entered
	into a RMB 12.0 million ($2.0 million) entrusted loan agreement, which has been increased to RMB 720.0 million ($117.0 million)
	through a series of amendments.

	Under
	the terms of the entrusted loan, QDML with its own funds entrusts HSBC Bank (China) to provide a loan facility in the name of QDML
	to Eastern Dragon. The loan can be drawn down in tranches. Each drawdown bears interest fixed at the prevailing lending rate stipulated
	by the People’s Bank of China on the date of drawdown. Each draw down has a term of three months and can be rolled forward
	at the discretion of QDML. The interest rate on this loan as at September 30, 2014 was 4.59%.




	 




	As at
	September 30, 2014, RMB 647.1 million ($105.2 million) had been drawn under the entrusted loan. Subsequent to September 30, 2014,
	RMB 0.7 million ($0.1 million) was drawn under this loan. The entrusted loan has been recorded on a net settlement basis.




	 



	Dividends



	On August
	26, 2014 Eldorado paid $6.5 million in dividends to shareholders of record. Future dividend payments will be dependent on the Company
	having an aggregate of contributed surplus, accumulated other comprehensive income and retained earnings balance exceeding the

	New accounting developments



	 


	The following interpretation
	of a standard has been adopted by the company commencing January 1, 2014:







	·




	IFRIC 21 ‘

	Levies

	’ – This interpretation of IAS
	37, ‘Provisions

	, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets’,

	applies to the accounting for levies imposed
	by governments. IAS 37 sets out criteria for the recognition of a liability, one of which is the requirement for the entity to
	have a present obligation as a result of a past event (“obligating event”). IFRIC 21 clarifies that the obligating
	event that gives rise to a liability to pay a levy is the activity described in the relevant legislation that triggers the payment
	of the levy. There was no impact on these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements as a result of the adoption
	of this standard.





	The following standards have
	been published and are mandatory for Eldorado’s annual accounting periods no earlier than January 1, 2017:







	·




	IFRS 9

	‘Financial Instruments’

	– This standard
	was published in July 2014 and replaces the existing guidance in IAS 39, ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’.
	IFRS 9 includes revised guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments, including a new expected credit
	loss model for calculating impairment on financial assets, and the new general hedge accounting requirements. It also carries forward
	the guidance on recognition and derecognition of financial instruments from IAS 39. IFRS 9 is effective for annual reporting periods
	beginning on or after January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the extent of the impact
	of the adoption of this standard.

	MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS




	for the three and nine-month periods ended September30, 2014







	 





	 







	·




	IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ –
	This standard contains a single model that applies to contracts with customers and two approaches to recognising revenue: at a
	point in time or over time. The model features a contract-based five-step analysis of transactions to determine whether, how much
	and when revenue is recognized. New estimates and judgmental thresholds have been introduced, which may affect the amount and/or
	timing of revenue recognized. This standard is effective for fiscal years ending on or after December 31, 2017. The Company does
	not expect this standard to have a material impact on its financial statements.






	 




	Internal controls over financial reporting



	Eldorado’s management is responsible
	for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Any system of internal control over financial
	reporting, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations. As a result, even those systems determined to be effective can
	only provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and presentation of our financial statements. There have been no changes
	in our internal control over financial reporting in the third quarter of 2014 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
	likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.



	Qualified Person



	Except as otherwise
	noted, Norman Pitcher, P. Geo., our President, is the Qualified Person under NI 43-101 responsible for supervising the preparation
	of the scientific or technical information contained in this MD&A and verifying the technical data disclosed in this document
	relating to our operating mines and development projects.



	 




	Forward-looking
	information and risks



	This MD&A includes statements and information about what we expect
	to happen in the future. When we discuss our strategy, plans and future financial and operating performance, or other things that
	have not yet happened in this review, we are making statements considered to be

	forward-looking information

	or

	forward-looking
	statements

	under Canadian and United States securities laws. We refer to them in this document as

	forward-looking information

	.


	Key things to understand about the forward-looking information
	in this document:






	•


	It typically includes words and phrases about the future, such as:

	plan, expect, forecast, intend, anticipate, believe,
	estimate, budget, scheduled, may, could, would, might, will

	, as well as the negative of these words and phrases.








	•


	Although it represents our current views, which we consider to be reasonable, we can give no assurance that the forward-looking
	information will prove to be accurate.








	•


	It is based on a number of assumptions, including things like the future price of gold, anticipated costs and spending, and
	our ability to achieve our goals.








	•


	It is also subject to the risks associated with our business, including








	•


	the changing price of gold and currencies,








	•


	actual and estimated production and mineral reserves and resources,








	•


	the speculative nature of gold exploration,








	•


	risks associated with mining operations and development,








	•


	regulatory and permitting risks,








	•


	acquisition risks, and








	•


	other risks that are set out in our Annual Information Form.








	•


	If our assumptions prove to be incorrect or the risks materialize, our actual results and events may vary materially from what
	we currently expect.




	We recommend that you review our annual information form,
	which includes a more detailed discussion of material risks that could cause actual results to differ significantly from our current
	expectations.


	Forward-looking information is designed to help you understand
	management’s current views of our near and longer term prospects, and it may not be appropriate for other purposes. We will
	not necessarily update this information unless we are required to by securities laws.
