Glassman Wealth At A Glance



Fee-only?Yes


Fiduciary?Yes


Investment minimum?$2 million of investable assets


Substantial?$1 billion in assets managed
(As of 05/30/17)


Too big?Boutique by design


Reporting?Clear


Research?Extensive


Recognition?Earned


Refreshing!Why, thank you!




 
 
 




It's about dedication.
People engage our services because they know the stakes are too high to accept anything other than investment excellence. Some have achieved moderate success managing their own money, but they recognize that expert guidance will bring new possibilities within reach. Others have come to the realization that their current advisor isn’t truly focused on their unique goals.
People come to us for many reasons. They stay with us because we offer personalized, service-driven wealth management unlike anything they’ve experienced before.
 



It's about unbiased advice.
We're a fee-only firm that seeks to adhere to the highest fiduciary standards and provide our clients advice that is truly unbiased. We accept no commissions or other incentives that might cloud our judgment or sway our allegiance. We work for you and your family alone.
 



It's about communication.
We conduct extensive research to inform our financial strategies, but that’s not enough. You should know what’s in your portfolio and why. From our conversations with you to our reporting, we communicate in a way that is simple, streamlined, and easy to understand.
 
 
 











"Refreshing" isn’t a word many people associate with a wealth-services firm, but it’s how our clients describe us.
This is because we approach things differently. Because we’re not afraid to be candid. Because we manage over $993 million in assets (*), yet remain a resolutely boutique firm offering personalized service. And because despite the significant industry recognition we’ve achieved, we still care more about the reputation we’ve earned with our clients.

It's about dedication.
People engage our services because they know the stakes are too high to accept anything other than investment excellence.

Investment Management















We are goal driven. Just like you.
When we create your investment portfolio, we combine extensive research, due diligence and portfolio modeling that results in a smart strategy designed for you and your family.
A personalized approach
Every investment strategy begins with a conversation. We discuss your investment history and experience, your short and long-term needs, your retirement horizon, and the level of risk you are comfortable taking in order to clarify and better define your investment goals. Then we draw on these insights to build a diversified portfolio that’s closely aligned with your financial objectives.
An integrated team
We put a team of more than a dozen experts including investment managers, equity and fixed-income analysts, market strategists and research specialists to work for you. They seek out and review thousands of opportunities—carefully evaluating the associated costs and tax efficiencies as well as projected performance—before arriving at the right investment approach for you.
The team we employ includes:

Certified Financial Planner practitioners (CFP)
Chartered Financial Analysts (CFA)
Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA)
Masters of Business Administration (MBA)
Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst (CAIA)

We select team members not only for their impressive designations and expertise, but also for their ability to work together to develop smart investment strategies.
Comprehensive reporting
You should never have to wonder: “How am I doing?”
That’s why we provide reporting tools designed to help our clients see their financial picture clearly at all times.
Our clear, concise reports capture a wide range of information and present it in an easy-to-grasp format that lets you understand how your investments are performing. Every report compares your portfolio to industry benchmarks and the goals you’ve set.
View all of your assets in one place
Plus, we give you access to the latest technology for keeping track of all your investments—not just those you hold with us. From your own secure, online portal, you can see all your holdings, including 401(k)s, college funds, or private equity investments held with any other custodians you use. Your complete financial picture is there any time you need it, and the data is updated on a daily basis.
When you’re ready to set—and reach—ambitious goals, we’re here to help. Learn more about how we can help you plan better.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
