                "No introduction to the global phenomenon of missions has been as up-to-date, or, in many a day, as thorough and well organized as this superb volume by three outstanding mission scholars."-Ralph D. Winter, president, William Carey International University"This foundational volume is comprehensive, contemporary, and challenging. It speaks to the issues and concerns of the current student generation and introduces the reader to every major facet of the missionary enterprise. Well-chosen case studies, helpful diagrams, and attention-grabbing sidebars supplement the well-written text. Sections on encountering missions as a candidate, a sent one, and a sender make this book an outstanding text for an introductory missions course as well as an invaluable resource for prospective missionaries and local church leaders. I recommend it highly."-Kenneth B. Mulholland, Columbia Biblical Seminary and School of Missions

Search results are sorted by a combination of factors to give you a set of choices in response to your search criteria. These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions.

Product Description▼▲
As the first volume of the Encountering Mission series, this book provides a broad overview of world missions. The book is divided into five major sections. The first two provide the biblical and theological basis for missions as well as a historical survey. The following three sections consider the practical issues and contemporary challenges involved in mission work. The authors incorporate a number of features that add focus and insight to their broader survey. Chapters close with a case study to focus on important issues and concerns. There are also numerous sidebars, maps, and charts throughout the text that provide further details on particular subjects and raise questions for discussion. A teacher's manual (available on CD-ROM) includes additional case studies, historical documents, and PowerPoint slides for classroom presentation. As a bonus, a free CD-ROM containing the Evangelical Dictionary of World Missions is included in the back of each book. This comprehensive reference work contains over 1,400 articles on the theory, practice, theology, and history of mission.SMM 11/11/5 correction
