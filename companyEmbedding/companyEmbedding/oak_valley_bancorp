Can Oak Valley Bancorp’s (OVLY) ROE Continue To Surpass The Industry Average?



Alex Johannesen 


            				July 6, 2017			        


 While Oak Valley Bancorp’s (NASDAQ:OVLY) 10.3% ROE was above the industry average of 9.62%, the role of leverage must also be considered. Leverage can distort an ROE to a great extent. For instance, assuming interest costs are higher than a company’s earnings. The ROE might look impressive, but in reality the shareholders will take a hit instead achieving a positive return. See our latest analysis for OVLY 
What you must know about ROE
 ROE ratio basically calculates the net income as a percentage of total capital committed by shareholders, namely shareholders’ equity.Any ROE north of 20%, implying 20 cents return on every dollar invested, is favourable for any investor. But investors seek multiple assets to diversify risk and an industry-specific comparison makes more sense to achieve the goal of choosing the best among a given lot.

Return on Equity = Net Profit ÷ Shareholders Equity

 ROE above the cost of equity estimate indicates value creation, which apparently is the only reason shares rally. The cost of equity can be estimated through a popular and Nobel-prize winning method called Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). With a few sets of assumptions, the CAPM pegs OVLY’s cost of equity at 8.85%, compared to its ROE of 10.3%.

                         Using Dupont Analysis, we find out that ROE is composed of three ratios: profit margin, asset turnover, and financial leverage. The method reflects the impact of change in key figures in both the income statement and the balance sheet. The analysis provides a bird’s-eye view on the strengths and weaknesses of the company.

Dupont Formula
ROE = annual net profit ÷ shareholders’ equity
ROE = (annual net profit ÷ sales) × (sales ÷ assets) × (assets ÷ shareholders’ equity)
ROE = profit margin × asset turnover × financial leverage

 Among the ratios affecting ROE, the profit margin is the most important as it highlights the operational efficiency of a company. To a potential investor, the ideal scenario would be profit increasing at a higher rate than the revenue.Oak Valley Bancorp’s ROA over the past 12 months stood at 0.9% versus the industry’s 1.03%. Although an investor should look at multi-year asset turnover to assess its effect on the latest ROE, a quick comparison with the industry tells him whether it’s acceptable. We use ROA for the comparison as along with sales, used in asset turnover, earnings, used in ROA, are also comparable within the industry.

 The last but not the least is the financial leverage. It’s an important ratio as a company can hide its poor operating and asset-use efficiency by increasing leverage. Thus, along with ROE, we should look at the Return on capital, which reflects earnings as a percentage of overall capital employed, including debt. For OVLY, ROC stood at 14% versus the industry’s 0.18%.
ROE – It’s not just another ratio
 ROE is called the mother of all ratios for a reason. It helps gauge a company’s efficiency both through the income statement and the balance sheet, along with telling you how just changing the capital structure of the company can impact perceived return.
