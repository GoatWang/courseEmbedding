With a variable universal life policy, you can take advantage of potential economic growth because your policy value is invested in the stock market. Your policy also has the flexibility to adjust to your changing needs. Underlying sub-accounts are only available as investment options in variable insurance contracts issued by life insurance companies. They are not offered directly to the general public.
However, it also puts greater responsibility on you - you assume the investment and mortality risks, and you select and monitor your own underlying investment options, instead of the insurance company doing it for you.
Your insurance needs may change if your personal situation changes, for example if you get married, have a child or get a promotion. Make sure that these strategies and products are suitable for your long-term life insurance needs. Also, make sure you are able to continue premium payments so your policy doesn’t lapse if the market goes down. If you take a loan, withdrawal or partial or whole surrender your death benefit may be reduced, your policy may lapse or you may face tax consequences.
There are fees and charges for variable life insurance, including a cost of insurance based on characteristics of the insured person such as gender, health and age. There may also be underlying fund charges and expenses, and additional charges for riders that customize a policy to fit your individual needs.
Before purchasing a variable life insurance policy, you should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the policy and its underlying investment options. The product prospectus and underlying fund prospectus contain this and other important information. Click on any of the prospectus links to obtain a product prospectus. Underlying fund prospectuses can be obtained from your investment professional or by contacting Nationwide. Read the prospectus carefully before you make a purchase.
Guarantees and protections are subject to Nationwide's claims-paying ability. They don't apply to the investment performance or safety of the underlying investment options. Underlying sub accounts are only available as investment options in variable insurance contracts issued by life insurance companies. They are not offered directly to the general public.
Investment products offered are not FDIC-insured, may lose value, have no bank guarantee.
Variable products are sold by prospectus. Both the product prospectus and underlying fund prospectuses can be obtained from your investment professional or by writing to Nationwide Life Insurance Company. P.O. Box.182021 Columbus, OH 43218-2021. Before investing, carefully consider the fund's investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. The product prospectus and underlying fund prospectuses contain this and other important information. Read the prospectuses carefully before investing.
