intermediary (the "Securities Intermediary").             

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 

        Pursuant to the Base Trust Agreement, dated as of September 26, 2003
(the "Base Trust Agreement" and, as supplemented pursuant to the Series         
Supplement, the "Agreement"), between the Trustor and the Trustee, such         
parties may at any time and from time to time enter into a series supplement    
supplemental to the Base Trust Agreement for the purpose of creating a trust.   
Section 5.13 of the Base Trust Agreement provides that the Trustor may at any   
time and from time to time direct the Trustee to authenticate and deliver, on   
behalf of any such trust, a new Series of trust certificates. Each trust        
certificate of such new Series of trust certificates will represent a           
fractional undivided beneficial interest in such trust. Certain terms and       
conditions applicable to each such Series are to be set forth in the related    
series supplement to the Base Trust Agreement.                                  

   Pursuant to this Series Supplement, the Trustor and the Trustee
shall create and establish a new trust to be known as STRATS(SM) Trust For      
Morgan Stanley Securities, Series 2004-12, and a new Series of trust            
certificates to be issued thereby, which certificates shall be known as the     
STRATS(SM) Certificates, Series 2004-12, and the Trustor and the Trustee shall  
herein specify certain terms and conditions in respect thereof. The Trust       
shall also enter into a swap agreement (the "Swap Agreement") pursuant to       
which the Trust will exchange interest payments due on the Underlying           
Securities for payments from the Swap Counterparty which will be passed         
through to the Certificateholders.                                              

      The STRATS(SM) Certificates, Series 2004-12 shall be floating rate
Certificates (the "Certificates") issued in the form thereof set forth in       
Exhibit C.                                                                      

   On behalf of and pursuant to the authorizing resolutions of the
Board of Directors of the Trustor, an authorized officer of the Trustor has     
authorized the execution, authentication and delivery of the Certificates, and  
has authorized the Base Trust Agreement, the Swap Agreement (as defined         
below), and this Series Supplement in accordance with the terms of Section

usage which shall be applicable hereto.                                         

      (b) Pursuant to Article I of the Base Trust Agreement, the meaning
of certain defined terms used in the Base Trust Agreement shall, when applied

Swap Counterparty under the Swap Agreement to the extent Trust assets are       
sufficient therefor, including but not limited to all Unpaid Amounts upon the   
occurrence of any Swap Agreement Termination Event                              

    (b) The Trustee shall within 3 Business Days of the Closing Date
establish the Collateral Account. Any and all amounts at any time on deposit    
in the Collateral Account shall be held in trust by the Trustee for the         
benefit of Certificateholders and the Swap Counterparty; provided, that, the    
only permitted withdrawal from or application of funds on deposit in, or        
otherwise to the credit of, the Collateral Account shall be (i) for             
application to obligations of the Swap Counterparty to the Trust under the      
Swap Agreement in accordance with the terms of the Swap Agreement or (ii) to    
return Posted Collateral to the Swap Counterparty when and as required by the

and 8.10 of the Base Trust Agreement and any other provision of the Base Trust  
Agreement which imposes obligations on or creates rights in favor of the        
Trustee or the Certificateholders as a result of or in connection with an       
"Event of Default" or "Administrative Agent Termination Event" shall be         
inapplicable with respect to the Certificates. In addition, there is no         
"Administrative Agent" specified herein, and all references to "Administrative  
Agent" in the Base Trust Agreement, therefore shall be inapplicable with        
respect to the Certificates.                                                    

Section 10. Distributions. (a) On each Distribution Date, so long as
no Swap Agreement Termination Event has occurred for which the Trust is the     
Defaulting Party or an Affected Party, the Trustee shall distribute to the      
Certificateholders the Interest Collections. On the Maturity Date, and to the   
extent received on any other Scheduled Distribution Date, so long as no Swap    
Agreement Termination Event has occurred for which the Trust is the Defaulting  
Party or an Affected Party, the Trustee shall distribute to the                 
Certificateholders, the principal amount of the Underlying Securities to the    
extent the principal of the Underlying Securities is received by the Trustee    
on such date or during the related Collection Period plus any accrued interest  
thereon.                                                                        

        (b) If a Swap Agreement Termination Event has occurred for which the
Trust is the Defaulting Party or an Affected Party the Trustee, first, shall    
distribute all collections received on the Underlying Securities to the Swap    
Counterparty until all amounts owing to the Swap Counterparty under the Swap    
Agreement for payments in connection with such Swap Agreement Termination       
Event (including any Unpaid Amounts) have been paid in full and, second, shall  
distribute all remaining amounts to the Certificateholders. If the              
distribution in the preceding sentence is insufficient to pay in full all       
amounts owing to the Swap Counterparty, the Trustee shall proceed to liquidate  
or distribute the Underlying Securities in accordance with                      

7   

P-->EX-4.111th�Page�of�79TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�11th
Section 10(h). Upon any liquidation of the Underlying Securities, the Trustee,  
first, shall distribute the proceeds thereof to the Swap Counterparty until     
all amounts owing to the Swap Counterparty have been paid in full and, second,  
shall distribute all remaining amounts to the Certificateholders. In the event  
of a Swap Agreement Termination Event, after paying all amounts due to the      
Swap Counterparty as set forth in the first sentence of this Section 10(b), if  
no Trust Termination Event has occurred, all Interest Collections shall         
thereafter be distributed to Certificateholders on each applicable              
Distribution Date. If a Swap Agreement Termination Event has occurred for       
which the Swap Counterparty is the Defaulting Party or the only Affected        
Party, notwithstanding the termination of the Swap Agreement, the Trustee       
shall distribute any Unpaid Amounts to the Swap Counterparty from Interest      
Collections on the Underlying Securities.                                       

  (c) In all cases hereunder, if any payment with respect to the
Underlying Securities is made to the Trustee after the Underlying Securities    
Payment Date on which such payment was due, the Trustee shall distribute such   
amount received on the Business Day following such receipt.                     

        (d) In the event of a Payment Default while the Swap Agreement is in
effect and if any payment is due to the Swap Counterparty, the Underlying       
Securities will be liquidated in accordance with Section 10(h). Otherwise, in   
the event of a Payment Default, the Trustee shall proceed against the           
Underlying Securities Issuer on behalf of the Certificateholders to enforce     
the Underlying Securities or otherwise to protect the interests of the          
Certificateholders, subject to the receipt of indemnity in form and substance   
satisfactory to the Trustee; provided, that Holders of the Certificates         
representing a majority of the Voting Rights on the Certificates will be        
entitled to direct the Trustee in any such proceeding or direct the Trustee to  
sell the Underlying Securities, subject to the Trustee's receipt of             
satisfactory indemnity.                                                         

      (e) In the event of an Acceleration and a corresponding payment on
the Underlying Securities prior to any liquidation of the Underlying            
Securities hereunder, the Trustee shall distribute the proceeds to the          
Certificateholders no later than two (2) Business Days after the receipt of     
immediately available funds pursuant to Section 10(b).                          

     (f) In the event the Trustee receives property other than cash in
respect of the Underlying Securities such property will be applied first, to    
the Swap Counterparty until all amounts owing to the Swap Counterparty have     
been paid in full and, second, to the Certificateholders. Property other than   
cash will be liquidated by the Trustee, and the proceeds thereof distributed    
in cash, to the extent necessary to pay to the Swap Counterparty all amounts    
owed to it under the Swap Agreement and, thereafter, to the extent necessary    
to avoid distribution of fractional securities to Certificateholders. In-kind   
distribution of Underlying Securities or other property to Certificateholders   
will be deemed to reduce the Stated Amount of Certificates on a proportionate   
basis. Following such in-kind distribution, all Certificates will be            
cancelled. No amounts will be distributed to the Trustor in respect of the      
Underlying Securities. The Swap Counterparty shall direct the Trustee with      
respect to any liquidation of such property to the extent of the full amount    
owed to it under the Swap Agreement.                                            

  (g) If an SEC Reporting Failure occurs, then the Trustor shall
promptly notify the Trustee, the Swap Counterparty and the Rating Agency of     
such SEC Reporting Failure and                                                  

8   

P-->EX-4.112th�Page�of�79TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�12th
the Trustee shall proceed to liquidate or distribute the Underlying Securities  
in accordance with Section 10(h).                                               

      (h) If at any time, the Trustee is directed to sell the Underlying
Securities, the Trustee shall solicit bids for the sale of the Underlying       
Securities with settlement thereof on or before the third (3rd) Business Day    
after such sale from three leading dealers in the relevant market, which may    
include but is not limited to any three of the following dealers: (1) Wachovia  
Securities, (2) Goldman, Sachs & Co., (3) Lehman Brothers Inc., (4) Merrill     
Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, (5) Citigroup Global Markets Inc.,  
(6) J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and (7) Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.;          
provided, however, that no bid from Wachovia Securities or any affiliate        
thereof shall be accepted unless such bid equals the then fair market value of  
such Underlying Securities. The Trustee shall not be responsible for the        
failure to obtain a bid so long as it has made reasonable efforts to obtain     
bids. If a bid for the sale of the Underlying Securities has been accepted by   
the Trustee but the sale has failed to settle on the proposed settlement date,  
the Trustee shall request new bids from such leading dealers. In any            
circumstance in which the sale of the Underlying Securities is required         
hereunder, the Trustee shall, to the extent it is so directed by the Trustor,   
provide Certificateholders with the option to elect to receive an "in-kind"     
distribution of their pro rata share of the Underlying Securities; provided,    
that, (1) an in-kind distribution shall be subject to the prior sale of         
Underlying Securities in accordance with the provisions of this Section 10(h)   
to the extent necessary, to pay any amounts owing to the Swap Counterparty      
under Section 10(b), (2) a Certificateholders' pro rata share of the            
Underlying Securities shall be a principal amount of Underlying Securities      
equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Underlying Securities            
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the Stated Amount of that    
holder's Certificates and the denominator of which is the aggregate principal   
amount of the Underlying Securities minus the amount required to be             
distributed to the Swap Counterparty pursuant to the second sentence of         
Section 10(b) and (3) odd-lot amounts that cannot be distributed in-kind        
because they are not within the authorized denominations of the Underlying      
Securities shall be distributed in cash. Any such in-kind distribution shall    
constitute the final distribution in respect of the Certificates as to which    
such option is exercised.                                                       

    (i) Distributions to the Certificateholders on each Distribution
Date will be made to the Certificateholders of record on the Record Date.       

      (j) All distributions to Certificateholders shall be allocated pro
rata among the Certificates based on their respective Outstanding Amounts as    
of the Record Date.                                                             

       (k) Notwithstanding any provision of the Agreement to the contrary,
to the extent funds are available, the Trustee will initiate payment in         
immediately available funds by 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on each           
Distribution Date of all amounts payable to each Certificateholder with         
respect to any Certificate held by such Certificateholder or its nominee        
(without the necessity for any presentation or surrender thereof or any         
notation of such payment thereon) in the manner and at the address as each      
Certificateholder may from time to time direct the Trustee in writing 15 days   
prior to such Distribution Date requesting that such payment will be so made    
and designating the bank account to which such payments shall be so made. The   
Trustee shall be entitled to rely on the last instruction delivered by the      
Certificateholder pursuant to this Section 10(f) unless a new instruction is    
delivered 15 days prior to a Distribution Date.

        (l) The rights of the Certificateholders to receive distributions in
respect of the Certificates, and all interests of the Certificateholders in     
such distributions, shall be as set forth in this Series Supplement. The        
Trustee shall in no way be responsible or liable to the Certificateholders nor  
shall any Certificateholder in any way be responsible or liable to any other    
Certificateholder in respect of amounts previously distributed on the           
Certificates based on their respective Outstanding Amounts.                     

Section 11. Termination of Trust. (a) The Trust shall terminate upon
the occurrence of any Trust Termination Event.                                  

   (b) Except for any reports and other information required to be
provided to Certificateholders hereunder and under the Base Trust Agreement     
and except as otherwise specified herein and therein, the obligations of the    
Trustee will terminate upon the distribution to the Swap Counterparty and       
Certificateholders of all amounts required to be distributed to them and the    
disposition of all Underlying Securities held by the Trustee. The Trust shall   
thereupon terminate, except for surviving rights of indemnity.                  

Section 12. Limitation of Powers and Duties. (a) The Trustee shall
administer the Trust and the Underlying Securities solely as specified herein   
and in the Base Trust Agreement.                                                

        (b) The Trust is constituted solely for the purpose of acquiring and
holding the Underlying Securities, entering into and performing its             
obligations under the Swap Agreement and issuing the Certificates. The Trustee  
is not authorized to acquire any other investments or engage in any activities  
not authorized herein and, in particular, unless expressly provided in the      
Agreement, the Trustee is not authorized (i) to sell, assign, transfer,         
exchange, pledge, set-off or otherwise dispose of any of the Underlying         
Securities, once acquired, or interests therein, including to                   
Certificateholders, (ii) to merge or consolidate the Trust with any other       
entity, or (iii) to do anything that would materially increase the likelihood   
that the Trust will fail to qualify as a grantor trust for United States        
federal income tax purposes. In addition, the Trustee has no power to create,   
assume or incur indebtedness or other liabilities in the name of the Trust      
other than as contemplated herein and in the Base Trust Agreement.              

      (c) The parties acknowledge that the Trustee, as the holder of the
Underlying Securities, has the right to vote and give consents and waivers in   
respect of the Underlying Securities and enforce the other rights, if any, of   
a holder of the Underlying Securities, except as otherwise limited by the Base  
Trust Agreement or this Series Supplement. In the event that the Trustee        
receives a request from the Underlying Securities Trustee, the Underlying       
Securities Issuer or, if applicable, the Depositary with respect to the         
Underlying Securities, for the Trustee's consent to any amendment,              
modification or waiver of the Underlying Securities, or any document relating   
thereto, or receives any other solicitation for any action with respect to the  
Underlying Securities, the Trustee shall within two (2) Business Days mail a    
notice of such proposed amendment, modification, waiver or solicitation to the  
Swap Counterparty and each Certificateholder of record as of the date of such   
request. The Trustee shall request instructions from the Certificateholders as  
to what action to take in response to such request and shall be protected in    
taking no action if no direction is received. Except as otherwise provided      
herein, the Trustee shall consent or vote, or refrain from consenting or        
voting, in the same proportion (based                                           

10  

P-->EX-4.114th�Page�of�79TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�14th
on the Stated Amounts of the Certificates of each Class as allocated based on   
the respective Voting Rights of each Class) as the Certificates were actually   
voted or not voted by the Holders thereof as of the date determined by the      
Trustee prior to the date such vote or consent is required; provided, however,  
that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Base Trust Agreement or   
this Series Supplement, the Trustee shall at no time vote in favor of or        
consent to any matter (i) which would alter the timing or amount of any         
payment on the Underlying Securities (including, without limitation, any        
demand to accelerate the Underlying Securities) or (ii) which would result in   
the exchange or substitution of any Underlying Security whether or not          
pursuant to a plan for the refunding or refinancing of such Underlying          
Security, except in each case with the unanimous consent of the                 
Certificateholders; provided, further, that the Trustee shall not take any      
such action if it would affect the method, amount or timing of payments due to  
the Swap Counterparty or otherwise materially adversely affect the interests    
of the Swap Counterparty under the Swap Agreement and result in a Swap          
Agreement Termination Event, in each case without the prior written consent of  
the Swap Counterparty. The Trustee shall have no liability for any failure to   
act or to refrain from acting resulting from the Certificateholders' late       
return of, or failure to return, directions requested by the Trustee from the   
Certificateholders.                                                             

       (d) Notwithstanding any provision of the Agreement to the contrary,
the Trustee may require from the Certificateholders prior to taking any action  
at the direction of the Certificateholders, an indemnity agreement of a         
Certificateholder or any of its Affiliates to provide for security or           
indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities the Trustee may incur by  
reason of any such action. An unsecured indemnity agreement, if acceptable to   
the Trustee, shall be deemed to be sufficient to satisfy such security or       
indemnity requirement.                                                          

       (e) Notwithstanding any provision of the Agreement to the contrary,
the Trustee shall act as the sole Authenticating Agent, Paying Agent and        
Registrar.                                                                      

Section 13. Compensation of Trustee. The Trustee shall be entitled
to receive from the Trustor as compensation for its services hereunder,         
trustee's fees pursuant to a separate agreement between the Trustee and the     
Trustor, and shall be reimbursed for all reasonable expenses, disbursements     
and advances incurred or made by it (including the reasonable compensation,     
disbursements and expenses of its counsel and other persons not regularly in    
its employ). The Trustor shall indemnify and hold harmless the Trustee and its  
successors, assigns, agents and servants against any and all loss, liability    
or reasonable expense (including attorney's fees) incurred by it in connection  
with the administration of this trust and the performance of its duties         
thereunder. The Trustee shall notify the Trustor promptly of any claim for      
which it may seek indemnity. Failure by the Trustee to so notify the Trustor    
shall not relieve the Trustor of its obligations hereunder. The Trustor need    
not reimburse any expense or indemnify against any loss, liability or expense   
incurred by the Trustee through the Trustee's own willful misconduct,           
negligence or bad faith. The indemnities contained in this Section 13 shall     
survive the resignation or termination of the Trustee or the termination of     
this Agreement.                                                                 

     Failure by the Trustor to pay, reimburse or indemnify the Trustee
shall not entitle the Trustee to any payment, reimbursement or indemnification  
from the Trust, nor shall such failure release the Trustee from the duties it   
is required to perform under this Series Supplement. Any unpaid, unreimbursed   
or unindemnified amounts shall not be borne by the Trust and shall              

11  

P-->EX-4.115th�Page�of�79TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�15th
not constitute a claim against the Trust, but shall be borne by the Trustee in  
its individual capacity, and the Trustee shall have no recourse against the     
Trust with respect thereto.                                                     

Section 14. Modification or Amendment of the Base Trust Agreement,
the Series Supplement or the Swap Agreement. (a) The Trustee shall not enter    
into any modification or amendment of the Base Trust Agreement or this Series   
Supplement unless such modification or amendment is in accordance with Section  
10.1 of the Base Trust Agreement. If the Rating Agency Condition is not         
satisfied with respect to any proposed modification or amendment of the Base    
Trust Agreement or this Series Supplement, then any such modification or        
amendment must be approved by 100% of the Certificateholders. The Trustee       
shall not enter into any amendment or modification of this Agreement that       
would affect the method, amount or timing of payment due to the Swap            
Counterparty or the consent rights of the Swap Counterparty hereunder or        
otherwise materially adversely affect the interests of the Swap Counterparty    
under the Swap Agreement and result in a Swap Agreement Termination Event, in   
each case without the prior written consent of the Swap Counterparty. The       
Trustee shall provide fifteen Business Days written notice to the Swap          
Counterparty before entering into any amendment or modification of this         
Agreement pursuant to this Section 14.                                          

      (b) The Trustee shall not enter into any modification or amendment
of the Swap Agreement without the prior written consent of holders of           
Certificates representing 66 ?% of the Voting Rights and without prior written  
confirmation from the Rating Agency that such amendment will not result in a    
reduction or withdrawal of the then current rating of the Certificates;         
provided, however, that each of the Swap Counterparty and the Trustee may       
amend the Swap Agreement without the prior written consent of                   
Certificateholders to cure any ambiguity in, or to correct or supplement any    
provision of the Swap Agreement which may be inconsistent with any other        
provision of the Swap Agreement, or to otherwise cure any defect in the Swap    
Agreement, provided that any such amendment does not materially adversely       
affect the interest of the Certificateholders and that the Rating Agency will   
have given its prior written confirmation that such amendment will not result   
in a reduction or withdrawal of the then current rating of the Certificates;    
provided further, however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no    
amendment may alter the timing or amount of any payment on the Swap Agreement   
without the prior consent of 100% of the Certificateholders and without giving  
the Rating Agency prior written notice of any such amendment.                   

       (c) Until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge
of the occurrence of an event that would constitute a Swap Agreement            
Termination Event, the Trustee shall be entitled to assume (and shall be fully  
protected, indemnified and held harmless in doing so) that no Swap Agreement    
Termination Event has occurred and may accordingly seek instructions under      
Section 12 and this Section 14 exclusively from the Swap Counterparty.          

Section 15. Assignment of Rights under the Swap Agreement. The
Trustee may consent to any transfer or assignment by the Swap Counterparty of   
its rights under the Swap Agreement, so long as the Rating Agency shall have    
given its prior written confirmation that such transfer or assignment will not  
result in a reduction or withdrawal of the then current rating of the           
Certificates.

 Section 16. Accounting. Notwithstanding Section 3.16 of the Base
Trust Agreement, "Independent Public Accountants' Administration Report," no    
such accounting reports shall be required. Pursuant to Section 4.2 of the Base  
Trust Agreement, "Reports to Certificateholders," the Trustee shall cause the   
statement described in Section 4.2 to be prepared and forwarded as provided     
therein.                                                                        

Section 17. No Investment of Amounts Received on Underlying 
Securities. All amounts received on or with respect to the Underlying           
Securities shall be held uninvested by the Trustee.                             

Section 18. No Event of Default. There shall be no Events of Default
defined with respect to the Certificates.                                       

Section 19. Notices. (a) All directions, demands and notices

the Rating Agency may designate in writing to the parties hereto.               

     (c) In the event a Payment Default or an Acceleration occurs, the
Trustee shall promptly give notice to the Swap Counterparty and to the          
Depositary or, for any Certificates which are not then held by the Depositary   
or any other depository, directly to the registered holders of the              
Certificates thereof. Such notice shall set forth (i) the identity of the       
issue of Underlying Securities, (ii) the date and nature of such Payment        
Default or Acceleration, (iii) the principal amount of the interest or          
principal in default, (iv) the Certificates affected by the Payment Default or

        (d) Notwithstanding any provisions of the Agreement to the contrary,
the Trustee shall deliver all notices or reports required to be delivered to    
or by the Trustee or the Trustor to the Certificateholders or the Swap          
Counterparty without charge to such Certificateholders or the Swap              
Counterparty.                                                                   

       (e) The Trustee shall, in connection with any notice or delivery of
documents to Certificateholders (whether or not such notice or delivery is      
required pursuant to the

Agreement), provide such notice or documents to the Swap Counterparty           
concurrently with the delivery thereof to the Certificateholders.               

Section 20. Access to Certain Documentation. Access to documentation
regarding the Underlying Securities will be afforded without charge to any      
Certificateholder so requesting pursuant to Section 3.17 of the Base Trust      
Agreement, "Access to Certain Documentation." Additionally, the Trustee shall   
provide at the request of any Certificateholder without charge to such

subject to the transfer restrictions set forth herein.                          

Section 21. Advances. There is no Administrative Agent specified
herein; hence no person (including the Trustee) shall be permitted or           
obligated to make Advances as described in Section 4.3 of the Base Trust        
Agreement, "Advances."

Section 22. Ratification of Agreement. With respect to the Series
issued hereby, the Base Trust Agreement (including the grant of a security      
interest in Section 10.8 of the Base Trust Agreement with respect to the        
Underlying Securities conveyed hereunder), as supplemented by this Series       
Supplement, is in all respects ratified and confirmed, and the Base Trust       
Agreement as so supplemented by this Series Supplement shall be read, taken     
and construed as one and the same instrument. To the extent there is any        
inconsistency between the terms of the Base Trust Agreement and this Series     
Supplement, the terms of this Series Supplement shall govern.                   

Section 23. Counterparts. This Series Supplement may be executed in
any number of counterparts, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an  
original, but all of such counterparts shall together constitute but one and    
the same instrument.                                                            

Section 24. Governing Law. This Series Supplement and each  
Certificate issued hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance   
with the laws of the State of New York applicable to agreements made and to be  
performed entirely therein without reference to such State's principles of      
conflicts of law to the extent that the application of the laws of another      
jurisdiction would be required thereby, and the obligations, rights and         
remedies of the parties hereunder shall be determined in accordance with such   
laws. The State of New York is the securities intermediary's jurisdiction of    
the Securities Intermediary for purposes of the UCC.                            

Section 25. Certificate of Compliance. The Trustor shall deliver to
the Trustee and the Swap Counterparty on or prior to June 30 of each year       
prior to a Trust Termination Event the Officer's Certificate as to compliance   
as required by Section 6.1(b) of the Base Trust Agreement.                      

Section 26. Certain Filing to be Made by the Trustee. In the event
that an event requiring the sale of the Underlying Securities under this        
Agreement occurs and the Underlying Securities are liquidated at a loss, the    
Trustee will disclose pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4 the      
loss in accordance with the procedures of such regulation, unless the Trustee   
obtains advice from counsel that such disclosure is not necessary. In general,  
the Trustee

will (x) attach a completed Form 8886 to its tax return in the year the         
requisite loss occurs and (y) file a completed form with the Office of Tax      
Shelter Analysis (OTSA) at: Internal Revenue Service LM:PFTG:OTSA, Large and    
Midsize Business Division, 1111 Constitution Avenue., NW., Washington DC 20224  
(or such other address subsequently required).                                  

Section 27. Establishment of Accounts. The Securities Intermediary
and the Trustee hereby represent and warrant that:                              

       (a) Each Account for the Trust is a "securities account" within the
meaning of Section 8-501 of the UCC and is held only in the name of the         
Trustee on behalf of the Trust. The Securities Intermediary is acting in the    
capacity of a "securities intermediary" within the meaning of Section           
8-102(a)(14) of the UCC;                                                        

(b) All Underlying Securities have been (i) delivered to the
Securities Intermediary pursuant to the Agreement and (ii) credited to the      
Certificate Account; and                                                        

       (c) Each Account is an account to which financial assets are or may
be credited, and the Securities Intermediary shall treat the Trustee as         
entitled to exercise the rights that comprise any financial asset credited to   
the Accounts.                                                                   

Section 28. Statement of Intent. It is the intention of the parties
hereto that, for purposes of federal income taxes, state and local income and   
franchise taxes and any other taxes imposed upon, measured by or based upon     
gross or net income, the Trust shall be treated as a grantor trust, but         
failing that, as a partnership (other than a publicly traded partnership        
taxable as a corporation) and, in any event, shall not be classified as a       
corporation. The parties hereto agree that, unless otherwise required by        
appropriate tax authorities, the Trustee shall file or cause to be filed        
annual or other necessary returns, reports and other forms consistent with      
such intended characterization. In the event that the Trust is characterized    
by appropriate tax authorities as a partnership for federal income tax          
purposes, each Certificateholder, by its acceptance of its Certificate, agrees  
to report its respective share of the items of income, deductions, and credits  
of the Trust on its respective returns (making such elections as to individual  
items as may be appropriate) in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section    
1.761-2(b) (the "761 Election") and in a manner consistent with the complete    
exclusion of the Trust from subchapter K of the Code. The terms of the          
Agreement shall be interpreted to further these intentions of the parties. As   
further consideration for each Certificateholder's purchase of a Certificate,   
each such Certificateholder is deemed to agree not to irrevocably delegate to   
any person (for a period of more than one year) authority to purchase, sell or  
exchange its Certificates.                                                      

       Each Certificateholder (and each beneficial owner of a Certificate)
by acceptance of its Certificate (or its beneficial interest therein) agrees,   
unless otherwise required by appropriate tax authorities, to file its own tax   
returns and reports in a manner consistent with the characterization indicated  
above.                                                                          

Section 29. Filing of Partnership Returns. In the event that the
Trust is characterized (by appropriate tax authorities) as a partnership for    
United States federal income tax purposes, and the 761 Election is              
ineffective, the Trustor agrees to reimburse the Trust for any expenses         
associated with the filing of partnership returns (or returns related           
thereto).

further consent by the Trustor or any other Person. The Securities              
Intermediary shall take all instructions (including without limitation all      
notifications and entitlement orders) with respect to the Accounts solely from  
the Trustee.

Intermediary hereby confirms and agrees that:                                   

(a) There are no other agreements entered into between the  
Securities Intermediary and the Trustor with respect to the Accounts. Each      
Account and all property credited to the Account is not subject to, and the     
Securities Intermediary hereby waives, any lien, security interest, right of

claiming through the Securities Intermediary (other than the Trustee);          

 (b) It has not entered into, and until the termination of the
Agreement will not enter into, any agreement with any other Person relating to  
the Accounts and/or any financial assets credited thereto pursuant to which it  
has agreed to comply with entitlement orders of any Person other than the       
Trustee; and                                                                    

 (c) It has not entered into, and until the termination of the
Agreement will not enter into, any agreement with any Person purporting to      
limit or condition the obligation of the Securities Intermediary to comply      
with entitlement orders as set forth in Section 31 hereof.

Representations. The Trustee and the Securities Intermediary each hereby

        (b) The Trustee and the Securities Intermediary each has not granted

Intermediary in its individual capacity; the Trustee and the Securities         
Intermediary each has no actual knowledge and has not received actual notice    
of any lien on the Underlying Securities (other than any liens of the Trustee   
in favor of the beneficiaries of the Trust Agreement); other than the           
interests of the Trustee, the Certificateholders and the Swap Counterparty,     
the books and records of the Trustee and the Securities Intermediary each do    
not identify any Person as having an interest in the Underlying Securities;     
and

represents and warrants to the Trustee as follows:                              

     (a) Immediately prior to the sale of the Underlying Securities to
the Trustee, the Trustor, as Depositor, owned and had good and marketable       
title to the Underlying Securities free and clear of any lien, claim or         
encumbrance of any Person;

Section 36. Additional Rights of the Swap Counterparty. Section 10.8

provided for under Section 10.8(b)(3), secure all of the obligations of the     
Trustor and the Trust to the Swap Counterparty under the Swap Agreement and     
this Agreement. The Swap Counterparty shall have the rights of a third party

disposition of all

amounts acquired therefrom in accordance with this Agreement and the Swap       
Agreement and the disposition of the final payments received under the Swap     
Agreement.

 On any Business Day occurring on or after September 15, 2005,
subject to satisfaction of all of the conditions set forth in clause (b), the   
Depositor may exchange Certificates held by it for a distribution of            
Underlying Securities representing the same percentage of the Underlying        
Securities as such Certificates represent of all outstanding Certificates.      

      (a) The following conditions shall apply to any Optional Exchange.

        (A) A notice specifying the number of Certificates being surrendered
  and the optional exchange date shall be delivered to the Trustee no less
than 5 days (or such shorter period acceptable to the Trustee) but not
more than 30 days before the optional exchange date.                  

      (B) Certificates shall be surrendered to the trustee no later than
10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the optional exchange date.        

     (C) The Trustee shall have received an opinion of counsel stating
  that the Optional Exchange would not cause the Trust to be treated as an
 association or publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for
federal income tax purposes.                                          

 (D) No more than one (1) Optional Exchange shall occur in any
Collection Period.                                                    

  (E) The Trustee shall not be obligated to determine whether an
 Optional Exchange complies with the applicable provisions for exemption
   under Rule 3a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the
rules or regulations promulgated thereunder.                          

       (F) The provisions of Section 4.5 of the Base Trust Agreement shall
not apply to an Optional Exchange pursuant to this Section 39. This   
  Section 39 shall not provide any Person with a lien against, an interest
in or a right to specific performance with respect to the Underlying  
Securities; provided that satisfaction of the conditions set forth in 
this Section 39 shall entitle the Depositor to a distribution thereof.

    (G) The aggregate principal balance of Certificates exchanged in
 connection with any Optional Exchange pursuant to this Section 39 shall
 be in an amount that results in a distribution of Underlying Securities
in an even multiple of the minimum denomination of the Underlying     
Securities.                                                           

18  

P-->EX-4.122nd�Page�of�79TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�22nd
    (H) No Swap Agreement Termination Event shall have occurred as a
result of the Optional Exchange except to the extent of a termination 
  resulting from the reduction in the Hedge Notional Amount (as defined in
the Swap Agreement) to an amount equal to the principal amount of the 
Underlying Securities after giving effect to the Optional Exchange.   

I(I)        Any payments due under the Swap Agreement as a result of the        
         reduction in such Hedge Notional Amount and any such Swap Agreement
 Termination Event (x) that are due to the Swap Counterparty
        (including but not limited to Unpaid Amounts) shall have been paid
        to the Swap Counterparty by the Depositor and (y) that are payable
       by the Swap Counterparty, shall be payable for the account of the
Depositor.                                                

       Section 40. ERISA Restrictions. Certificates may not be acquired by
or for the account of any employee benefit plan, trust or account, including    
an individual retirement account, that is subject to the requirements of Title  
I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or that   
is described in Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code, or by or for the account of     
any entity whose underlying assets include any assets subject to these laws by  
reason of investment in that entity by such plans, trusts or accounts. By       
accepting and holding any Certificate, the holder of the Certificate will be    
deemed to have represented and warranted that it is not a plan or entity        
described above, and that its acquisition and holding of the Certificate are    
in compliance with the foregoing restrictions.

Supplement 2004-12, dated as of September 9, 2004 (the "Series Supplement"      
and, together with the Agreement, the "Trust Agreement"), between the Trustor   
and the Trustee. This Certificate does not purport to summarize the Trust       
Agreement and reference is hereby made to the Trust Agreement for information   
with respect to the interests, rights, benefits, obligations, proceeds and      
duties evidenced hereby and the rights, duties and obligations of the Trustee   
with respect hereto. A copy of the Trust Agreement may be obtained from the     
Trustee by written request sent to the Corporate Trust Office. Capitalized      
terms used but not defined herein have the meanings assigned to them in the     
Trust Agreement.                                                                

   This Certificate is one of the duly authorized Certificates designated as
"STRATS(SM) Certificates, Series 2004-12 (herein called the "Certificate" or    
"Certificates"). This Certificate is issued under and is subject to the terms,  
provisions and conditions of the Trust Agreement, to which Trust Agreement the  
Holder of this Certificate by virtue of the acceptance hereof assents and by    
which such Holder is bound. The assets of the Trust include the Underlying      
Securities, all proceeds of the Underlying Securities and the Trust's rights    
under the Swap Agreement.                                                       

Under the Trust Agreement, there shall be distributed on the dates    
specified in the Trust Agreement (a "Distribution Date"), to the person in      
whose name this Certificate is registered at the close of business on the       
related Record Date, such Certificateholder's fractional undivided interest in  
the amount of distributions of the Underlying Securities to be distributed to   
Certificateholders on such Distribution Date and distributions to the Trust     
under the Swap Agreement. The Underlying Securities will pay interest on April  
1 and October 1 of each year. The principal of the Underlying Securities is     
scheduled to be paid on April 1, 2014. The Swap Agreement provides for          
payments on the 1st day of each January, April, July and October commencing in  
October 2004.                                                                   

   The distributions in respect of this Certificate are payable in such coin
or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal  
tender for payment of public and private debts as set forth in the Series       
Trust Agreement.                                                                

  The Underlying Securities held by the Trust are subject to the rights of
the Swap Counterparty, as provided for in the Series Supplement and the Swap    
Agreement, and each Certificateholder, by accepting its Certificate,            
acknowledges such rights in accordance with the terms of the Series Supplement  
and the Swap Agreement.                                                         

   It is the intent of the Trustor and the Certificateholders that the Trust
will be classified as a grantor trust under subpart E, Part I of subchapter J   
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Except as otherwise required  
by appropriate taxing authorities, the Trustor and the Trustee, by executing    
the Trust Agreement, and each Certificateholder, by acceptance of a             
Certificate, agrees to treat, and to take no action inconsistent with the       
treatment of, the Certificates for such tax purposes as interests in a grantor  
trust and the provisions of the Trust Agreement shall be interpreted to         
further this intention of the parties.                                          

By acceptance of a Certificate, each Certificateholder (1) elects to  
integrate the Underlying Securities and the Swap Agreement for United States    
federal income tax purposes, (2) authorizes and directs the trustee (or the     
trustee's agent) to retain, as part of the Certificateholder's books and        
records, information that (a) describes the Underlying Securities               

C-2   

P-->EX-4.128th�Page�of�79TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�28th
and the Swap Agreement, (b) identifies the two positions as integrated for      
federal income tax purposes and (c) describes the features of the resulting     
"synthetic" debt instrument and (3) agrees to retain copies of such             
information as provided to the Certificateholder by the Trust.                  

   Each Certificateholder, by its acceptance of a Certificate, covenants and
agrees that such Certificateholder shall not, prior to the date which is one    
year and one day after the termination of the Trust Agreement, acquiesce,       
petition or otherwise invoke or cause the Trustor to invoke the process of any  
court or governmental authority for the purpose of commencing or sustaining a   
case against the Trustor under any federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency,     
reorganization or similar law or appointing a receiver, liquidator, assignee,   
trustee, custodian, sequestrator or other similar official of the Trustor or    
any substantial part of its property, or ordering the winding up or             
liquidation of the affairs of the Trustor.                                      

Certificates may not be acquired by or for the account of any employee
benefit plan, trust or account, including an individual retirement account,     
that is subject to the requirements of Title I of the Employee Retirement       
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or that is described in Section        
4975(e)(1) of the Code, or by or for the account of any entity whose            
underlying assets include any assets subject to these laws by reason of         
investment in that entity by such plans, trusts or accounts. By accepting and   
holding this Certificate, the holder of this Certificate will be deemed to      
have represented and warranted that it is not a plan or entity described        
above, and that its acquisition and holding of this Certificate are in          
compliance with the foregoing restrictions.                                     

The Trust Agreement permits the amendment thereof, in certain         
circumstances, without the consent of the Holders of any of the Certificates.   

  Unless the certificate of authentication hereon shall have been executed
by an authorized officer of the Trustee by manual signature, this Certificate   
shall not entitle the Holder hereof to any benefit under the Trust Agreement    
or be valid for any purpose.                                                    

A copy of the Trust Agreement is available upon request and all of its
terms and conditions are hereby incorporated by reference and made a part       
hereof.                                                                         

THIS CERTIFICATE SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE
STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REFERENCE TO ITS CONFLICT OF LAW PROVISIONS, AND     
THE OBLIGATIONS, RIGHTS AND REMEDIES OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE          
DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH LAWS.

MASTER AGREEMENT  

dated as of September 9, 2004 

WACHOVIA BANK, NATIONAL                and  STRATS(SM) TRUST FOR MORGAN STANLEY 
ASSOCIATION                                 SECURITIES, SERIES 2004-12          

have entered and/or anticipate entering into one of more transactions (each a   
"Transaction") that are or will be governed by this Master Agreement, which     
includes the schedule (the "Schedule"), and the documents and other confirming  
evidence (each a "Confirmation") exchanged between the parties confirming       
those Transactions.                                                             

Accordingly, the parties agree as follows: --                                   

1.   Interpretation                                                             

(a)  Definitions. The terms defined in Section 14 and in the Schedule will      
have the meanings therein specified for the purpose of this Master Agreement.   

(b)  Inconsistency. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions    
of the Schedule and the other provisions of this Master Agreement, the          
Schedule will prevail. In the event of any inconsistency between the            
provisions of any Confirmation and this Master Agreement (including the         
Schedule), such Confirmation will prevail for the purpose of the relevant       
Transaction.                                                                    

(c)  Single Agreement. All Transactions are entered into in reliance on the     
fact that this Master Agreement and all Confirmations form a single agreement   
between the parties (collectively referred to as this "Agreement"), and the     
parties would not otherwise enter into any Transactions.                        

2.   Obligations                                                                

(a)  General Conditions.                                                        

(i) Each party will make each payment or delivery specified in each 
  Confirmation to be made by it, subject to the other provisions of this
Agreement.                                                          

(ii) Payments under this Agreement will be made on the due date for 
    value on that date in the place of the account specified in the relevant
Confirmation or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement, in freely     
transferable funds and in the manner customary for payments in the  
   required currency. Where settlement is by delivery (that is, other than
  by payment), such delivery will be made for receipt on the due date in
the manner customary for the relevant obligation unless otherwise   
  specified in the relevant Confirmation or elsewhere in this Agreement.

   (iii) Each obligation of each party under Section 2(a)(i) is subject to
   (1) the condition precedent that no Event of Default or Potential Event
of Default with respect to the other party has occurred and is      

D-1-1   

P-->EX-4.132nd�Page�of�79TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�32nd
  continuing, (2) the condition precedent that no Early Termination Date
   in respect of the relevant Transaction has occurred or been effectively
  designated and (3) each other applicable condition precedent specified
in this Agreement.                                                  

(b)   Change of Account. Either party may change its account for receiving a    
payment or delivery by giving notice to the other party at least five Local     
Business Days prior to the scheduled date for the payment or delivery to which  
such change applies unless such other party gives timely notice of a            
reasonable objection to such change.                                            

(c)   Netting. If on any date amounts would otherwise be payable: --            

(i) in the same currency; and                                       

(ii) in respect of the same Transaction,                            

by each party to the other. then, on such date, each party's obligation to      
make payment of any such amount will be automatically satisfied and discharged  
and, if the aggregate amount that would otherwise have been payable by one      
party exceeds the aggregate amount that would otherwise have been payable by    
the other party, replaced by an obligation upon the party by whom the larger    
aggregate amount would have been payable to pay to the other party the excess   
of the larger aggregate amount over the smaller aggregate amount.               

The parties may elect in respect of two or more Transactions that a net amount  
will be determined in respect of all amounts payable on the same date in the    
same currency in respect of such Transactions, regardless of whether such       
amounts are payable in respect of the same Transaction. The election may be     
made in the Schedule or a Confirmation by specifying that subparagraph (ii)     
above will not apply to the Transactions identified as being subject to the     
election, together with the starting date (in which case subparagraph (ii)      
above will not, or will cease to, apply to such Transactions from such date).   
This election may be made separately for different groups of Transactions and   
will apply separately to each pairing of Offices through which the parties      
make and receive payments or deliveries.                                        

(d)  Deduction or Withholding for Tax.                                          

    (i)   Gross-Up. All payments under this Agreement will be made without any
deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax unless such     
 deduction or withholding is required by any applicable law, as modified
 by the practice of any relevant governmental revenue authority, then in
  effect. If a party is so required to deduct or withhold, then that party
("X") will: --                                                        

    (1) promptly notify the other party ("Y") of such requirement;

        (2) pay to the relevant authorities the full amount required to be
    deducted or withheld (including the full amount required to be
    deducted or withheld from any additional amount paid by X to Y
       under this Section 2(d)) promptly upon the earlier of determining
        that such deduction or withholding is required or receiving notice
that such amount has been assessed against Y;             

   (3) promptly forward to Y an official receipt (or a certified
copy), or other documentation reasonably acceptable to Y, 
evidencing such payment to such authorities; and          

       (4) if such Tax is an Indemnifiable Tax, pay to Y, in addition to
        the payment to which Y is otherwise entitled under this Agreement,
   such additional amount as is necessary to ensure that the net
    amount actually received by Y (free and clear of Indemnifiable
         Taxes. whether assessed against X or Y) will equal ft full amount Y
   would have received had no such deduction or withholding been
     required. However, X will not be required to pay any additional
        amount to Y to the extent that it would not be required to be paid
but for: --                                               

            (A) the failure by Y to comply with or perform any agreement
   contained in Section 4(a)(i), 4(a)(iii) or 4(d); or

         (B) the failure of a representation made by Y pursuant to
              Section 3(f) to be accurate and true unless such failure would
          not have occurred but for (I) any action taken by a taxing
              authority, or brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, on
or after the date on which a                    

D-1-2   

P-->EX-4.133rd�Page�of�79TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�33rd
              Transaction is entered into (regardless of whether such action
              is taken or brought with respect to a party to this Agreement)
or (II) a Change in Tax Law.                    

(ii)  Liability. If: --                                               

 (1) X is required by any applicable law, as modified by the
      practice of any relevant governmental revenue authority, to make
     any deduction or withholding in respect of which X would not be
         required to pay an additional amount to Y under Section 2(d)(i)(4);

(2) X does not so deduct or withhold; and                 

  (3) a liability resulting from such Tax is assessed directly
against X,                                                

      then, except to the extent Y has satisfied or then satisfies the
     liability resulting from such Tax, Y will promptly pay to X the
   amount of such liability (including any related liability for
         interest, but including any related liability for penalties only if
       Y has failed to comply with or perform any agreement contained in
Section 4(a)(i), 4(a)(iii) or 4(d)).                      

(e)  Default Interest; Other Amounts. Prior to the occurrence or effective      
designation of an Early Termination Date in respect of the relevant             
Transaction, a party that defaults in the performance of any payment            
obligation will, to the extent permitted by law and subject to Section 6(c),    
be required to pay interest (before as well as after judgment) on the overdue   
amount to the other party on demand in the same currency as such overdue        
amount, for the period from (and including) the original due date for payment   
to (but excluding) the date of actual payment, at the Default Rate. Such        
interest will be calculated on the basis of daily compounding and the actual    
number of days elapsed. If, prior to the occurrence or effective designation    
of an Early Termination Date in respect of the relevant Transaction, a party    
defaults in the performance of any obligation required to be settled by         
delivery, it will compensate the other party on demand if and to the extent     
provided for in the relevant Confirmation or elsewhere in this Agreement.       

3.   Representations

D-1-6   

P-->EX-4.137th�Page�of�79TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�37th
Upon Merger if the event is specified pursuant to (iv) below or an Additional   
Termination Event if the event is specified pursuant to (v) below:--            

  (i) Illegality. Due to the adoption of, or any change in, any applicable
  law after the date on which a Transaction is entered into, or due to the
promulgation of, or any change in, the interpretation by any court,   
tribunal or regulatory authority with competent jurisdiction of any   
applicable law after such date. it becomes unlawful (other than as a  
result of a breach by the party of Section 4(b)) for such party (which
will be the Affected Party):--                                        

    (1) to perform any absolute or contingent obligation to make a
        payment or delivery or to receive a payment or delivery in respect
        of such Transaction or to comply with any other material provision
of this Agreement relating to such Transaction; or        

         (2) to perform, or for any Credit Support Provider of such party to
     perform, any contingent or other obligation which the party (or
         such Credit Support Provider) has under any Credit Support Document
relating to such Transaction;                             

(ii) Tax Event. Due to (x) any action taken by a taxing authority, or 
brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, on or after the date on 
   which a Transaction is entered into (regardless of whether such action is
taken or brought with respect to a party to this Agreement) or (y) a  
  Change in Tax Law, the party (which will be the Affected Party) will, or
there is a substantial likelihood that it will, on the next succeeding
Scheduled Payment Date (1) be required to pay to the other party an   
additional amount in respect of an Indemnifiable Tax under Section    
   2(d)(i)(4) (except in respect of interest under Section 2(e), 6(d)(ii) or
6(e)) or (2) receive a payment from which an amount is required to be 
deducted or withheld for or on account of a Tax (except in respect of 
 interest under Section 2(e), 6(d)(ii) or 6(e)) and no additional amount
is required to be paid in respect of such Tax under Section 2(d)(i)(4)
(other than by reason of Section 2(d)(i)(4)(A) or (B));               

   (iii) Tax Event Upon Merger. The party (the "Burdened Party") on the next
 succeeding Scheduled Payment Date will either (1) be required to pay an
additional amount in respect of an Indemnifiable Tax under Section    
   2(d)(i)(4) (except in respect of interest under Section 2(e), 6(d)(ii) or
  6(e)) or (2) receive a payment from which an amount has been deducted or
 withheld for or on account of any Indemnifiable Tax in respect of which
 the other party is not required to pay an additional amount (other than
   by reason of Section 2(d)(i)(4)(A) or (B)), in either case as a result of
 a party consolidating or amalgamating with, or merging with or into, or
transferring all or substantially all its assets to, another entity   
  (which will be the Affected Party) where such action does not constitute
an event described in Section 5(a)(viii);                             

   (iv) Credit Event Upon Merger. If "Credit Event Upon Merger" is specified
in the Schedule as applying to the party, such party ("X"), any Credit
Support Provider of X or any applicable Specified Entity of X         
consolidates or amalgamates with, or merges with or into, or transfers
all or substantially all its assets to, another entity and such action
does not constitute an event described in Section 5(a)(viii) but the  
creditworthiness of the resulting, surviving or transferee entity is  
materially weaker than that of X, such Credit Support Provider or such
Specified Entity, as the case may be, immediately prior to such action
(and, in such event, X or its successor or transferee, as appropriate,
will be the Affected Party); or                                       

 (v) Additional Termination Event. If any "Additional Termination Event"
is specified in the Schedule or any Confirmation as applying. the     
occurrence of such event (and, in such event. the Affected Party or   
Affected Parties shall be as specified for such Additional Termination
Event in the Schedule or such Confirmation).                          

(j)  Event of Default and Illegality. If an event or circumstance which would   
otherwise constitute or give rise to an Event of Default also constitutes an    
Illegality, it will be treated as an Illegality and will not constitute an      
Event of Default.

6.   Early Termination                                                          

(a)  Right to Terminate Following Event of Default. If at any time an Event of  
Default with respect to a party (the "Defaulting Party") has occurred and is    
then continuing, the other party (the "Non-defaulting Party") may, by not more  
than 20 days notice to the Defaulting Party specifying the relevant Event of    
Default, designate a day not earlier than the day such notice is effective as   
an Early Termination Date in respect of all outstanding Transactions. If,       
however, "Automatic Early Termination" is specified in the Schedule as          
applying to a party, then an Early Termination Date in respect of all           
outstanding Transactions will occur immediately upon the occurrence with        
respect to such party of an Event of Default specified in Section               
5(a)(vii)(l), (3), (5), (6) or, to the extent analogous thereto, (8), and as    
of the time immediately preceding the institution of the relevant proceeding    
or the presentation of the relevant petition upon the occurrence with respect   
to such party of an Event of Default specified in Section 5(a)(vii)(4) or, to   
the extent analogous thereto, (8).                                              

(b)  Right to Terminate Following Termination Event.                            

(i) Notice. If a Termination Event occurs, an Affected Party will,    
promptly upon becoming aware of it, notify the other party, specifying
the nature of that Termination Event and each Affected Transaction and
   will also give such other information about that Termination Event as the
other party may reasonably require.                                   

 (ii) Transfer to Avoid Termination Event. If either an Illegality under
 Section 5(b)(i)(1) or a Tax Event occurs and there is only one Affected
   Party, or if a Tax Event Upon Merger occurs and the Burdened Party is the
 Affected Party, the Affected Party will, as a condition to its right to
designate an Early Termination Date under Section 6(b)(iv), use all   
reasonable efforts (which will not require such party to incur a loss,
excluding immaterial, incidental expenses) to transfer within 20 days 
after it gives notice under Section 6(b)(i) all its rights and        
  obligations under this Agreement in respect of the Affected Transactions
to another of its Offices or Affiliates so that such Termination Event
ceases to exist.                                                      

If the Affected Party is not able to make such a transfer it will give
notice to the other party to that effect within such 20 day period,   
   whereupon the other party may effect such a transfer within 30 days after
the notice is given under Section 6(b)(i).                            

  Any such transfer by a party under this Section 6(b)(ii) will be subject
to and conditional upon the prior written consent of the other party, 
which consent will not be withheld if such other party's policies in  
 effect at such time would permit it to enter into transactions with the
transferee on the terms proposed.                                     

  (iii) Two Affected Parties. If an Illegality under Section 5(b)(i)(1) or
a Tax Event occurs and there are two Affected Parties, each party will
   use all reasonable efforts to reach agreement within 30 days after notice
thereof is given under Section 6(b)(i) on action to avoid that        
Termination Event.                                                    

(iv) Right to Terminate. If:--                                        

         (1) a transfer under Section 6(b)(ii) or an agreement under Section
       6(b)(iii), as the case may be, has not been effected with respect
         to all Affected Transactions within 30 days after an Affected Party
gives notice under Section 6(b)(i); or                    

     (2) an Illegality under Section 5(b)(i)(2), a Credit Event Upon
      Merger or an Additional Termination Event occurs, or a Tax Event
   Upon Merger occurs and the Burdened Party is not the Affected
Party,                                                    

   either party in the case of an Illegality, the Burdened Party in the case
   of a Tax Event Upon Merger, any Affected Party in the case of a Tax Event
or an Additional Termination Event if there is more than one Affected 
Party, or the party which is not the Affected Party in the case of a  
 Credit Event Upon Merger or an Additional Termination Event if there is
   only one Affected Party may, by not more than 20 days notice to the other
party and provided that the relevant Termination Event is then

continuing, designate a day not earlier than the day such notice is   
effective as an Early Termination Date in respect of all Affected     
Transactions.                                                         

(c)  Effect of Designation.                                                     

(i) If notice designating an Early Termination Date is given under    
   Section 6(a) or (b), the Early Termination Date will occur on the date so
 designated, whether or not the relevant Event of Default or Termination
Event is then continuing.                                             

   (ii) Upon the occurrence or effective designation of an Early Termination
  Date, no further payments or deliveries under Section 2(a)(i) or 2(e) in
 respect of the Terminated Transactions will be required to be made, but
  without prejudice to the other provisions of this Agreement. The amount,
if any, payable in respect of an Early Termination Date shall be      
determined pursuant to Section 6(e).                                  

(d)  Calculations.                                                              

(i) Statement. On or as soon as reasonably practicable following the  
occurrence of an Early Termination Date, each party will make the     
 calculations on its part, if any, contemplated by Section 6(e) and will
   provide to the other party a statement (1) showing, in reasonable detail,
 such calculations (including all relevant quotations and specifying any
   amount payable under Section 6(e)) and (2) giving details of the relevant
 account to which any amount payable to it is to be paid. In the absence
of written confirmation from the source of a quotation obtained in    
 determining a Market Quotation, the records of the party obtaining such
quotation will be conclusive evidence of the existence and accuracy of
such quotation.                                                       

(ii) Payment Date. An amount calculated as being due in respect of any
   Early Termination Date under Section 6(e) will be payable on the day that
notice of the amount payable is effective (in the case of an Early    
   Termination Date which is designated or occurs as a result of an Event of
   Default) and on the day which is two Local Business Days after the day on
  which notice of the amount payable is effective (in the case of an Early
   Termination Date which is designated as a result of a Termination Event).
Such amount will be paid together with (to the extent permitted under 
applicable law) interest thereon (before as well as after judgment) in
the Termination Currency, from (and including) the relevant Early     
  Termination Date to (but excluding) the date such amount is paid, at the
 Applicable Rate. Such interest will be calculated on the basis of daily
compounding and the actual number of days elapsed.                    

(e)  Payments on Early Termination. If an Early Termination Date occurs, the    
following provisions shall apply based on the parties' election in the          
Schedule of a payment measure, either "Market Quotation" or "Loss", and a       
payment method, either the "First Method" or the "Second Method". If the        
parties fail to designate a payment measure or payment method in the Schedule,  
it will be deemed that "Market Quotation" or the "Second Method", as the case   
may be, shall apply. The amount, if any, payable in respect of an Early         
Termination Date and determined pursuant to this Section will be subject to     
any Set-off.                                                                    

(i) Events of Default. If the Early Termination Date results from an  
Event of Default:--                                                   

    (1) First Method and Market Quotation. If the First Method and
  Market Quotation apply, the Defaulting Party will pay to the
       Non-defaulting Party the excess, if a positive number, of (A) the
    sum of the Settlement Amount (determined by the Non-defaulting
Party) in respect of the Terminated Transactions and the  
        Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the
       Non-defaulting Party over (B) the Termination Currency Equivalent
of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the Defaulting Party.      

        (2) First Method and Loss. If the First Method and Loss apply, the
 Defaulting Party will pay to the Non-defaulting Party, if a
         positive number, the Non-defaulting Party's Loss in respect of this
Agreement.                                                

      (3) Second Method and Market Quotation. If the Second Method and
        Market Quotation apply, an amount will be payable equal to (A) the
sum of the Settlement Amount (determined by the           

D-1-9   

P-->EX-4.140th�Page�of�79TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�40th
         Non-defaulting Party) in respect of the Terminated Transactions and
        the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to
the Non-defaulting Party less (B) the Termination Currency
        Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the Defaulting Party. If
        that amount is a positive number, the Defaulting Party will pay it
  to the Non-defaulting Party; if it is a negative number, the
        Non-defaulting Party will pay the absolute value of that amount to
the Defaulting Party.                                     

         (4) Second Method and Loss. If the Second Method and Loss apply, an
        amount will be payable equal to the Non-defaulting Party's Loss in
         respect of this Agreement. If that amount is a positive number, the
        Defaulting Party will pay it to the Non-defaulting Party; if it is
       a negative number, the Non-defaulting Party will pay the absolute
value of that amount to the Defaulting Party.             

(ii) Termination Events. If the Early Termination Date results from a 
Termination Event:--                                                  

        (1) One Affected Party. If there is one Affected Party, the amount
       payable will be determined in accordance with Section 6(e)(i)(3),
 if Market Quotation applies, or Section 6(e)(i)(4), if Loss
        applies, except that, in either case, references to the Defaulting
Party and to the Non-defaulting Party will be deemed to be
     references to the Affected Party and the party which is not the
       Affected Party, respectively, and, if Loss applies and fewer than
         all the Transactions are being terminated, Loss shall be calculated
in respect of all Terminated Transactions.                

    (2) Two Affected Parties. If there are two Affected Parties:--

          (A) if Market Quotation applies, each party will determine a
          Settlement Amount in respect of the Terminated Transactions,
       and an amount will be payable equal to (I) the sum of (a)
             one-half of the difference between the Settlement Amount of the
   party with the higher Settlement Amount ("X") and the
             Settlement Amount of the party with the lower Settlement Amount
             ("Y") and (b) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid
   Amounts owing to X less (II) the Termination Currency
Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to Y; and  

        (B) if Loss applies, each party will determine its Loss in
  respect of this Agreement (or, if fewer than all the
             Transactions are being terminated, in respect of all Terminated
           Transactions) and an amount will be payable equal to one-half
             of the difference between the Loss of the party with the higher
             Loss ("X") and the Loss of the party with the lower Loss ("Y").

             If the amount payable is a positive number, Y will pay it to X;
          if it is a negative number, X will pay the absolute value of
that amount to Y.                                 

(iii) Adjustment for Bankruptcy. In circumstances where an Early      
  Termination Date occurs because "Automatic Early Termination" applies in
   respect of a party, the amount determined under this Section 6(e) will be
subject to such adjustments as are appropriate and permitted by law to
 reflect any payments or deliveries made by one party to the other under
  this Agreement (and retained by such other party) during the period from
the relevant Early Termination Date to the date for payment determined
under Section 6(d)(ii).                                               

  (iv) Pre-Estimate. The parties agree that if Market Quotation applies an
 amount recoverable under this Section 6(e) is a reasonable pre-estimate
   of loss and not a penalty. Such amount is payable for the loss of bargain
 and the loss of protection against future risks and except as otherwise
  provided in this Agreement neither party will be entitled to recover any
additional damages as a consequence of such losses.                   

7.   Transfer                                                                   

Subject to Section 6(b)(ii), neither this Agreement nor any interest or         
obligation in or under this Agreement may be transferred (whether by way of     
security or otherwise) by either party without the prior written consent of     
the other party, except that:--                                                 

D-1-10  

P-->EX-4.141st�Page�of�79TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�41st
(a)  a party may make such a transfer of this Agreement pursuant to a           
consolidation or amalgamation with, or merger with or into, or transfer of all  
or substantially all its assets to, another entity (but without prejudice to    
any other right or remedy under this Agreement); and                            

(b)  a party may make such a transfer of all or any part of its interest in     
any amount payable to it from a Defaulting Party under Section 6(e).            

Any purported transfer that is not in compliance with this Section will be      
void.                                                                           

8.   Contractual Currency                                                       

(a)  Payment in the Contractual Currency. Each payment under this Agreement     
will be made in the relevant currency specified in this Agreement for that      
payment (the "Contractual Currency"). To the extent permitted by applicable     
law, any obligation to make payments under this Agreement in the Contractual    
Currency will not be discharged or satisfied by any tender in any currency      
other than the Contractual Currency, except to the extent such tender results   
in the actual receipt by the party to which payment is owed, acting in a        
reasonable manner and in good faith in converting the currency so tendered      
into the Contractual Currency, of the full amount in the Contractual Currency   
of all amounts payable in respect of this Agreement. If for any reason the      
amount in the Contractual Currency so received falls short of the amount in     
the Contractual Currency payable in respect of this Agreement, the party        
required to make the payment will, to the extent permitted by applicable law,   
immediately pay such additional amount in the Contractual Currency as may be    
necessary to compensate for the shortfall. If for any reason the amount in the  
Contractual Currency so received exceeds the amount in the Contractual          
Currency payable in respect of this Agreement, the party receiving the payment  
will refund promptly the amount of such excess.                                 

(b)  Judgments. To the extent permitted by applicable law, if any judgment or   
order expressed in a currency other than the Contractual Currency is rendered   
(i) for the payment of any amount owing in respect of this Agreement, (ii) for  
the payment of any amount relating to any early termination in respect of this  
Agreement or (iii) in respect of a judgment or order of another court for the   
payment of any amount described in (i) or (ii) above, the party seeking         
recovery, after recovery in full of the aggregate amount to which such party    
is entitled pursuant to the judgment or order, will be entitled to receive      
immediately from the other party the amount of any shortfall of the             
Contractual Currency received by such party as a consequence of sums paid in    
such other currency and will refund promptly to the other party any excess of   
the Contractual Currency received by such party as a consequence of sums paid   
in such other currency if such shortfall or such excess arises or results from  
any variation between the rate of exchange at which the Contractual Currency    
is converted into the currency of the judgment or order for the purposes of     
such judgment or order and the rate of exchange at which such party is able,    
acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith in converting the currency      
received into the Contractual Currency, to purchase the Contractual Currency    
with the amount of the currency of the judgment or order actually received by   
such party. The term "rate of exchange" includes, without limitation, any       
premiums and costs of exchange payable in connection with the purchase of or    
conversion into the Contractual Currency.                                       

(c)  Separate Indemnities. To the extent permitted by applicable law, these     
indemnities constitute separate and independent obligations from the other      
obligations in this Agreement, will be enforceable as separate and independent  
causes of action, will apply notwithstanding any indulgence granted by the      
party to which any payment is owed and will not be affected by judgment being   
obtained or claim or proof being made for any other sums payable in respect of  
this Agreement.                                                                 

(d)  Evidence of Loss. For the purpose of this Section 8, it will be sufficient 
for a party to demonstrate that it would have suffered a loss had an actual     
exchange or purchase been made.

9.   Miscellaneous                                                              

(a)  Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and      
understanding of the parties with respect to its subject matter and supersedes  
all oral communication and prior writings with respect thereto.                 

(b)  Amendments. No amendment, modification or waiver in respect of this        
Agreement will be effective unless in writing (including a writing evidenced    
by a facsimile transmission) and executed by each of the parties or confirmed   
by an exchange of telexes or electronic messages on an electronic messaging     
system.                                                                         

(c)  Survival of Obligations. Without prejudice to Sections 2(a)(iii) and       
6(c)(ii), the obligations of the parties under this Agreement will survive the  
termination of any Transaction.                                                 

(d)  Remedies Cumulative. Except as provided in this Agreement, the rights,     
powers, remedies and privileges provided in this Agreement are cumulative and   
not exclusive of any rights, powers, remedies and privileges provided by law.   

(e)  Counterparts and Confirmations.                                            

(i) This Agreement (and each amendment, modification and waiver in    
 respect of it) may be executed and delivered in counterparts (including
by facsimile transmission), each of which will be deemed an original. 

  (ii) The parties intend that they are legally bound by the terms of each
  Transaction from the moment they agree to those terms (whether orally or
 otherwise). A Confirmation shall be entered into as soon as practicable
   and may be executed and delivered in counterparts (including by facsimile
 transmission) or be created by an exchange of telexes or by an exchange
 of electronic messages on an electronic messaging system, which in each
   case will be sufficient for all purposes to evidence a binding supplement
to this Agreement. The parties will specify therein or through another
effective means that any such counterpart, telex or electronic message
constitutes a Confirmation.                                           

(f)  No Waiver of Rights. A failure or delay in exercising any right, power or  
privilege in respect of this Agreement will not be presumed to operate as a     
waiver, and a single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege will  
not be presumed to preclude any subsequent or further exercise, of that right,  
power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.      

(g)  Headings. The headings used in this Agreement are for convenience of       
reference only and are not to affect the construction of or to be taken into    
consideration in interpreting this Agreement.                                   

10.  Offices; Multibranch Parties                                               

(a)  If Section 10(a) is specified in the Schedule as applying, each party      
that enters into a Transaction through an Office other than its head or home    
office represents to the other party that, notwithstanding the place of         
booking office or jurisdiction of incorporation or organisation of such party,  
the obligations of such party are the same as if it had entered into the        
Transaction through its head or home office. This representation will be        
deemed to be repeated by such party on each date on which a Transaction is      
entered into.                                                                   

(b)  Neither party may change the Office through which it makes and receives    
payments or deliveries for the purpose of a Transaction without the prior       
written consent of the other party.                                             

(c)  If a party is specified as a Multibranch Party in the Schedule, such       
Multibranch Party may make and receive payments or deliveries under any         
Transaction through any Office listed in the Schedule, and the Office through   
which it makes and receives payments or deliveries with respect to a            
Transaction will be specified in the relevant Confirmation.                     

11.  Expenses                                                                   

A Defaulting Party will, on demand, indemnify and hold harmless the other       
party for and against all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including legal    
fees and Stamp Tax, incurred by such other party by reason of the enforcement   
and protection of its rights under this Agreement or any Credit Support         
Document

to which the Defaulting Party is a party or by reason of the early termination  
of any Transaction, including, but not limited to, costs of collection.         

12.  Notices                                                                    

(a)  Effectiveness. Any notice or other communication in respect of this        
Agreement may be given in any manner set forth below (except that a notice or   
other communication under Section 5 or 6 may not be given by facsimile          
transmission or electronic messaging system) to the address or number or in     
accordance with the electronic messaging system details provided (see the       
Schedule) and will be deemed effective as indicated:--                          

 (i) if in writing and delivered in person or by courier, on the date it
is delivered;                                                         

(ii) if sent by telex, on the date the recipient's answerback is      
received;                                                             

   (iii) if sent by facsimile transmission, on the date that transmission is
 received by a responsible employee of the recipient in legible form (it
   being agreed that the burden of proving receipt will be on the sender and
will not be met by a transmission report generated by the sender's    
facsimile machine);                                                   

(iv) if sent by certified or registered mail (airmail, if overseas) or
the equivalent (return receipt requested), on the date that mail is   
delivered or its delivery is attempted; or                            

 (v) if sent by electronic messaging system, on the date that electronic
message is received,                                                  

unless the date of that delivery (or attempted delivery) or that receipt as     
applicable, is not a Local Business Day or that communication is delivered (or  
attempted) or received, as applicable, after the close of business on a Local   
Business Day, in which case that communication shall be deemed given and        
effective on the first following day that is a Local Business Day.              

(b)  Change of Addresses. Either party may by notice to the other change the    
address, telex or facsimile number or electronic messaging system details at    
which notices or other communications are to be given to it.                    

13.  Governing Law and Jurisdiction                                             

(a)  Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in         
accordance with the law specified in the Schedule.                              

(b)  Jurisdiction. With respect to any suit, action or proceedings relating to  
this Agreement ("Proceedings"), each party irrevocably:--                       

  (i) submits to the jurisdiction of the English courts, if this Agreement
is expressed to be governed by English law, or to the non-exclusive   
   jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York and the United States
 District Court located in the Borough of Manhattan in New York City, if
this Agreement is expressed to be governed by the laws of the State of
New York; and                                                         

  (ii) waives any objection which it may have at any time to the laying of
   venue of any Proceedings brought in any such court, waives any claim that
 such Proceedings have been brought in an inconvenient forum and further
 waives the right to object, with respect to such Proceedings, that such
court does not have any jurisdiction over such party.                 

Nothing in this Agreement precludes either party from bringing Proceedings in   
any other jurisdiction (outside, if this Agreement is expressed to be governed  
by English law, the Contracting States, as defined in Section 1(3) of the       
Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982 or any modification, extension or

Proceedings in any one or more jurisdictions preclude the bringing of           
Proceedings in any other jurisdiction.

Process Agent is unable to act as such, such party will promptly notify the     
other party and within 30 days appoint a substitute process agent acceptable    
to the other party. The parties irrevocably consent to service of process       
given in the manner provided for notices in Section 12. Nothing in this         
Agreement will affect the right of either party to serve process in any other   
manner permitted by law.

assets (irrespective of their use or intended use), all immunity on the         
grounds of sovereignty or other similar grounds from (i) suit, (ii)             
jurisdiction of any court, (iii) relief by way of injunction, order for

banks are open for business (including dealings in foreign exchange and

"Loss" means, with respect to this Agreement or one or more Terminated          
Transactions, as the case may be, and a party, the Termination Currency         
Equivalent of an amount that party reasonably determines in good faith to be    
its total losses and costs (or gain, in which case expressed as a negative      
number) in connection with this Agreement or that Terminated Transaction or     
group of Terminated Transactions, as the case may be, including any loss of     
bargain, cost of funding or, at the election of such party but without          
duplication, loss or cost incurred as a result of its terminating,              
liquidating, obtaining or reestablishing any hedge or related trading position  
(or any gain resulting from any of them). Loss includes losses and costs (or    
gains) in respect of any payment or delivery required to have been made         
(assuming satisfaction of each applicable condition precedent) on or before     
the relevant Early Termination Date and not made, except, so as to avoid        
duplication, if Section 6(e)(i)(1) or (3) or 6(e)(ii)(2)(A) applies. Loss does  
not include a party's legal fees and out-of-pocket expenses referred to under   
Section 11. A party will determine its Loss as of the relevant Early            
Termination Date, or, if that is not reasonably practicable, as of the          
earliest date thereafter as is reasonably practicable. A party may (but need    
not) determine its Loss by reference to quotations of relevant rates or prices  
from one or more leading dealers in the relevant markets.                       

"Market Quotation" means, with respect to one or more Terminated Transactions   
and a party making the determination, an amount determined on the basis of      
quotations from Reference Market-makers. Each quotation will be for an amount,  
if any, that would be paid to such party (expressed as a negative number) or    
by such party (expressed as a positive number) in consideration of an           
agreement between such party (taking into account any existing Credit Support   
Document with respect to the obligations of such party) and the quoting         
Reference Market-maker to enter into a transaction (the "Replacement            
Transaction") that would have the effect of preserving for such party the       
economic equivalent of any payment or delivery (whether                         

D-1-15

the underlying obligation was absolute or contingent and assuming the           
satisfaction of each applicable condition precedent) by the parties under       
Section 2(a)(i) in respect of such Terminated Transaction or group of           
Terminated Transactions that would, but for the occurrence of the relevant      
Early Termination Date, have been required after that date. For this purpose,   
Unpaid Amounts in respect of the Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated  
Transactions are to be excluded but, without limitation, any payment or         
delivery that would, but for the relevant Early Termination Date, have been     
required (assuming satisfaction of each applicable condition precedent) after   
that Early Termination Date is to be included. The Replacement Transaction      
would be subject to such documentation as such party and the Reference          
Market-maker may, in good faith, agree. The party making the determination (or  
its agent) will request each Reference Market-maker to provide its quotation    
to the extent reasonably practicable as of the same day and time (without       
regard to different time zones) on or as soon as reasonably practicable after   
the relevant Early Termination Date. The day and time as of which those         
quotations are to be obtained will be selected in good faith by the party       
obliged to make a determination under Section 6(e), and, if each party is so    
obliged, after consultation with the other. If more than three quotations are   
provided, the Market Quotation will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations,   
without regard to the quotations having the highest and lowest values, If       
exactly three such quotations are provided, the Market Quotation will be the    
quotation remaining after disregarding the highest and lowest quotations. For   
this purpose, if more than one quotation has the same highest value or lowest   
value, then one of such quotations shall be disregarded. If fewer than three    
quotations are provided, it will be deemed that the Market Quotation in         
respect of such Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions      
cannot be determined.                                                           

"Non-default Rate" means a rate per annum equal to the cost (without proof or   
evidence of any actual cost) to the Non-defaulting Party (as certified by it)   
if it were to fund the relevant amount.                                         

"Non-defaulting Party" has the meaning specified in Section 6(a).

or the lapse of time or both, would constitute an Event of Default.             

"Reference Market-makers" means four leading dealers in the relevant market     
selected by the party determining a Market Quotation in good faith (a) from     
among dealers of the highest credit standing which satisfy all the criteria     
that such party applies generally at the time in deciding whether to offer or   
to make an extension of credit and (b) to the extent practicable, from among    
such dealers having an office in the same city.                                 

"Relevant Jurisdiction" means, with respect to a party, the jurisdictions (a)   
in which the party is incorporated, organised, managed and controlled or        
considered to have its seat, (b) where an Office through which the party is     
acting for purposes of this Agreement is located, (c) in which the party        
executes this Agreement and (d) in relation to any payment, from or through     
which such payment is made.                                                     

"Scheduled Payment Date" means a date on which a payment or delivery is to be   
made under Section 2(a)(i) with respect to a Transaction.

or withholding or similar right or requirement to which the payer of an amount  
under Section 6 is entitled or subject (whether arising under this Agreement,

imposed on, such payer.                                                         

"Settlement Amount" means, with respect to a party and any Early Termination    
Date, the sum of.-                                                              

(a)  the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Market Quotations (whether      
positive or negative) for each Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated    
Transactions for which a Market Quotation is determined; and                    

(b)  such party's Loss (whether positive or negative and without reference to   
any Unpaid Amounts) for each Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated      
Transactions for which a Market Quotation cannot be determined or would not     
(in the reasonable belief of the party making the determination) produce a      
commercially reasonable result.

2(a)(iii)) required to be settled by delivery to such party on or prior to      
such Early Termination Date and which has not been so settled as at such Early

such amounts, from (and including) the date such amounts or obligations were    
or would have been required to have been paid or performed to (but excluding)

   (ii) Section 5(a)(vii) of this Agreement (Bankruptcy), provided that, the

the terms of the Trust Agreement shall not be deemed to constitute a  
   Bankruptcy within the meaning of clause (2) thereof with respect to Party
B; and

  (i) The occurrence of any of the following events shall be an Additional
Termination Event:                                                    

 (A)  the unsecured and unsubordinated debt, deposit or letter of credit
obligations of Party A or its Credit Support Provider, as   
applicable, are assigned a rating by S&P below the Hedge    
Counterparty Required Rating ("S&P Required Rating Downgrade
Event"), and Party A fails to make a Permitted Transfer in  
    accordance with the provisions of Part 6(a)(ii) of this Schedule
      within seven (7) days of such S&P Required Rating Downgrade Event,
    provided, however, that termination due to any such S&P Required
  Rating Downgrade Event shall not be permitted if S&P agrees in
   writing that it will not downgrade, reduce, suspend or withdraw
   S&P's then-current rating on the Certificates if this Agreement
     remains in full force and effect with respect to each transaction
       hereunder. Party A shall notify Party B within one (1) Business Day
of the occurrence of a S&P Required Rating Downgrade Event; 

 (B)  the unsecured and unsubordinated debt, deposit or letter of credit
obligations of Party A or its Credit Support Provider, as

Counterparty Collateral Threshold Rating ("Collateral Rating
       Downgrade Event"), unless Party A either (i) transfers to Party B's
  Custodian under the Credit Support Annex an amount of Eligible
      Collateral equal to the Delivery Amount required to be transferred
    with respect to the Affected Transactions on that Credit Support
      Commencement Date (as defined in the Credit Support Annex) or (ii)
        makes a Permitted Transfer with respect to the Affected Transactions
        or (iii) provides Alternative Credit Support (as defined below) with

(C)  The Certificates become due and payable prior to their final     
scheduled maturity date for any reason;                     

  (D)  Party B fails to comply with sub-paragraph (e)(i) of Part 6 of this
    Schedule; any prepayment, redemption, retirement, liquidation or
       distribution of the Underlying Securities (including as a result of
      a Payment Default, an Acceleration or an SEC Reporting Failure) or
   other prepayment in full of all Certificates outstanding occurs
        under the Trust Agreement (or any notice is given to that effect and
        such prepayment, redemption, retirement, liquidation or distribution
        of the Underlying Securities is not capable of being rescinded); any
      Trust Termination Event (as defined in the Trust Agreement) occurs
       under the Trust Agreement (or any notice is given by the Trustee or
   any other authorized party to that effect) and the Trustee, the
     Certificateholders or any other authorized party thereunder takes
  any action or exercises any rights or remedies under the Trust
        Agreement or under law that would result in (1) the appropriation of
      all right, title and interest in and to the assets under the Trust
Agreement in satisfaction, in whole or in part, of the      

D-2-2   

P-->EX-4.151st�Page�of�79TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�51st
obligations secured thereby, (2) the sale, liquidation or   
disposition of the assets under the Trust Agreement and the 
    application of the proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, to the
   obligations secured thereby, or (3) the release of the security
        interest in the assets granted under the Trust Agreement in exchange
 for receiving either the payment, in whole or in part, of the
  obligations secured thereby or substitute collateral or credit
support; or                                                 

  (E)  Party B fails to comply with sub-paragraph (j)(i) of Part 1 of this
        Schedule, or any Additional Termination Event occurs under paragraph
       (j) of Part 1 of this Schedule in either event to the extent of the
       applicable Affected Notional Amount as described in that paragraph.

   (ii) For purposes of the right to terminate under Section 6(b)(iv), Party
A will be the sole Affected Party for any Additional Termination Event
described in clause (A) or (B) of sub-paragraph (i) above, and Party B
will be the sole Affected Party for any other Additional Termination  
Event.                                                                

(iii) Notwithstanding which party is the Affected Party for any       
   Additional Termination Event, upon the occurrence of an Early Termination
 Date for any Additional Termination Event under this Part 1(i), Party A
shall make the calculations under Section 6(e) of this Agreement as   
   though it were the non-Affected Party for purposes of Section 6(e)(ii)(1)
of this Agreement.                                                    

(iv) "Hedge Counterparty Required Rating" means, as applicable, at any
   time that any Certificates outstanding under the Trust Agreement and have
 a long-term rating of at least A by S&P, with respect to a Person as an
   issuer or with respect to long-term senior unsecured debt of such Person,
BBB- by S&P (for so long as any Certificates are outstanding under the
   Trust Agreement and are rated by S&P); provided that should S&P effect an
  overall downward adjustment of its short-term or long-term ratings, then
the applicable Hedge Counterparty Required Rating shall be downwardly 
 adjusted accordingly; provided further, that any adjustment to a rating
shall be subject to the prior written consent of S&P.                 

   (v) "Hedge Counterparty Collateral Threshold Rating" mean, so long as any
 Certificates are outstanding under the Trust Agreement and are rated by
S&P:                                                                  

 (A)  if the actual long-term rating assigned by S&P with respect to the
        Certificates outstanding under the Trust Agreement (in the event S&P
   has assigned more than one long-term rating with respect to the
   Certificates, then the applicable long-term rating shall be the
        highest of such long-term ratings) (the "Actual Certificate Rating")
is "AA-" or above, "A" with respect to the long-term senior 
        unsecured debt of Party A (so long as the short-term debt of Party A
  is rated at least "A-1") or "A+" with respect to the long-term
      senior unsecured debt of Party A (if Party A has a short-term debt
    rating below "A-1" or does not have a short-term debt rating) in
each case, by S&P;                                          

D-2-3   

P-->EX-4.152nd�Page�of�79TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�52nd
 (B)  if the Actual Certificate Rating is "A+" or "A", "A-" with respect
    to the long-term senior unsecured debt of Party A and "A-2" with
        respect to the short-term debt of Party A, in each case, by S&P; and

(C)  if the Actual Certificate Rating is "A-" or below, then the Hedge
Counterparty Collateral Threshold Rating shall be the Actual
Certificate Rating;                                         

     provided that should S&P effect an overall downward adjustment of
  its short-term or long-term ratings, then the applicable Hedge

    adjusted accordingly; provided further, that any adjustment to a
rating shall be subject to the prior written consent of S&P.

(vi)   "Alternative Credit Support" means an absolute and unconditional         
     guarantee, credit intermediation arrangement, letter of credit or other
  additional credit support or collateral, in a form which meets S&P's
then current criteria with respect to such types of credit support
     reasonably acceptable to S&P and for which S&P confirms in writing that
 such support will not cause the reduction or withdrawal of its then
     current rating of any outstanding class of Certificates under the Trust
Agreement with respect to which it has previously issued a rating.

(vii)  "S&P" means, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a division of The       
McGraw-Hill Companies ("S&P") (so long as any Certificates deemed 
outstanding under the Trust Agreement are rated by S&P).          

(j)    Mandatory Reduction Events. To protect Party A's interest in the Trust   
   Agreement as a source of payment for Party B's obligations hereunder,
     including the priority of those payments under the Trust Agreement, the
following provisions shall apply with respect to all Transactions 
hereunder:                                                        

 (i) If either (x) without the prior written consent of Party A, Party B
  enters into any "Hedge Agreement" (as defined in the Trust Agreement) on
any date (a "Principal Payment Date") with any person or entity that  
would result in the Hedge Notional Amount exceeding the remaining     
Principal Balance on any date or (y) as the result of any payment,    
repayment, retirement or redemption of any amount of the Principal    
Balance under the Trust Agreement on any date (a "Principal Payment   
Date"), (A) the Principal Balance would be reduced to zero, or (B) the
   Hedge Notional Amount would exceed the remaining Principal Balance (after
  giving effect to that repayment), (each, a "Mandatory Reduction Event"),
then not later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date        
("Mandatory Reduction Date") which is the second New York Business Day
prior to that Principal Payment Date, Party B shall:                  

        (1)  notify Party A of that Mandatory Reduction Event, including the
            amount to be repaid and the outstanding Hedge Notional Amount;
and                                               

      (2)  specify in that notice each outstanding Transaction hereunder
     and the corresponding amount by which the Transactional
           Notional Amount of that Transaction is to be reduced for that
            Mandatory Reduction Event ("Affected Notional Amount") so that
the Hedge Notional Amount for any                 

D-2-4   

P-->EX-4.153rd�Page�of�79TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�53rd
         date (after giving effect to all such reductions) would not
             exceed the Principal Balance for that date (after giving effect
        to any repayment) (except that if the Principal Balance is
            reduced to zero, the Hedge Notional Amount shall be reduced to
zero).                                            

    "Hedge Notional Amount" means, as of the date of determination, an
   amount equal to the aggregate Notional Amount outstanding on that
date and for the then current Calculation Period of all       
   Transactions outstanding under any Hedge Agreement (as defined in
the Trust Agreement) then in effect.                          

 "Principal Balance" means, on any date, the aggregate principal
   amount of the Certificates, outstanding under the Trust Agreement
   on that date, after giving effect to all repayments, redemptions,
advances or distributions of principal thereon on that date.  

(ii) For each Transaction for which a corresponding Affected Notional 
Amount is specified ("Affected Transaction") pursuant to sub-paragraph
(i) above, the Notional Amount of that Affected Transaction shall be  
reduced as of the Mandatory Reduction Date by an amount equal to the  
  Affected Notional Amount (and, if the Notional Amount otherwise accretes
or amortizes after the Mandatory Reduction Date, the effect of that   
  reduction shall be to reduce proportionately the Notional Amount of each
future Calculation Period remaining under the Transaction), and an    
 Additional Termination Event and Early Termination Date shall be deemed
   to have occurred on the Mandatory Reduction Date for that Transaction and
Party B will be the sole Affected Party. For purposes of such Early   
Termination Date, the term "Terminated Transaction" as used in Section
6(e) of this Agreement shall be only that part of the Affected        
 Transaction relating to the Affected Notional Amount, and the remainder
  of the Affected Transaction shall continue in full force and effect as a
  Transaction hereunder subject to the terms of this Agreement. The amount
payable under Section 6(e) of this Agreement with respect to any such 
 Early Termination Date shall be due and payable in accordance with such
  Section 6(e), provided that such payment shall be made no later than the
next "Distribution Date" under the Trust Agreement to occur after the 
  Mandatory Reduction Date, and provided further that the Market Quotation
  with respect to any Terminated Transaction under this sub-paragraph (ii)
shall be determined on the basis of the quotation of one Reference    
  Market-maker selected by Party A, which may be Party A to the extent its
quotation is reasonably determined in good faith.                     

(k)  Events of Default. An Event of Default shall not occur with respect to     
Party A under Section 5(a)(v)(1) or (2) or Section 5(a)(vi) when the  
failure to pay or deliver, or the default, event of default or other  
  similar condition or event, as the case may be, arises solely (i) out of
a wire transfer problem or an operational or administrative error or  
   omission (so long as the required funds or property required to make that
payment or delivery were otherwise available to Party A), or (ii) from
the general unavailability of the relevant currency due to exchange   
   controls or other similar governmental action, but in either case only if
the payment or delivery is made within three Local Business Days after
   the problem has been corrected, the error or omission has been discovered
or the currency becomes generally available.                          

D-2-5

(l)  Modification of Section 5(a)(i) - Failure to Pay or Deliver. Section       
5(a)(i) is hereby amended to change the reference to "third Local     
Business Day" in the third line of such subsection to read "thirtieth 
   day" and to add the following language immediately after the word "party"
  at the end of the third line of such subsection "provided, however, such
cure period shall not apply with respect to any amounts payable on the
Termination Date".                                                    

(m)  Reports. For purposes hereof, Party B shall cause to be delivered to       
Party A within 10 days of the end of each calendar month a statement  
("Reporting Statement") showing the Stated Amount of all Outstanding  
   Certificates as of the end of such month and the Hedge Notional Amount as
   of the end of such month and each following month during the term of this
Agreement for all outstanding Transactions under all Hedge Agreements 
 which Party B has entered into, whether the same have already commenced
or are scheduled to commence on a future date.                        

Part 2.  Tax Provisions

prejudice to its legal or commercial position.

  B which remain outstanding shall be extinguished. Party A further agrees
that it shall not take any action against the directors, shareholders,

The term "S&P Credit Support Amount" shall mean for any Valuation Date
(i) Party B's Exposure for that Valuation Date plus (ii) the product of the     
applicable S&P Volatility Buffer (as determined by reference to the applicable  
provisions below) times the Transaction Notional Amount, minus (iii) Party A's  
Threshold; provided, however the S&P Credit Support Amount shall be zero if     
(x) S&P is no longer rating any of the Certificates, or (y) Party A's ratings   
from S&P are not below the Hedge Counterparty Collateral Threshold Rating for   
S&P.                                                                            

S&P Volatility Buffers  

If, on the related Valuation Date, the highest rated Certificates are 
rated "AA-" or higher by S&P, then the Volatility Buffer will be determined

If, on the related Valuation Date, the highest rated Certificates are 
rated "A-" or below by S&P, then the Volatility Buffer will be determined in    
consultation with S&P and will be at such levels as may be required in order    
for S&P to agree in writing that it will not downgrade, reduce, suspend or      
withdraw S&P's then-current rating on the Certificates; provided, however, in   
no event shall such Volatility Buffer levels exceed the levels set forth in     
the table set forth

* If Party A has a long-term or short-term rating from S&P which is not         
expressly set forth in the applicable table above, then the S&P Volatility      
Buffer shall be deemed to be 0.0%.

"Party A Rating" means, Party A's rating with respect to its long-term senior   
unsecured debt or its short-term debt, as applicable, by S&P on the related     
Valuation Date; provided, however, if both Party A's long-term debt and         
short-term debt are rated by S&P on such Valuation Date, then Party A Rating

                                                         EXHIBIT E
EVIDENCE OF INTEGRATION FOR TAX PURPOSES  

This information is retained on behalf of each Certificateholder and is         
intended to comply with requirements imposed by Section 1.1275-6(e) of the      
United States Treasury Regulations.                                             

   (1) The date the qualifying debt instrument was issued or acquired (or is
expected to be issued or acquired) by the taxpayer and the date the   
Section 1.1275-6 hedge was entered into by the taxpayer.              

The Trust acquired the qualifying debt instrument on September 9, 2004
and entered into the Section 1.1275-6 hedge on the same date. Each    
  Certificateholder simultaneously acquires its interest in the qualifying
 debt instrument and enters into the Section 1.1275-6 hedge on the trade
date identified in the trade confirmation for the purchase of         
Certificates.                                                         

(2) A description of the qualifying debt instrument and the Section   
1.1275-6 hedge.                                                       

The qualifying debt instrument is $5,000,000 in aggregate principal   
amount of 4.75% Subordinated Notes due April 1, 2014 issued by Morgan 
   Stanley. The Section 1.1275-6 hedge is a swap agreement between the Trust
and Wachovia Bank, N.A, as evidenced by an ISDA Master Agreement      
(including a schedule and credit support annex thereto) dated as of   
   September 9, 2004 and as supplemented by a confirmation number 447612 and
447674 in the form attached to this series supplement as Exhibit D.   

  (3) A summary of the cash flows and accruals resulting from treating the
qualifying debt instrument and the Section 1.1275-6 hedge as an       
integrated transaction (that is, the cash flows and accruals on the   
synthetic debt instrument).                                           

  A single principal payment of $5,000,000 is payable on the maturity date
of April 1, 2014. Interest at LIBOR plus 0.50% (but no less than 3.00% per      
annum and no more than 6.50% per annum) is payable on the 1st calendar day of   
each January, April, July and October (or if the 1st calendar day is not a      
business day, on the next succeeding business day).                             

   For any interest period (with respect to the first distribution date, the
period from and including the original issue date of the Certificates to, but   
excluding, the first distribution date, and thereafter, with respect to each    
distribution date, the period from and including the preceding distribution     
date to but excluding the current distribution date), three-month LIBOR will    
be, with respect to any LIBOR Determination Date, the London interbank offered  
rate for three month (such period being referred to as the "Designated
Maturity") United States dollar deposits, commencing on the second London       
Banking Day (as defined below) immediately following such LIBOR Determination   
Date, which appears on Telerate Page 3750 (as defined below) as of 11:00 a.m.,  
London time, on such LIBOR Determination Date. If such rate does not appear on  
Telerate Page 3750 at such time, LIBOR for the Designated Maturity will be      
determined on the                                                               

E-1   

P-->EX-4.1Last�Page�of�79TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�79th
basis of the rates at which deposits in U.S. Dollars are offered by the         
Reference Banks (as defined below) at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time,    
on the LIBOR Determination Date to prime banks in the London interbank market   
for a period of the Designated Maturity commencing on the first day of the      
related Interest Period and in an amount that is representative for a single    
transaction in such market at the relevant time. The Calculation Agent will     
request the principal London office of each of the Reference Banks to provide   
a quotation of its rate. If at least two such quotations are provided, the      
rate for that Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations.    
If fewer than two quotations are provided as requested, the rate for that       
Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted by major banks  
in New York City, selected by the Calculation Agent, at approximately 11:00     
a.m., New York City time, on the first day of the related Interest Period for   
loans in U.S. Dollars to leading European banks for a period of the Designated  
Maturity commencing on the first day of the related Interest Period and in an   
amount that is representative for a single transaction in such market at the    
relevant time.

Free access to more than 21 million filings
Since 1934, the SEC has required disclosure in forms and documents. In 1984, EDGAR began collecting electronic documents to help investors get information. The SEC's new system requires data disclosure — the next step to improve how investors find and use information.

You can search information collected by the SEC several ways:

Company or fund name, ticker symbol, CIK (Central Index Key), file number, state, country, or SIC (Standard Industrial Classification)
Most recent filings
Full text (past four years)
Boolean and advanced searching, including addresses
Key mutual fund disclosures
Mutual fund voting records
Mutual fund name, ticker, or SEC key (since Feb. 2006)
Variable insurance products (since Feb. 2006)

STANLEY TOLIN and EDWARD WALTON, Individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, Plaintiffs,
v.
AMBAC FINANCIAL GROUP, INC., ROBERT J. GENADER AND SEAN T. LEONARD, Defendants.


United States District Court, S.D. New York.
December 21, 2009.









MEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER DENYING DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT
McMahon, Judge.
This action raises what appears to be a question of first impression in this Circuit: does the Second Circuit's decision in Ontario Pub. Serv. Employees Union Pension Trust Fund v. Nortel Networks Corp., 369 F.3d 27 (2d Cir. 2004) (hereinafter "Nortel") bar the purchasers of a derivative securities product from bringing a 10(b)(5) action against the issuer of the securities that were bundled by a second issuer to create the derivative?
I conclude that it does not, at least not on the facts of this case.
Because defendants' other challenges to the face of the complaint are unpersuasive (and, for the most part, premature), their motion to dismiss is denied.
FACTS
The following facts are pleaded in the complaint and, as is always the case, are presumed true for purposes of this motion.
Ambac
Ambac was founded in 1971. Through its principal operating subsidiary, Ambac Assurance Corporation, it guaranteed public and private finance obligations. It was, for example, the first financial guarantor to insure the principal and interest of municipal bonds. Ambac became known as a "monoline" insurer, because it provided only one type of insurance: a guarantee to protect against the risk of default on credit instruments.
Ambac built a gold-plated reputation as one of the leading financial guarantee insurers in the world. It was known for insuring only the highest quality municipal bonds, assessing risk to a "remote-loss" underwriting standard; Ambac's 2006 Form 10-K advised investors that it only insured exposures that `are of investment grade quality with a remote risk of loss.' (Compl. ¶ 50.) In Ambac's public filings, and in public statements made by its executive officers, Ambac told investors "that it exercised rigorous and conservative underwriting standards to ensure that it only guaranteed and provided credit enhancement for the safest transactions, that it diligently monitored its insured portfolios, and that it was exposed to no material risk of loss." (Id. ¶ 11.) Various analysts from major commercial and investment banks, relying on those disclosures, issued reports stating in substance that Ambac was `not the market,' and that, `given Ambac's strict underwriting standards' (id. ¶ 13 (quoting report of Deutsche Bank)), it was unlikely to suffer significant losses on its mortgage portfolio.
Ambac first obtained a AAA credit rating—highest rating available—in 1979, and that rating never declined, regardless of the fortunes of the market, until the events giving rise to this lawsuit occurred. (Id. ¶¶ 12, 52.) Ambac's AAA credit rating was integral to its business success. Indeed, the Company's business model depended on maintaining its AAA rating. In its 2006 Form 10-K, Ambac stated, "triple-A financial strength ratings . . . are an essential part of Ambac Assurance's ability to provide credit enhancement and any reduction in these ratings could have a material adverse affect on Ambac Assurance's ability to compete in the financial guarantee business." (Id. ¶ 54 (alteration in original).)
Maintenance of the AAA credit rating was, of course, dependent on the soundness of the investments that Ambac guaranteed. The company's stated capital and claims paying ability were but a small fraction of the net financial guarantees Ambac had in force in the first quarter of 2007; plaintiffs allege that the failure of as little as 5% of Ambac's insured portfolio would be enough to wipe out Ambac's excess capital. For that reason, the quality of the company's underwriting and risk exposure monitoring was highly material to investors. (Id. ¶ 56.)
Ambac's Role in the Structured Finance Market
Beginning in at least 2005, Ambac guaranteed billions of dollars of private asset-backed structured financial instruments supported by collateral, including (1) residential mortgage backed securities ("RMBS"), which are collateralized by the underlying mortgages, and (2) collateralized debt obligations ("CDOs"), which are supported by large bundles of securitized RMBS rather than by the mortgages directly. Ambac directly insured the RMBS, and it issued credit default swaps ("CDS") to guarantee CDOs that were backed by bundles of RMBS. (Id. ¶ 4.)
According to the complaint, Ambac played a key role in the explosion of the RMBS and CDO markets, by providing direct insurance for RMBS and by providing protection for CDOs that were collateralized by bundles of RMBS via the use of credit default swaps. Ambac also allegedly insured increasing amounts of RMBS backed by secondary lien second mortgage loans, often home equity lines of credit. Such loans are, of course, riskier than first lien loans, because repayment is directly related to the borrower's ability to pay down the underlying first mortgage. And Ambac did not need to allocate as much capital to support credit default swaps, which made them at once riskier and more profitable for the company. (Id. ¶¶ 63-67.)
Plaintiffs allege that Ambac "effectively sold its AAA credit rating to enhance the credit rating of bonds and asset backed securities." (Id. ¶ 54.) At the direction of its executive officers (defendants Genader and Leonard), Ambac drastically lowered its underwriting standards so that it could "wrap, or guarantee, billions of dollars of high risk securities." (Id. ¶ 14 (internal quotations omitted).) The alleged mastermind of this strategic shift was Genader, who purportedly focused Ambac on the generation of greater profits rather than on risk management and loss avoidance in an effort to achieve net income of $1 billion per year in the near future. (Id. ¶ 15.) His purported motive for increasing revenue was, of course, his own pocketbook; his compensation was tied directly to Ambac's reported returns on equity, and he profited handsomely during 2005 and 2006—to the tune of over $17 million. (Id. 69.)
The importance to Ambac of preserving its credit rating and avoiding excessive risk came into conflict with the desire to earn more and more money. Ambac's "safe and stable" municipal bond insurance business was a diminishing source of growth. (Id. ¶ 57.) In order to achieve the income levels Genader desired, Ambac became more and more reliant on revenues from "the riskiest corners of the derivative securities business." (Id. ¶ 15; accord id. ¶ 70.) This required Ambac to relax its historic underwriting standards in various ways. One way was to adopt a new underwriting model, one designed to approve riskier portfolios of RMBS by relying on historical analysis of the originator's default rates rather than the quality of the loans that were actually in the securitized portfolio. (Id. ¶ 71-81.) Yet all the while, Ambac was advising the market that it was still engaged in conservative underwriting. (Id. ¶ 71.)
Ambac Securitizes Its Risky Investments through Wachovia
Plaintiffs are investors who purchased a derivative product known as Structured Repackaged Asset-Backed Trust Securities, Callable Class A Certificates, Series 2007-1, STRATS(SM) Trust for Ambac Financial Group Inc. Securities, Series 2001-1 (hereinafter "STRATS"). The STRATS, which bore an interest rate of 6.7%, were issued on June 29, 2007; the purported class period runs from the date of issuance through and including April 22, 2008.
Plaintiffs and other STRATS owners have, by virtue of their investment, a beneficial interest in a trust that is funded with a single asset: securities issued by Ambac, known as Ambac February 2007 Directly-Issued Subordinated Capital Securities ("DISCS"), bearing an interest rate of 6.15%. The STRATS themselves, however, were not issued by Ambac; rather, they were packaged and issued by a subsidiary of Wachovia Bank, known as Synthetic Fixed-Income Securities, Inc. ("SFIS") (emphasis added)— which is one of the most aptly descriptive names for a special purpose vehicle since LHIW (Let's Hope It Works), Inc. See Wellman v. Dickinson, 475 F.Supp. 783 (S.D.N.Y. 1979).
Both the Wachovia-issued STRATS and the underlying Ambac-issued DISCS are asset-backed securities. Asset-backed securitization is a financing technique in which financial assets are pooled and converted into instruments that can be sold in capital markets. An entity known as the "sponsor" (in this case, Ambac) originates or acquires a pool of financial assets (the DISCS), and then sells those assets to an issuer (SFIS/Wachovia), which places the assets in a specially created investment vehicle (usually a trust) that issues and sells interests (securities) that are "backed" (supported) by the underlying financial assets. Transactions that pool and securitize outstanding debt securities issued by third party companies are marketed to retail investors and are listed on a national securities exchange. (Compl. ¶ 2.) Payment on asset-backed securities is a function of cash flows generated by the assets in the underlying pool. (Id. ¶ 3.) In this case, while the DISCS are the underlying financial assets that immediately back the STRATS, the real underlying assets were the residential mortgages themselves, which had been securitized via RMBS, and perhaps securitized again into CDOs, which were guaranteed by Ambac, which securitized its own guarantees by creating the DISCS and selling them off to the public through the medium of SIFS.1
The complaint alleges—and it is obvious enough—that ABS securities and ABS issuers differ significantly from garden-variety corporate securities and their issuers when it comes to making the disclosures required under the federal securities laws. The issuer of the ABS (in this case, SFIS) generally has no business or management to describe—it is a so-called Special Purpose Vehicle ("SPV"), and its business consists of taking pools of assets that were assembled by someone else (many of which are themselves ABS, like RMBS and CDOs), and securitizing (or resecuritizing) those pools. Plaintiffs allege that ABS investors value securities by examining the characteristics and quality of the underlying asset pool and the timing and certainty of cash flows from the underlying asset pool. Plaintiffs further allege that the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") has recognized the unique nature of ABS products, to the point of providing a separate regulatory framework to govern them. Of particular importance to this case are SEC regulations that allow the issuer of an asset-backed security to make the disclosures required by the securities laws by referring to the filings of the issuer of the security that backs the ABS. 17 C.F.R. § 210 et seq. This rule recognizes the fact that an ABS issuer would find it difficult to obtain and analyze some other party's financial information, and so sends the investor back to the underlying issuer's financial statements for information pertinent to the investment decision. (Compl. ¶ 7.)
In the Prospectus and Registration Statement for STRATS here at issue, SFIS refers to Ambac's public filings with respect to the DISCS, and informed investors that they should "obtain and evaluate the same information concerning the Underlying Issuer as they would obtain and evaluate if they were investing directly in the DISCS or in other debt securities issued by the Underlying Issuer." (Id. ¶ 9 (internal quotations omitted).) The Prospectus also cautioned STRATS purchasers that they would "be exposed to the credit risk of the Underlying Issuer." The Underlying Issuer was, of course, Ambac. (Id. (internal quotations omitted).)
So plaintiffs and other members of the putative class purchased STRATS, an ABS backed solely by Ambac-issued debt securities (the DISCS), which were in turn backed by pools of collateralized debt obligations on mortgage-backed securities, or by mortgage-backed securities themselves, all of which were insured or guaranteed by Ambac, purportedly in accordance with its highly-touted historic underwriting standards.
The STRATS prospectus stated that it was a condition to the issuance of the STRATS that they be rated by Standard & Poor's Rating Services ("S&P") "at least as highly as the Underlying Securities." The Underlying Securities are the DISCS, which were (at the time) rated "A+" by S&P. (Id. ¶ 10.)
The Alleged Securities Fraud
Plaintiffs contend that Ambac, Genader and Leonard knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that Ambac's own publicly issued securities (including the DISCS that were repackaged into the STRATS) were losing market value because of the increasing likelihood of default on residential mortgages. This loss of value in turn jeopardized Ambac's ability to repay the debt securities (the DISCS) that backed the STRATS owned by plaintiffs. (Id. ¶ 14.)
Starting in 2005 and extending into 2007, plaintiffs allege that the quality of mortgage loans that were pooled together into RMBS-related deals deteriorated with each successive quarter. Ambac, which received monthly or quarterly reports on all the transactions that it guaranteed (id. ¶ 84), and which purported to conduct quarterly reviews and perform due diligence with respect to mortgage originators (id. ¶ 86), had to have been aware of the increase in delinquency rates and default rates on the underlying loans in the RMBS it was insuring. Yet Ambac did not mark its CDOs to market, as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 133 (SFAS133), entitled "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities." This had the effect of inflating Ambac's earnings, allowing the company to show a profit and positive earnings per share when it was in fact experiences significant losses. (Id. ¶¶ 94-99.)
By June 2007, when the STRATS were marketed, Ambac and its executive officers were well aware that the housing market had been in decline for months (according to plaintiffs, this was apparent by late 2006. (See id. ¶¶ 71, 86.)
During the class period, rather than report collateral deterioration and mark-to-market write-downs in line with a deteriorating market, defendants allegedly bolstered Ambac's stock price by insisting that market deterioration did not indicate any deterioration in Ambac's portfolio. (Id. ¶ 90.) As noted above, various analysts bought into Ambac's representations, telling their customers that Ambac was "not the market" and that that the company's "conservative" management team was "comfortable that losses will be minimal." (Id. ¶ 148 (internal quotations omitted).) Yet when someone (not Ambac) finally disclosed what collateral underlay Ambac-insured CDOs, studies revealed that the RMBS insured by Ambac did not perform better than the market at all. While the average percentage of underlying mortgages in Ambac-insured RMBS that were in delinquency by 30-59 days was under 1% in the summer of 2006, that figure had doubled by the end of 2006, tripled by the late summer of 2007 and quadrupled by the end of 2007.
Plaintiffs allege that Ambac's reported earnings for the years 2002 through 2007 were more than wiped out by the massive write-downs and increased reserves that Ambac would be forced to take when the mortgage markets froze in the fall of 2007— only months after the issuance of the STRATS that plaintiffs purchased.
On January 16, 2008, a mere 6 months after SFIS issued the STRATS, Ambac announced that it was taking $5.4 billion in mark-to-market write-downs on its then $29 billion in exposure to CDOs supported by RMBS, as well as recognizing $1.1 billion of actual impairment on these exposures. Ambac nearly tripled its loss reserves due to the deterioration of its direct RMBS portfolio, and reduced dividend payouts by 67%. In response to this announcement, the trading price of STRATS securities collapsed, falling from $20.35 per Class A Certificate to $8.95 in just three days. Further announcements during the class period revealed that Ambac's RMBS included a "wide range of loans" whose characteristics were far riskier than had previously been disclosed, and Ambac reported massive losses at the end of the first quarter 2008. Ambac's debt securities declined in value so dramatically that the price of STRATS reached $2.47 on November 18, 2008. (Id. ¶¶ 14-18.)
This lawsuit followed. Defendants moved to dismiss, arguing that plaintiffs lacked standing to sue them because they had purchased securities issued by an entity other than Ambac (SFIS). Defendants also asserted that the massive and detailed (267 paragraph, 103 page) complaint—which specifically identifies the time and content of dozens of allegedly false disclosures—failed to meet the pleading standards for a securities fraud complaint.
The motion is denied in all respects.
DISCUSSION
I. STANDARD OF REVIEW
To survive a motion to dismiss, "a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter . . . to `state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)). "A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Id. (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556). "While a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss does not need detailed factual allegations, a plaintiffs obligation to provide the grounds of his entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do." Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (internal quotations, citations, and alterations omitted). Thus, unless a plaintiffs well-pleaded allegations have "nudged [its] claims across the line from conceivable to plausible, [the plaintiff's] complaint must be dismissed." Id. at 570; Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1950-51.
Additionally, claims sounding in fraud must meet Rule 9(b)'s heightened pleading standard. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). To comply with Rule 9(b), a complainant "must: (1) specify the statements that the plaintiff contends were fraudulent, (2) identify the speaker, (3) state where and when the statements were made, and (4) explain why the statements were fraudulent." Lerner v. Fleet Bank, N.A., 459 F.3d 273, 290 (2d Cir. 2006) (quoting Mills v. Polar Molecular Corp., 12 F.3d 1170, 1175 (2d Cir. 1993)) (internal quotations omitted). Although Rule 9(b) provides that "intent, knowledge, and other conditions of mind may be averred generally," a plaintiff must allege sufficient facts to create a "strong inference" of scienter. Kalnit v. Eichler, 264 F.3d 131, 137-38 (2d Cir. 2001).
Similarly, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Pub.L. 104-67, 109 Stat. 737 (1995) (codified as amended in sections of 15 U.S.C.) ("PSLRA"), requires a private plaintiff bringing claims under certain federal securities laws (including Section 10(b)) to "state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind." 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(2). To establish a "strong inference" of scienter, as required by the PSLRA, the inference must be such that a "reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged." Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308, 324 (2007). Plaintiffs may discharge their burden of pleading a strong inference of scienter under both the PSLRA and Rule 9(b) by alleging facts "(1) showing that the defendants had both motive and opportunity to commit the fraud or (2) constituting strong circumstantial evidence of conscious misbehavior or recklessness." ATSI Commc'ns, Inc. v. Shaar Fund, Ltd., 493 F.3d 87, 99 (2d Cir.2007) (citation omitted) (PSLRA); accord In re AOL Time Warner, Inc. Sec. & "ERISA" Litig., 381 F.Supp.2d 192, 206 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (citations omitted) (Rule 9(b)).
II. PLAINTIFFS HAVE STANDING TO SUE AMBAC FOR SECURITIES FRAUD
It is undisputed that the securities purchased by the plaintiffs were issued by SFIS, not by Ambac. The question posed by defendants' motion is whether plaintiffs have standing to sue Ambac for making material misrepresentations about its earnings, underwriting criteria and business prospects.
Defendants say not. Indeed, defendants say that the Second Circuit's decision in Nortel, which binds this Court, resolves the question in their favor.
Plaintiffs say not so.
I agree with plaintiffs.
To understand why, it is necessary to discuss Nortel, 369 F.3d 27 (2d Cir. 2004), in some detail.
In Nortel, the plaintiff purchased stock in a public company called JDS Uniphase, a manufacturer of fiber optic components. JDS Uniphase had an extensive business relationship with a second public company, Nortel Networks, which was a global supplier of telecommunications services. Indeed, Nortel was JDS' largest customer, accounting for 10-15% of the latter's revenues. Nortel also made fiber optics products.
At a time when the market was flooded with rumors that JDS was going to sell part of its business to Nortel in exchange for Nortel stock, Nortel publicly made several rosy prognostications about the demand for its (i.e., Nortel's) fiber optics products, and also predicted 30% growth in revenue and earnings for 2001. Both Nortel and JDS stock moved up following Nortel's statements. However, within days after Nortel and JDS consummated the asset sale described above, Nortel cut revenue estimates for the quarter and announced that revenue growth for 2001 would be closer to 15%. Following this announcement, the value of both Nortel and JDS shares tumbled in heavy trading.
Plaintiffs sued Nortel under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, alleging that Nortel's favorable statements about its own business prospects (1) were false, in that Nortel had actually known for some time that demand was falling for its fiber optics products, and (2) had caused JDS's stock price to inflate, thereby causing plaintiffs to purchase their JDS shares at an artificially high price. Nortel sought dismissal on the ground that JDS shareholders lacked standing to sue Nortel for allegedly misleading disclosures about Nortel's business. The district court (Berman, J.) granted Nortel's motion.
The Second Circuit affirmed Judge Berman's ruling. The Court of Appeals noted that neither Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 ('34 Act) nor Rule 10b-5 thereunder explicitly created a private right of action in favor of anyone. Nonetheless, various courts had implied such a right of action since at least 1946. Nortel, 369 F.3d at 30-31. In Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U.S. 723 (1975), the Supreme Court had ruled that only purchasers or sellers of securities could sue under the antifraud provisions of the '34 Act and Rule 10b-5. Writing for the panel in Nortel, Judge Pooler noted that:
In this case, plaintiffs are quick to point out that they did purchase securities after the alleged misrepresentations took place. However, instead of purchasing securities of the entity that made the alleged misrepresentation, they purchased securities of a company that had a business relationship with the misrepresenter. They claim that they have met the Blue Chip Stamps standing requirements because they purchased the security at issue in their lawsuit. They base this argument on the references in Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 to fraudulent conduct "in connection with the purchases or sale of any security." In plaintiffs' view, the word "any" indicates that the intent of Congress and the SEC was to create universal standing for purchasers of securities, allowing anyone who made use of the markets to sue under Rule 10b-5.
369 F. 3d at 32 (citations omitted).
Having set out plaintiffs' argument, the Court of Appeals proceeded to reject it:
Plaintiffs assume that the phrase "any security" includes securities of any company affected in some way by the misrepresentation and not just securities of the company that makes the material misstatements. However, in our view, the phrase indicates that the regulations reach all types of securities, and not any affected company's securities. Furthermore, plaintiffs' interpretation of this passage is entirely at odds with the purchaser-seller requirement in Blue Chip Stomps that "limits the class of plaintiffs to those who have at least dealt in the security to which the prospectus, representation, or omission relates."
Id. (citations omitted).
After additional discussion of precedents, the Circuit summarized its holding: "Stockholders do not have standing to sue under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 when the company whose stock they purchased is negatively impacted by the material misstatement of another company, whose stock they do not purchase." Id. at 34.
For several years after Nortel, various defendants, relying on the language just quoted and an equally sweeping statement elsewhere in the Second Circuit's opinion, argued—sometimes successfully—that no liability can exist under Rule 10b-5 for "statements by a non-issuer [of the security that is the subject of the suit] about a non-issuer." See e.g., In re NYSE Specialists Sec. Litig., 405 F.Supp.2d 281, 305 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (citation omitted). The Second Circuit put that notion to rest, however, when it reversed the district court's dismissal of the complaint in the NYSE Specialists case. See In re NYSE Specialists Sec. Litig., 503 F.3d 89 (2d Cir. 2007). In an opinion by now-Justice Sotomayor, the court noted that an overly broad reading of the above-quoted language "would place beyond the reach of Rule 10b-5 false statements made by underwriters, brokers, bankers, and non-issuer sellers." Id. at 102. Justice Sotomayor went on to say that this was not what the Nortel court had in mind:
On the basis of a business relationship between JDS Uniphase and Nortel Networks, the plaintiffs claimed that their purchase price for JDS Uniphase stock had been inflated by Nortel Networks' false statements about itself. In the particular circumstances of the case, the connection between Nortel Networks' false statements about itself and the plaintiffs purchase of JDS Uniphase stock was too remote to sustain an action under Rule 10b-5. In short, the district court incorrectly read Nortel Networks to mean that an action under Rule 10b-5 for false statements about a security purchased by the plaintiff lies only against the issuer of the security, or that only statements about a security issuer are actionable. Accordingly, we vacate the district court's decision with respect to statutory standing.
Id.
It is thus quite clear that Defendants' simplistic analysis of Nortel is predicated on a reading of that decision that the Second Circuit has disavowed. Whether a purchaser or seller of a security has standing to bring an action under the antifraud provisions of the '34 Act is ultimately a function of the remoteness between the false statements and the plaintiffs purchase of a particular stock. Standing is not exclusively a function of who made the false statements, although that is undoubtedly one factor a court can consider in making its determination. Thus, much as defendants might wish it, Nortel does not mandate dismissal of plaintiffs' complaint.
Indeed, much of what is quoted above from Nortel augurs in favor of according these plaintiffs standing to sue Ambac. Unlike the plaintiffs in Nortel, plaintiffs here purchased a security that was by its terms directly related to the business of Ambac. The security was a derivative created out of financial assets that belonged to Ambac. The security was no doubt created at the behest of Ambac; the idea behind securitizing financial assets is to pass the risk represented by those assets off to someone else. See generally Steven L. Schwarcz, The Alchemy of Asset Securitization, 1 Stan. J. L. Bus. & Fin. 133, 135 (1994). The securities were held in a trust "for Ambac." Indeed, the securities' name includes the word Ambac; the name does not include any reference to Wachovia or SFIS, the technical issuer.
Furthermore, the security purchased by the plaintiffs was "a security to which the alleged misrepresentations relate. . . ." In Nortel, the Second Circuit, relying on the Supreme Court's decision in Blue Chip Stamps, recognized that relationship as the key element in the standing equation. The SEC understands this; it requires the special purpose vehicles that issue derivatives like the STRATS to tell potential purchasers that they should look to the disclosures made by the company whose assets are securitized when they assess the risk of their investment. Thus, a rule promulgated by the agency responsible for regulating the securities markets makes it clear that plaintiffs and the class they seek to represent—persons who could be expected to look to Ambac's representations about its business in making an informed decision about whether to purchase or sell STRATS are part of "the precise class for the protection of which the 1934 Act was enacted." Deutschman v. Beneficial Corp., 841 F.2d 502, 507 (3d Cir. 1988). Indeed, on the facts alleged, I cannot imagine any other entity whose SEC filings and public statements made to the press and to market analysts would have the slightest relevance to an informed decision to deal in the STRATS that are the subject of this lawsuit.
Nothing in In re Refco Capital Markets. Ltd. Brokerage Customer Sec. Litig., 586 F.Supp.2d 172, 179-80 (S.D.N.Y. 2008), suggests that these plaintiffs ought not be accorded standing to sue Ambac. As plaintiffs note in their memorandum of law, the plaintiffs in Refco lacked standing because they neither purchased nor sold anything, and nothing was purchased or sold on their behalf. That is simply not the case here.
Finally, in Blue Chip Stamps, the Supreme Court held that "policy considerations" could properly be taken into account when deciding whether an entity has standing to sue under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. See 421 U.S. at 737. Relevant policy consideration supports allowing plaintiffs to sue Ambac.
The primary purpose of the securities laws is to provide protection to investors. See e.g., Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185, 195 (1976). The development and evolution of new and complex financial instruments, such as ABS and RMBS and CDOs, created new challenges for investors who are trying to make informed decisions. While scholars and commentators have called for a variety of new laws to deal with this development—with some even going so far as to suggest making subprime mortgages themselves subject to the federal securities laws,2 and others suggesting a revision of Blue Chip Stamps' "purchaser or sale" requirement3—we need not consider these and other interesting suggestions for expanding existing law, because in our case we are dealing with instruments that are admittedly securities, and that are already subject to federal law. The issue for this Court is whether it makes sense, as a policy matter, to allow purchasers of a derivative security to bring suit under Section 10(b) and Rule 10-b(5) against the firm whose assets have been securitized by a shell corporation, on the theory that persons who purchased those securities were defrauded about their value, not by some statement about the issuer, but by inaccurate descriptions of the securitized assets that were made by the owner of those assets.
The question answers itself. SPVs like SFIS have been described as "essentially robot firms" that are "thinly capitalized" and "have no employees, make no substantive economic decisions, have no physical location, and cannot go bankrupt." Gary Gorton and Nicholas S. Souleles, Special Purpose Vehicles and Securitization, in The Risks of Financial Institutions 550 (Mark Carey & Rene Stulz eds., 2007). By design, the SPV that issues the securities does not function as a separate, independent entity except on paper. Its purpose it to serve as a pass-through vehicle for money going to corporations like Ambac and securities (and the risk they represent) going to investors like plaintiffs. Plaintiffs could never recover anything from the SPV, so limiting the right to sue for misrepresentations in connection with the purchase of a derivative to the shell corporation that is technically the "issuer" means that the investing public has no recourse, while underlying issuers like Ambac—which benefited by passing off its risk to the investing public, while being handsomely paid for doing so—are insulated from their own alleged frauds.
It is true that allowing plaintiffs to sue Ambac expands the class of persons who can sue that company. However, I agree with Judge Schwarzer in Zelman v. JDS Uniphase Corp., 376 F.Supp.2d 956 (N.D. Cal. 2005) that this expansion will not lead willy-nilly to a world in which any investor can sue any corporation on any cock-and-bull theory that the corporation's public statements have affected some wholly unrelated security. Id. at 961-63. Nortel is still good law in this Circuit, so where the relationship between Corporation A's disclosures and Corporation B's stock price is too remote, Corporation B's shareholders cannot sue Corporation A under the antifraud provisions of the '34 Act. In this case, however, the relationship between Ambac's disclosures and the STRATS is anything but remote, as the SEC regulations make clear. Therefore, this Court is perfectly comfortable in concluding that plaintiffs have standing to sue Ambac if material misstatements made by that company illegally inflated the price of the STRATS that issued "for benefit of Ambac."4
III. THE PLEADING IS OTHERWISE SUFFICIENT
With standing established, it is clear that there is no basis on which to dismiss the instant complaint.
"The basic elements of a cause of action for securities fraud under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 are (1) a material misstatement or omission, (2) scienter, (3) a connection with the purchase or sale of a security, (4) reliance, often referred to in cases involving public securities markets (fraud-on-the-market cases) as `transaction causation,' (5) economic loss, and (6) loss causation, i.e., a causal connection between the material misrepresentation and the loss." In re Salomon Analyst Metromedia Litig., 544 F.3d 474, 478 n. 1 (2d Cir. 2008) (citing Dura Pharm., Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U.S. 336, 341 (2005)) (internal quotations omitted). In addition, as discussed above, plaintiff must identify specific fraudulent statements or omissions, and must state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter.
The Plaintiffs have clearly met their burden of identifying specific alleged fraudulent statements. They have identified numerous specific statements and disclosures that they allege were fraudulent, and identified who made them, when they were made and why they were allegedly fraudulent.
As discussed above, the alleged misstatements were made in connection with the purchase or sale of a security, and Plaintiffs have adequately pled that they relied on the alleged misstatements and suffered an economic loss. Further, they have adequately pled loss causation. Plaintiffs have identified several corrective disclosures that allegedly demonstrated the falsity of defendants' previous statements, and have also alleged that the value of their securities declines following the corrective disclosures. That is sufficient at the pleadings stage. See Dura Pharm., 544 U.S. at 346-8.
The only remaining issue is whether Plaintiffs have adequately pled, with sufficient particularity, "facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind." PSLRA, 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(2). The Second Circuit has stated that:
the required strong inference may arise where the complaint sufficiently alleges that the defendants: (1) benefitted in a concrete and personal way from the purported fraud; (2) engaged in deliberately illegal behavior; (3) knew facts or had access to information suggesting that their public statements were not accurate; or (4) failed to check information they had a duty to monitor.
Teamsters Local 445 Freight Division Pension Fund v. Dynex Capital, Inc., 531 F.3d 190, 194 (2d Cir. 2008) (citing Novak v. Kasaks, 206 F.3d 300, 311 (2d Cir. 2000)). "When the defendant is a corporate entity, this means that the pleaded facts must create a strong inference that someone whose intent could be imputed to the corporation acted with the requisite scienter. In most cases, the most straightforward way to raise such an inference for a corporate defendant will be to plead it for an individual defendant." Id. at 195.
Here, Plaintiffs have adequately pled specific facts that, if proved, raise the necessary strong inference as to both Genader and Leonard, and consequently raised such an inference with regards to Ambac.
Plaintiffs have alleged that Genader's compensation was tied to short-term profits and that he actively took steps to increase those short-term profits at the expense of prudential risk management for the purpose of increasing his own compensation. Plaintiffs also allege that Genader was closely involved in the formulation of Ambac's public statements and representations, and that he knew they were materially misleading, because it was at his behest that Ambac was no longer adhering to the underwriting standards it was touting to the public. These allegations are sufficient to raise a strong inference of scienter as to defendant Genader.
As for Leonard, Plaintiffs have alleged in detail that he either made public statements or participated in conference calls, in which he represented both that Ambac was continuing to be conservative in its approach and that it was actively monitoring its own portfolio to ensure that general market woes were not negatively affecting Ambac. Taking the allegations of the complaint as true, then Leonard either: (1) knew facts or had access to information that Ambac's public statements about its underwriting and risk management were inaccurate, because Ambac was not adhering to its historically conservative approach; or (2) failed to check information he had a duty to monitor, namely, that Ambac was in fact monitoring the mortgage portfolio that underlay its insurance and was accurately disclosing the risks inherent in that portfolio. Either of these scenarios raises a sufficiently strong inference of scienter as to defendant Leonard. See Dynex Capital, 531 F.3d at 194.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Defendants motion to dismiss the Complaint is denied. This constitutes the decision and order of the Court. The Clerk of the Court is instructed to remove the motion to dismiss (docket no. 15) from the Court's outstanding motion list.


FootNotes 
1. For some months, a collection of cartoons entitled "The Subprime Primer" has circulated on the internet and been distributed to students of business and finance. It describes (using language that cannot be quoted in a judicial opinion) the various steps in asset-backed securitization involving mortgages, from the taking out of a mortgage by a homebuyer who cannot afford it through the various levels of securitization of the ensuing risk and on to the ultimate default—i.e., the process summarized here. It is highly instructive.

2. See Richard E. Mendales, Collateralized Explosive Devices: Why Securities Regulation Failed to Prevent the CDO Meltdown, and How to Fix It, 2009 U. Ill. L. Rev. 1359, 1407 (2009); Jonathan Macey et al., Helping Law Catch Up to Markets: Applying Broker-Dealer Law to Subprime Mortgages, 34 J. Corp. L. 789, 813 (2009). Professor Mendales proposes modification of the securities laws to cover mortgages and other debt instruments that will be securitized. Mendales, supra, at 1407. Macey et al. argue instead that the current antifraud provisions of the securities laws are sufficient, but should be applied more broadly. They argue, inter alia, that because the securitization process turns subprime mortgages into traded securities, the mortgage origination itself falls under the securities laws as a transaction in connection with the purchase or sale of a security. Macey et al., supra, at 813. Therefore, they argue subprime borrowers should be entitled to the protections of the antifraud provisions of the securities laws with respect to their mortgages.

3. See Doug Winnard, Know When to Hold `Em, Know When to Fold `Em: The Collapse of the Auction Rate Securities Market and the Problem of Standing for Securities Holders Under Rule 10b-5, 104 Nw. U. L. Rev. (forthcoming 2010), available at http://ssrn.com/abstract=1392046. Winnard argues that investors in auction-rate securities (a financing instrument created in the mid-1980s, whose market collapse in early 2008 was an early casualty of the financial crisis) should be allowed to bring "holder" claims under 10b-5; claims which have been disallowed since Blue Chip Stamps. Id. at *4. Further, Winner argues that "developments in both securities markets and securities law require the Court to —examine the standing requirements for injured securities holders." Id. at *6.

4. Obviously, one must engage in a line-drawing exercise in order to decide whether Issuer A's securities are or are not so remote from Issuer B as to preclude suit against Issuer B by the holders of Issuer A's securities. The inextricable intertwining of Ambac with the STRATS makes this an easy case—it is hard to imagine a closer (or less remote) relationship—just as Nortel strikes me as an easy case in the other direction. It may not always be easy to figure out on which side of the "remoteness/closeness" line a situation falls, but this Court finds it unnecessary to make any black-and-white pronouncement in order to dispose of the challenge here mounted to plaintiffs' standing.

Commission Announcements
Commission Charges Traders in Massive Kickback Scheme Involving Venezuelan Official
The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) today charged four individuals with ties to a New York City brokerage firm in a scheme involving millions of dollars in illicit bribes paid to a high-ranking Venezuelan finance official to secure the bond trading business of a state-owned Venezuelan bank.
According to the SEC’s complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, the global markets group at broker-dealer Direct Access Partners (DAP) executed fixed income trades for customers in foreign sovereign debt.  DAP Global generated more than $66 million in revenue for DAP from transaction fees – in the form of markups and markdowns – on riskless principal trade executions in Venezuelan sovereign or state-sponsored bonds for Banco de Desarrollo Económico y Social de Venezuela (BANDES).  A portion of this revenue was illicitly paid to BANDES Vice President of Finance, María de los Ángeles González de Hernandez, who authorized the fraudulent trades.
“These traders triggered a fraud that was staggering in audacity and scope,” said Andrew M. Calamari, Director of the SEC’s New York Regional Office.  “They thought they covered their tracks by using offshore accounts and a shadow accounting system to monitor their illicit profits and bribes, but they underestimated the SEC’s tenacity in piecing the scheme together.”
The SEC’s complaint charges the following individuals for the roles in the kickback scheme:

Tomas Alberto Clarke Bethancourt, who lives in Miami and is an executive vice president at DAP.  Known as “Tomas Clarke,” he was responsible for executing the fraudulent trades and maintaining spreadsheets tracking the illicit markups and markdowns on those trades.
Iuri Rodolfo Bethancourt, who lives in Panama and received more than $20 million in fraudulent proceeds from DAP via his Panamanian shell company, which then paid Gonzalez a portion of this amount.
Jose Alejandro Hurtado, who lives in Miami and served as the intermediary between DAP and Gonzalez.  Hurtado was paid more than $6 million in kickbacks disguised as salary payments from DAP, and he remitted some of that money to Gonzalez.  
Haydee Leticia Pabon, who is Hurtado’s wife and received approximately $8 million in markups or markdowns on BANDES trades that were funneled to her from DAP in the form of sham finders’ fees.

In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Gonzalez as well as Clarke and Hurtado.
According to the SEC’s complaint, the scheme began in October 2008 and continued until at least June 2010.  BANDES was a new customer to DAP brought in by DAP Global executives through their connections to Hurtado.  As a result of the kickbacks to Gonzalez, DAP obtained BANDES’ lucrative trading business and provided Gonzalez with the incentive to enter into trades with DAP at considerable markups or markdowns without regard to the prices paid by BANDES.  Gonzalez used her senior role at the Caracas-based bank to ensure that its bond trades would continue to be steered to DAP.  As the scheme evolved over time, the traders deceived DAP’s clearing brokers, executed internal wash trades, inter-positioned another broker-dealer in the trades to conceal their role in the transactions, and engaged in massive roundtrip trades to pad their revenue.  
For example, the SEC alleges that in January 2010, the traders and Gonzalez arranged for two fraudulent roundtrip trades with BANDES as both buyer and seller.  These trades – which lacked any legitimate business purpose – caused BANDES to pay DAP more than $10 million in fees, a portion of which was diverted to Gonzalez for authorizing the blatantly fraudulent trades.  
The SEC further alleges that, giving rise to the adage of no honor among thieves, Clarke and Hurtado frequently falsified the size of DAP’s fees in their reports to Gonzalez, which enabled the traders to retain a greater share of the fraudulent profits.
The SEC’s complaint charges Clarke, Bethancourt, Hurtado, and Pabon with fraud and seeks final judgments that would require them to return ill-gotten gains with interest and pay financial penalties.
The SEC’s investigation, which is continuing, was conducted by Wendy Tepperman, Amanda Straub, and Michael Osnato of the New York Regional Office.  The SEC’s litigation will be led by Howard Fischer.  An SEC examination of DAP that that led to the investigation was conducted by members of the New York office’s broker-dealer examination staff.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. (Press Rel. 2013-84)
Commission Announces Panelists for Credit Ratings Roundtable
The Commission today announced the panelists for its Credit Ratings Roundtable, which will be held on May 14.
As previously announced, the roundtable will consist of three panels. The first panel will discuss the potential creation of a credit rating assignment system for asset-backed securities.  The second panel will discuss the effectiveness of the SEC’s current system to encourage unsolicited ratings of asset-backed securities.  The third panel will discuss other alternatives to the current issuer-pay business model in which the issuer selects and pays the firm it wants to provide credit ratings for its securities.
The event will be held in the auditorium at the SEC’s Washington, D.C., headquarters at 100 F Street, N.E., beginning at 9 a.m. and ending at approximately 4:30 p.m.  The public is invited to attend, with seating available on a first-come, first-served basis.  The event will be webcast live on the SEC’s website and archived for later viewing.  (Press Rel. 2013-83)
ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS
In the Matter of Ziad K. Abdelnour
The Commission today issued an Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 15(b) and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Section 9(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order (Order) against Ziad K. Abdelnour based on Abdelnour’s scheme to offer and sell fictitious “prime bank” securities.
The Order finds that from at least September 2009 to April 2011, Abdelnour, acting through Blackhawk Partners, Inc., a purported private equity “family office,” solicited investors to invest in trading programs that purportedly yielded returns of up to 600% in as little as seven days, with no risk.  None of this was true, however.  Abdelnour, a long-time registered representative with an MBA from one of the top business schools, attempted to sell the programs by means of representations on Blackhawk’s website and in emails to prospective investors that he knew, or was reckless in not knowing, were false, and he continued to do so even after receipt of a Commission subpoena.  The Order finds that although Abdelnour did not succeed in selling any of the fictitious securities, as a result of his fraud, Abdelnour willfully violated Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act, and by engaging in unregistered broker-dealer activity, he willfully violated Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act. 
Based on the above, the Order requires Abdelnour to pay a civil money penalty in the amount of $25,000 and orders him to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of the above-referenced provisions of the Securities Act and Exchange Act.  The Order further bars Abdelnour from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization; bars him from serving or acting as an employee, officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment adviser or depositor of, or principal underwriter for, a registered investment company or affiliated person of such investment adviser, depositor or principal underwriter; and bars him from participating in any offering of a penny stock, including: acting as a promoter, finder, consultant, agent or other person who engages in activities with a broker, dealer or issuer for purposes of the issuance of or trading in any penny stock, or inducing or attempting to induce the purchase or sale of any penny stock; with the right to apply for reentry after five years to the appropriate self-regulatory organization, or if there is none, to the Commission.  
Abdelnour consented to the issuance of the Order without admitting or denying any of the findings.  (Rels. 33- 9402; 34- 69530; IC- 30508; File No. 3-15318)
In the Matter of Frank Bluestein
The Commission announced the issuance of an Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Notice of Hearing (Order) against Frank Bluestein (Bluestein) based upon the entry of a Permanent Injunction entered against him in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan (Securities and Exchange Commission v. Frank Bluestein, Civil Action No. 09-CV-13809).
In the Order, the Division of Enforcement alleges that on April 24, 2013, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan entered a judgment against Bluestein, which permanently enjoined Bluestein from violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.  
A hearing will be scheduled before an Administrative Law Judge to determine whether the allegations contained in the Order are true, and to provide the Respondent an opportunity to dispute these allegations, and to determine what, if any, remedial sanctions are appropriate and in the public interest.
The Order requires the Administrative Law Judge to issue an initial decision no later than 210 days from the date of service of this Order, pursuant to Rule 360(a)(2) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice.  (Rels. 34-69529; IC- 3603; File No. 3-15317)
Final Judgments Entered against Richard Verdiramo and Vincent L. Verdiramo, Esq.
The Commission announced today that on April 29, 2013, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York entered final judgments against Richard Verdiramo and Vincent L. Verdiramo, Esq., that require the defendants to pay full disgorgement and civil money penalties, and bar them from penny stock offerings and from serving as officers or directors of public companies.  This relief supplements the injunctions and disgorgement that the SEC had previously obtained and concludes the SEC’s case against the defendants.
In March 2010, the SEC charged Richard Verdiramo, RECOV Energy Corp.’s former Chairman, CEO, President, and CFO, with, among other things, committing fraud and violating the securities registration requirements based on his issuances of RECOV stock for his and his father’s personal benefit. The SEC charged his father, Vincent Verdiramo, an attorney who facilitated the misconduct and who was a recipient of some of the RECOV stock, with aiding and abetting his son’s fraud and with violating the securities registration requirements.  
The Court previously ordered all of the injunctive relief sought by the Commission in its Complaint against both Richard and Vincent Verdiramo for all of their misconduct.  The Court had also previously ordered the defendants to pay full disgorgement for their violations of the securities registration requirements, including holding Richard Verdiramo jointly and severally liable with other defendants.  In November 2011, the SEC issued an order suspending Vincent Verdiramo from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.
The recent judgment requires Richard Verdiramo to disgorge an additional $145,000 in ill-gotten gains plus $61,968 in prejudgment interest, and requires him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  In addition, the Court barred Richard Verdiramo from participating in any penny stock offering and from serving as an officer or director of any reporting company for five years.  The Judgment against Vincent Verdiramo orders him to disgorge an additional $462,000 in ill-gotten gains, plus $197,444 in prejudgment interest, and requires him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  The Court also permanently barred Vincent Verdiramo from participating in any penny stock offering and from serving as an officer or director of any reporting company.  Both Richard and Vincent Verdiramo consented to the entry of the final judgments against them without admitting or denying any of the allegations of the SEC’s Complaint.  [SEC v. Richard Verdiramo, Vincent L. Verdiramo, Edward Meyer, Jr., and Victoria Chen, Civil Action No. 10-CIV-1888 (S.D.N.Y.)] (LR-22697) 
Delinquent Filer’s Stock Registration Revoked
The registration of the registered securities of UC Hub Group, Inc., has been revoked.  It had repeatedly failed to file required annual and quarterly reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Thus, it violated a crucial provision of the federal securities laws that requires public corporations to publicly disclose current, accurate financial information so that investors may make informed decisions.  The revocation was ordered in an administrative proceeding before an administrative law judge.  (Rel. 34-69526; File No. 3-15290)

1 Morningstar, as of 12/31/2016. Post-tax comparison between the 1, 3 and 5 year returns at NAV of the iShares Core ETFs and the oldest share class of active open-end mutual funds within the same Morningstar categories as the iShares Core ETFs. Mutual funds are generally more tax inefficient than ETFs and, as a result, are typically more negatively impacted than ETFs when comparing performance based on post-tax returns rather than total returns. The number of ETFs and mutual funds used for each period varies based on the inception date of the iShares Core ETFs. iShares Core ETFs included in this comparison vary based on the time period analyzed: 1 year (19 Core ETFs existed for the full 1-year period ended 1/31/15); 3 year (15 Core ETFs existed for the full 3-year period ended 1/31/13); and 5 year (9 Core ETFs existed for the full 5-year period ended 1/31/11). iShares Core ETFs outperformed their active mutual fund peers by 77.5% (1955/2426), 84.6% (1804/2157) and 79.9% (1330/1515) over the 1, 3 and 5 year periods ended 12/31/16, respectively. Performance was averaged for Morningstar categories containing more than one iShares fund, and may be different for other time periods. Returns are calculated after taxes on distributions, including capital gains and dividends, assuming the highest federal tax rate for each type of distribution in effect at the time of the distribution. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Review the differences between iShares ETFs and mutual funds for more information.2 BlackRock, as of 3/31/17. Based on 815 ETFs and $1.42 trillion in assets under management globally.






 
Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses, which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.
Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.







Transactions in shares of ETFs will result in brokerage commissions and will generate tax consequences. All regulated investment companies are obliged to distribute portfolio gains to shareholders.






Investment comparisons are for illustrative purposes only. To better understand the similarities and differences between investments, including investment objectives, risks, fees and expenses, it is important to read the products' prospectuses.






The Funds are distributed by BlackRock Investments, LLC (together with its affiliates, “BlackRock”).

			Objective & Strategy
		

			
				The fund seeks long-term growth of capital and, secondarily, current income by employing a total return approach, emphasizing capital appreciation, current income and principal preservation. The fund may act as a foundation for investors' portfolios.

			
			
				
			
		



Dividend growers
A high-conviction, actively managed strategy that focuses on dividend-growing companies and seeks to deliver attractive total returns — combining appreciation, income and preservation — over a full market cycle.

Experience our high-conviction approach


Appreciation


A history of adding value
			The fund had a cumulative return of 272% since manager inception versus 257% for the Russell 1000 Value Index.1




Income


A focus on sustainable and growing dividends
			The fund's annualized dividend growth rate was 12.48% since manager inception versus 7.65% for the S&P 500 Index and 5.76% for the Russell 1000 Value Index.2 Please note the dividend growth rate is not a yield or a measure of fund performance but is based on the annualized growth rate of the fund's actual dividend payments. 
		



Preservation


A solid foundation for your equity portfolio
			The fund's Class A shares at NAV outperformed its benchmark, the Russell 1000 Value Index, by 9.95% in the last major bear market.3

Morningstar details

Source: Morningstar Inc. Ratings are based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are considered a single population for comparison purposes. Ratings are calculated for funds with at least a three year history. The overall rating is derived from a weighted average of three-, five- and 10-year rating metrics, as applicable, excluding sales charges and including fees and expenses. ©2017 Morningstar Inc. All rights reserved. The information contained herein is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers. It may not be copied or distributed and is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The top 10% of funds in a category receive five stars, the next 22.5% four stars, the next 35% three stars, the next 22.5% two stars and the bottom 10% one star. Ratings are subject to change monthly. Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed currently or in the past, the Morningstar rating would have been lower. Ratings for other share classes may differ due to different performance characteristics.

Invesco Diversified Dividend Fund Investor Guide
Investable Ideas: Dividend value investing








 About risk
			 


Foreign Securities Risk. The Fund's foreign investments may be adversely affected by political and social instability, changes in economic or taxation policies, difficulty in enforcing obligations, decreased liquidity or increased volatility. Foreign investments also involve the risk of the possible seizure, nationalization or expropriation of the issuer or foreign deposits (in which the Fund could lose its entire investments in a certain market) and the possible adoption of foreign governmental restrictions such as exchange controls. Unless the Fund has hedged its foreign securities risk, foreign securities risk also involves the risk of negative foreign currency rate fluctuations, which may cause the value of securities denominated in such foreign currency (or other instruments through which the Fund has exposure to foreign currencies) to decline in value. Currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time. Currency hedging strategies, if used, are not always successful.
Management Risk. The Fund is actively managed and depends heavily on the Adviser's judgment about markets, interest rates or the attractiveness, relative values, liquidity, or potential appreciation of particular investments made for the Fund's portfolio. The Fund could experience losses if these judgments prove to be incorrect. Additionally, legislative, regulatory, or tax developments may adversely affect management of the Fund and, therefore, the ability of the Fund to achieve its investment objective.
Market Risk. The market values of the Fund's investments, and therefore the value of the Fund's shares, will go up and down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Market risk may affect a single issuer, industry or section of the economy, or it may affect the market as a whole. Individual stock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those of certain other types of investments, such as bonds. During a general downturn in the financial markets, multiple asset classes may decline in value. When markets perform well, there can be no assurance that specific investments held by the Fund will rise in value.
Value Investing Style Risk. A value investing style subjects the Fund to the risk that the valuations never improve or that the returns on value equity securities are less than returns on other styles of investing or the overall stock market.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
