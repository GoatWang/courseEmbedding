Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60)

      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.

                          Stock prices used are the "total returns" stock price and will include

Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

Academy Bank


                                            They cancelled my secured credit card without informing me.  Did not refund the money from secured card without me calling,. Guess they thought I might forget.  Will be closing all accounts with them today.  Worst customer service of any bank I've dealt with

Alfa Insurance


                                            I have (had) been with Alfa for 23 years. Over the course of the last few years, my premiums kept going up. $20 here, $30 there - well, this last time it went up over $200 with the new renewal. I have a perfect driving record- no tickets, no wrecks- and yet my insurance jumps up...show more

                                            I've had a NetSpend prepaid debit card for approximately 3 years. Up until recently I've had no problem.

PenFed Credit Union


                                            HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! They do not work with you at all to satisfy the customer. Other credit unions help you ESPECIALLY if you have great credit. This CU doesn't tell you everything so verify everything with two other reps. Total Nightmare!

SEFCU


                                            After getting fed-up with SEFCU’s “nickel-and-dime” fee structure and lack of branches/ATMs in my area, I decided to close my account in April 2017. Fast forward to July 25, 2017 when I receive a collection notice for fees due ($175). Access to my online...show more

                                            The online banking portal provides inaccurate information and the customer service people really don't care. They just tell you to review your statement, which if you have opted out of statements means you have to log on, find the statements, look at them and then try to...show more

PenFed Credit Union


                                            Applied for a credit card and was denied based on what they said was a loss from a personal loan in 1978. I have never had an account with PenFed, so I questioned the accuracy of this denial. Considering, as a business owner, my scores are well north of 700, I thought this...show more

In The News











Centaur Mutual Funds is dedicated to offering differentiated, value-oriented investing strategies designed to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns.
-Zeke Ashton, Portfolio Manager






About Centaur Total Return Fund
The Centaur Total Return Fund was originally launched in March 2005 as the Tilson Dividend Fund.  In October 2013, following the assignment of the investment advisory contract to Centaur Capital Partners, the fund was renamed the Centaur Total Return Fund.
The Centaur Total Return Fund has been managed since its inception by Centaur Capital Partners, led by portfolio manager Zeke Ashton.

Strategy Description
The Centaur Total Return Fund seeks to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns through a combination of capital appreciation and current income.
Mr. Ashton invests in equity securities that he believes are undervalued in the securities markets, but which also offer high dividend yields relative to the yield of the broad market averages such as the S&P 500 Total Return Index.
In addition to investing in stocks that offer high dividend yields, Mr. Ashton expects to generate income from selling covered call options on existing securities. ( Definition of covered call ) The use of covered call options, in combination with the purchase of equity securities, allows for the inclusion of undervalued, non-paying dividend stocks in the fund’s portfolio while still satisfying the fund’s goal of generating investment income. Securities so purchased will be selected based upon the attractiveness and security of the underlying stock as well as the income potential of the covered call options. The fund may also invest in non-dividend paying stocks without selling covered call options if the portfolio manager believes the stocks can produce significant appreciation.
To select equities for the Centaur Total Return Fund, the manager seeks to identify companies he understands well and that possess one or more of the following characteristics:

Positive (or projected positive) revenue or profit trends;
Healthy balance sheet, characterized by ample cash relative to debt, efficient working capital management,
                        high or increasing liquidity, or other metrics that the Advisor believes indicate the company’s ability to withstand unexpected shocks, reinvest in the business, and improve its business prospects and circumstances;
Strong free cash flow generation;
Powerful and sustainable competitive advantages;
Management team that: (i) operates the business well and has a sound strategy to build it over time; (ii)
                        allocates capital wisely to enhance shareholder value; and (iii) has high integrity; or
 Policies (e.g., compensation structures) that do not significantly dilute shareholders’ ownership.

The Centaur Total Return Fund typically invests in common stocks and other equity securities but may allocate its capital to bonds, short-term money market instruments, or other investment securities. Please review the prospectus for further details.
