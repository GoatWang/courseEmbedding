      ■ William P. Foley II was considered one of the most successful
      entrepreneurs and businessmen in the real estate services and specialty
      finance industries. In 1984, while running his own law firm, Foley
      organized a group of investors and led a leverage buyout of a small title
      insurance company in Phoenix, Arizona. Twenty years and more than 80
      acquisitions later, that local firm (then called Fidelity National Title
      Insurance Company) became the largest title insurer in the country. Foley
      was credited with recognizing early on the growth opportunities in the
      title insurance industry. Through dozens of shrewd and complicated
      acquisitions and effective operational management, he led Fidelity to the
      top position in the title insurance industry in 2000, following its
      acquisition of Chicago Title Corporation. By 2003 Fidelity controlled 30
      percent of the title insurance market, with annual revenues of $7.7
      billion. Foley ascribed his success to one core principle: staying focused
      on the customer. In a November 1992 article in 
      
        California Business
      
      , he said, "It takes years to get the business, one deal at a time.
      But once you get it, you have customers for life, as long as you treat
      them properly." Foley was also one who never stood still, always
      looking forward to his next move. "We're always looking over
      our shoulder," he said in the 
      
        Santa Barbara News-Press
      
       in August 2002. "So when things are good, that's the time
      to prepare."
    

      THE DEAL MAKER
    

      Foley was interested in business early on. While attending the U.S.
      Military Academy in the 1960s, he preferred managing his stock portfolio
      to completing his studies, by his own admission. He fulfilled his military
      commitment by overseeing defense contracts at Boeing Company in Seattle as
      an air force officer. After his discharge, he earned a degree in business
      from Seattle University and then a law degree from the University of
      Washington.
    

      After receiving his law degree, Foley joined the Phoenix firm of Streich,
      Lang, Weeks, Cardon & French in 1974 and, two years later,
      established Foley, Clark & Nye, where he stayed until 1984. It was
      during this period—while handling the legal work for a local
      savings and loan (S&L) company—that Foley first came in
      contact with Fidelity National Title Insurance Company, a small title
      insurer in Phoenix. Though it was a rather unglamorous and arcane
      business, title insurance was critical to companies, lenders, and home
      owners. The policies issued by title insurers shielded real estate title
      holders from losses that occurred from claims filed against a property.
      Foley helped the S&L company acquire Fidelity in 1980 and then
      watched as its revenues grew from $6 million to $40 million during the
      next three years. Foley saw the potential for greater growth at Fidelity,
      so he formed an investor group to purchase the company in 1984. The gamble
      paid off handsomely for Foley, who left his law practice to become
      chairman, chief executive officer, and president of the business that same
      year. The company went public in 1987 and began a series of acquisitions
      over the next 13 years that catapulted it to the top position in the title
      insurance industry.
    

      Fidelity's consistent growth was attributed to Foley and his
      management team's aggressive acquisition of regional and,
      ultimately, national title insurance firms across the country. Focusing
       on residential real estate and businesses in core states like California,
      Texas, and Florida, Fidelity grew rapidly during the late 1980s and early
      1990s. "Every year, our revenue would go up by 50 percent, 100
      percent," said Foley in the 
      
        Florida Times Union
      
       (September 1, 2003). While Foley executed dozens of acquisitions after
      Fidelity became a public company, three deals stand apart as key
      contributors to the company's growth.
    

      The first was the 1987 acquisition of Western Title Insurance Company,
      which gave the Arizona-based Fidelity a major presence in California.
      Almost overnight, according to Foley, "we had a 25-county operation
      in California" (
      
        Florida Times Union
      
      , September 1, 2003). The acquisition prompted the company to move its
      headquarters from Scottsdale, Arizona, to Irvine, California, that same
      year.
    

      The second event was the acquisition of Meridian Title Insurance Company
      in 1992. At the time of the deal, Meridian had operations in 15 states and
      about $140 million in annual revenue. The Meridian acquisition gave
      Fidelity "a national presence," according to Foley (
      
        Florida Times Union
      
      , September 1, 2003), and it propelled it to the number-seven position in
      the title insurance industry.
    

      The third major event was the boldest one of all: the 2000 acquisition of
      the second-largest title insurer in the country, Chicago Title
      Corporation. With the purchase of Chicago Title, Fidelity went from being
      the fourth-largest to the largest title insurance company in the United
      States.
    

      KEY BUSINESS AND LEADERSHIP STRATEGIES
    

      A number of important business strategies and leadership skills have
      guided Foley's management of Fidelity from the beginning. In 
      
        California Business
      
      , the reporter Philip Capelle described the way Foley and his early
      partner, Frank P. Willey, transformed Fidelity after their leveraged
      buyout of the company, "Foley and Willey decided to curb the
      company's dependence on independent agents and to emphasize direct
      selling through [its] employees. This approach gave Fidelity control over
      costs" and the ability "to avoid the kinds of losses
      incurred by competitors" (November 1992).
    

      Foley and Willey also steered Fidelity's business toward the more
      stable residential sector, as opposed to commercial real estate. The move
      proved prescient by anticipating the U.S. real estate boom of the 1990s.
      Foley was also a disciple of the management guru Tom Peters, and like
      Peters, he instilled a core value of superior customer service throughout
      Fidelity's subsidiaries. Toward that end, Foley sought out talented
      executives to run his operations, and he credited his ability to delegate
      as a key ingredient to his company's success.
    

      "I'm a very good delegator, so that's one of the
      reasons the company has grown like it has," he explained to the 
      
        Santa Barbara News-Press
      
       (August 12, 2002). He tried to "delegate to strong
      managers." Indeed, Foley has been criticized for axing executives
      at companies he acquired and replacing them with his own people.
      "If people are the problem, we get rid of them. If there are
      structural problems … we fix them," he said to the 
      
        Orange County Business Journal
      
       (January 5, 1998).
    

      Another core competency of Foley and his executive team was the ability to
      find good acquisition candidates. In Cathy Taylor's article in the 
      
        Orange County Register
      
      , Foley described his approach to selecting these companies, stating that
      his first criterion "is to find companies that have been
      mismanaged" (October 29, 1995). According to Foley, he typically
      looked for the characteristics that led to his purchase of Fidelity in
      1984: ineffective managers who miss growth opportunities and ignore their
      customers' changing needs. He then researched the company's
      financial records and tried to identify the reasons why it was not
      increasing its revenue or adding to market share.
    

      Afterward, Foley created a "to do" list to fix the company
      and then negotiated hard for the acquisition. "I tell them,
      'Here are the things you have to fix; that's why you have to
      lower the [asking] price.'" Foley negotiated for a final
      price below net asset value, meaning total assets minus debt, goodwill,
      patents, and other intangibles. Foley and his team were also patient when
      negotiating an acquisition, spending two or three years to close a deal.
      "We will keep changing and tuning [the offer], from a tax
      standpoint, from a GAAP (accounting) reporting standpoint," he
      added (
      
        Orange County Register
      
      , October 29, 1995).
    

      PROBLEMS ALONG THE WAY
    

      Not all deals worked out as well as Foley envisioned. In the mid-1990s, as
      it attempted to diversify into other businesses, Fidelity failed to close
      several deals, including a couple of hostile takeovers. Foley reported to
      the 
      
        Florida Times Union
      
       that acquisitions were "difficult for us because we were just a
      small company. We were very aggressive…. The reality was we were
      never very successful at [hostile takeovers]. We irritated a lot of people
      and we wasted a lot of time. So we stopped it." Foley added,
      "[Executing hostile takeovers] wasn't my style"
      (September 1, 2003). Foley also admitted that his ambitious deal making
      could get out of control. "I'm my own worst enemy; I keep
      finding transactions to do" (
      
        Forbes
      
      , September 23, 1996).
    

      The Fidelity holding company also had interests in the restaurant
      industry, with its CKE Restaurants subsidiary (of which Foley served as
      chairman of the board and CEO). CKE operated a number of regional
      restaurant chains, including Hardee's, Carl's Jr./Green
      Burrito, Rally's, Checkers Drive-Ins, Home Town Buffets, Galaxy
      Diners, and Taco Bueno. In 1999 it was the fourth-largest seller of
      hamburgers in the United States, after McDonald's, Burger King, and
      Wendy's.
    

      Though Foley helped turn CKE around after he took it over in 1993, the
      company began losing money in the early 2000s. In the fiscal year ending
      January 2003, it lost $150 million. The 1997 acquisition of the
      Hardee's chain of 2,400 restaurants turned out to be more
      problematic and costly than Foley had anticipated. The deal appeared cheap
      at the purchase price of $327 million, but it turned out that more than
      five hundred of the units, which were franchised to a company named
      Advantica Corporation, were prepared to break away from the acquisition.
      CKE was forced to invest another $420 million to buy out Advantica and
      keep the units—located mostly in the Southeast—on board. The
      extra costs doubled CKE's debt, which the company struggled to
      manage.
    

      FUTURE DIVERSIFICATION
    

      Though Fidelity never lost money in its 20-year history under Foley, it
      aggressively diversified its services beginning in the 2000s to withstand
      the cyclical downturns in the real estate market. "Our downside is
      that we're subject to the real estate cycle," Foley reported
      to the 
      
        Santa Barbara News-Press
      
       (August 12, 2002). "We're attempting to diversify to get
      into more consistent revenue streams that will produce a recurring income
      stream and after-tax profit performance for our organization."
    

      To this end, Fidelity expanded into other forms of real estate services,
      such as flood insurance, mortgage insurance, property and casualty
      insurance, appraisal services, and the home warranty business. It also
      made a number of acquisitions of real estate and finance technology
      companies, such as Alltel Information Services, Sanchez Computer
      Associates, Web-Tone Technologies, and Aurum Technologies. These
      acquisitions positioned Fidelity as a technology-solution business in the
      real estate and financial services industries, not just an insurer. Such a
      "plan-ahead-for-survival" strategy fit with Foley's
      temperament as a person. "In the spring and summer, prepare for the
      fall and winter. That's what we're all about" (
      
        Santa Barbara News-Press
      
      , August 12, 2002).

William P. "Bill" Foley II (born December 14, 1944) is an American businessman and former attorney, specializing in financial services. He serves as Chairman of the Board for Fidelity National Financial and Black Knight Financial Services, and Vice Chairman of the board for Fidelity National Information Services Inc. (FIS).[1] Foley is also the lead investor in Black Knight Sports & Entertainment, a consortium that was awarded an expansion ice hockey franchise named the Vegas Golden Knights for Las Vegas, Nevada that will begin play in the National Hockey League in 2017.
Growing up, Foley mostly lived in Texas with his family and extended family who were ranchers. For a time, he lived in Ottawa, Ontario, when his father was posted in the United States Air Force there. Foley played shinny, an informal type of ice hockey and started a lifelong appreciation for the sport.[2]
Foley graduated from West Point in 1967. While still at West Point he made $40,000 on the stock market which he played in his spare time. Foley later transferred to the Air Force, where as an officer he negotiated million-dollar defense contracts with Boeing. After leaving the Air Force, Foley moved into corporate law upon earning his J.D. from the University of Washington in 1974. Later he bought and revitalized the then struggling title insurance firm Fidelity National Financial. He later invested in wineries, golf courses, hotels, ski resorts, steak houses, fast-food joints and auto parts manufacturers.[3]

William Foley - the billionaire in our vines | Stuff.co.nz
















LoginWilliam Foley - the billionaire in our vinesJOHN SAKER21:07, Dec 13 2011FacebookTwitterWhats AppEmailCRAIG SIMCOX/Fairfax NZEYES OPEN: Bill Foley sees many more investment opportunities.The new laird of Wharekauhau  wails. "I wish I had more depth!"American billionaire William P  Foley II (Bill to pretty much  everybody) has been fielding those  annoying little questions that writers of  profiles (this one, anyway) like to ask.What do you enjoy reading? "Military  history - I've just finished The 900 Days  about the siege of Leningrad."Favourite  music? "Country and western, especially  female singers like Patty Loveless and  Gretchen Wilson."It's the last reply that brought on the  depth wish. "Country and western! Why  not Beethoven's 6th or something?"He's joking, or is he? After talking to  Foley for a couple of hours, I'm left feeling  he's quite comfortable with who he is.  Also that he's utterly unpretentious  (Exhibit A: the white T-shirt under the old  V-neck with a few stains on the sleeve)  and speaks his mind. At one stage, he  says: "I'd love to be a writer. I've got a  book I've been fooling with forever."AdvertisementI do think he harbours some small  regret that all those years of sitting at  America's corporate poker table left parts  of him unexercised. If so, that awareness  itself reflects a degree of depth. What's more, Foley is now cashing in his very  large of stack of chips. No, he's not about  to enrol in a Beethoven appreciation  course; he's found himself another  gaming table - a far more convivial one,  though not without its own tough odds.Wine is what Foley is increasingly  about these days. He's collecting  wineries, with collateral dabblings such  as his purchase last year (with two other  parties) of Wharekauhau, the South  Wairarapa luxury lodge. It was reported  at the time to be worth more than $24  million.The club of wealthy Americans who  have invested in the New Zealand wine  industry is small and discreet. It includes  Las Vegas casino magnate Glenn  Schaeffer, who is behind Nelson's Woollaston Estate, and Wall Street tycoon  Julian Robertson, who owns Wairarapa's  iconic Dry River winery and Hawke's Bay  labels Te Awa and Kidnapper Cliffs.Foley gained membership only  recently. His first acquisition was the New  Zealand Wine Fund in 2009. Previously a  private investment vehicle for wealthy  individuals, the entity houses a cluster of Marlborough brands including Vavasour, Dashwood, Redwood Pass, Boatshed Bay, Goldwater and Clifford Bay.  For good measure, Foley also bought a 50  per cent stake in the seasoned New  Zealand wine distribution company  EuroVintage.This year, he added to the portfolio  pioneering Martinborough winery Te  Kairanga, and now runs all his New  Zealand operations from the Te Kairanga  office. And he's not finished yet."There'll be some more opportunities.  I'm looking for appellations or locations.  Martinborough is perfect - it has a great  history for pinot noir. So that's covered. I  would go to Central Otago, but I'm all  about not stressing out trying to get  somewhere. In Marlborough I would  keep on going. I'd buy more vineyards -  if there was a good brand available I'd  buy that and really try and build up my  production base, get the company doing  three-quarters of a million cases in New  Zealand so we've got some size and  mass. And maybe add some more  distribution horsepower. So that's sort of  my idea for New Zealand."At this time of pain and price cutting in  the New Zealand wine industry, that  manifesto seems barely credible. Here is  someone who wants to invest where  others have been losing their shirts,  where scared banks are calling the shots  on highly leveraged operations, where  half of Marlborough, New Zealand wine's  beating heart, seems up for sale.That's the way Foley likes it.He first came to this country in 2001,  intrigued by the quality of the New  Zealand wine he had tasted in California.  He started the trip in Central Otago and  took in several wine regions. In the  Wairarapa he found much to admire,  though not the journey over the Rimutaka  Hill ("I much prefer to come in by  chopper"). Smitten by the Ata Rangi pinot  noir - which remains his Desert Island  New Zealand Pinot - Martinborough's  aptitude for the grape excited him. Foley's  goal now is for Te Kairanga to produce a  pinot the equal of (or better still, superior  to) Ata Rangi.On that tour he stayed at Wharekauhau for the first time, loved it, and idly  thought what fun it would be to own the  lodge with its accompanying sheep  station. He also talked to several wineries  about investment possibilties. His chequebook, however, never left his pocket. He  already had a wine foothold in California,  and was interested in establishing an  annex in New Zealand but Bill Foley was  in no hurry.That changed after 2008. That year's  monster vintage burdened New Zealand  wine with a massive oversupply, while  the global financial crisis added "complex  notes" of its own. Once proud brands  were relegated to discount bins. The rush  to get in had become a rush to get out.  The stage was set for Foley to go bargain  hunting. "Some people say I'm cheap. I'm  always trying to find a value purchase  and get some assets. It's a good time to  buy."Foley's own introduction to wine came  in the mid-1980s, relatively late in life.  A friend suggested they have a white  Burgundy and Foley, a wine ignoramus  whose glass usually contained scotch or vodka, found his interest piqued. He  began tasting, talking and learning. "I  knew nothing, it was news to me that  white Burgundy was made from chardonnay and red Burgundy from pinot  noir." A visit to Burgundy followed and his  interest spread to Californian (and  eventually, New Zealand) versions of  those grape varieties.Besides his enjoyment of wine and a  conviction that done properly it can make  good business sense, there are other  reasons for Foley's late midlife (he's 67)  sideways plunge into vats and vineyards.He was, he says, ready to move on  from the businesses that had elevated  him to the super-rich category.Fidelity National Financial Inc (FNF) is  a provider of title insurance, a form of  insurance commonplace in America that  covers you in case something dodgy  emerges in regard to the title of a property  you own. It was a small acorn when  Foley, who was practising law at the time,  bought into it in 1984. Under Foley's  leadership (he was CEO between 1984  and 2007) it burgeoned, as the noted "deal  addict" made one canny acquisition after  the other. It is now No 398 on the Fortune  500, a list of America's largest companies.For Foley's part, in 2004 he was placed  fourth on Forbes magazine's list of CEO  compensation, earning a total of  US$179.56m (NZ$240m) that year. He  remains chairman of FNF.Over the years his interests spread into  other spheres. Generally, they have been  businesses that have weathered the  recent global financial tempest well."In the mid-90s, when I was learning  about wines, I said: 'I'm going to retire -  the title business is kind of boring, the  market's no good, and I've got to get my  kids out of school in Orange County' . . .  They were public schools and my kids  weren't learning anything. So we moved  to Santa Barbara. That's where I got into  the wine business."The step from consumer to producer  came in 1997, when what was to evolve  into Foley Family Wines was formed and  acquired a winery in the Santa Ynez  Valley in Santa Barbara County.As he gained experience in producing  and selling wine, he was beating an  orderly retreat from other businesses.The big wine push began in 2007,  when further purchases came in rapid  succession. Most of them have been  made in California's glamour regions,  Napa Valley and Sonoma, and include  cult brands such as Chalk Hill and Merus.  By production volume, he now ranks  among the top 30 wine producers in the  US. In January, Foley was named Man of  the Year for 2010 by the American  magazine Wine Enthusiast."I love land," Foley cries, gesturing to  the open vista before Wharekauhau,  beyond which the waters of Palliser Bay  look typically restless. It's a happy cry, a  cry of liberation even. "I grew up on a  cattle ranch in west Texas. I love wide  open spaces . . . I love going in to the vineyards with our viticulturists and winemakers, looking at the grapes . . . It's a  high for me. I get immediate gratification."The high of doing a successful business deal spikes up and then once you're  done you have to find the next one. In the  wine business, every day there's something to be done. It's a process. And of  course, I get to be a deal guy too."Family is also a significant factor in the wine equation. Foley and his wife, Carol, met in the late 1960s when she was a United Airlines flight attendant. They were married 42 years ago near her hometown in the state of Washington. They had four children (two boys, two girls) in rapid succession.They are a tight family, and wine is bringing them closer. One son, Rob, runs the tasting room at Chalk Hill, and Foley is confident daughter Courtney and the youngest, Patrick (aka William P Foley III), will take up roles with Foley Family Wines."Courtney has been on the sales side at Young's Market (a West Coast wine and spirit distributor). I want to figure out a path for her. I'm lobbying Patrick to get that graduate diploma in oenology at Lincoln, then work harvests in New Zealand. Trouble is, he's got to learn how not to drink all the product."My kids are all workers. None feel entitled, but I want to make sure the people around them don't think they're entitled. They have to work their way up and learn the way everybody else does."A ring on Bill Foley's right hand gives a strong clue to the inner man. It's his class of 1967 graduation ring from the storied army academy, West Point.Foley was a reluctant cadet. He was in "goof-off" mode as the clock ran down on his senior year in high school and his father suggested he apply for a place in a military academy. Partly to irk his dad, a career air force man, Foley replied: "I would only go to West Point  that's where tough guys go." He secretly hoped, and expected, he would never get in, but an astonishing run of bad luck for those ahead of him on the waiting list saw him enter the gates of West Point as a "plebe" (freshman) in 1963."The dream of most of the class was to be there. I wasn't even interested. Once there, I hated it. All I wanted to do was get out, but it was easier to stay than quit. So I was in a group whose attitude was 'I'm here, but I'm going to do everything I can to rebel and not do what they want me to do'."One compensation was military history, a subject at which Foley excelled. A semester spent studying Napoleon absorbed him. Later, he would name one of his companies Cannae, after the clever, strangling victory achieved by Hannibal over Rome in the Second Punic War.After West Point, he was spared the horrors of Vietnam after failing a physical ("I couldn't fly because my eyes weren't good enough"). Thirty of his 582 classmates lost their lives in the conflict; the others remain a close group. "I have great friends. I can call any classmate anywhere and ask for something and they'll do it and I'd do the same for them. It's a four-year bond that's hard to describe. And my class was a very successful class."West Point honed me. It got me thinking the right way - how to lead guys into combat and make instant decisions. I can prioritise, I can multitask. I do a good job of identifying a problem and seeing things in three dimensions."It also taught me how to delegate. In my businesses, I delegate people not only responsibility but also authority. Then people have to perform. If they perform, they survive, they achieve and they're rewarded. So I'm all about team-building and letting people be masters of their own destiny. West Point taught me all that  but at the time I hated it."Foley donates regularly and generously to West Point. He has done similarly to the Republican Party over the recent past, though doesn't feel so inclined at present. "Right now, I really don't support much of anybody in politics. I'm disgusted with all of them."I tell him Robertson and Schaeffer, his compatriots and confreres in New Zealand wine investment, have given generously to the arts in New Zealand. Does he feel a similar philanthropic urge coming on?"Give me a while. I would probably do something related to business, maybe help with the business school at one of the universities. I hate to say that because I know what's going to happen now  'Bill, we just read about you and we have a naming opportunity'."For Bill Foley, you get the feeling the opportunities are just going to keep on coming.The Dominion PostFacebookTwitterWhats AppEmail

 About Us 

About Foley Estates

Rancho Santa Rosa

Sta. Rita Hills

Rancho Las Hermanas

Winemaker

Vintner



William P. Foley II, Vintner
Vintner, William P. (Bill) Foley II, established the Foley Wine Group in 1996, with the acquisition of Lincourt Vineyards in the Santa Ynez Valley appellation of Santa Barbara County. Taking its name from Bill and Carol’s two daughters, Lindsay and Courtney, Lincourt Vineyards quickly established itself as a viable, dynamic brand.
From there, Bill founded Foley Estates Vineyard and Winery, a premiere Pinot Noir and Chardonnay house located in the Sta. Rita Hills appellation of Santa Barbara County. Highly regarded by leading wine critics and sommeliers, this Burgundian-influenced portfolio has become a flagship property in the South Central Coast.
The acquisition of Las Hermanas Vineyard, formerly known as the iconic Ashley’s Vineyard, followed thereafter. Also located in the Sta. Rita Hills appellation, this esteemed vineyard has provided fruit not only to the Lincourt Vineyards program, but also to critically successful wineries such as Brewer-Clifton, Samsara and Tantara.
Merus, in the Napa Valley, is Bill’s nod to his love of benchmark California Cabernet Sauvignons of merit and elegance. Considered by many to be one of the most coveted “cult Cabernets” in the United States, Merus has added breadth and depth to the FWG portfolio.
Foley Family Wines also includes Firestone Vineyard, which Bill acquired in 2007. Long considered a destination for visitors to Santa Barbara County’s wine country, Firestone produces an array of Bordeaux-influenced wines in competitively-priced categories.
By adding Three Rivers Winery to Foley Family Wines, Bill has now expanded his thoughtfully composed wine portfolio into the Pacific Northwest. Located in Walla Walla, Washington, Three Rivers Winery is recognized for producing Rieslings and Bordeaux-influenced wines.
In addition to the Santa Barbara area properties, Bill purchased Sebastiani Vineyards & Winery in Sonoma in December 2008. Under the guidance of Bill, Sebastiani Vineyards advances its record of acclaim and maintains its commitment to producing singular wines from the appellations of Sonoma County.
During the spring of 2009, Bill once again expanded his holdings with the majority purchase of Kuleto Estate, located in the eastern mountains of the Napa Valley. By partnering with Pat Kuleto, a famed restaurateur, Bill strives to produce truly singular estate wines from Napa Valley.
In addition to being a passionate, adventurous vintner, Bill Foley is Chairman of the Board of Directors for Fidelity National Inc. (NYSE: FNF), number 435 on the Fortune 500 roster, and a leading provider of title insurance, specialty insurance and claims management services. FNF’s three primary operating segments include Fidelity National Title Group, one of the nation’s largest and most respected title insurance companies; Fidelity National Property and Casualty Insurance Group, a nationwide provider of specialty insurance products; and Sedgwick CMS, the leading North American provider of innovative claims and productivity management solutions.
Bill also serves as Executive Chairman of Fidelity National Information Services (NYSE: FIS), number 481 on the Fortune 500 list, part of the S&P 500, and a global provider of core processing for financial institutions; card issuer and transaction processing services; mortgage loan processing, as well as mortgage-related information products and outsourcing services.
Under Bill’s leadership, FNF was selected in 2004 by Forbes as one of the 26 Best Managed Companies in the U.S. The company has repeatedly been named to Fortune’s list of America’s Most Admired Companies, Forbes’ list of America’s Best Big Companies and selected for Barron’s list of Best Companies for Investors.
An avid and accomplished golfer (Golf Digest’s Top 20 Executive Golfers in the World, 2006), Bill received his B.S. degree in Engineering from the United States Military Academy at West Point, Bill served in the U.S. Air Force, where he attained the rank of Captain. He received an M.B.A. degree from Seattle University and earned his J.D. degree in 1974 from The University of Washington School of Law.
By turns hard-nosed and soft-hearted, Bill is committed to achieving an enological and viticultural portfolio that resonates not only with wine professionals worldwide, but also with the average American consumer, who enjoys a memorable bottle of wine at the end of a long work day.
