						CA Inc. (NASDAQ:CA) Stock Rating Lowered by Zacks Investment Research

CA Inc. (NASDAQ:CA) was downgraded by Zacks Investment Research from a “buy” rating to a “hold” rating in a report released on Monday. 
According to Zacks, “CA is a leading information technology (IT) management software company. We are optimistic about CA’s acquisition strategy, which has enhanced its IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, we believe that the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by them will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model. Additionally, CA’s “go to market” sales strategy integrates the commercial functions of sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight, which helps it in lowering costs, thereby improving the bottom line. Nonetheless, intensifying competition from peers, an uncertain economic environment, currency headwinds and the weak IT spending forecast by Gartner are other concerns. Notably, shares of the company has underperformed the broader market over the last one year period.”
Several other equities analysts have also recently weighed in on CA. Citigroup Inc.  reissued a “neutral” rating and set a $34.00 price objective (up previously from $33.00) on shares of CA in a research report on Sunday, May 14th. DA Davidson  reissued a “neutral” rating and set a $12.00 price objective on shares of CA in a research report on Friday, May 19th. BidaskClub cut CA from a “hold” rating to a “sell” rating in a research report on Saturday, July 1st. Raymond James Financial, Inc.  reissued a “market perform” rating on shares of CA in a research report on Thursday, June 22nd. Finally, Sanford C. Bernstein  reissued an “underperform” rating and set a $28.00 price objective on shares of CA in a research report on Wednesday, June 28th. Four equities research analysts have rated the stock with a sell rating, eight have assigned  a hold rating and five have given a buy rating to the stock. CA currently has an average rating of “Hold” and an average price target of $35.10.




Shares of CA (NASDAQ CA) opened at 34.06 on Monday. The company’s 50 day moving average price is $33.34 and its 200 day moving average price is $32.43. The stock has a market capitalization of $14.23 billion, a P/E ratio of 18.41 and a beta of 0.87. CA has a one year low of $30.01 and a one year high of $36.54. 
CA (NASDAQ:CA) last released its quarterly earnings results on Thursday, May 11th. The technology company reported $0.54 earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter, topping the consensus estimate of $0.49 by $0.05. The company had revenue of $1.01 billion during the quarter, compared to the consensus estimate of $996.59 million. CA had a return on equity of 17.15% and a net margin of 19.20%. The firm’s revenue was up .3% on a year-over-year basis. During the same quarter in the prior year, the company posted $0.60 EPS.

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.
