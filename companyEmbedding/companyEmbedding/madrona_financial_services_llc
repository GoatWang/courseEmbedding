Madrona’s financial advisors concentrates on services such as investment management, tax strategies, retirement & legacy planning in Washington. This fiduciary capacity is not new to our CEO and Chief Investment Officer, Brian Evans, as he has met this standard since beginning his professional career as a CPA more than 30 years ago.

P.S. have grown to include over 30 support staff working together to help you invest in your future, simplify your life and prosper. This is The Madrona Way and this is why we exist.
The process behind the Madrona Way begins with our proprietary global asset allocation strategy, which actively evaluates securities based on anticipated profit per dollar invested. By analyzing and researching vast amounts of reports and data, including the consensus estimates of approximately 670 analysts, we create sophisticated and diversified portfolios that factor in debt, price-to-earnings ratios and expected growth of earnings, which we use to advise you how to best achieve your financial goals.

Have you satisfied your charitable intent with your current estate plan?

We encourage you to contact us for a complimentary estate plan review or to go over estate planning basics, but a good place to start making sure your family receives the maximum benefit from your estate is requesting your free copy of The Madrona Life & Legacy Planner. This is designed to assist you in developing lifetime goals, both personal and financial, and building your legacy so that your loved ones can navigate your estate with clarity once you are unable to do so.

Guaranteed Income
We have all had those days. Those mornings over the course of our careers when getting out of bed and going to work was the last thing we wanted to do, but you did. You worked hard for decades and you’ve finally done it. You reached the point where you’re ready to retire. That first Monday when you sleep in as late as you want…There are few moments as glorious.
This is the point where many retirees face one of the hardest aspects of being retired: switching gears (mentally) from amassing wealth to supporting yourself with it. This transition from accumulation to distribution sounds obvious, but you might be surprised by how strange it feels. You spent your entire adult life earning a paycheck and always adding to your retirement savings, your nest egg, “the pile.” Now the pile is as large as it is ever going to be and you need to be strategic about how you spend against it. Then you realize it: Your savings are finite now.
When this finally sinks in, unless you own the Seahawks like Paul Allen, you might feel butterflies. You may find yourself staring at the ceiling at night, thinking about the question that all retirees stress over. “Am I going to outlive my savings?” You’re supposed to be enjoying life to the fullest and catching more Zs, not losing sleep with this uncertainty hanging over you. It’s ironic because technically, at this point in time you are the richest you ever have been or will be again, yet instead of confidence, you might feel vulnerable if you do not know how long your nest egg will last.
Madrona has the solution, with retirement plan services to fit your situation. It is fast, painless and most importantly, could add years of income to your portfolio. As the President and CEO of one of Washington’s premier retirement planning firms, Brian Evans has years of experience helping retirees ensure they’ll never outlive their savings. It starts with a complimentary financial review where your advisor will get to know you and your story, ask about your goals and profile, explain some financial retirement planning realities and ultimately help you make some educated decisions by guiding you through factors that affect your financial planning for retirement.
Financial Retirement Realities




With modern medicine, you’re going to live a long time.Let’s be honest… You aren’t going to spend less in retirement.You can’t afford nearly as much risk as you used to be able to.But thanks to inflation, things will certainly get more expensive.You’re retired, which means no more paychecks every other week.You’ll live with the decisions you make today for the rest of your life.The Income Questions




What other sources of income do you have, like a pension or Social Security?Do you want to leave something for your family when you’re gone?How soon after retirement will you need to start receiving income?Are you expecting an inheritance at some point in the future?Are you done working, or are you only partially retiring?How much income will you need on an annual basis?Do you have savings tucked away anywhere else?When we have questions about our health, we wouldn’t hesitate to ask a professional doctor for advice. Sure, we could go it alone, but we might not be maximizing our longevity. That’s irrational when the alternative was as quick and simple as taking the time to ask the experts in their field for a checkup and a long-term plan. The same is true for your financial position. In order to make your money last as long as possible and achieve the goal of leaving behind a certain amount for your loved ones, you need a financial review and a long-term plan. Unfortunately, some retirees will be hesitant to visit their doctor when they should and as a result, are taking unnecessary risks. In terms of savings, if you want the best shot at being as successful as possible in retirement, you need to avoid that hesitation and seek professional financial advice. The only thing you have to lose is potential income, so do what hundreds of families already have. Reach out to Madrona Financial Services today and give yourself the gift of financial independence.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly









            Adhere to established standards of advertising and selling.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Make known all material facts in both written and verbal representations, remembering that misrepresentation may result not only from direct statements but by omitting or obscuring relevant facts.
                

                    2. Ensure that any written materials are readily available, clear, accurate and complete.
                







Be Transparent









            Openly identify the nature, location, and ownership of the business, and clearly disclose all policies, guarantees and procedures that bear on a customer's decision to buy.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards. This may include, but is not limited to business name, address and contact information; names and background of principles; business and banking references; licensing and/or professional accreditation; and a complete description of the nature of the business.
                

                    2. Clearly disclose to customers:

                    
1. direct and effective means to contact the business
2. terms of any written contract
3. any guarantees or warranties accompanying a product

                            4. any restrictions or limitations imposed (e.g. limited supply,maximum number available per customer)
                        
5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

How many clients do you currently manage?
400


Will you be the only person working with me?
We service clients in a team environment with each member of the team specializing in a specific role.



How are you compensated? How will I pay for your services?
We are primarily compensated based on a percentage of the assets under management that we advise. Secondarily, we utilize insurance products for specific planning instances that we receive a commission from the insurance company that does not come out of your investment funds.


If you are going to manage my account, will you obtain my permission every time you buy or sell something?
A large portion of the assets that we manage are discretionary meaning we will not necessarily contact you each time we buy or sell something in your account. However, we trade as you have advised us to do so and in accordance with your best interests.


Do you offer any guaranteed results?
No. From an ethical, legal and practical standpoint it is impossible to do so.



How much risk should I be willing to take?
We work with you to determine what amount of risk is proper for each client based on your goals, risk tolerance and time horizon. We then develop a plan that balances growth with protection to ensure our clients are not exposed to risk in excess of their expectations.


Have you ever been charged with any breaches?
No


What financial institution(s) do you represent?
We are an independent Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) which means it is our legal fiduciary duty to always act in the best interest of our clients. Therefore, we do not charge hidden fees,we are not paid based on up-front mutual fund commissions and we have the freedom to select the proper investment strategies for our clients.


How do you charge for your services?
The fees we charge are based on a percentage of assets under management and varies based on the size of the account. Generally speaking, this fee is 1% per year.


Do you provide a free initial consultation?
Yes. Additionally, we offer a free Retirement Analysis, Financial Plan and Social Security Maximization Report for qualified prospective clients.


What is your approach to 401 K plan rollovers?
401(k)'s comprise a significant portion of retirement savings today but they oftentimes lack investment options. Contributions are not properly allocated and allocations are typically not updated throughout the length of the plan. It may be advantageous to roll over 401(k)'s from past employers or from current employers (if you are 59 1/2 or older).

Part V: Professionals
You want a real expert with documented credentials helping you plan your financial future and invest your assets in the securities markets.


Real experts have valid, documented credentials that include degrees, experience, and high quality certifications.


Paladin Quality Rating: Paladin is the only SEC registered firm that vets and rates the quality of financial advisors and firms. A 5 Star rating means the advisor or firm scored in the 90th percentile or higher when Paladin rated the quality of their credentials, ethics, business practices, and services.


Experience: Years of experience is the best way for advisors to become real financial experts.


Education: Degrees should be from accredited institutions. Use the Internet to research schools you may not have heard of. Some advisors buy degrees to appear more knowledgeable than they really are.


Certifications: Also called designations, certifications are the best way for advisors to acquire specialized knowledge in shorter time periods. Some certifications are extremely valuable (CFA, CFP, CIMA, CPA). 35% of certifications are fake (Source: Paladin Research).


Associations: Membership in quality associations can also be a source of specialized knowledge if the organizations have continuing education requirements.


Firm Credentials: Some advisors represent firms that employ or license multiple professionals. Some of these professionals may impact your financial results.


Tip: Real experts have good educations, years of experience, and high quality certifications and designations.

Part VI: Firm Registration, Licensing, Compliance
You want a real financial expert. You also want an expert you can trust.


Registration: Only Registered Investment Advisors (firms) and Investment Advisor Representatives (professionals) can provide financial advice and ongoing services for fees.


Type of Registration: RIAs with less than $100 million of assets register with your state’s Securities Commissioner. RIAs with more than $100 million of assets register with the Securities and Exchange Commission.


Industry Licenses: These licenses permit advisors to sell investment and insurance products for commissions.


Registration & License Numbers: Use the advisor and firm’s registration and license numbers to check compliance records at: FINRA.org, SEC.gov, your State’s Securities Commissioner, and your State’s Insurance Commissioner.


State Licensing: Make sure the advisor is licensed to sell investment and insurance products in your state. Make sure the advisor is properly licensed before you buy.


Financial Fiduciary: RIAs and IARs are fiduciaries who are held to the highest ethical standards in the financial service industry. Salesmen are held to lower ethical standards that do not require them to put your financial interests first.


Compliance Record (Investment): Does an advisor or firm have disclosures on compliance records that are maintained by FINRA.org, SEC.gov, or your state’s Securities Commissioner?


Compliance Record (Insurance): Does an advisor or firm have disclosures on compliance records that are maintained by your state’s Insurance Commissioner?


Criminal Disclosures: It may be hard to believe, but convicted felons can obtain securities licenses if their crimes were not securities related.


Additional Disclosures: Advisors and firms have the option of providing additional disclosures that are published on their Paladin Research Reports.


ADVs: RIAs file ADVs with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents provide valuable information about advisory firms.


Links: Click on these links to view additional information about advisors and firms on third party websites.


Tip: Real advisors are RIAs and IARs. Salesmen are not RIAs or IARs. This should be one of your primary criteria when you selec
