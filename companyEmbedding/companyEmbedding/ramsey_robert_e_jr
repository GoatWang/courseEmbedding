                            THIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT ("Agreement") is made this 30th day of June, 1997, by and between ROBERT E. RAMSEY, JR. ("Executive") and RURAL/METRO CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("Rural/Metro"), effective June 30, 1997 ("Effective Date").                                    R E C I T A L S            A. Executive desires to be employed by Rural/Metro in the position as a senior executive.            B. Rural/Metro has decided to offer Executive an employment agreement, the terms and provisions of which are set forth below.            NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY MUTUALLY AGREED AS FOLLOWS:            1.       POSITION AND DUTIES.                     Executive will be employed as a senior executive of Rural/Metro and shall perform the duties of his position, as determined by the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of Rural/Metro, in accordance with the policies, practices and bylaws of Rural/Metro. Executive shall report directly to Robert T. Edwards and Warren S. Rustand, or their successors, and not to any regional president of Rural/Metro. Executive shall have direct management authority over all of Rural/Metro's ambulance and fire service operations in Arizona.                     Executive shall serve Rural/Metro faithfully, loyally, honestly and to the best of his ability. Executive will devote his best efforts to the performance of his duties for, and in the business and affairs of, Rural/Metro.    2                     Executive agrees that during the Term (as defined in paragraph 5), Executive shall serve as the President and Chief Executive Officer of SW General, Inc., Southwest Ambulance of Casa Grande, Inc., Medical Emergency Devices and Services (MEDS), Inc., and Southwest General Services, Inc., each of which are Arizona corporations (collectively referred to herein as the "Southwest Companies") or any successor corporation of such companies and as Vice-President of Rural/Metro, and Executive agrees to serve as a member of the Board of Directors of Rural/Metro.                     The Board of Directors of Rural/Metro reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to change or modify Executive's position, title and duties during the term of this Agreement.            2.       SALARY.                     During the first year of this Agreement, Executive's semimonthly salary will be based upon annual compensation of Two Hundred Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($200,000.00). Thereafter, the salary will be reviewed annually in accordance with Rural/Metro's compensation review policies and practices, all as determined by Rural/Metro, in its sole discretion; provided that Rural/Metro may not reduce the salary set forth above during the first three (3) years of the Term.            3.       MANAGEMENT INCENTIVE PROGRAM.                     Executive shall be eligible to participate in the Rural/Metro Management Incentive Program ("MIP") (or any other plan that is designated by the Board as replacing the MIP) and to receive such additional compensation as may be provided by the MIP from time to time.            4.       OTHER AGREEMENTS.                     Rural/Metro and Executive may enter into one or more agreements from time-to-time relating to specific programs (such as a stock option program). Nothing in this Agreement is intended to alter or modify said agreements, which are referred to below as "Ancillary Agreements."                                         -2-    3            5.       TERM AND TERMINATION.                     This Agreement will continue in full force and effect until it is terminated by the parties. This Agreement may be terminated in any of the following ways: (a) it may be renegotiated and replaced by a written agreement signed by both parties; (b) Rural/Metro may elect to terminate this Agreement with or without "Cause", as defined below; (c) Executive may elect to terminate this Agreement with or without "Good Reason," as defined below; or (d) either party may serve notice on the other of its desire to terminate this Agreement at the end of the Term, which notice shall be given to the other party at least forty-five (45) days before the end of the Term.                     The "Term" of this Agreement shall begin on the date hereof and shall expire by its terms on March 31, 2002, unless sooner terminated in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.            6.       TERMINATION BY RURAL/METRO.                     A. Termination For Cause. Rural/Metro may terminate this Agreement and Executive's employment for Cause at any time upon written notice. This means that Rural/Metro has the right to terminate the employment relationship for Cause at any time should there be Cause to do so.                     For purposes of this Agreement, "Cause" shall be limited to discharge resulting from a determination by Rural/Metro that Executive: (a) has been convicted of a felony involving dishonesty, fraud, theft or embezzlement; (b) has repeatedly failed or refused, after written notice from Rural/Metro, in a material respect to follow reasonable policies or directives established by Rural/Metro; (c) has willfully and persistently failed, after written notice from Rural/Metro, to attend to material duties or obligations imposed upon him under this Agreement; (d) has performed an act                                         -3-    4 or failed to act, which, if he were prosecuted and convicted, would constitute a felony involving $1,000 or more of money or property of Rural/Metro; or (e) has misrepresented or concealed a material fact for purposes of securing employment with Rural/Metro or this Employment Agreement.                     Because Executive is in a position which involves great responsibilities, Rural/Metro is not required to utilize its progressive discipline policy.                     If this Agreement and Executive's employment is terminated for Cause, Executive shall receive no Severance Benefits.                     B. Termination Without Cause. Rural/Metro also may terminate this Agreement and Executive's employment without Cause at any time by giving thirty (30) days written notice to Executive. In the event this Agreement and Executive's employment are terminated by Rural/Metro without Cause, Executive shall be entitled to receive Severance Benefits pursuant to paragraph 9.            7.       TERMINATION BY EXECUTIVE.                     Executive may terminate this Agreement and his employment with or without "Good Reason" in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph 7.                     A. Termination For Good Reason. Executive may terminate this Agreement and his employment for "Good Reason" by giving written notice to Rural/Metro within thirty (30) days, or such longer period as may be agreed to in writing by Rural/Metro, of Executive's receipt of notice of the occurrence of any event constituting "Good Reason," as described below.                     Executive shall have "Good Reason" to terminate this Agreement and his employment upon the occurrence of any of the following events: (a) Executive is demoted to a position of less stature or importance within Rural/Metro than the position described in paragraph 1, it being agreed                                         -4-    5 that "Good Reason" shall not exist hereunder by reason of Executive's failure to be elected to the Board of Directors of Rural/Metro as a result of the shareholders of Rural/Metro voting not to elect Executive to the Board of Directors of Rural/Metro (provided, however, that, unless circumstances constituting Cause exist, Rural/Metro shall have taken all action within its power and authority to nominate Executive for election to the Board of Directors); (b) Executive is required to relocate to an employment location that is more than fifty (50) miles from his employment location on the date of the execution of this Agreement; (c) Executive's annualized salary rate is reduced to a level that is at least twenty percent (20%) less than the salary paid to Executive during any prior calendar year, unless Executive has agreed to said reduction; (d) the potential incentive compensation (or bonus) to which Executive may become entitled under the MIP at any level of performance by the Executive or Rural/Metro is reduced by seventy-five percent (75%) or more as compared to the prior year; or (e) a sale by Rural/Metro of more than fifty percent (50%) of the capital stock of all of the Southwest Companies or their successors, to an entity not a subsidiary (direct or indirect) or an affiliate of Rural/Metro (except for a consolidation of some or all of the Southwest Companies, a change in the ownership of Rural/Metro or a sale of Rural/Metro's ambulance business in general).                     If Executive terminates this Agreement and his employment for Good Reason, Executive shall be entitled to receive Severance Benefits pursuant to paragraph 9.                     B. Termination Without Good Reason. Executive also may terminate this Agreement and his employment without Good Reason at any time by giving thirty (30) days notice to Rural/Metro. If Executive terminates this Agreement and his employment without Good Reason, Executive shall not be entitled to receive Severance Benefits pursuant to paragraph 9.                                         -5-    6            8.       DEATH OR DISABILITY.                     This Agreement will terminate automatically on Executive's death. Any salary or other amounts due to Executive for services rendered prior to his death shall be paid to Executive's surviving spouse, or if Executive does not leave a surviving spouse, to Executive's estate. No other benefits shall be payable to Executive's heirs pursuant to this Agreement, but amounts may be payable pursuant to any life insurance or other benefit plans maintained by Rural/Metro.                     In the event Executive becomes "Disabled," and as a result is unable to continue the proper performance of his duties hereunder, Executive's employment hereunder and Rural/Metro's obligation to pay Executive's salary shall continue for a period of three (3) months from the date of such Disability, at which point Executive's employment hereunder shall automatically cease and terminate. Executive shall be considered "Disabled" or to be suffering from a "Disability" for purposes of this paragraph 8 if, in the judgment of a licensed physician selected by the Board of Directors of Rural/Metro, Executive is unable to perform the essential functions of his position required under this Agreement, with or without reas
