If I Knew Then...


            In this ongoing series, we ask executives, entrepreneurs and business leaders about mistakes that
            have shaped their business philosophy.
          

            Elizabeth Brown          



                CEO, Viyet              






              By Dong Jin Oh

















 


            Background:  
          
Viyet is an online marketplace where users can buy or sell pre-owned designer furniture and accessories.

The Mistake: 
We have so many different types of inventory coming in that is being curated by many different curators out in the field. In Viyet's early stages, when we were scaling and had a greater volume of pieces coming in every month, we were lacking a system that would help us organize these and keep track of everything that was in the pipeline. This got to be a huge headache,  because we were tracking things on Google Docs and over email, and it was just turning into a giant mess. 
We had a very small tech team of only two developers on staff at the time, and we were thinking, “Oh my gosh, this is a great interim step! We’ll get this piece of software, we’ll get it set up, it’s only $10,000 a year, which seems really affordable when you look at the gigantic queue of things that our engineering team is working on that numbers in the hundreds."
So we bought the license for the product, took the initial $10,000 outlay, and then once we went to set it up, we realized that that $10,000 only got us the most basic out-of-the-box features. We didn’t have ways to track appointments, or to track all these nuances of information that we needed for our own particular business model. As we kept adjusting these features, we realized that we had to bring on an agency to start customizing the platform, and before we knew it, we had spent over $25,000 just trying to implement the most basic version of this platform to fit our needs. Not to mention it was a huge, gigantic cash outlay, and the build process took over six months, which was just crazy to us because we’re used to putting things out very quickly — we usually worked in three-week development sprints.  
In the end, we created a massive bottleneck just for getting inventory on the site, because we were constantly waiting to hear back from this agency as to whether they had updated the features, and on top of that, we were still having to deal with our old method of doing things on spreadsheets while we were waiting for it to be built. We spent a whole lot of money that we really didn’t anticipate having to spend.  
"We created a massive bottleneck just for getting inventory on the site."

The Lesson:   
Looking back, the key lesson was that very rarely is there an "off-the-shelf" solution that’s going to fit exactly what you need to do (unless you’re looking for the most basic implementation). It really taught me to not shy away from big vision builds if they’re going to be critical to the way the business operates, even if they take our development team away from putting out their short-term fires for a few days or weeks. It changed my thoughts to be more focused on exactly what our requirements were going to be at that moment — but also trying to evaluate if we were looking at the big picture.  
I realized that we’d rather build our own systems in-house and have a great core of technology that’s going to last us over the long term, instead of trying to piece together this Frankenstein of different third-party systems, none of which is a great fit for our needs.  
Most importantly, I learned not to be afraid of investing the time to build something that’s going to last you until you need to build out your vision, instead of just trying to find a quick answer from an "off-the-shelf" piece of software that’s only going to get you 60 percent of the way there.
