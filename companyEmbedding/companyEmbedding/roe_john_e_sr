John Roe, Jr.
John Roe, Jr.
President & CEO
516-358-3534 / jroe@cuagency.com

John E. Roe, Jr. is President of City Underwriting Agency, Inc. (CUA, Lake Success, NY), a leading provider of comprehensive insurance products and services. As the third generation in the Roe family to head CUA since its 1930 inception, Mr. Roe has brought his own brand of leadership and a broad executive skill set to the organization.

Mr. Roe's higher education is indicative of his wide range of expertise covering all facets of the business. Following his graduation from LaSalle Military Academy (Oakdale, NY) in 1976, he entered The College of the Holy Cross (Worcester, MA) on a Naval ROTC Scholarship. He graduated in 1980 with a Bachelor of Arts in History and as an Ensign in the U.S. Navy. From 1980-1986, he served in the U.S. Navy, retiring as a Lieutenant Commander. 

In addition to his Bachelor's degree, Mr. Roe holds an MBA in Finance and in Computer Information Systems both received from Bryant College (Smithfield, RI). 

In 1986, he joined CUA beginning as a Mail Clerk. During his earlier years at CUA, Mr. Roe served in various positions from Computer Technician and Administrative Assistant to Switchboard Operator and eventually, Account Executive. In 1987, having demonstrated a strong commitment to all aspects of the Company, he was named Vice President and Producer. 

The combination of his sales prowess and in-depth knowledge of CUA's broad product line and risk management strategies made Mr. Roe one of the Agency's top producers. In 1992, he was named Executive Vice President; a role in which he began the redevelopment and evolution of CUA into one of the region's premier agencies. In 1997, Mr. Roe became CUA President and the Agency's majority stockholder.

Under his leadership, CUA has maintained its close-knit family business and employee-centered culture, while also experiencing significant growth and development. Since 1998, the Agency has more than doubled its revenues and emerged as "the agency" of choice for key industry sectors including the utilities, restaurant and hospitality and transportation. Most recently, CUA expanded into the area of employee benefits outsourcing.

In addition to his active industry involvement, Mr. Roe leads CUA as a community-involvement and philanthropic organization. He and his Management Team assume a hands-on role in supporting various causes from the Association for the Help of Retarded Children to the Nassau Boy Scouts and Queens Child Guidance Center. 

Mr. Roe resides with his wife and their three children in Rockville Centre, NY.
