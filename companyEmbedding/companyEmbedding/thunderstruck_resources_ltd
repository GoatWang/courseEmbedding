How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

Beyond Tesla: 7 stocks driving the autonomous car revolution
              
              Look at these component manufacturers rather than the car companies, says Jeff Reeves.

These 7 highly taxed companies need Congress to finally act on tax reform
              
              It wasn’t Trump’s “movement” that lifted stocks late last year, says Jeff Reeves. It was the promise of lower corporate tax rates.

              The U.S. stock market is on such a parabolic march higher that Wall Street investors may have forgotten what a typical daily downturn feels like anymore.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar turns lower for the week following GDP report
              
              The U.S. dollar fell on Friday, erasing its gains for the week after a read on economic growth came in below expectations, though analysts said the beleaguered currency was potentially nearing a bottom.

Dollar rises from 13-month low

The Nakoro prospect is a zinc-copper volcanogenic massive sulphide prospect located in the northern portion of SPL 1425. A diamond drilling program carried out by Anglo American in the 1970’s intersected anomalous values including:-

12 metres @ 12.7% zinc, 0.3% copper and 56g/t silver,
23.2 metres @ 5.1% zinc, 0.5% copper and 22g/t silver,
7.4 metres @ 7.2% zinc, 0.3% copper and 54g/t silver.

Recent shallow diamond drilling has located a new copper-zinc rich zone close to the surface with several anomalous drill intersections including 1.3 metres @ 3.3% copper, 1.5% zinc, 37.6 g/t silver and 1.6 metres @ 3.0% copper, 10.9% zinc and 40.5 g/t silver. In another area a float sample assayed 21.1% copper. This suggests there may be zones   with higher copper values in the prospect area increasing the chance of finding an economic deposit.
Geophysical interpretative work carried out in 2012 indicated that the prospective horizon extends over 8 kms.

Selective surface grab samples of zinc rich nodules,
(sphalerite-rich) assayed 2.6% copper, 27.5% zinc and 177 g/t silver.

				Liwa Creek Gold Prospect			


The Liwa Creek gold prospect is located in the southern portion of SPL 1425. Amoco Minerals discovered a float sample in the Liwa Creek which assayed 8.4g/t gold in the 1970s. Geopacific Limited in the 1980s discovered the source of the Liwa Creek float sample. The surface expression was a 90-100 metre wide zone of altered volcanic rock with a strike length of over 300 metres. Trenching by Geopacific Limited returned intersections of 15 metres @ 1.9g/t gold and 5.5 metres @ 2.0g/t gold.
Aljen (Pacific) Limited has in the last few years discovered the following anomalous zones up to two kilometres away from the original discovery site at Liwa Creek:-

Outcrops of highly silicified rock assaying 5.7g/t gold over 7 metres.
An outcrop of galena-rich quartz veining with assays of up to 36g/t gold, (Jensen’s prospect).
Float samples from various localities with assays of up to 11.5g/t gold and 110 g/t silver, (Siga’s prospect).

Aeromagnetic data suggest the gold mineralisation is controlled by splay faults associated with the regional Mavuvu fault. This fault extends into the two surrounding application areas CX 784 and CX 801, which suggests these two areas may be prospective for gold.

				The Wainaleka Copper-Zinc Prospect			


Wainaleka is a copper-zinc volcanogenic massive sulphide prospect situated in the central portion of SPL 1416. A diamond drilling  
 program carried out by Anglo American in the 1970’s intersected highly anomalous values including:-

6 metres @ 1.75% copper, 12.0 zinc and 25g/t silver,
10 metres @ 2.0% copper, 5.5% zinc and 47g/t silver,
15.5 metres @ 1.4% copper, 1.3 % zinc and 5.0g/t silver.
The Anglo drilling results have shown the main mineralised zone is open at both ends and at depth.

Recent exploration by Aljen has included: –

Surface sampling; assay results from two samples were 2.7% copper and 19.9% zinc and 7.1% copper and 14.4% zinc.
Trenching returned an intersection of 5.5 metres @ 2.6% copper, 6.8% zinc and 212g/t silver.
A shallow diamond drilling intersection of 2.2 metres @ 1.9% copper, 11.8% zinc and 8.9 g/t silver.

Recent geophysical interpretative work indicated that the prospective horizon is extends over a strike length of 10 kms.

				Thunderstruck Commences Exploration Program			




  
  
 




Effort Represents First Focused Exploration Of Targets In 38 YearsVancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - July 13, 2017) - Thunderstruck Resources Ltd. (TSXV: AWE) ("Thunderstruck") is pleased to provide shareholders with an update on our 2017 exploration program. The Company's current exploration focus is on surface to near-surface gold targets at both Rama Creek and Liwa Creek. The high-grade Liwa Creek prospect is located 6 km to the southeast of the Rama copper-gold porphyry, which is surrounded by an area that has high potential for gold."Now that the onset of dryer weather has allowed better access to the Rama and Liwa areas, we can undertake a more meaningful field program in order to delineate drill targets for later this season. The Fijian exploration season normally runs through November, by which point we hope to have significantly advanced both of these assets." notes Bryce Bradley, CEO.Our first-pass stream sediment sampling program at Rama Creek was recently completed with 110 samples being collected over an area of 15 square kilometres. Heavy rain and associated flash flooding forced a temporary abandonment of field operations and the first batch of sample results are now expected from the laboratory before the end of the month. Forty-seven samples have been received by the lab for cyanide leach followed by gold, silver and copper analysis and of these, 22 will be going directly for multi-element analysis. Analytical work on the remaining 63 samples will be governed by the results from the first batch. Exploration Program RAMA CREEKThe targets in the Rama Creek area are vein-type gold deposits. Recently discovered data of multi-element analysis of 141 stream sediment samples collected by Barringer Fiji Ltd. in 1971 have revealed a significant arsenic-antimony anomaly (figure attached) with gold potential. This anomaly is an east-trending, anomalous arsenic-antimony zone (maximum values of 461 ppm As and 1,126 ppm Sb) with a length of 4.5 km and centred 1,600 metres north of diamond drill hole DDH 1 (which returned 244m of 0.22% Cu, 0.16 g/t Au). Arsenic and antimony are well-known pathfinder elements for epithermal, vein gold, which are commonly developed around such porphyry systems. The As and Sb values may indicate a previously unrecognized gold system. In addition, Southern Pacific Resources Limited completed approximately 14 km of ridge and spur auger soil sampling in 1988. This sampling defined a large gold anomaly (Anomaly A in the attached figure) extending 2,500 m by 1,000 m based on a 50 ppb Au cut-off value. This anomaly is of interest for gold veins peripheral to the adjacent copper-gold porphyry. RAMA EXPLORATION PROGRAMFieldwork will involve the following:•   Follow up bulk leach extractable gold (BLEG) sampling•   Geological and prospecting follow up of First Pass BLEG results•   Fill-in hand auger sampling at Anomaly A plus deeper auger sampling.•   Fill-in hand auger sampling at several other small gold and copper anomalies.LIWA CREEKLiwa Creek's historical surface work returned high gold values that include (figure attached) : •   1.9 g/t Au over 15 metres trenching across the north-trending Liwa Lode.•   5.7 g/t Au over 7 metres outcropping of highly silicified rock (part of Jensen's Prospect and 750 m east of Liwa Lode).•   30 g/t Au outcrop of galena-rich (13% Pb & 1 % Cu) quartz veins (200 m east of the above gold zone at Jensen's prospect).•   11.5 g/t Au & 110 g/t Ag float samples (Siga's Prospect, 1.7 km NE of Jensen's Prospect).•   42 ppb and 15 ppb gold BLEG samples (500 m east and 1,100 m south of Jensen's Prospect respectively).LIWA EXPLORATION PROGRAMThe anomalous gold zone in the Liwa area is 6 km by 4 km and Thunderstruck will be testing the more auriferous zones within this 24 km2 that will include;•   Regional BLEG sampling.•   Stream sediment sampling, designed to test the previously located zinc values of up to 0.25% in stream sediments.•   Geological mapping, sampling and trenching of the Liwa Lode and Jensen's area. •   Auger soil sampling to test for extensions of Liwa and Jensen's prospects to the north and south of known limits.DrillingThe Company is pleased to announce it has retained the services of Eric Mosley to train local Fijians on the use of the Company's man-portable diamond drill in advance of its anticipated drill program. Concurrent with Thunderstuck's Q2/Q3 field program, Mr. Mosley will conduct a training program with local drillers. As results from the field program are received, the Company will decide where to mobilize the drill for maximum effectiveness.Bryce Bradley comments, "Mr. Mosley has previously been to Fiji, assembled our drill and walked our land. He has conducted many drill programs with this type of drill, and is very comfortable with the topography. We're confident that he will implement a drilling campaign that is both cost-effective and efficient." Eric Mosley (HBSc. Geology) has worked globally as a Geological Technician, Field Geologist, Chief Geologist, and Exploration and Project Manager. He has conducted drill programs across Canada, the Arctic, West Africa and Dominican Republic.Tenement AcquisitionThunderstruck is in the process of assessing its sizable application areas, to determine priority targets in order to pursue the acquisition of the most prospective of these projects. The assets under review include the Vago, CIS, Wainaleka Extension and SPL 1425 Extension areas (please see PR April 13, 2017), as well as CX 801 and CX 784. The Company expects to announce a strategic consolidation of its most prospective holdings upon completion of detailed analyses of available data, in conjunction with any necessary field reconnaissance and liaison with the Mineral Resource Department. Other BusinessThe Company will seek to extend the expiry date of an aggregate 5,597,000 outstanding share purchase warrants. The subject warrants were originally issued on July 21, 2015 and September 21, 2015 with original expiry dates of two years. The new expiry dates will provide a three-year extension. The warrants continue to be exercised at their original exercise price.The amendment to the terms of the warrants is subject to TSX Venture Exchange approval and any regulatory approvals.The scientific and technical information disclosed in this news release was reviewed and approved by Michael Page, who is a "Qualified Person" as defined in National Instrument 43-101 — Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects, and a director of the Company.Figure 1To view an enhanced version of Figure 1, please visit:http://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/2901/27941_a1499919890402_51.jpgFigure 2To view an enhanced version of Figure 2, please visit: http://orders.newsfilecorp.com/files/2901/27941_a1499919890589_25.jpgAbout Thunderstruck ResourcesThunderstruck Resources is a Canadian mining exploration company with highly prospective VMS and precious metals projects in Fiji.

Thunderstruck Resources – Copper & Zinc Exploration in the Pacific Ocean’s Ring of Fire



Overview
Thunderstruck Resources Ltd. (TSXV:AWE) is developing a diverse portfolio of zinc, copper and gold properties on the main island of Fiji, Viti Levu. The company’s two flagship properties are the high-grade zinc-copper Nakoro and Wainaleka projects, with historical drilling returning average grades of 7% zinc and 1-2% copper.
Thunderstruck’s Fijian property portfolio covers nearly four percent of the main island and includes four main assets; the Nakoro and Wainaleka zinc-copper projects, the Liwa Creek gold project, and the Rama Creek copper porphyry.
In October 2016, Thunderstruck acquired a private Fijian company holding the assets that Thunderstruck Resources had previously under option.
“After three years of working toward this achievement, we now own 100 percent of these highly prospective zinc, copper and precious metal targets and have commenced exploration, said Bryce Bradley, Thunderstruck’s President and CEO. “The company has satisfied the multiple conditions required by the various Fijian authorities, and are entertaining joint venture opportunities on one of our properties.”
Thunderstruck is conducting mapping, geochemical and trenching programs on its Nakoro, Liwa Creek and Rama Creek properties to determine drill targets. Both the Nakoro and Wainaleka zinc-copper projects are the site of successful historic drilling by Anglo American.
Thunderstruck Resources is managed by an experienced team of geology, mining and financial professionals. The company’s Country Manager, Bill Brook, has worked as a geologist in Fiji for more than four decades and conducted preliminary exploration work on Thunderstruck’s project areas in the 1980s before discovering the 787,000 ounce gold deposit nearby that is now in development with Lion One Metals (LIO-TSXV). Co-founding directors Brien Lundin and Bryce Bradley have a long history of raising capital and other strategic roles in the natural resource sector to support the advancement of discoveries like their current Fijian projects.
Investment Highlights

With asset purchase complete, Thunderstruck owns a vast land package of zinc, copper, gold and silver assets covering nearly four percent of the main island of Fiji.
Significant mineral deposits on the main island including Vatukoula Gold Mine, Tuvatu Gold deposit and Namosi copper project.
26 holes drilled by Anglo with grades up to 12.7 percent zinc and two percent copper.
High-grade zinc, copper, silver and gold targets.
Mineralization remains open at depth and along strike.
Accomplished management and exploration team.
Q4 2016 exploration work has been completed, and JV partners are being sought.
Close to Asian markets.


Mining in Fiji
When most people think of Fiji, mining usually isn’t the first thing that comes to mind. However, mining in the South Pacific nation has been ongoing since the opening of the Emperor (now Vatukoula) Gold Mine in 1934.
The island archipelago is located on the Pacific Ocean’s Ring of Fire, which contains many of the world’s major gold and copper deposits. One of the most developed economies in the Pacific, Fiji is served by a mining-friendly government, and a reasonable royalty (five percent gross profits) and tax structure (20 percent corporate).
The Highly Prospective “Ring of Fire”
The Vatukoula Mine is still in operation and has produced more than seven million ounces of gold. In addition to gold, Fiji also hosts several undeveloped major porphyry copper-gold deposits.
Australian miner Newcrest, along with joint venture partners that include Mitsubishi Materials Corp., has a pre-feasibility stage copper-gold project immediately adjacent to Thunderstruck’s properties on the main island of Viti Levu. The Namosi project contains an estimated resource of 2.2 billion tonnes @ 0.34 percent copper and 0.11 g/t gold.
Fiji is close to Asian markets and Viti Levu has excellent infrastructure including a deep-water port and hydroelectric dam.
Key Properties
Nakoro Zinc-Copper Project
Thunderstruck Resources’ main asset is the Nakoro zinc-copper volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) project on the main island of Fiji, Viti Levu. Thunderstruck Resources recently acquired 100-percent ownership of the base metal and gold properties portfolio and has recently completed its Q4 exploration work. Forestry roads extend across the property and the hydroelectric power station at the Monasavu Dam is only 20 kilometers northeast of Nakoro. The project is in the same district as Newcrest’s Namosi JV Project.
Previous drilling by Anglo American on a massive sulphide body discovered grades of about five to 12 percent zinc, with zones of high-grade copper at surface. Further surface exploration work will focus on expanding known zones of zinc and copper mineralization, and gold potential on the property will also be assessed. In 2015, Thunderstruck exposed a small, siliceous, gold-bearing rock sample of 3.37 g/t gold north of the zinc mineralization.

Between 1975 and 1977, Anglo American completed two diamond drill programs at Nakoro totaling 2,614 meters in 20 holes over a strike length of approximately 300 meters. Historical drill results include:

12 meters @ 12.7 percent zinc, 0.3 percent copper and 56g/t silver;
23.2 meters @ 5.1 percent zinc, 0.5 percent copper and 22g/t silver; and
7.4 meters @ 7.2 percent zinc, 0.3 percent copper and 54g/t silver.

Diamond drilling by the previous owner located a new zinc-copper rich zone close to the surface. Anomalous intersections include:

1.3 meters @ 1.5 percent zinc, 3.3 percent copper, and 37.6 g/t silver; (ending in mineralization) and
1.6 meters @ 10.9 percent zinc, 3.0 percent copper, and 40.5 g/t silver (ending in mineralization).

In addition, float samples taken at that time assayed 21.1 percent copper, suggesting the property has the potential to host zones of high-copper values.
The historical and recent exploration work at Nakoro has shown a copper zone located at surface with only a few meters of surface oxidation, and the historically drilled massive zinc zone open along strike and at depth.
Thunderstruck Resources conducted a surface exploration program at Nakoro in 2014. Assay results from the field work confirmed the potential for high-grade copper mineralization as well as high-grade zinc and silver. Results from the initial samples include values of 19.3 percent and 11.3 percent copper; 25.6 percent and 14.0 percent zinc; 1,026 gold g/t and 498 g/t silver g/t.
Wainaleka Zinc-Copper Project
Thunderstruck Resources’ second flagship project is the Wainaleka zinc-copper VMS project. The property is approximately 10 kilometers from the south coast of the main island and 50 kilometers by modern highway from the deep-water port at the Fijian capital of Suva.

Historical drilling on the property by Anglo American totaled 1,763 meters. Results showed that the main mineralized zone is open at both ends and at depth. Drill work intersected high grade values including:

6 meters at 12.0 percent zinc, 1.75 percent copper, and 25g/t silver;
10 meters at 5.5 percent zinc, 2.0 percent copper, and 47g/t silver; and
15.5 meters at 1.3 percent zinc, 1.4 percent copper, and 5.0g/t silver.

Results from exploration work by the previous owner included:

surface sampling with assay results from two samples showing 2.7 percent copper and 19.9 percent zinc; and 7.1 percent copper and 14.4 percent zinc;
trenching returned an intersection of 5.5 meters at 2.6 percent copper, 6.8 percent zinc and 212g/t silver (ending in mineralization); and
a shallow diamond drilling intersection of 2.2 meters at 1.9 percent copper, 11.8 percent zinc and 8.9 g/t silver (ending in mineralization).

Two stacked mineralized zones are apparent at Wainaleka including a high-grade central zinc zone, and an underlying and adjacent copper zone. The project has the potential for an initial open pit with only a few meters of surface oxidation which will maximize tonnage for flotation.
Liwa Creek Gold Project
The Liwa Creek Gold Project is a prospective high-grade gold property on the main island of Fiji, near the company’s Nakoro and Wainaleka copper-gold VMS projects. This high-priority area contains classic epithermal, high-grade gold veins, breccia bodies and silicification zones. Other than regional sampling, minor trenching and grab sampling, little exploration has been completed. Numerous rock samples over a nine-square-kilometer area range in grade from five g/t to 30 g/t gold, with locally high silver.
Historical data at Liwa Creek includes:

assays of 8.4 g/t gold and 93 g/t silver from a siliceous, pyritic rock sample taken by Amoco Minerals Fiji Ltd. in the 1970s;
soil samples assaying up to 9.6 g/t gold; chip sampling from trenches showing 15 meters of 1.9 g/t gold; and 5.5 meters of 2.01 g/t gold from soil sampling and trenching conducted in the 1980s by Geopacific Limited; and
a chip sample assaying 5.7 g/t gold over seven meters has shown the potential for a regional target area.

This data suggests the area should be the target of further exploration work and has excellent potential to host gold and silver deposits. Both the Country Manager and Project Manager worked on the project.
Rama Creek Copper-Gold Project
The Rama Creek copper-gold porphyry prospect, similar geologically to the adjacent giant Namosi porphyry copper-gold deposit, is located about five kilometers northwest of the Liwa Creek project. Anglo American previously drilled only four wide-spaced holes with the central hole DDH 1 intersecting stockwork porphyry mineralization over 244 meters grading 0.22 percent copper and 0.16 g/t gold, including 72 meters at 0.38 percent copper and 0.29 g/t gold. High-grade silver assays were reported in samples from the periphery.
Thunderstruck Resources’ exploration program is focusing on the surrounding area of 14 square kilometers of anomalous gold values derived from stream sediment sampling in the 1990s. The area is highly prospective for gold and silver as such copper-gold porphyries typically have gold vein systems around them.
