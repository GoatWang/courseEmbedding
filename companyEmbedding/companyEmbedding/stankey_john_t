Telecommunications colossus AT&T already is making plans for its management structure after it completes its proposed $85.4-billion takeover of media giant Time Warner Inc., including expanding its operations in Los Angeles.It is widely expected that AT&T will turn to 30-year phone company veteran John Stankey to run the movie and television business once the Time Warner deal closes. Stankey, 54, is a trusted lieutenant of AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson and he currently leads AT&T’s Entertainment group in El Segundo, which includes satellite television service DirecTV.Dallas-based AT&T has begun relocating 300 high-level executives from its Dallas headquarters and operations in Atlanta to work at the El Segundo campus, where Stankey is based. The company wants Los Angeles, where 12,000 AT&T employees already work, to become a more vibrant corporate center.The gargantuan Time Warner merger was announced in October, and the U.S. Department of Justice antitrust division has been reviewing the combination to make sure that it won’t choke competition in the media and telecommunications industries. If the deal is approved by Justice Department regulators and U.S. Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions, the telecommunications giant would control such prized media assets as CNN, HBO, TBS, TNT, Cartoon Network and Warner Bros. film and television studio.

Observers expect the Justice Department to approve the deal  this year, perhaps as early as September.AT&T sponsored a conference Friday and Saturday for software developers on the Warner Bros. studio lot in Burbank as the company takes strategic steps to raise its profile in the entertainment community.“L.A. is a real critical place for us,” Stankey, who currently serves as chief executive of AT&T Entertainment, said in an interview this week. “I have bought in — hook, line and sinker — to the Silicon Beach entertainment nexus — and this is why we want to be here. It is a software-driven world.”Bloomberg News first reported that AT&T plans to break itself into two independent companies once the merger is finalized — phone operations in one group and media and entertainment in the other.

Stankey would reportedly run the entertainment operations, including the Time Warner properties, while John Donovan, another AT&T veteran, would run the phone service.AT&T on Friday said “no decisions on [organizational] structure or leadership have been finalized.”Stankey also said those decisions were still pending, in part, because the Justice Department has rules that restrict cooperation and sharing of information between two companies before a merger is complete.“Making final decisions on organizational structure and what we are going to do is — believe it or not — something that is done very, very, late in the process,” Stankey said. “We don’t have the access to all the information and insights that we need to be able to make those decisions until we are further along in the process.”However, Time Warner Chairman and Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes is expected to step down from his leadership role as soon as AT&T takes over the venerable media company. Bewkes has said he will stick around as long as AT&T needs his help with the integration, but executives within AT&T and Time Warner believe that AT&T quickly will begin calling the shots.For example, after AT&T assumed control of DirecTV in 2015, Stankey immediately replaced the former DirecTV CEO, Mike White, and there was an exodus of longtime DirecTV executives.Dividing the company into two distinct business units would follow a model used by Philadelphia cable giant Comcast Corp. when it acquired NBCUniversal in 2011. Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts turned to his trusted deputy, Steve Burke, to run NBCUniversal in New York and tapped another executive to oversee the cable television and broadband Internet operations.It is unclear whether dividing the company would also satisfy concerns that are expected to be raised by regulators, such as how AT&T would safeguard personal information about phone customers as well as ensuring editorial independence at CNN.CNN has become a particular sore spot for President Trump, who frequently criticizes CNN’s coverage of him. And before the election, Trump said his administration would block the proposed merger because it would consolidate too much power in a single company, although people close to the companies believe that Trump now is more comfortable with the deal.Another area of concern is that AT&T’s phone operations are highly regulated, and frequently have issues pending before state and municipal governments, including where the company can locate its cellphone towers. Separating the two spheres could help to insulate CNN, one of the nation’s premier news organizations, from meddling by politicians.Stephenson will remain chairman and chief executive of AT&T once the deal is finalized, AT&T said Friday.There is a wild card in the Justice Department review of the AT&T-Time Warner deal. The U.S. Senate has not confirmed Trump’s pick to run the antitrust division, Makan Delrahim, who would become the assistant attorney general under Sessions. Delrahim was nominated in March and a Senate subcommittee approved his appointment by a 19-1 vote in June. He is now awaiting the approval of the full Senate.Until he is confirmed, Acting Assistant Atty. Gen. Andrew Finch is overseeing the AT&T merger review. Meanwhile, opponents are mobilizing to try to persuade regulators to block the deal.“There's a growing discomfort across the political spectrum of consumers that amassing more power in the hands of fewer media and cable giants will drive up prices and limit choices,” said Gene Kimmelman, chief executive of the consumer rights group Public Knowledge. “It's time for antitrust enforcers to do their job and stand up to monopolistic dangers like the AT&T-Time Warner merger.”

        LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORENEW YORK — AT&T's $49 billion acquisition of DirecTV was formally approved Friday.The merger puts AT&T's John Stankey in a new role as CEO of AT&T Entertainment & Internet Services, where he will run both DIRECTV and AT&T's home solutions operations. Stankey talked to USA TODAY tech columnist Edward C. Baig about what the deal means for AT&T and for consumers.Comments were edited for space and clarity.USA TODAY: What is your vision for the new company?Stankey: The simple vision is we want customers to take their premium entertainment experience and enjoy it anywhere. Our job as a company that provides connectivity, whether it's fixed or mobile, is to make sure that they have that portability.Nobody else has the kind of toolset (and) breath that we now have--scaled content, world class mobile network, broadband network, the technical compatibilities to take all that out over an IP infrastructure. That's the big strategic thrust.And then there's the basic blocking and tackling thrust (to take) two big companies and get the benefits of being able to leverage product distribution. Remove redundancies between the two businesses and make it more cost efficient and more effective. That ultimately generates more cash. And when that cash is generated it will allow us to plow it back into building fiber and broadband.USA TODAY: Will there be changes in branding?Stankey: You'll see us of course start to move to make sure that people know that DirecTV is part of the AT&T family. And you'll see us evolving the branding over time. Our goal is to make sure that customers think about their entertainment with their connectivity.USA TODAY: Back when deal was announced AT&T said it could take 12 to 18 months for new robust wireless offerings? Is that still the case?Stankey: There's good news and bad news. The bad news is that it took a long time to get this (merger) thing approved, probably longer than it should. The good news is that it gives you a little time to think about what you want to do. And you should probably expect weeks (from now) you're going to start to see things in the market that will represent the integration and togetherness of those products. I'm not going to tell you today what the price is and what those products are but they will be out there and I think you'll be surprised by how fast we move out there. We've had 14 months to think about it. And 14 months within the bounds of the law to do some planning.USA TODAY? Will U-verse and DirecTV co-exist?Stankey: We sold to different customer bases. There's some overlap in the markets but we played to the bundle game with U-verse by consolidating product offerings. DirectTV played to people who wanted to buy standalone video. We now can start to cross market products and services. Over the long haul our goal is offer one video product in the market, (with) one video channel lineup, one set of programming relationships, one video brand.To do that, we have to do integration work of the technical platforms. I wouldn't think about it as one going away or the other one going away. It's about how the two of them arrive at a new place that's better. Building that new platform is going to take us 24 to 36 months. Our goal is if you're a consumer of ours today that this transition is done in way that is evolutionary (and) non-invasive. This new platform is very software centric. We'll be able to bring the customer new features and services incrementally.USA TODAY: Does this deal change AT&T's views on net neutrality or its open Internet policy?)Stankey: We're still in favor of an open Internet and still supportive of rules around non-discrimination of traffic. Our issue is with Title II, it's not about whether we think the Internet should be open and fair. We think Title II is a regulatory overreach and it adds a degree of uncertainty into an investment marketplace (when the) FCC at any time can choose to reach in and reset the rules or regulate price or change performance metrics that create problems for consistency in business models. This transaction doesn't change anything about our challenge around that.FCC approves AT&T's acquisition of DirecTVUSA TODAY: What kind of clout does the DirecTV deal give AT&T?Stankey: I think it' s nice to be able to play in a league that's closer to what a vertically integrated Comcast can play in. We don't own content like they do.Our situation is we at least have volume scale. (It is) important to generate returns to invest in fiber and bring more broadband to customers. But we also want that ability so that we can go start working with the people who have the really attractive content to build these new distribution models. If you're talking about 26 million homes that buy video — traditional linear video — and 100 million high quality handsets and customers that are out there, many of whom have smartphones, that's a whole other opportunity to distribute content. That will allow us to do something with these guys that others who don't have this whole set of vertically integrated capabilities—home broadband, mobile, great TV product, etc. — can do.USA TODAY? How does this benefit consumers?Stankey: (The FCC) believed that another player in the market that had some scale would help to suppress the increase that's going on in rates. So I think consumers are going to see an economic value.USA TODAY? Big mergers often bring job loss to the new company. What do you expect?Stankey:  Obviously, there's going to be some functions that are going to be redundant when you put two large businesses together like this. There's two treasury organizations and two legal organizations. But this is about us growing broadband and video share and making this business more competitive. That growth is going to be really good for employees who are in operating roles. When you're growing you need more technicians and more people to talk to customers on the phone and you do more investment with IT. So the vast majority of folks are going to have more than enough work to do over the next several months and years to get this business operating right, aside from some of the corporate overheads that we're going to have to manage through.Email:ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow USA TODAY tech columnist @edbaig on TwitterCONNECTTWEET
