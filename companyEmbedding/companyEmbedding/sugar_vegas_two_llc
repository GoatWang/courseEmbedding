SUGAR VEGAS TWO               RESTAURANT



INVESTMENT     RESTAURANT





The Sugar Factory brand has become a worldwide phenomenon – offering everyone a sweet escape for the young and not-so-young alike. The Sugar Factory is the first of its kind, bringing the world of celebrity entertainment to a consumer offering in the retail confectionary sector. This strategy has been imbedded in the marketing campaigns of successful clubs and restaurants for decades yet no one has thought to apply this strategy to candy. Each Sugar Factory location has an endless supply of candy and sugar themed snack foods that appeal to both children and the inner-child in everyone. Iconic superstars including Britney Spears, Drake, Nicole Scherzinger, Kim Kardashian, Eva Longoria, Carmen Electra and Rupert Grint are just a few of the celebrities who have either endorsed or have been spotted with the sparkly lollipops. Sugar Factory’s loyal celebrity following has received widespread media attention from People Magazine, the Daily Mail, Extra and more. With the explosion of social media, these celebrities help get the word out to their millions of loyal followers that the Sugar Factory is their destination of choice.
The Sugar Factory Las Vegas location will feature 345 seats in 18,000 square feet of dining space including a chocolate lounge, margarita bar, private dining rooms, and even a merry-go-round. It will be an over the top restaurant in a city that is known for its lavish dining options. With the added bonus of celebrity guests, tourists will all want to dine at Sugar Factory to feel as though they are a part of the glamorous world their favorite stars occupy, and when they see that the food is top notch, they will continue to return to the restaurant and recommend it to their friends and family.

 


 





There are currently Sugar Factory locations in multiple cities around the United States with worldwide destinations currently under development. The New York City location, which opened in 2013, had revenues of $6 million in 2014, operating out of only 1,600 square feet. They recently opened a new 8,000 square foot location in New York’s Meatpacking District that is on track to significantly grow the revenue. The Miami Beach location, on Ocean Drive in South Beach, is on pace for $8 million in revenues, and the Chicago location, in Rosemont, is on pace for $10 million in sales from a 9,000 square foot location. Finally, the original flagship Las Vegas location had 2013 revenues of over $20 million, thereby fuelling the need for an incredible, new showplace to dazzle the over 40 million annual visitors to Las Vegas.
In addition to the currently operating Sugar Factory locations throughout the United States, there are plans in development to open new restaurants in London, Boston, Los Angeles, Dubai, the Philippines, Bahrain, and Houston, with future cities under discussion. Sugar Factory is on track to become the next global retail and restaurant giant, with a following of customers spanning every age group. Through product licensing deals with world renowned celebrities, as well as a newly signed deal with DC Comics to feature their characters on candy products, as well as a deal with Hello Kitty, the Sugar Factory, through strategic partnerships, is growing their customer awareness rapidly.

Over the last decade there has been a shift in the Las Vegas Strip. For years, Caesar’s Palace was considered the epicenter of Vegas, however due to substantial development on the north part of the strip, that center is moving north to the area surrounding Fashion Show Mall. This is primarily due to the construction and popularity of the Wynn and Encore resorts, in addition to the Palazzo and Venetian all being in this location, and focusing on a higher end clientele looking for unique dining and cultural experiences while in Las Vegas. Additionally, Resorts World is under construction on a $4 billion Chinese themed resort with 3,500 rooms directly next door to the Fashion Show Mall. Billionaire James Packer of Crown Entertainment recently purchased land directly across from Wynn Encore for a planned resort that has not yet been announced. All of this development in the area surrounding the Sugar Factory American Brasserie will only further strengthen the performance of the restaurant.

Meatpacking District
Sugar Factory American Brasserie has settled into its new home at 835 Washington Street in New York City’s Meatpacking District, continuing the celebrated brand’s impressive worldwide expansion.
The new 9,000-square-foot brasserie and retail store delivers the same candyland appeal that has made Sugar Factory an international favorite. The design combines form and function to bring Sugar Factory’s whimsical brand into its new home on Washington Street. The dining room spans two floors, with 250 seats and two magnificent bars serving up Sugar Factory’s famed cocktail concoctions. The top floor also features a private “VIP” room that can be rented out for special events and comes complete with a personal candy store that can be customized with guests’ favorites.
The third and underground levels feature the Sugar Factory Chocolate Lounge with 68 seats, offering a wide array of cocktails with chocolate pairings. Glassware will be presented with a decadent chocolate rim as guests can enjoy a selection of fondues, cheeses, crepes Suzette and more.
Situated at the entrance to the new Sugar Factory American Brasserie, a spacious sidewalk café welcomes patrons with a 60 seat outdoor patio and to-go window serving artisanal doughnuts and 12 different flavors of gelato year-round.
The retail section features a selection of more than 300 of the company’s signature treats and merchandise, including candy bins and the world-famous Couture Pops. Synonymous with the Sugar Factory brand, Couture Pops have become a pop culture phenomenon and have made confections a celebrity accessory.
The expansive restaurant serves delectable breakfast, lunch, dinner and late-night options, offering a variety of inventive and mouthwatering appetizers, oversized sandwiches, salads, pizzas and more. Sugar Factory’s specialty, of course, is a sprawling dessert menu, featuring an assortment of warm, freshly-baked waffles and crepes, childhood favorites and rich, gourmet chocolates cascading from colossal fondue fountains. In addition to the savory cuisine and sweet confections, Sugar Factory offers a distinctive selection of liquid libations.

SUGAR VEGAS TWO               INVESTMENT



INVESTMENT     RESTAURANT





The purpose of this Confidential Investment Offering Overview is to provide a summary of a possible  future private investment opportunity that may be made available to a certain  limited number of accredited investors.   This is not an offer to sell real estate and/or any type of security,  partnership interest, public or otherwise.
In early 2016, our Investors were provided the opportunity to invest in a newly built Sugar Factory location in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Sugar Factory is a Las Vegas based retail and restaurant concept developed by some of the most successful nightlife industry veterans in Las Vegas. Their colorful stores and restaurants are a sugar addict’s dream and the concept has been expanding rapidly around the entire world. The majority of their locations are Sugar Factory American Brasseries. These restaurants feature a menu created by a Michelin award winning chef and treat guests to a one-of-a-kind dining experience, serving decadent and tasty fare to satisfy sweet and savory cravings. The celebrated eatery is well known for its 36-ounce alcohol-infused smoking candy goblets such as the Lollipop Passion infused with coconut, pineapple and melon flavors, adorned with candy necklaces and swirly lollipops. The eatery’s exclusive Chocolate Lounge acts as an intimate alcove set to deliver the ultimate experience to patrons interested in fondue, wine, champagne and liquor pairings. 














The Las Vegas location will appeal to every visitor to Las Vegas, over 40 million total in 2014, and will be seen by most of them. The restaurant currently under construction is an 18,000-square foot restaurant, bar, and lounge that will serve as the worldwide flagship Sugar Factory American Brasserie. It is located on the ground floor of the Fashion Show Mall, the largest shopping center in Nevada at over 2 million square feet, and one of the highest revenue producing shopping centers in the world. The Sugar Factory location will be directly on The Strip, with frontage facing the Wynn resort. This luxurious restaurant and lounge will appeal to every age demographic traveling to Las Vegas and offer them the fun and exciting atmosphere people travel to Vegas for. Helmed by Michelin award winning chef, Christophe Bonnegrace, the incredible food the Sugar Factory offers will continue to bring back diners over and over again for an experience they will never forget.
We have recently been advised by our partners at Sugar Factory that the scope of the restaurant has increased in several exciting ways. They were successful in receiving variances to add an additional 40 seats on the second level daiquiri bar, two additional seating areas on the second level across from the mall entrance to add 80 seats, and an indoor/outdoor bar on the ground level which will help bring in patrons to the patio, bar and restaurant. Finally, approval was granted from the mall to build a one of a kind Sugar Factory “Candy Lane” attraction on the second level overlooking the Las Vegas Strip. This attraction is geared to drive tourists and locals to the venue in addition to greater signage. When completed, the restaurant will have 345 seats.

The Sugar Factory excels at the marketing of their stores and products. Celebrities from Britney Spears to the Kardashian Family all have specialty Sugar Factory products and through the power of social media are able to be the best spokespeople for the Sugar Factory stores. When a Sugar Factory opening occurs, most likely with celebrities in attendance, thousands of people line the red carpet for a glimpse of the stars and to have a taste of what so many customers are raving about. With locations so far in Manhattan, Miami, Chicago, and Washington D.C., and locations under construction throughout the world, customers are highly anticipating each new opening and bringing their family and friends to enjoy the fun. Each Sugar Factory location is a visual feast and is both glamorous and comfortable. Customers have been known to wait up to three hours for a table in some locations and bring back family and friends to enjoy the surroundings and delicious food. It is the perfect place for a birthday party, bachelorette celebration, or even an engagement.
The first Sugar Factory location opened in the Mirage hotel in Las Vegas in 2009 as a retail store and several years later as a full restaurant and lounge in the Paris Hotel on the strip. Due to its immense success and strong brand image, the Sugar Factory team is ready to open their largest location yet in the epicenter of the north end of the Strip, the Fashion Show Mall, across from the Wynn and Encore resorts (4,750 rooms), as well as the Palazzo (3,068 rooms), Treasure Island (2,884 rooms), and the currently under construction 3,500 room Resorts World Hotel.
