Virtus Investment Advisers, Inc. Key Developments

Virtus Investment Advisers Agrees to Pay $16.5 Million to Settle Charges
Nov 18 15
The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that Virtus Investment Advisers agreed to pay $16.5 million to settle charges that it misled mutual fund investors and others with advertisements containing false historical performance data about AlphaSector. An SEC investigation found that Virtus Investment Advisers publicized a substantially overstated performance track record as received from F-Squared, which it hired as a sub adviser for mutual funds and other clients that followed F-Squared's AlphaSector strategy. Virtus falsely stated in client presentations, marketing materials, SEC filings, and other communications that the AlphaSector strategy had a performance history dating back to April 2001 and outperformed the S&P 500 Index for several years. In a separate SEC enforcement action last year, F-Squared admitted to touting a track record it presented as real when it was actually hypothetical and backtested, and these calculations also were inflated.

History[edit]
Virtus Investment Partners, formerly known as Phoenix Investment Partners, Ltd., was formed on November 1, 1995 through a reverse merger with Duff & Phelps Investment Management Co., at the time the investment management affiliate of Duff & Phelps Corporation.
1995 - 2006[edit]
From 1995 to 2001, Virtus was a majority-owned indirect subsidiary of Phoenix Life Insurance Co. During this period, the company purchased a majority interest in several boutique investment management companies to establish its multi-manager business model. In addition to Duff & Phelps Investment Management, Virtus’ affiliated managers include Kayne Anderson Rudnick Investment Management, LLC, Newfleet Asset Management (formerly SCM Advisors, LLC, and previously Seneca Capital Management), and Zweig Advisers LLC, which was founded by legendary Wall Street investor Martin Zweig.
On January 11, 2001, a subsidiary of Phoenix acquired the outstanding shares of Phoenix Investment Partners not already owned, and the company became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Phoenix.
In May 2005, Phoenix Investment Partners acquired the remaining minority interest in SCM Advisors and in September of that year acquired the remaining minority interest in Kayne Anderson Rudnick, thereby increasing ownership of both companies to 100%. In May 2006, Phoenix Investment Partners acquired the rights to advise, distribute and administer the Insight Funds from Harris Investment Management, Inc.
2006 - 2009[edit]
In February 2008, Phoenix announced it would spin-off Phoenix Investment Partners as an independent asset management company through a pro-rata dividend of Phoenix Investment Partners common stock to Phoenix's shareholders.[1] On October 30, 2008, Harris Bankcorp Inc., a US subsidiary of Bank of Montreal announced it would acquire $45 million in convertible preferred stock, representing a 23 percent equity position in Virtus.[2]
Virtus became an independent publicly traded company on December 31, 2008 upon completion of its spin-off from Phoenix. The first day of trading of VRTS was January 2, 2009, and company officials rang the opening bell at NASDAQ Market Site on January 5, 2009.[3]
Business Overview[edit]
Retail products (available to individual investors) include open-end mutual funds, closed-end funds and separately managed accounts. The Virtus Mutual Funds family consists of approximately 45 open-end mutual funds that are distributed primarily through intermediaries, including national and regional broker-dealers, independent broker-dealers and independent financial advisory firms. Virtus' five closed-end funds, which are provided by two affiliated managers, encompass utility and tactical asset allocation strategies. The closed-end funds trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
Retail separately managed accounts comprise intermediary programs, sponsored and distributed by unaffiliated brokerage firms, and private client accounts, which are offered to the high-net-worth clients of the affiliated managers.
Virtus also manages institutional accounts for corporations, multi-employer retirement funds, foundations, endowments, and special purpose funds.[4]
Principal Subsidiaries[edit]
Virtus operates a multi-manager asset management business, comprising a number of individual affiliated managers, each having its own distinct investment style, autonomous investment process and brand, and the services of unaffiliated subadvisers. Affiliated managers include:[5]

Cliffwater Investments LLC, located in Los Angeles and NYC, provides alternative advisory services to institutional investors including endowments, foundations, retirement systems and financial institutions. In 2015, it reportedly advised clients with $800 million to exit the Carlyle Group's Claren Road hedge fund.[6]
Duff & Phelps Investment Management Co., headquartered in Chicago, manages open- and closed-end funds and institutional separate accounts investing in global utilities, infrastructure and REITs. Institutional services are offered to corporations, municipalities, retirement and benefit plans, endowments, foundations and others.
Euclid Advisors LLC is a New York-based investment management affiliate of Virtus Investment Partners that manages both domestic and international equity portfolios.
Kayne Anderson Rudnick Investment Management, LLC of Los Angeles offers a variety of actively managed equity and fixed-income strategies to individuals through open end mutual funds and separately managed accounts primarily to high-net-worth individuals. Institutional clients include endowments, foundations, corporations, public funds, and pension plans.
Kleinwort Benson Investors International, Ltd. is an investment affiliate of Kleinwort Benson Investors (KBI), an established institutional asset manager headquartered in Dublin, Ireland. KBI International has been managing assets for institutional investors since 1980.
Newfleet Asset Management is a full-service, multi-capability fixed income firm that manages open-end funds, institutional accounts, structured products, and high-net-worth/private client assets. It manages assets in three distinctive strategies: Multi-Sector Fixed Income; Core Plus Fixed Income; and Specialty Fixed Income.
Rampart Investment Management, a Boston-based investment management affiliate of Virtus Investment Partners, manages client positions and portfolios using domestic and international index and equity options.
Zweig Advisers LLC is a registered investment advisor headquartered in New York that manages open- and closed-end funds in fundamental, small cap value, and tactical asset allocation investment styles. Its tactical asset allocation investment style, which seeks to participate in rising markets and limit losses during major declines, was modeled after the approach of Dr. Martin Zweig, author of Winning on Wall Street and a regular panelist on Louis Rukeyser's Wall Street.

Unaffiliated Subadvisers[edit]
Virtus supplements the investment capabilities of its affiliated managers through select unaffiliated subadvisers whose strategies are not available to retail mutual fund customers. These subadvisers include:[5]

Aberdeen Asset Management, Inc., is the wholly owned U.S. subsidiary of Aberdeen Asset Management PLC, a global investment management group formed in 1983 and headquartered in Scotland, U.K. With investment teams based in the markets or regions in which they invest, the firm manages assets for both institutions and private individuals from offices around the globe.
Horizon Asset Management LLC, a subsidiary of Horizon Kinetics LLC, is an independently owned and operated investment boutique formed by the 2011 merger of Horizon Asset Management, Inc. (founded in 1994) and Kinetics Asset Management, Inc. (founded in 1996) and its affiliates.
Sasco Capital, Inc., of Fairfield, CT, which specializes in contrarian/value equity investing using a disciplined approach that includes extensive fundamental analysis of business segments.
Thomas J. Herzfeld Advisors, Inc., is an investment management firm based in Miami, Florida, specializing in closed-end fund research, analysis, and investment since 1984.
Vontobel Asset Management, Inc. of New York, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Vontobel Holding AG of Switzerland that specializes in managing long-only global equity portfolios.

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator

History[edit]
Virtus Investment Partners, formerly known as Phoenix Investment Partners, Ltd., was formed on November 1, 1995 through a reverse merger with Duff & Phelps Investment Management Co., at the time the investment management affiliate of Duff & Phelps Corporation.
1995 - 2006[edit]
From 1995 to 2001, Virtus was a majority-owned indirect subsidiary of Phoenix Life Insurance Co. During this period, the company purchased a majority interest in several boutique investment management companies to establish its multi-manager business model. In addition to Duff & Phelps Investment Management, Virtus’ affiliated managers include Kayne Anderson Rudnick Investment Management, LLC, Newfleet Asset Management (formerly SCM Advisors, LLC, and previously Seneca Capital Management), and Zweig Advisers LLC, which was founded by legendary Wall Street investor Martin Zweig.
On January 11, 2001, a subsidiary of Phoenix acquired the outstanding shares of Phoenix Investment Partners not already owned, and the company became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Phoenix.
In May 2005, Phoenix Investment Partners acquired the remaining minority interest in SCM Advisors and in September of that year acquired the remaining minority interest in Kayne Anderson Rudnick, thereby increasing ownership of both companies to 100%. In May 2006, Phoenix Investment Partners acquired the rights to advise, distribute and administer the Insight Funds from Harris Investment Management, Inc.
2006 - 2009[edit]
In February 2008, Phoenix announced it would spin-off Phoenix Investment Partners as an independent asset management company through a pro-rata dividend of Phoenix Investment Partners common stock to Phoenix's shareholders.[1] On October 30, 2008, Harris Bankcorp Inc., a US subsidiary of Bank of Montreal announced it would acquire $45 million in convertible preferred stock, representing a 23 percent equity position in Virtus.[2]
Virtus became an independent publicly traded company on December 31, 2008 upon completion of its spin-off from Phoenix. The first day of trading of VRTS was January 2, 2009, and company officials rang the opening bell at NASDAQ Market Site on January 5, 2009.[3]
Business Overview[edit]
Retail products (available to individual investors) include open-end mutual funds, closed-end funds and separately managed accounts. The Virtus Mutual Funds family consists of approximately 45 open-end mutual funds that are distributed primarily through intermediaries, including national and regional broker-dealers, independent broker-dealers and independent financial advisory firms. Virtus' five closed-end funds, which are provided by two affiliated managers, encompass utility and tactical asset allocation strategies. The closed-end funds trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
Retail separately managed accounts comprise intermediary programs, sponsored and distributed by unaffiliated brokerage firms, and private client accounts, which are offered to the high-net-worth clients of the affiliated managers.
Virtus also manages institutional accounts for corporations, multi-employer retirement funds, foundations, endowments, and special purpose funds.[4]
Principal Subsidiaries[edit]
Virtus operates a multi-manager asset management business, comprising a number of individual affiliated managers, each having its own distinct investment style, autonomous investment process and brand, and the services of unaffiliated subadvisers. Affiliated managers include:[5]

Cliffwater Investments LLC, located in Los Angeles and NYC, provides alternative advisory services to institutional investors including endowments, foundations, retirement systems and financial institutions. In 2015, it reportedly advised clients with $800 million to exit the Carlyle Group's Claren Road hedge fund.[6]
Duff & Phelps Investment Management Co., headquartered in Chicago, manages open- and closed-end funds and institutional separate accounts investing in global utilities, infrastructure and REITs. Institutional services are offered to corporations, municipalities, retirement and benefit plans, endowments, foundations and others.
Euclid Advisors LLC is a New York-based investment management affiliate of Virtus Investment Partners that manages both domestic and international equity portfolios.
Kayne Anderson Rudnick Investment Management, LLC of Los Angeles offers a variety of actively managed equity and fixed-income strategies to individuals through open end mutual funds and separately managed accounts primarily to high-net-worth individuals. Institutional clients include endowments, foundations, corporations, public funds, and pension plans.
Kleinwort Benson Investors International, Ltd. is an investment affiliate of Kleinwort Benson Investors (KBI), an established institutional asset manager headquartered in Dublin, Ireland. KBI International has been managing assets for institutional investors since 1980.
Newfleet Asset Management is a full-service, multi-capability fixed income firm that manages open-end funds, institutional accounts, structured products, and high-net-worth/private client assets. It manages assets in three distinctive strategies: Multi-Sector Fixed Income; Core Plus Fixed Income; and Specialty Fixed Income.
Rampart Investment Management, a Boston-based investment management affiliate of Virtus Investment Partners, manages client positions and portfolios using domestic and international index and equity options.
Zweig Advisers LLC is a registered investment advisor headquartered in New York that manages open- and closed-end funds in fundamental, small cap value, and tactical asset allocation investment styles. Its tactical asset allocation investment style, which seeks to participate in rising markets and limit losses during major declines, was modeled after the approach of Dr. Martin Zweig, author of Winning on Wall Street and a regular panelist on Louis Rukeyser's Wall Street.

Unaffiliated Subadvisers[edit]
Virtus supplements the investment capabilities of its affiliated managers through select unaffiliated subadvisers whose strategies are not available to retail mutual fund customers. These subadvisers include:[5]

Aberdeen Asset Management, Inc., is the wholly owned U.S. subsidiary of Aberdeen Asset Management PLC, a global investment management group formed in 1983 and headquartered in Scotland, U.K. With investment teams based in the markets or regions in which they invest, the firm manages assets for both institutions and private individuals from offices around the globe.
Horizon Asset Management LLC, a subsidiary of Horizon Kinetics LLC, is an independently owned and operated investment boutique formed by the 2011 merger of Horizon Asset Management, Inc. (founded in 1994) and Kinetics Asset Management, Inc. (founded in 1996) and its affiliates.
Sasco Capital, Inc., of Fairfield, CT, which specializes in contrarian/value equity investing using a disciplined approach that includes extensive fundamental analysis of business segments.
Thomas J. Herzfeld Advisors, Inc., is an investment management firm based in Miami, Florida, specializing in closed-end fund research, analysis, and investment since 1984.

Phoenix Investment Partners Changes Names of Company, Funds To Initiate 'Virtus' Identity







Phoenix Investment Partners Changes Names of Company, Funds To Initiate 'Virtus' Identity


Launches www.VirtusInvestmentPartners.com
HARTFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Phoenix Investment Partners, a diversified asset management firm with $33.4 billion under management, will take another step toward its spin-off from The Phoenix Companies, Inc. (NYSE:PNX) by formally changing the name of its mutual fund family from PhoenixFunds to Virtus Mutual Funds on October 1, with an accompanying change in the name of its individual mutual funds.
Additionally, the firm itself will be renamed Virtus Investment Partners, Inc., also effective October 1, and the investment advisor to the funds will become Virtus Investment Advisers, Inc. All mutual fund ticker symbols will remain unchanged and the funds will be listed in stock tables under the Virtus name.
"Rebranding the company and our mutual funds with the Virtus name now gives us the opportunity to build our new identity prior to the spin-off," said George R. Aylward, president of Virtus Investment Partners. "The name change also marks the beginning of a new marketing approach, including a Web site with expanded functionality."
The firm had previously announced that it would change its name to Virtus - which is Latin and connotes the characteristics of integrity, quality and strength - in connection with the spin-off. Phoenix has said it expects the spin-off to be completed later this year. After the spin-off, Virtus Investment Partners will be an independent, publicly traded company.
The company's new Web site, www.VirtusInvestmentPartners.com, launches October 1 with additional features for individual investors and advisors.
"We built VirtusInvestmentPartners.com with the features that investors and their advisors are looking for in a Web site," said Steve Neamtz, head of retail distribution for Virtus. "In particular, we're providing advisors with many on-line tools - including commentary from our portfolio managers and investment experts - to help them better manage and build their business." The new Web site was developed by Acsys Interactive of Farmington, CT.
Customers or advisors who access the Phoenix Web site, www.phoenixwm.com or www.phoenixfunds.com will be redirected to the new Virtus site for information on investment management products and services.

Performance data quoted represents past results. Past performance is no guarantee of future results and current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, so your shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Please click on the fund name link for additional fund details and performance data current to the most recent month-end.
Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of any Virtus Mutual Fund before investing. The prospectus and summary prospectus contains this and other information about the fund.

Price & Performance:

Average annual total return is the annual compound return for the indicated period. It reflects the change in share price and the reinvestment of all dividends and capital gains. NAV returns do not include the effect of any applicable sales charges. POP and w/CDSC returns include the effect of maximum applicable sales charges.

Returns for periods of less than one year are cumulative total returns.

Net Asset Value (NAV) Per Share: The market worth of one share of a mutual fund. This figure is calculated by subtracting a fund's liabilities from total assets (securities, cash and any accrued earnings) and dividing by the number of shares outstanding.
Public Offering Price (POP): The price at which a fund's shares can be purchased. The offering price includes the current net asset value (NAV) per share plus any sales charges.
On each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading, the net asset value (NAV) is determined as of the close of trading (normally 4:00 pm Eastern Time). The NAV and POP for all funds are subject to change.


Class A shares:
POP (Public Offering Price) performance reflects the deduction of the maximum sales charge as follows:


All equity, asset allocation, target date, alternative and international/global: 5.75%

Virtus Newfleet CA Tax-Exempt Bond Fund, Virtus Newfleet Senior Floating Rate Fund, Virtus Newfleet Tax-Exempt Bond Fund, Virtus Seix Floating Rate High Income Fund, Virtus Seix Georgia Tax-Exempt Bond Fund, Virtus Seix High Grade Municipal Bond Fund, Virtus Seix Investment Grade Tax-Exempt Bond Fund, Virtus Seix North Carolina Tax-Exempt Bond Fund, Virtus Seix Virginia Intermediate Municipal Bond Fund: 2.75%
Virtus Newfleet Low Duration Income Fund, Virtus Newfleet Multi-Sector Short Term Bond Fund, Virtus Seix Short-Term Bond Fund, Virtus Seix Short-Term Municipal Bond Fund, Virtus Seix U.S. Mortgage Fund: 2.25%

For Equity Funds (except Sector Trend Fund), Asset Allocation, Target Date, Alternative and International/Global Mutual Funds a contingent deferred sales charge of 1% may be imposed on certain redemptions within 18 months on purchases on which a finder's fee has been paid.
For Fixed Income Funds and Virtus Sector Trend Fund, a contingent deferred sales charge of 0.50% may be imposed on certain redemptions within 18 months on purchases on which a finder's fee has been paid (within 12 months for Virtus Newfleet Multi-Sector Short Term Bond Fund, Virtus Newfleet Low Duration Income Fund, Virtus Seix U.S. Mortgage Fund, Virtus Seix Short-Term Bond Fund and Virtus Seix Short-Term Municipal Bond Fund).
Click here  for more information on Breakpoint (Volume) Discounts on Class A Share Purchases.
Class C shares:

Virtus Newfleet Multi-Sector Short Term Bond Fund Class C shares are subject to a 0% deduction for all shares redeemed.
Class C1 Shares:
The maximum contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) for Class C1 shares is 1%. However, w/CDSC performance for Class C1 shares reflects the deduction of: 1% for all shares redeemed within the first year; 0% for all shares redeemed at the end of year one and thereafter.
Class I Shares:
Class I Shares are offered primarily to clients of financial intermediaries that (i) charge such clients an ongoing fee for advisory, investment, consulting or similar services, or (ii) have entered into an agreement with the distributor to offer Class I shares through a no-load network or platform. Such clients may include pension and profit sharing plans, other employee benefit trusts, endowments, foundations and corporations. Class I shares are also offered to private and institutional clients of, or referred by, the adviser, the subadviser and their affiliates. If you are eligible to purchase and do purchase Class I Shares, you will pay no sales charge at any time. There are no distribution and service fees applicable to Class I Shares.
Class IS Shares:
Class IS Shares are offered to the following investors without a minimum initial investment: (i) qualified retirement plans, including, but not limited to, 401(k) plans, 457 plans, employer sponsored 403(b) plans, defined benefit plans and other accounts or plans whereby Class IS Shares are held on the books of a fund through plan level or omnibus accounts; (ii) banks and trust companies; (iii) insurance companies; (iv) registered investment companies; and (v) non-qualified deferred compensation plans. Other institutional investors may be permitted to purchase Class IS Shares subject to management’s determination of eligibility and may be subject to a $2,500,000 minimum initial investment requirement. If you are eligible to purchase and do purchase Class IS Shares, you will pay no sales charge at any time. There are no distribution and service fees applicable to Class IS Shares.
Class R Shares:
Class R Shares are designed to be sold only through various third-party intermediaries that offer employer-sponsored defined contribution retirement plans and other retirement plan platforms, including brokers, dealers, banks, insurance companies, retirement plan record-keepers and others. Class R Shares require an agreement with the funds prior to investment. If you are eligible to purchase and do purchase Class R Shares, you will pay no sales charge at any time. Class R Shares have higher distribution and service fees (0.50%) and pay lower dividends than Class A Shares.
Class R6 Shares:
For Class R6 Shares, there is no minimum initial investment and there is no minimum for additional purchases. R6 Shares are available only to certain employer-sponsored retirement plans, including Section 401(k), 403(b) and 457, profit-sharing, money purchase pension and defined benefit plans and non-qualified deferred compensation plans, in each case provided that plan level or omnibus accounts are held on the books of the fund. If you are participating in an employer sponsored retirement plan, such as a 401(k) plan, profit-sharing plan, defined benefit plan or other employer-directed plan, your company will provide you with the information you need to open an account and buy Class R6 Shares.
Morningstar Disclosures:The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

TD Ameritrade


In the process of searching for a well-rounded broker, finding the right mix is no easy task. Trade costs, trade platforms, tools, research, and customer service all are important to investors.
After using a TD Ameritrade account, you cannot help but love the overall experience. The broker charges $6.95 per trade, almost twice that of some of the cheaper discount brokers. However, the value and quality delivered is so superior it easily justifies the higher price tag.
Commissions & Fees

While having access to 24/7 customer support, advanced trade platforms, ample research, real-time streaming quotes site wide and more is great; unfortunately, it is expensive. TD Ameritrade charges a flat rate of $6.95 per trade, with options costing $6.95, plus $.75 per contract.
Compared to other full-service brokers, TD Ameritrade is on par with ETRADE, but is more expensive than the rest, including Charles Schwab, Fidelity, and Scottrade. In fact, considering margin costs, TD Ameritrade is the most expensive broker out of the 16 included in our 2017 Review.

One bright spot is that TD Ameritrade offers 101 commission-free ETFs (Charles Schwab offers the most, with 229). The only caveat is that, with TD Ameritrade, any commission-free ETF that is sold within 30 days of purchase is subject to a short-term trading fee of $19.99.
UPDATE 03/06/17 – TD Ameritrade reduced its equity commissions. Equity trades, including stocks and ETFs, have been lowered to $6.95 per trade (previously $9.99). Since these new rates were announced after the 2017 Review was published, they are not incorporated into TD Ameritrade's star rating for this category. 
Customer Service

If having access to 24/7 customer support by phone and email is important to you, then TD Ameritrade has you covered. The broker posted fantastic results for phone and email during testing for our 2017 Review, finishing No. 1 and No. 3, respectively.
When it comes to support, the bottom line is that for a full-service broker, great customer service is expected, and TD Ameritrade delivers, regardless of the communication avenue.
During our phone tests, our average wait time was less than two minutes. The reps were very well trained. Every test call we made to TD Ameritrade, regardless of the day or time, was answered by a customer service agent who identified him/herself, provided a pleasant introduction, and always left us with a warm closing note (e.g., “Have a great day”). All our questions were always answered, so it was not surprising to see TD Ameritrade end up No. 1 for phone customer service out of 16 brokers.
Email testing was also a great experience. All our emails were returned within 12 hours, on average. In fact, in one test, TD Ameritrade responded to our multi-question support inquiry in a blazingly fast 11 minutes.  Customer service agents were clearly well trained, as email templates were consistent and thorough. Of all our eight email tests, two resulted in a “good” overall score, with the rest being “great.” TD Ameritrade finished third for email.
Live chat support is also offered, but only for clients seeking platform support while using thinkorswim, or for potential clients who navigate around the site long enough to trigger a live chat popup. Knowing how the web is evolving and how millennials prefer to communicate, I would like to see TD Ameritrade offer live chat support for all clients and potential clients. TD Ameritrade finished third for live chat.
When it comes to support, the bottom line is that for a full-service broker, great customer service is expected, and TD Ameritrade delivers, regardless of the communication avenue. TD Ameritrade finished first overall for Customer Service in our 2017 Review.
Research

Like its biggest competitors, Fidelity, Charles Schwab, and ETRADE, TD Ameritrade has a substantial research offering. 
TD AmeritradeFidelity E*TRADEMerrill EdgeCharles SchwabEquity Research - Social Yes  Yes  Yes  No  Yes Equity Research - Metric Comparisons Yes  Yes  No  Yes  Yes Equity Research - Reports712438ETF Research - Reports Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes Mutual Fund Research - Reports Yes  No  Yes  Yes  Yes 
When I pulled up a quote for Apple (AAPL), I found a clean spread of relevant data, including seven different third-party research reports to choose from and read, which is the third highest number in the industry (Fidelity offers 12). The featured research report provider is ResearchTeam, which combines five research providers into one.

Providing clients quality research is an extremely competitive challenge. Of all the functionality provided on the website, I found TD Ameritrade had two outstanding functions: the Social Signals tab and the Peer Comparison tab. Powered by LikeFolio, Social Signals displays both a real-time streaming feed of algorithmically filtered brand-relevant tweets – which I found much better than seeing a list of recent StockTwits tweets – and a summary chart of the most-tweeted brands. Naturally, Social Signals is best used for consumer-focused brands such as Apple (AAPL) or Nike (NKE). In thinkorswim (covered further down) the data can be charted for deeper analysis.

On the Peer Comparison tab, investors find a clean customizable chart showing the stock’s performance against its closest competitors followed by a comparison table of relevant metrics. Included competitors can also be shown or hidden. Clean peer comparisons are not easy to do, which is where TD Ameritrade stands out. Metrics included in the table are relevant and pruned to the most important. Social Signals data is also tied in; however, I found this data did not appear each time I loaded the page, and data was missing for certain securities. Data was marked as “New” during my testing, so I imagine the data will be worked out in time.

Social Signals and peer comparisons aside, I also enjoyed the on-site charting functionality. With 34 different technical indicators (volume, MACD, RSI, etc.) and easy-to-read, big charts, the experience is as clean as you will find anywhere. I could even pop out the chart into its own window to expand it across my 24-inch monitor. The only downside to the experience is the lack of panning flexibility on the chart itself. Charting is driven by provider SunGard, and my recommendation to TD Ameritrade would be to check out ChartIQ instead.

For the price customers pay per trade, excellent research should be expected. When all 51 variables for Research are considered, TD Ameritrade lacks only two features: displaying the total number of holdings for ETFs, and a country allocation chart for Mutual Funds. Impressive, to say the least. TD Ameritrade finished third behind Fidelity and Charles Schwab for Research in 2017. 
Ease of Use

Making research a seamless experience is just one part of TD Ameritrade’s efforts to make its website easy to use. The site-wide quote bar streams real-time quotes – functionality that Charles Schwab, ETRADE, and Fidelity do not offer – and includes SnapTicket, a quick trade extension that allows stock and option orders to be placed from any page on the site.

TD Ameritrade also offers a fully customizable sidebar, My Dock, which allows clients to display up to 13 different modules. Modules can be resorted or placed into separate columns, allowing clients with wide-screen monitors to maximize their workflow. While clean and easy to use, I found myself leaving the sidebar collapsed and hidden away. Despite having a 24-inch monitor capable of maximizing the experience, I found it to be a distraction.

I had to dig deep to find flaws in TD Ameritrade’s client experience.
I had to dig deep to find flaws in TD Ameritrade’s client experience. After many hours of testing and comparing, I found two disappointing items that stood out: The My Account Overview experience and adding additional accounts. The default My Account page is data rich but poorly laid out and I found it to be a poor launching pad into my usual workflow. Enabling My Dock in the sidebar did little to patch the user experience. Charles Schwab Trade Source and Fidelity’s new fully responsive Accounts experience are both superior; I know TD Ameritrade can do better.

For managing multiple accounts, I found that each new account I created required a completely new username and password. Once established and logged in, I could then link the new account to my primary user ID. This is a subtle difference from other brokers where you can simply create and add a new brokerage account to your same ID with no trouble. Minor? Yes. However, for clients with multiple accounts, it can be a confusing experience first time through.
Pickiness aside, TD Ameritrade’s platforms (discussed next) have both casual and active traders covered and the same two-pronged approach is applied to mobile, where two separate apps are offered. No doubt, TD Ameritrade shines in the category Ease of Use.
Platforms & Tools

While there are many attractive features in TD Ameritrade, the broker's two platforms are its bread and butter. The flagship platform, thinkorswim, used to be a standalone broker until TD Ameritrade acquired it in 2009.
TD AmeritradeFidelity E*TRADEMerrill EdgeCharles SchwabDesktop Platform (Windows) Yes  Yes  Yes  No  Yes Charting - Indicators / Studies3701661187340Charting - Drawing Tools2222242215Option Chains - Total Columns3326396234Watch Lists - Total Fields4018013021694
Thinkorswim is designed for advanced traders who want complete flexibility and depth. Furthermore, it can be used by any client with no minimums or specific trade criteria required for access. This is an important advantage over both Fidelity Active Trader Pro and ETRADE Pro, which both require minimums for access.

Run as a desktop application, thinkorswim is so advanced it is rivaled only by TradeStation. A few clicks of the mouse will have dozens of charts streaming real-time data, and even the pickiest trader will be satisfied with the 300+ technical studies available for each chart (highest in the industry), not to mention that each study can be customized thereafter.

Using thinkScript, thinkorswim’s proprietary coding language, traders can even create their own indicators. This is most like TradeStation’s EasyLanguage, which is the only other broker to offer such functionality.
It’s a dazzling array of choices that will set your mind spinning – in a good way.
TD Ameritrade's thinkorswim is also home to a slew of advanced tools. Whether it be company profiling, advanced earnings analysis, plotting FRED data, charting social sentiment, backtesting and replaying historical markets tick by tick, viewing economic and corporate calendars, creating and conducting real-time stock scans, sharing charts and workspace layouts, or performing advanced options analysis, the rabbit hole goes as far as any trader's imagination will take them. It’s a dazzling array of choices that will set your mind spinning – in a good way.

Focusing on the two most recent innovations, adding Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) and the new earnings analysis tool, investors can begin to appreciate the endless brain hub stationed at thinkorswim’s Chicago office. Starting with FRED, a publicly accessible US Government database of over 400,000 economic data points; think GDP, CPI, treasury rates, median household income, etc. FRED data is used by institutional investors, hedge funds, and other sophisticated trading operations. In its never-ending quest to level the playing field, the thinkorswim team decided to download all the data, process it, build a custom interface to graph it, and brought it to all TD Ameritrade clients free.

Make no mistake, what thinkorswim has accomplished is truly mind blowing. The only other way to view this data as seamlessly as thinkorswim is to pay up for a Bloomberg terminal.
Make no mistake, what thinkorswim has accomplished is truly mind blowing. The only other way to view this data as seamlessly as thinkorswim is to pay up for a Bloomberg terminal. Once a data set is loaded, it can be tweaked and customized, whichever way the user desires. For sophisticated investors, FRED data is extremely useful in assessing the overall health of the market or specific sectors, which is why institutions pay up to access it via Bloomberg. Thanks to thinkorswim, now any TD Ameritrade client can conduct the same analysis.
Alongside FRED analysis, thinkorswim also launched its new tool for conducting earnings analysis. In my personal trading career, I have analyzed thousands of earnings releases. Heading into an earnings event, the toughest and most time-consuming part is researching historical price action and volatility surrounding previous events, understanding how the earnings were estimated in the eyes of Wall Street, then gauging the significance of any beat or miss. Earnings analysis with thinkorswim does all of this in one clean interface.

Starting with the top row, five days of price action are plotted before and after each earnings release. Next, volatility is plotted over the same time span followed by an At The Money (ATM) straddle (extremely insightful data for options traders seeking patterns and outliers in options market behavior). Finally, using data from Wall Street analysts and crowd-sourced ratings from Estimize, EPS estimate ranges alongside actual results are clearly plotted, providing an efficient way of assessing the company’s results. The whole experience together brings clarity with much less noise. It’s magic.
Both FRED data and the new earnings analysis experience launched in 2016 are two examples of many where TD Ameritrade continues to innovate and push the envelope of what is available for traders.
Both FRED data and the new earnings analysis experience launched in 2016 are two examples of many where TD Ameritrade continues to innovate and push the envelope of what is available for traders. For casual and active traders, earnings analysis with thinkorswim is truly a work of art and the best new trader tool of 2017 in my books.
One of my gripes with thinkorswim back in 2013 and 2014 was the platform’s reliability during volatile markets. On highly volatile and active trading days when there would be a large influx of clients using the system, thinkorswim would lag noticeably – sometimes for lengthy periods. Growing pains are no fun, and while it took longer than clients had hoped for, thinkorswim addressed them all. Today, thanks to the thinkorswim reskin in 2015, alongside a slew of infrastructure updates in both 2015 and 2016, thinkorswim hums along with no trouble at all. In 2017, active traders should be confident relying on thinkorswim to provide a seamless experience, regardless of the market environment.
Platform thinkorswim aside, TD Ameritrade also has a web-based platform, Trade Architect, which is designed with more casual investors in mind. The tools and functionality are purposely kept simple, and the design is clean with visual flare. Everything ran smoothly in my Chrome browser, bug-free, and I quickly became a fan of the platform-wide streaming real-time quotes.

From testing every broker, the streaming watch list functionality Trade Architect offers is my favorite. It isn't just the superb layout, but also the flexibility, ease of use, and depth of data available. The layout is completely customizable, and it’s great having access to visual data such as quote trends, trade trends, 52-week range, and a strength meter.

The bottom line is simple: when it comes to Platforms & Tools in 2017, for the sixth year in a row, TD Ameritrade is on top.
Mobile Trading

With mobile trading, TD Ameritrade took a different approach by offering not one, but two smartphone apps: TD Ameritrade Mobile and TD Ameritrade Mobile Trader. TD Ameritrade Mobile is designed for new and casual investors, while TD Ameritrade Mobile Trader is designed for the feature-hungry active trader.
Having two separate apps has its noticeable pros and cons.
Having two separate apps has its noticeable pros and cons. On the pros side, the apps can hone in on their individual target users and provide a specific experience. On the cons side, it is easy to confuse the two apps initially and not know which one is right for you. Also, some of the functionality that is built for one could really be beneficial on the other, for example basic price alerts, so it can be tricky at times to find the right home as a client.

Looking at specific functionality, TD Ameritrade Mobile Trader is “where the magic happens,” so to speak. Advanced charting, with a staggering 328 different technical studies, is available alongside a full array of order options. An extremely smooth interface for advanced equities trades as well as a seamless experience for complex options trades are compelling features. In my view, this combination is the best in the industry.

In 2015, TD Ameritrade released in-app chat support and mobile desktop linking, both for the Mobile Trader app. In-app chat support allows users to use their mobile devices and chat with a customer service agent for live help, which includes screen sharing. Linking enables users to link the thinkorswim desktop platform to the Mobile Trader app. Click on the quotes tab, select a color next to the search bar that matches a chart or similar in thinkorswim, then pull up any quote, and thinkorswim will follow suite.
In 2016, the updates were across the board. With TD Ameritrade Mobile, highlights included Touch ID login alongside customized positions and watch list views, and the addition of Social Signals analysis. A Windows 10 app was also launched. For Mobile Trader, access to saved orders was added with deeper linking to thinkorswim desktop.

It would be great to see screening and advanced alerts added to TD Ameritrade’s Mobile Trader in 2017. In TD Ameritrade Mobile, it would also be nice to be able to chart portfolio performance against the overall market and be able to set basic price alerts.
When all 52 variables are factored in for the Mobile Trading category, TD Ameritrade came away with 95% of possible points in our 2017 Review, edging out long-time industry leader E*TRADE, and taking first place overall.

Other Notes
Regarding TD Ameritrade’s educational offering, the company was again the only broker to ace the category in our 2017 Review and receive a perfect five-star rating. Over 200 videos are available, including endless education webinars and articles through thinkMoney magazine and The Ticker Tape. Content is organized into courses with quizzes and the chance to earn points alongside badges to encourage further learning.

TD Ameritrade also extends education into colleges across the United States with its annual thinkorswim Challenge. October 2016 was the third challenge, in which 726 teams across 49 states competed.
Finally yet importantly, TD Ameritrade entered the robo advisor space in 2016 with the launch of TD Ameritrade Essential Portfolios. Read our full review of TD Ameritrade Essential Portfolios.
Final Thoughts
TD Ameritrade is one of those companies that just gets it. They understand their clients and the value of a high-quality user experience, and they know what it takes to stay ahead of the competition.
Any investor, new or seasoned, will find TD Ameritrade a great fit for their needs. The main gripe with the broker is cost, but what you pay for is what you get, and the quality delivered by TD Ameritrade is, undoubtedly worth the extra few dollars per trade.
For online investing and trading in 2017, TD Ameritrade ranks #1 Overall.
Methodology
For our 2017 Stock Broker Review we assessed, rated, and ranked sixteen different online brokers over a period of six months. In total, we conducted 349 customer service tests, collected 5,277 data points, and produced over 40,000 words of research. How we test.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.

Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
