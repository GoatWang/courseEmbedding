Early life and education[edit]
Born in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, he is the son of a Jewish traveling salesman and Presbyterian housewife from Kansas.[3] Schwartz is a 1972 graduate of Duke University.[4] There he pitched on the baseball team as a scholarship athlete, making the ACC academic honor roll three times.[5][6] He was drafted as a pitcher by the Cincinnati Reds but never reported due to an injury.[4]
Career[edit]
Schwartz joined Bear Stearns in 1976 first working in Dallas and then in 1979, he was appointed the director of research and investment in New York City.[4] In 1985, he became executive vice president and head of Bear Stearns' Investment Banking Division.[1][7] He became Co-President and Co-COO on June 25, 2001. Schwartz became sole President and COO in August 2007 after Warren Spector (the original heir-apparent to Chairman and CEO James Cayne) was forced to resign in the wake of the collapse of two hedge funds, which foreshadowed the upcoming subprime mortgage crisis and financial meltdown.[8] Schwartz became CEO in January 2008 after Jimmy Cayne was pressured to step down.
When Schwartz became CEO, Bear Stearns stock traded around $75 per share, however the share price continued to drop as the financial crisis worsened over 2007-08.[9] Within a week of its near collapse and merger with JPMorgan Chase on March 16, 2008, the shares were trading at $5.33 per share. After the deal with JPMorgan was announced, the fire sale price of the stock prompted a reportedly angry confrontation between Schwartz and senior trader Alan Mintz in the company gym.[10][11] Schwartz stayed on with JPMorgan for a short while to manage the transition but declined a permanent senior position with the firm. Schwartz also turned down offers from rival investment banks Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.[9]
In June 2009, Schwartz became executive chairman of Guggenheim Partners, an investment banking firm based in Chicago and New York.[12] According to Schwartz, the new job meant "fate has dealt [him] an opportunity to start from scratch."[12] Schwartz is also the chairman of the Board of Visitors at the Fuqua School of Business at Duke and is a trustee on the Duke University Board of Trustees.[13]
Personal life[edit]
Schwartz resides in Greenwich, Connecticut, with his wife, Nancy Seaman, chairman of Houlihan Lawrence Realty Corporation.[14] They have five children.[7]

Title
Products Liability Reform: A Theoretical Synthesis



Authors
Alan Schwartz, Yale Law SchoolFollow



Document Type
Article



Comments
"Products Liability Reform: A Theoretical Synthesis," 97 Yale L. Journal 353 (1988)



Abstract
The debate among practicing lawyers and legislators about products liability reform has failed to consider much of the recent scholarship in the law and economics of contracts and torts. In light of these literatures, some seriously discussed reform proposals, such as a renewed commitment to the "fault principle," seem unhelpful; other apparently promising ideas do not appear on policymakers' agendas. This Article proposes solutions to products liability problems that integrate and apply the insights of the contracts and torts theorists. It evaluates both current law and these solutions under the dominant norm in the contracts literature: consumer sovereignty. This norm holds that the law should reflect the preferences of competent, informed consumers regarding risk allocation.

               The FRR has become and will continue to be a one-stop shop for all things LCA. We are the only Foundation completely dedicated to moving research along in ways that would not otherwise happen. We work side by side cooperatively with other foundations dedicated to our same mission, pooling resources to fund research that would not otherwise be funded. We were the first group to bring scientists together to work cooperatively and openly discuss research possibilities for LCA 15 years ago. We support families affected by LCA by offering biannual conferences where families network with other families and professionals. We support families with communication through our Facebook page, our FRR Newletter and making ourselves available whenever possible. At FRR, we take pride in knowing LCA inside and out, moving research forward and keeping families informed. Julianne Lyons, our new events director, is now a regular visitor to my office. She will accumulate information from me and others to make sure we are letting you all know what is happening promptly. We look forward to a year filled with health, advancement and a lot of communication from the FRR.
