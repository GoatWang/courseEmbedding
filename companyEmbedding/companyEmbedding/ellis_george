Early life[edit]
Johnson was born in Richton, Mississippi, in a three-room sharecropper's shack.[1] When he was two, he moved to Chicago with his mother, Priscilla, after his parents had separated. At the age of eight, while attending Doolittle Elementary School, Johnson also started work as a shoe shine boy. He later attended Wendell Phillips High School but dropped out to work full-time jobs.[2] During the day he was a bus boy and in the evenings he set pins at a local bowling alley.[3] In 1944, he took a job working for Samuel B. Fuller, who owned a cosmetics firm, as a production chemist.
Entrepreneurship[edit]
In 1954, at the encouragement of co-worker, Johnson left the Fuller company and founded Johnson Products with his wife Joan,[4] focusing on the African American male hair care market. Johnson borrowed $250 from a bank and another $250 from a friend to finance the venture.[1] The company’s first product was Ultra Wave, a hair relaxer for men. In 1957, Ultra Sheen, a revolutionary hair straightener that could easily be used in the home, was introduced for women.
During the next quarter century, more product lines were introduced like Afro Sheen.[1] Afro-Sheen, one of Johnson's best-known products, was released in the late 1960s, at a time when the "Afro" became a popular hairstyle for African Americans.
Over the next few decades, Johnson Products continued to grow, focusing its efforts on not only its products line but on training cosmetologists on the proper usage as well. In 1964, Johnson founded Independence Bank, and during the 1970s he became the exclusive sponsor behind the nationally syndicated dance show Soul Train.
In 1971, Johnson Products became the first African American-owned company to be listed on the American Stock Exchange.[1]That same year, Johnson became the first African American to serve on the board of directors of Commonwealth Edison.
Awards and honors[edit]
George E. Johnson, Sr. received the Horatio Alger Award in 1981[5] and the Babson Medal in 1983[6]
He received an honorary Doctor of Commercial Science degree from College of the Holy Cross in 1975 and an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Babson College in 1976[7]
In popular culture[edit]
A short documentary on George E. Johnson, Sr. and the Johnson Products Company was produced by The Czar of Black Hollywood director Bayer Mack and released by Block Starz Music Television as part of its Profiles of African-American Success video series. [8][9]

Other topics covered include problem-solving techniques, development, and continuous improvement of processes required in product development, risk recognition and management, and proper communication with mangers and other stakeholders. 
Finally, project management techniques used in product development are presented, including the critical path method, scrum and XP, and Kanban/lean project development, along with the strengths and weaknesses of each.

Reviews


Everyone recognizes the importance of sustainable innovation for any growing business.  Less well understood is the vital role outstanding project management plays in innovative businesses.  Our approach to project management at Danaher evolved greatly over the last two decades and played no small part in our success.  George Ellis nicely captures the "state of the art" and demonstrates how process alone is not enough – true "Total Leadership" in project management differentiates the winners from the runners-up.  If you want to win the innovation game, read his book.
-Lawrence Culp, Jr., Former CEO, Danaher Corporation
Tools for project management have expanded over the years, most recently agile methods as applied to software development, and lean methods adopted from manufacturing; earlier additions include critical-chain and phase-gate methodologies. Many fine books cover each of these, but none covers them all. Ellis does, as well as traditional waterfall/critical path methods. Especially valuable is Ellis’ comparison of the methods, their relative strengths and weaknesses, where each applies and doesn’t apply. Along the way he reminds us of the importance of leadership and interpersonal skills in project management by way of interesting side comments and bits of advice for dealing with technical specialists, customers, and bosses. All of this separates Ellis’ book from and puts it above the rest in project management. 
-John Nicholas, Professor, Quinlan School of Business, Loyola University Chicago
Based on his many years of practical experience, George Ellis tackles an application area of project management that is rarely covered. This book is a very down-to-earth and thorough exposition, rather than being theoretical and academic. It is well illustrated with lists, tables, charts and explanatory diagrams. As well as techniques such as critical path management, it delves into Phase-gate management, Agile project management, "Lean Product Development", Risk and "Patents" issues, all in the context of product development. Ellis also emphasizes the importance of looking upon project management as a leadership responsibility rather than just an administrative position. This book is a valuable addition to any Product Development Manager's reference library. 
-R. Max Wideman, FPMI, Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada
The section on patent law is at the right level of detail to help project managers get up to speed. Clear, step-by-step explanations take the mystery out of reading a patent and searching for prior art. The reader will learn how to avoid serious pitfalls, and will acquire the understanding necessary to discuss patent issues with the development team. The patent material alone makes Geroge Ellis’s Project Management in Product Development an excellent investment. 
-Alan L. Durham, Judge Robert S. Vance Professor of Law, University of Alabama School of Law and Author of Patent Law Essentials: A Concise Guide

                 This sofa set comes with deep seats and a high back for ultimate comfort. The unique cross stitching along the front corners showcases the hand-crafted quality of this classic design. The leather is dyed with aniline dyes and no surface pigmentation. This process creates shade variations and adds to the character of the aged look. The oil pull-up effect re-creates an 'old world' finish, which lightens under stress and darkens with natural body oils and daily use. All these characteristics re-affirm the purchase of an authentic leather product and make each product unique in appearance. This set includes a sofa, loveseat and chair. Only selected bovine hides are used for pull-up leather with rustic and bushveld showing the greater degree of natural markings. It is a natural product with unique characteristics. Thorns, tick - bites and scratches leave their traces on a hide and are natural marks only manufactured by nature. The leather is dyed to color with aniline dyes with no surface pigmentation. Shade variations are normal and add to the character of the aged look. The oil pull-up effect recreates an old world' finish, which lightens under stress and darkens with body oils and perspiration. These phenomena apply more to aggressive than to mild pull-up. All these characteristics re-affirm the purchase of an authentic leather product and make each product unique in appearance.
