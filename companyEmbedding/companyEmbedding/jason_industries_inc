News and Press

JASON INDUSTRIES, INC. (FORMERLY QUINPARIO ACQUISITION CORP.) ANNOUNCES  SATISFACTION OF BUSINESS COMBINATION CONDITION TO WARRANT TENDER OFFER

June 30, 2014
MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN /Globe Newswire/ - Jason Industries, Inc., formerly known as Quinpario Acquisition Corp. (Nasdaq: QPAC, QPACU, QPACW) (the “Company”), today announced that the business combination condition (as described below) to its previously announced warrant tender offer has been satisfied. The warrant tender offer is scheduled to expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on July 7, 2014, unless extended or terminated.
The warrant tender offer is being made in connection with the Company’s previously announced acquisition of Jason Incorporated (“Jason”). It is a condition to the warrant tender offer, among other things, that (i) the purchase agreement providing for the acquisition of Jason has not been terminated, (ii) redemptions by the Company’s stockholders would not cause the Company to maintain less than $115.0 million in its trust account at closing of the Business Combination and (iii) the business combination with Jason is consummated prior to the expiration of the warrant tender offer. These conditions are collectively referred to as the “business combination condition.”
On June 30, 2014, the Company consummated the business combination with Jason. At the consummation of the business combination, after accounting for redemptions by the Company’s stockholders, approximately $151.0 million remained in the Company’s trust account. Accordingly, as of June 30, 2014, the business combination condition has been satisfied.
Immediately after the consummating the business combination, the Company changed its name to “Jason Industries, Inc.” Effective Tuesday, July 1, 2014, the Company’s common stock ticker symbol will be “JASN” and the ticker symbol for the Company’s warrants will be “JASNW.”
All of the terms and conditions set forth in the offer to purchase, the related letter of transmittal and the other offer materials for the warrant tender offer, in each case as amended (collectively, the “Offer Documents”), remain unchanged.
The Company has offered to purchase up to 9,200,000 of its outstanding warrants at a purchase price of $1.00 per warrant in the warrant tender offer. If more than 9,200,000 warrants are duly tendered and not properly withdrawn, the Company will purchase warrants from tendering warrant holders on a pro rata basis (disregarding fractions), in accordance with the number of warrants duly tendered by or on behalf of each warrant holder (and not so withdrawn). Tenders of the Company’s warrants must be made prior to the expiration of the warrant tender offer and may be withdrawn at any time prior to the expiration of the warrant tender offer, in accordance with the procedures described in the Offer Documents. In addition to the business combination condition, the warrant tender offer is subject to certain other conditions, as more fully described in the Offer Documents. The warrant tender offer is not conditioned on any financing or any minimum number of warrants being tendered.
None of Quinpario Partners I, LLC, the Company’s sponsor, nor the Company’s prior or current directors and executive officers will tender their warrants pursuant to the warrant tender offer.
The Company has 18,400,000 outstanding warrants. The warrants are currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. On June 27, 2014, the last reported trading price of the Company’s warrants was $1.39 per warrant.
Morrow & Co., LLC is acting as the information agent for the warrant tender offer, and the depositary for the warrant tender offer is Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company. For questions and information, please call the information agent toll free at (800) 662-5200 (banks and brokers call collect at (203) 658-9400).
This press release is neither an offer to purchase nor a solicitation of an offer to sell any Company warrants. The Offer Documents are included as exhibits to the Schedule TO originally filed by the Company with the SEC on May 6, 2014, as amended on June 4, 2014, June 5, 2014 and June 18, 2014. Offers to purchase and solicitations of offers to sell will be made solely pursuant to the Offer Documents, as they may be further amended or supplemented. The Offer Documents, as they may be further amended or supplemented, should be read carefully and considered before any decision is made with respect to the warrant tender offer because they contain important information about the warrant tender offer. These materials have been distributed free of charge to all Company warrant holders. In addition, these materials (and all other materials filed by the Company with the SEC) are available at no charge from the SEC through its website at www.sec.gov. Warrant holders may also obtain free copies of the Offer Documents filed by the Company with the SEC by directing a request to the information agent at Morrow & Co., LLC, 470 West Avenue, 3rd Floor, Stamford, CT 06902, quinpario.info@morrowco.com.

Power Transmission Belts
From synchronous to vee multi-rib to flat to banded v-belts, we offer the nation's largest and most complete stock of power transmission belts for every need, whether standard or metric. We also maintain an extensive stock of belt sleeves to meet customized specifications, including one-piece banded v-belts to make up any number of ribs. Non-stock widths of synchronous and/or multi-rib flat belts are cut and shipped the same day - an exclusive Jason Industrial Inc. service. Our Accu-Link adjustable v-belt is the ideal temporary replacement belt to keep your critical drives running. We stock many specialty belts and a full line of lawn & garden belts, along with a complete line of v-belt sheaves, synchronous pulleys and bushings.







View additional information on Power Transmission Belts in our interactive catalog.View additional information on Power Transmission Belts in our brochure.

Neoprene Synchronous
HTB timing belts are oil, heat, and abrasion-resistant. The standard trapezoidal tooth timing belt design performs poorly in high torque applications and high power drives at lower speeds. To overcome this disadvantage the High Torque Belt (HTB) was developed using a more efficient tooth profile.
Stock timing belts have fiberglass tension members, neoprene body with nylon covered teeth, all bonded together for maximum strength. For non-stock widths, Jason cuts specified widths from our large supply of timing belt sleeves on special order. Mini-pitch MXL (.080-inch pitch) timing belts are also available.

Open-end belting Neoprene, fiberglass reinforced for positioning, metering, and open-close applications. Open end timing belting is specified by an "L" for long length, the belt pitch letters and the width code. i.e. L8M-20 Length is specified in feet. Spliced belts available on special order. Special constructions and backings also available.
Dual timing belts. Neoprene fiberglass reinforced, Dual belts afford power transmission from either side of the belt and are often used in reversing and serpentine applications. They are specified the same way as timing belts except with a "D" prefix. For example: D240H100. Special widths are cut to order from our sleeve stock for fast delivery.
Highlights:





Higher torque transmission at low speeds

PLATINUM – THE NEXT GENERATION SYNCHRONOUS BELT - 8M, 14M Curvlinear RPC Tooth Profile
PLATINUM is an ultra-high performance, rubber-based synchronous belt. "Dual Core" Hybrid Tensile Cord Technology, combined with a nitrile-based HNBR compound body, results in a product capable of handling the most demanding high-power, high-torque drives. Designed to replace drives using roller chains and gears, and as an alternative to Poly Chain®, PLATINUM permits a high-power capacity drive with excellent dimensional stability and a fully-functional interchange with all of the most common deep pulley tooth profile systems currently in use. With PLATINUM, Jason/Megadyne introduces a revolutionary new "RPC" belt tooth profile. An evolution of the industry standard RPP, the new "RPC" belt tooth profile is fully interchangeable with HTD®, RPP® and Poly Chain® pulley tooth profiles. The RPC belt tooth profile allows existing drive systems (RPP®, HTD®, PCGT® and PowerGrip® GT® 2) to be upgraded without replacing the pulleys. PLATINUM is a true "drop-in" replacement on all commonly used pulley profilesView additional information on PLATINUM – THE NEXT GENERATION SYNCHRONOUS BELT - 8M, 14M Curvlinear RPC Tooth Profile in our brochure.

RPP GOLD SYNCHRONOUS BELTS - 8M, 14M Curvlinear Tooth Profile
The Isoran® RPP Gold is the result of Jason/Megadyne's continued focus on developing high-performance drive systems to obtain new application opportunities against alternative systems such as gears and chain. Our systems take advantage of belt features such as lower weight, quieter running and reduced maintenance costs. The Isoran® RPP Gold belt system can be used in a virtually limitless range of industrial applications where a high-torque synchronous drive is required.View additional information on RPP GOLD SYNCHRONOUS BELTS - 8M, 14M Curvlinear Tooth Profile in our brochure.

RPP SILVER SYNCHRONOUS BELTS - 8M, 14M Curvlinear Tooth Profile
The Isoran® RPP Silver Synchronous Belt is constructed with the highest quality materials. The bonded strength of all components guarantees superior torque capacity. The new materials join forces to achieve the highest standard of quality and performance in the industry.View additional information on RRPP SILVER SYNCHRONOUS BELTS - 8M, 14M Curvlinear Tooth Profile in our brochure.

Tiger ® High Horsepower
Jason
   developed the Tiger Belt to extend the synchronous belt application
   range. Special aramid reinforced compounds along with improved tooth
   facing and tensile members provide the muscle for the increased
   horsepower ratings of the Tiger High Horsepower Synchronous Belt - up to
   three times that of our standard HTB belts! Tiger run in HTB or RPP
   pulleys. Select an HTB/HTD width for longer life in your current
   pulleys* or a RPP Panther or QT Powerchain width for high horsepower
   applications. Jason performance testing has shown the Tiger Belt to
   outlast competitive premium synchronous belt products.
*Always verify HP ratings for pulleys and bushings before applying increased loads.View additional information on Tiger ® High Horsepower in our interactive catalog.

	We encourage you to use this method of recording your Jason purchase. It assures you of immediate warranty coverage. To be eligible for Jason’s warranty coverage, your product must be registered. As an alternative to submitting information via the internet, you may submit the warranty registration by mail.
To begin the process you will need your Jason product serial number. It is located on an information tag found on the inside rail of your cap or lid product. For EGG trailers the serial number is located on an information tag on the front left side or on the MSO/Title document.

	We appreciate if you would take a moment to answer a few questions about your purchase. This information helps us build buyer profiles for our products. It  is held in confidence; we do not sell or distribute information to any outside party.  Answering these questions is not required to register your purchase.

	 

Thank you for selecting a Jason product.
