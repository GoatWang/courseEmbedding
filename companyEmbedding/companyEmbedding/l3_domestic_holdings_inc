CloseHazmat Item Details
If the item that you are trying to ship is deemed Hazmat you may have an additional fee added to your order when you check out. Items are deemed Hazmat as per the Section 14 Transport Information located in the item's Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS). Sorry, but things that can go "boom" are hard to ship and we have to pass on our fees.
Flammable or explosive items such as Fire Extinguishers, MEK, Toluene, Paint Thinner, etc. are subject to a $25.00 Hazmat fee via ground shipping methods. However, the majority of Hazmat items have no fee when shipping with a ground method.

Major defense contractor L-3 Communications Holdings Inc. (LLL  -  Free Report)	 has acquired UK-based CTC Aviation Group in a deal worth $220 million (£143 million) in cash. The acquisition aims at enhancing its commercial aviation training operations and strengthening its international presence.CTC Aviation has been renamed L-3 CTC Ltd. and integrated into the company’s Electronic Systems segment.L-3 CTC Aviation has a worldwide reputation in providing specialized and innovative solutions related to pilot training and crew resourcing services to major airlines and retail customers. Its integration into L-3’s Commercial Aviation Training business, which already includes L-3 Link UK, ­ a world-class provider of flight-training simulation devices, will strengthen L-3 Communications’ foothold as a leading provider of flight training and simulation services.L-3 CTC expects sales of $86 million in 2015 and $95 million in 2016. Being a high-margin business, it has the potential to generate operating margins more than that of the entire Electronic Systems segment. Hence, the acquisition is a strategic fit for the company as it strengthens its training solutions across a wide range of military and commercial platforms. The company expects L-3 CTC to add approximately $50 million to its total sales this year.Given that L-3 Communications’ business is primarily driven by contracts from the U.S. government, a tepid defense budget scenario has compelled it to expand and consolidate its international presence. A steady flow of foreign contracts will thus help to counter the sequestration impact at home.Recently, the company posted weak first-quarter results with earnings falling 24.7% year over year hurt by a sales decline in each of its four segments. The company also lowered its revenue and earnings guidance for 2015. Although growth slowed down in the first quarter, its strategy of gradually expanding its commercial and international operations has partially offset some of the domestic decline.The company’s international and commercial sales represented about 30% of its consolidated net sales in the first-quarter 2015, up from 29% in first-quarter 2014. Moreover, the company has expanded its international sales by 35% since 2011 and expects international and commercial sales to make up for 32% of consolidated 2015 sales.L-3 Communications is one of the best-positioned, pure defense players due to its non-platform-centric focus and broad diversification of programs. Its timeliness and contributions from strategic acquisitions will sustain its financial performance, going forward. L-3 Communications currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the defense space include API Technologies Corp. , Leidos Holdings, Inc. (LDOS  -  Free Report)	 and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report)	, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Federal Contracting, OSHA Violations, and Opposition to Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Executive Order
An L-3 executive sits on the board of the Professional Services Council (PSC), a trade association. PSC is a major opponent of the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Executive Order, an order issued by President Obama in 2014 that aims to ensure that federal contractors comply with federal wage laws, health and safety standards, and civil rights laws.[3]
An investigation by the Center for Media and Democracy of OSHA inspection records found that numerous corporations (and/or their subsidiaries)--including L-3--whose executives sit on the board of PSC had been cited for serious and repeat violations of OSHA standards from 2013-2015 that would be reportable under the EO. A "serious" violation indicates "a substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result" from a hazard, a "willful" violation is cited when "evidence shows either an intentional violation of the Act or plain indifference to its requirements," and a "repeat" violation indicates the business "has been cited previously for a substantially similar condition."[4]
In 2014, L-3 generated 71 percent of its total revenue from the federal government, amounting to $8.58 billion.[1]
As described in more detail below, between 2013-2015, L-3 or its subsidiary or related entity, L-3 Display Systems, received citations for 5 OSHA violations and $17,550 in fines.

3/10/14:[5] In response to a complaint at Fort Drum, NY, L-3 Communications was cited for 1 "Serious" violation and 2 "Other-than-Serious" violations, and fined $7,000. The serious violation concerned the failure to protect workers from exposure to hexavalent chromium, a cancer-causing substance.[6] The case remains open, pending abatement of violations and penalty payment.


4/17/14:[7] Following an unprogrammed inspection at an L-3 Communications site in Greenville, TX, OSHA inspectors cited the company for 1 "Serious" violation for failing to protect workers against exposure to electric shock. In an informal settlement the serious violation was reduced to "Other- than-Serious" and the penalty to $3,500.


6/02/14:[8] Following a referral inspection, OSHA cited an L-3 Communications site in Salt Lake City, UT for 1 "Serious" violation, and issued a fine of $4,500.


11/20/14:[9] Following a complaint inspection, OSHA cited an L-3 subsidiary or related entity, L-3 Display Systems, in Alpharetta, GA for 2 "Serious" violations of the standard for personal protective equipment, and issued an initial penalty of $5,100. In an informal settlement, the violation was reduced to 1 "Other-than-Serious" and the penalty to $2,550.

In establishing the company, several advanced electronics businesses were purchased that were part of the Lockheed Martin, Loral Corporation merger that occurred in 1996.

2000: Training Devices and Training Services (TDTS) business of the Raytheon Company; the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) product line from Honeywell and created the L-3 Aviation Communications and Surveillance Systems division; acquired all outstanding stock of MPRI (teaching and training programs to domestic and international governments as well as commercial customers; and acquired a 53.5% stake in LogiMetrics, Inc and control of its operations [leadership technology for the emerging broadband wireless communications infrastructure market for Ka-band Point-to-Multipoint (PMP) distribution services, including high-speed Internet access, real-time multimedia file transfer, interactive video and other applications].
