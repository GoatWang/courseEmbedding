Notes
Tentative release date Q4 2016 (subject to change)


Virtuix Omni is an Omnidirectional treadmill simulator for virtual reality games and other applications. It is currently in development by Virtuix.[1] It uses a platform to simulate locomotion i.e. the motion of walking, requiring both special shoes and surface that reduce friction. It works in conjunction with a variety of head mounted display's such as the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, Gear VR and allows gamers to walk or run within the game they are playing.[2]
In 2013, the Virtuix Omni became one of the ten biggest technology Kickstarter campaigns, raising $1.1 million in funding.[3] Since then, Virtuix has raised another $8 million from private and institutional investors.[3]
Although originally slated to be released in January 2014,[4] production of the Omni only began in November 2015.[5] If the current launch target of Q4 2016[6] is met, it will have been delayed by over two-and-a-half-years.
Kickstarter backers began receiving their orders during the third week of January, 2017.[7][8][9][10]

History[edit]




Virtuix Omni design from 2013.


Virtuix was founded by Jan Goetgeluk.[11] He quit his investment banking job to develop the project, investing 12 months of his time and a $200,000 personal investment to develop a prototype.[11] The prototype for the Omni used dummy shoes and Kinect software to detect movement instead of the sensor system that became part of the final product. He applied for a US patent on 23rd October 2013 for his Locomotion System and Apparatus[12] however, there is also prior art: the UK's Wizdish whose product is now known as RoVR. Jan Goetgeluk purchased a dish and shoes from Wizdish system prior to the filing of the US patent and could have derived his work, as the technology is exactly the same. Virtuix presented the prototype of the Omni at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2013 in Los Angeles, California where it was reviewed by Engadget[13] and other electronic publications, including The Verge.[14]
Virtuix launched a Kickstarter campaign in June 2013 to raise money for manufacturing. The campaign was endorsed by Oculus Rift founder Palmer Luckey[2] and overshot its funding goal of $150,000 within three and a half hours of it being posted. The campaign raised a total of $1.1 million when it closed, making it one of the top 10 biggest technology crowdfunding campaigns at the time.[3] Goetgeluk presented the Virtuix Omni on an episode of the TV show Shark Tank in 2013, after selling approximately 3,000 units in the Kickstarter campaign.[15] He failed to obtain funding from the Sharks after asking for $2 million for 10% of the company.[15] However, Shark Tank investor and billionaire Mark Cuban invested in Virtuix after the airing of the show.[16] Virtuix has raised a total of $8 million in additional funding from institutions and private investors.[3] Investors have included 2020 Ventures, SeedInvest, Tekton Ventures, and Scout Ventures.[17] In 2016, the company tested the waters under Regulation A for a potential offering of shares to the public.[18]
The Omni presented at SXSW in 2014[19] where Virtuix founder Jan Goetgeluk also spoke on the topic of virtual reality.[20] The final version of the Virtuix Omni was presented at the 2015 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada.[21] It was described as "sleek" compared to its previous versions.[21]
In January 2016, the first production Omnis began to ship to consumers.[22] By December that year, Virtuix announced that they would no longer be shipping Kickstarter pre-orders to non-US customers, and would not allow customers to swap their shipping address to a package forwarding service, claiming the logistics and costs of shipping were "unfeasible". The company would refund the orders with an additional 3% per year from the date of the order.[23][24][25]
Kickstarter backers began receiving their orders during the third week of January, 2017.[7][8][9][10]
Product overview[edit]




Design of the Virtuix Omni as showcased at the 2015 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.


The Omni is a locomotion simulator designed to work as a game controller and allow gamers to walk within the game environment in which they are playing.[2] It is used in tandem with Oculus Rift or other virtual reality head mounted displays and is a peripheral for a full virtual reality game setup. The surface is bowl shaped and requires special low friction shoes in order to operate it.[2] It uses inertial sensors to track a person's position, the length of their stride, and how fast they are moving.[19] The information is then sent to a computer which translates the data into the game movements.[19]
Games and peripherals[edit]
Virtuix Omni acts as a standard game controller and is designed to work with any PC game.[19] Virtuix is also developing TRAVR, a first-person shooter game as well as three additional games designed specifically for the Omni.[19][26] The Virtuix Omni has been reviewed in publications for games such as Grand Theft Auto V,[27] The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,[26] Battlefield 4,[26] and ARMA 3 among others.[28] In addition to gaming, the Virtuix Omni can be used for virtual reality applications including training and simulation, fitness, healthcare, architecture, virtual tourism, meet-ups and events. Virtuix is a sponsor of Hands Omni, a wireless glove that allows users to "feel" an object they are grabbing in virtual reality.[29] The glove is in development as of 2015 and is being developed to be used as a peripheral for the Omni.[30]
Military use[edit]
Virtuix is developing a version of the Omni for use in military simulation.[31] The military version has additional forms of movement features such as accommodating a fully combat-loaded soldier. It was first exhibited in December 2014.[32]

It is currently in development by Virtuix.[1] It uses a platform to simulate locomotion i.e. the motion of walking, requiring both special shoes and surface that reduce friction. It works in conjunction with a variety of head mounted display's such as the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, Gear VR and allows gamers to walk or run within the game they are playing.[2]
In 2013, the Virtuix Omni became one of the ten biggest technology Kickstarter campaigns, raising $1.1 million in funding.[3] Since then, Virtuix has raised another $8 million from private and institutional investors.[3]
Although originally slated to be released in January 2014,[4] production of the Omni only began in November 2015.[5] If the current launch target of Q4 2016[6] is met, it will have been delayed by over two-and-a-half-years.
Kickstarter backers began receiving their orders during the third week of January, 2017.[7][8][9][10]

History[edit]




Virtuix Omni design from 2013.


Virtuix was founded by Jan Goetgeluk.[11] He quit his investment banking job to develop the project, investing 12 months of his time and a $200,000 personal investment to develop a prototype.[11] The prototype for the Omni used dummy shoes and Kinect software to detect movement instead of the sensor system that became part of the final product. He applied for a US patent on 23rd October 2013 for his Locomotion System and Apparatus[12] however, there is also prior art: the UK's Wizdish whose product is now known as RoVR. Jan Goetgeluk purchased a dish and shoes from Wizdish system prior to the filing of the US patent and could have derived his work, as the technology is exactly the same. Virtuix presented the prototype of the Omni at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2013 in Los Angeles, California where it was reviewed by Engadget[13] and other electronic publications, including The Verge.[14]
Virtuix launched a Kickstarter campaign in June 2013 to raise money for manufacturing. The campaign was endorsed by Oculus Rift founder Palmer Luckey[2] and overshot its funding goal of $150,000 within three and a half hours of it being posted. The campaign raised a total of $1.1 million when it closed, making it one of the top 10 biggest technology crowdfunding campaigns at the time.[3] Goetgeluk presented the Virtuix Omni on an episode of the TV show Shark Tank in 2013, after selling approximately 3,000 units in the Kickstarter campaign.[15] He failed to obtain funding from the Sharks after asking for $2 million for 10% of the company.[15] However, Shark Tank investor and billionaire Mark Cuban invested in Virtuix after the airing of the show.[16] Virtuix has raised a total of $8 million in additional funding from institutions and private investors.[3] Investors have included 2020 Ventures, SeedInvest, Tekton Ventures, and Scout Ventures.[17] In 2016, the company tested the waters under Regulation A for a potential offering of shares to the public.[18]
The Omni presented at SXSW in 2014[19] where Virtuix founder Jan Goetgeluk also spoke on the topic of virtual reality.[20] The final version of the Virtuix Omni was presented at the 2015 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada.[21] It was described as "sleek" compared to its previous versions.[21]
In January 2016, the first production Omnis began to ship to consumers.[22] By December that year, Virtuix announced that they would no longer be shipping Kickstarter pre-orders to non-US customers, and would not allow customers to swap their shipping address to a package forwarding service, claiming the logistics and costs of shipping were "unfeasible". The company would refund the orders with an additional 3% per year from the date of the order.[23][24][25]
Kickstarter backers began receiving their orders during the third week of January, 2017.[7][8][9][10]
Product overview[edit]




Design of the Virtuix Omni as showcased at the 2015 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.


The Omni is a locomotion simulator designed to work as a game controller and allow gamers to walk within the game environment in which they are playing.[2] It is used in tandem with Oculus Rift or other virtual reality head mounted displays and is a peripheral for a full virtual reality game setup. The surface is bowl shaped and requires special low friction shoes in order to operate it.[2] It uses inertial sensors to track a person's position, the length of their stride, and how fast they are moving.[19] The information is then sent to a computer which translates the data into the game movements.[19]
Games and peripherals[edit]
Virtuix Omni acts as a standard game controller and is designed to work with any PC game.[19] Virtuix is also developing TRAVR, a first-person shooter game as well as three additional games designed specifically for the Omni.[19][26] The Virtuix Omni has been reviewed in publications for games such as Grand Theft Auto V,[27] The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,[26] Battlefield 4,[26] and ARMA 3 among others.[28] In addition to gaming, the Virtuix Omni can be used for virtual reality applications including training and simulation, fitness, healthcare, architecture, virtual tourism, meet-ups and events. Virtuix is a sponsor of Hands Omni, a wireless glove that allows users to "feel" an object they are grabbing in virtual reality.[29] The glove is in development as of 2015 and is being developed to be used as a peripheral for the Omni.[30]
Military use[edit]
Virtuix is developing a version of the Omni for use in military simulation.[31] The military version has additional forms of movement features such as accommodating a fully combat-loaded soldier. It was first exhibited in December 2014.[32]

Walk in Virtual Reality

Whether you are creating a commercial entertainment experience, a professional training environment, or any other virtual reality application, VR is best experienced with motion. The Virtuix Omni™ is a first-of-its-kind active virtual reality platform that enables natural movement. Active VR, where your movement in the virtual world is controlled by your physical actions like walking or running, creates an unprecedented sense of immersion that cannot be experienced sitting down.
 





Better Yet … Run in Virtual Reality

We run in real life. Sometimes for entertainment, sometimes for exercise, and sometimes because it is our job. Why would you want to give that up in virtual reality?  The Virtuix Omni™ is the ONLY way to run in virtual reality safely and comfortably, without risk of falling or colliding with people, walls and other objects that hurt.
 



 




 




Big Environments – Small Footprint

Real estate is expensive and our customers tell us that efficient use of that real estate is critical. The Virtuix Omni™ allows you to experience the largest virtual reality environments without leaving the Omni’s compact frame. Multiplayer experiences are now possible in a small room.

What is Form D? What It Is Used For
Form D disclosures could be used to track and understand better your competitors. The information in Form D is usually highly confidential for ventures and startups and they don’t like revealing it. This is because it reveals amount raised or planned to be raised as well as reasons for the financing. This could help competitors. Entrepreneurs usually want to keep their financing a ‘secret’ so they can stay in stealth mode for longer.
Why Fundraising Reporting Is Good For Virtuix Holdings  Also
The Form D signed by Jan Goetgeluk might help Virtuix Holdings Inc.’s sector. First, it helps potential customers feel more safe to deal with a firm that is well financed. The odds are higher that it will stay in the business. Second, this could attract other investors such as venture-capital firms, funds and angels. Third, positive PR effects could even bring leasing firms and venture lenders.

                About Virtuix            


















ORIGINS
A revolution in virtual reality is underway – consumers can now explore virtual worlds with the natural use of their hands and eyes thanks to affordable devices such as the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. The Virtuix Omni™ evolves virtual reality one step further, allowing anyone to stand up and traverse virtual worlds with the natural use of their own feet. Walking and running in virtual reality creates an unprecedented sense of immersion.
Virtuix has completed a successful $1.1 million Kickstarter campaign thanks to more than 3,000 backers, and has raised more than $16 million in funding to date. From Kickstarter to kickoff, Virtuix has led the way in addressing locomotion in virtual environments. The Omni blazed the market trail for ultimate immersive gaming, attracting the interest of both indie and market-leading game developers. With no moving parts, the Omni is not only the first, but also the most compact, easily assembled, and affordable gaming system of its kind.
THE EXPERIENCE
True virtual reality cannot be experienced sitting down. The panoramic visuals offered by head mounted displays need corresponding natural movement to maintain our sense of orientation and feeling of immersion.
The Omni frees gamers from passive, seated gameplay, unleashing the full potential of virtual reality gaming with the Oculus Rift and future head mounted displays. Gaming on a keyboard, mouse or gamepad while seated pales in comparison to the intense experience and fun that comes from actually walking, running, and jumping in games. The Omni transforms the gaming experience into a highly interactive, energetic battle royale between players fighting for virtual supremacy.
Omni players can walk and run in 360 degrees, resulting in a natural interface that works with any game or application that uses keyboard or gamepad input. Walk, run, jump, strafe, or even sit—movements mapped to the keyboard or gamepad can be mapped to natural motion with the Omni. The Omni works with PC or even mobile devices, thanks to its integrated Bluetooth connectivity.
DESIGN
The Omni is the result of four years of design and testing. The Omni uses a concave platform that enables a smooth, natural gait and an immersive walking and running motion. The final Omni design was created by the award winning design studio CRE8 Design.

Notes
Tentative release date Q4 2016 (subject to change)


Virtuix Omni is an Omnidirectional treadmill simulator for virtual reality games and other applications. It is currently in development by Virtuix.[1] It uses a platform to simulate locomotion i.e. the motion of walking, requiring both special shoes and surface that reduce friction. It works in conjunction with a variety of head mounted display's such as the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, Gear VR and allows gamers to walk or run within the game they are playing.[2]
In 2013, the Virtuix Omni became one of the ten biggest technology Kickstarter campaigns, raising $1.1 million in funding.[3] Since then, Virtuix has raised another $8 million from private and institutional investors.[3]
Although originally slated to be released in January 2014,[4] production of the Omni only began in November 2015.[5] If the current launch target of Q4 2016[6] is met, it will have been delayed by over two-and-a-half-years.
Kickstarter backers began receiving their orders during the third week of January, 2017.[7][8][9][10]

History[edit]




Virtuix Omni design from 2013.


Virtuix was founded by Jan Goetgeluk.[11] He quit his investment banking job to develop the project, investing 12 months of his time and a $200,000 personal investment to develop a prototype.[11] The prototype for the Omni used dummy shoes and Kinect software to detect movement instead of the sensor system that became part of the final product. He applied for a US patent on 23rd October 2013 for his Locomotion System and Apparatus[12] however, there is also prior art: the UK's Wizdish whose product is now known as RoVR. Jan Goetgeluk purchased a dish and shoes from Wizdish system prior to the filing of the US patent and could have derived his work, as the technology is exactly the same. Virtuix presented the prototype of the Omni at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2013 in Los Angeles, California where it was reviewed by Engadget[13] and other electronic publications, including The Verge.[14]
Virtuix launched a Kickstarter campaign in June 2013 to raise money for manufacturing. The campaign was endorsed by Oculus Rift founder Palmer Luckey[2] and overshot its funding goal of $150,000 within three and a half hours of it being posted. The campaign raised a total of $1.1 million when it closed, making it one of the top 10 biggest technology crowdfunding campaigns at the time.[3] Goetgeluk presented the Virtuix Omni on an episode of the TV show Shark Tank in 2013, after selling approximately 3,000 units in the Kickstarter campaign.[15] He failed to obtain funding from the Sharks after asking for $2 million for 10% of the company.[15] However, Shark Tank investor and billionaire Mark Cuban invested in Virtuix after the airing of the show.[16] Virtuix has raised a total of $8 million in additional funding from institutions and private investors.[3] Investors have included 2020 Ventures, SeedInvest, Tekton Ventures, and Scout Ventures.[17] In 2016, the company tested the waters under Regulation A for a potential offering of shares to the public.[18]
The Omni presented at SXSW in 2014[19] where Virtuix founder Jan Goetgeluk also spoke on the topic of virtual reality.[20] The final version of the Virtuix Omni was presented at the 2015 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada.[21] It was described as "sleek" compared to its previous versions.[21]
In January 2016, the first production Omnis began to ship to consumers.[22] By December that year, Virtuix announced that they would no longer be shipping Kickstarter pre-orders to non-US customers, and would not allow customers to swap their shipping address to a package forwarding service, claiming the logistics and costs of shipping were "unfeasible". The company would refund the orders with an additional 3% per year from the date of the order.[23][24][25]
Kickstarter backers began receiving their orders during the third week of January, 2017.[7][8][9][10]
Product overview[edit]




Design of the Virtuix Omni as showcased at the 2015 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.


The Omni is a locomotion simulator designed to work as a game controller and allow gamers to walk within the game environment in which they are playing.[2] It is used in tandem with Oculus Rift or other virtual reality head mounted displays and is a peripheral for a full virtual reality game setup. The surface is bowl shaped and requires special low friction shoes in order to operate it.[2] It uses inertial sensors to track a person's position, the length of their stride, and how fast they are moving.[19] The information is then sent to a computer which translates the data into the game movements.[19]
Games and peripherals[edit]
Virtuix Omni acts as a standard game controller and is designed to work with any PC game.[19] Virtuix is also developing TRAVR, a first-person shooter game as well as three additional games designed specifically for the Omni.[19][26] The Virtuix Omni has been reviewed in publications for games such as Grand Theft Auto V,[27] The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,[26] Battlefield 4,[26] and ARMA 3 among others.[28] In addition to gaming, the Virtuix Omni can be used for virtual reality applications including training and simulation, fitness, healthcare, architecture, virtual tourism, meet-ups and events. Virtuix is a sponsor of Hands Omni, a wireless glove that allows users to "feel" an object they are grabbing in virtual reality.[29] The glove is in development as of 2015 and is being developed to be used as a peripheral for the Omni.[30]
Military use[edit]
Virtuix is developing a version of the Omni for use in military simulation.[31] The military version has additional forms of movement features such as accommodating a fully combat-loaded soldier. It was first exhibited in December 2014.[32]

Notes
Tentative release date Q4 2016 (subject to change)


Virtuix Omni is an Omnidirectional treadmill simulator for virtual reality games and other applications. It is currently in development by Virtuix.[1] It uses a platform to simulate locomotion i.e. the motion of walking, requiring both special shoes and surface that reduce friction. It works in conjunction with a variety of head mounted display's such as the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, Gear VR and allows gamers to walk or run within the game they are playing.[2]
In 2013, the Virtuix Omni became one of the ten biggest technology Kickstarter campaigns, raising $1.1 million in funding.[3] Since then, Virtuix has raised another $8 million from private and institutional investors.[3]
Although originally slated to be released in January 2014,[4] production of the Omni only began in November 2015.[5] If the current launch target of Q4 2016[6] is met, it will have been delayed by over two-and-a-half-years.
Kickstarter backers began receiving their orders during the third week of January, 2017.[7][8][9][10]

History[edit]




Virtuix Omni design from 2013.


Virtuix was founded by Jan Goetgeluk.[11] He quit his investment banking job to develop the project, investing 12 months of his time and a $200,000 personal investment to develop a prototype.[11] The prototype for the Omni used dummy shoes and Kinect software to detect movement instead of the sensor system that became part of the final product. He applied for a US patent on 23rd October 2013 for his Locomotion System and Apparatus[12] however, there is also prior art: the UK's Wizdish whose product is now known as RoVR. Jan Goetgeluk purchased a dish and shoes from Wizdish system prior to the filing of the US patent and could have derived his work, as the technology is exactly the same. Virtuix presented the prototype of the Omni at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2013 in Los Angeles, California where it was reviewed by Engadget[13] and other electronic publications, including The Verge.[14]
Virtuix launched a Kickstarter campaign in June 2013 to raise money for manufacturing. The campaign was endorsed by Oculus Rift founder Palmer Luckey[2] and overshot its funding goal of $150,000 within three and a half hours of it being posted. The campaign raised a total of $1.1 million when it closed, making it one of the top 10 biggest technology crowdfunding campaigns at the time.[3] Goetgeluk presented the Virtuix Omni on an episode of the TV show Shark Tank in 2013, after selling approximately 3,000 units in the Kickstarter campaign.[15] He failed to obtain funding from the Sharks after asking for $2 million for 10% of the company.[15] However, Shark Tank investor and billionaire Mark Cuban invested in Virtuix after the airing of the show.[16] Virtuix has raised a total of $8 million in additional funding from institutions and private investors.[3] Investors have included 2020 Ventures, SeedInvest, Tekton Ventures, and Scout Ventures.[17] In 2016, the company tested the waters under Regulation A for a potential offering of shares to the public.[18]
The Omni presented at SXSW in 2014[19] where Virtuix founder Jan Goetgeluk also spoke on the topic of virtual reality.[20] The final version of the Virtuix Omni was presented at the 2015 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada.[21] It was described as "sleek" compared to its previous versions.[21]
In January 2016, the first production Omnis began to ship to consumers.[22] By December that year, Virtuix announced that they would no longer be shipping Kickstarter pre-orders to non-US customers, and would not allow customers to swap their shipping address to a package forwarding service, claiming the logistics and costs of shipping were "unfeasible". The company would refund the orders with an additional 3% per year from the date of the order.[23][24][25]
Kickstarter backers began receiving their orders during the third week of January, 2017.[7][8][9][10]
Product overview[edit]




Design of the Virtuix Omni as showcased at the 2015 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.


The Omni is a locomotion simulator designed to work as a game controller and allow gamers to walk within the game environment in which they are playing.[2] It is used in tandem with Oculus Rift or other virtual reality head mounted displays and is a peripheral for a full virtual reality game setup. The surface is bowl shaped and requires special low friction shoes in order to operate it.[2] It uses inertial sensors to track a person's position, the length of their stride, and how fast they are moving.[19] The information is then sent to a computer which translates the data into the game movements.[19]
Games and peripherals[edit]
Virtuix Omni acts as a standard game controller and is designed to work with any PC game.[19] Virtuix is also developing TRAVR, a first-person shooter game as well as three additional games designed specifically for the Omni.[19][26] The Virtuix Omni has been reviewed in publications for games such as Grand Theft Auto V,[27] The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,[26] Battlefield 4,[26] and ARMA 3 among others.[28] In addition to gaming, the Virtuix Omni can be used for virtual reality applications including training and simulation, fitness, healthcare, architecture, virtual tourism, meet-ups and events. Virtuix is a sponsor of Hands Omni, a wireless glove that allows users to "feel" an object they are grabbing in virtual reality.[29] The glove is in development as of 2015 and is being developed to be used as a peripheral for the Omni.[30]
Military use[edit]
Virtuix is developing a version of the Omni for use in military simulation.[31] The military version has additional forms of movement features such as accommodating a fully combat-loaded soldier. It was first exhibited in December 2014.[32]

                Developers Resource Center            








 


















 
















Welcome
Welcome to our Developer Resource Center! On this page you will find information regarding the Omni SDK, our demo games, and helpful links to additional developer resources. Please join in the conversations we are having with other developers on our developer forums. Or get in touch with our Developer Relations team at developers@virtuix.com.
Omni SDK
Omni applications enable players to walk around and explore VR in ways never seen before:


“Active VR”
Immersion through physical walking and running in 360 degrees inside a game or VR application


De-coupled looking / walking direction
The ability to walk in one direction while looking around independently in any other direction gives the player the natural experience of looking around for danger or observing the surroundings while moving


Natural Speed
Analog walking and running speed in-game matches the player’s physical movement speed on the Omni


The Omni Software Development Kit (Omni SDK) is the development gateway to Active VR experiences with the Omni. Request our SDK for Unity or Unreal Engine 4 via the links below. After submitting the form and review by our team, you will receive an email with a link to download our SDKs.
