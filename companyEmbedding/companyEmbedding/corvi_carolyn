Carolyn Corvi Biography :


Carolyn Corvi is responsible for leading Boeing Commercial Airplanes' fully-integrated production system -- from design through production and delivery. The Airplane Programs organization has more than 30,000 employees and includes all airplane production activities in Everett and Renton, Wash., component fabrication at Boeing facilities in the United States, Canada and Australia, and supplier management.Prior to this assignment, Corvi was vice president - general manager of the 737/757 Programs. Under her leadership, the 737/757 Programs incorporated industry-leading applications of lean manufacturing principles, including a moving assembly line that reduced 737 final assembly flow time from 22 days in 1999 to 11 days in 2005. She also was responsible for the "Move to the Lake" project, which co-located most of the people who design, build and support the 737 inside the Renton Final Assembly building on the south shore of Lake Washington. Aviation Week & Space Technology Magazine recognized the project's creativity and innovation by selecting it as a 2005 Laurels Awards recipient.Corvi joined Boeing in 1974 and has held a variety of key leadership assignments including: vice president of Aircraft Systems & Interiors, which designed and produced assemblies for all airplane programs, spares and aftermarket support; vice president of the Propulsion Systems Division, which develops propulsion systems and auxiliary power units for the entire Boeing family of commercial airplanes; director of Quality Assurance for the Fabrication Division, which produces a diverse range of parts, tools and assemblies used in the production of every Boeing jetliner; and director of Program Management for the 737 and 757 programs.She was the 2006 recipient of the Eli Whitney Productivity Award, granted by the Society of Manufacturing Engineers for distinguished accomplishments in improved production capabilities. Corvi was also honored as one of the "Women of Influence" in 2006 by the Puget Sound Business Journal. For her contributions to both Boeing and the aerospace industry, she won the 2001 Women in Aerospace Leadership award.Corvi currently serves on Virginia Mason Medical Center's Health System Board of Directors, is on the president's advisory board at Embry Riddle University and serves on the Board of Directors of Matis Aerospace.She is co-founder of the Northwest Children's Fund, a former board member of the YWCA - King and Snohomish Counties, and past president and executive board member of Washington's National Park Fund.Corvi has a bachelor's degree from the University of Washington and a master's degree in management from MIT.A native of Seattle, she was born Sept. 12, 1951.

Retired Boeing exec. Carolyn Corvi joins Goodrich board
			By Andrea James
on June 2, 2009 at 10:23 AM


Print

Goodrich Corp., said Tuesday that retired Boeing executive Carolyn Corvi has joined its board of directors. 







Corvi held a 34-year career at Boeing, culminating as vice president and general manager for Boeing Commercial Airplanes from 2005 until 2008. She is 57.
“Carolyn Corvi’s experience in the global commercial aircraft manufacturing sector will bring tremendous insight to our board of directors. Her implementation of lean manufacturing principles complements our focus on continuous improvement, and the board and I look forward to working with her,” Goodrich Chief Executive Officer Marshall Larsen said in a statement.
Corvi is an alumna of the University of Washington, where she studied history as an undergraduate, and of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Business, where she was a graduate student studying management.
Charlotte-based Goodrich has several large operations in Washington state, including five sets of operations in Everett and one in Spokane. The Everett operations include an engineering and sales office for aircraft wheels and brakes, a Boeing commercial strategic relationship management team, landing gear assembly and engineering, a sales office for sensors and integrated systems, 787 engine integration and inlet final assembly, and a service and product support center for interiors. The company does carbon brake manufacturing for aircraft in Spokane.
