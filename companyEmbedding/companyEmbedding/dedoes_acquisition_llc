Investments











Graycliff Partners, an independent investment firm focusing on middle market private equity and mezzanine investments, has provided subordinated debt and equity financing to Dedoes Industries, a manufacturer of equipment for the automotive refinish market.
Graycliff’s investment supported the acquisition of the business by Ashland Capital Partners, a Chicago based private investment firm.
 
Headquartered in Walled Lake, MI and founded in 1941, Dedoes’ products are used by auto refinish shops to mix, shake, proportion, formulate, cure and store both water and solvent based paint.
 
“Dedoes represents an attractive investment opportunity given its leading position within its market niche, combined with a stable revenue base tied to the auto aftermarket,” says Andrew Trigg, managing partner at Graycliff Partners.
 
“We are excited to have the support of both Ashland and Graycliff to assist Dedoes in achieving its next phase of growth,” says Dave Pratt, president, Dedoes Industries.

      Graycliff Partners, an independent investment firm focusing on middle
      market private equity and mezzanine investments, today announced it has
      provided subordinated debt and equity financing to Dedoes Industries, a
      global leader in equipment for the automotive refinish market.
      Graycliff’s investment supported the acquisition of the business by
      Ashland Capital Partners, a Chicago based private investment firm.
    

      Headquartered in Walled Lake, MI and founded in 1941, Dedoes is the
      North American leader in the design and manufacturing of equipment that
      supports the automotive refinish market. The company’s products are used
      by auto refinish shops to mix, shake, proportion, formulate, cure and
      store both water and solvent based paint.
    

      “Dedoes represents an attractive investment opportunity given its
      leading position within its market niche, combined with a stable revenue
      base tied to the auto aftermarket,” said Andrew Trigg, Managing Partner
      at Graycliff Partners. Garrett Wentzell, Vice President, added “We look
      forward to partnering with both Ashland and Management to foster the
      company’s strong position domestically and to further penetrate
      international markets.”
    

      “We are excited to have the support of both Ashland and Graycliff to
      assist Dedoes in achieving its next phase of growth,” said Dave Pratt,
      President, Dedoes Industries.
