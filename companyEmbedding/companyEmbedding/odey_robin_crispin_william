Early life[edit]
Odey was born in east Yorkshire, the only son of (George) Richard Odey.[5] In 1980, his sister Caroline Jane Odey married Hon. Henry David Montgomery (heir apparent to the viscountcy), the son of David Montgomery, 2nd Viscount Montgomery of Alamein, and they have three children.[6]
He was educated at Harrow School, where his father had been head boy, and graduated from Christ Church, Oxford in 1980 with a degree in history and economics.
His father was from a family of Yorkshire industrialists, and his grandfather George Odey, "a formidable bully", had been the Conservative MP for Beverley.[7] His mother was from the "prominent" Clitherow family.[7]
Soon after graduation, he found out that his father had huge debts, and the trustees made him responsible for Hotham Hall, a 4,000-acre estate that had been in his mother's family since 1720.[7] Aged 23, he sold everything.[7] According to Odey, his father was a "wastrel from beginning to end", and survived on handouts from his son.[7]
Early career[edit]
After university he qualified as a barrister but instead joined Framlington fund managers, leaving to work for Barings International where he managed the Baring European Growth Trust. He ran continental European pension funds at Barings and at Framlington.[2][4][8]
Odey Asset Management[edit]
Odey founded Odey Asset Management in 1991.[8] George Soros was one of the original investors, seeding Odey $150 million.[4] He suffered large losses in 1994 when the Federal Reserve unexpectedly lifted interest rates (one of his funds lost 44 per cent of its value), but went on to thrive, for instance by foreseeing that the value of insurers would rise after the September 11 attacks on New York in 2001.[4][9]
Through the early part of the 2000s Odey worked closely with Hugh Hendry, whom he had recruited and who ran Odey's top performing Continental Europe Fund. Hendry left in 2005 to establish Eclectica Asset Management. In reference to Hendry, Odey himself said: "Odey in the 1990s was a one-man band; Odey in the 2000s was a two-man band."[4]
Odey came to wide attention in 2008 when he paid himself £28 million after successfully anticipating the credit crunch.[9] That year his return was 54.8 per cent.[4] He had been bearish about the position of banks for a number of years, shorting Bradford & Bingley as early as 2005, questioning the German landesbanks and warning consistently about the dangers of debt and inflated house prices. He continued his short positions into early 2009 but in April took longer positions as he predicted the market rally of that year.[2] The Times newspaper selected Odey as a "Business Big Shot" in 2008.[10]
In May 2009 Odey attracted some controversy for saying in The Times that he would leave the country to avoid paying 50% income tax.[11]
He was at the centre of further controversy when it was suggested that he financially backed anti-EU campaigners in the Irish referendum on the Lisbon Treaty[12] while some hedge funds had taken out specific bets on the insolvency of the country in the event that the vote not be carried.[13] The Treaty passed by a margin of 67.1 per cent to 32.9 per cent.[14] Odey denied that he had funded the Libertas 'no' campaign in faxes issued to RTÉ and TV3.[15]
In May 2010, Odey Asset Management formed a new investment management firm with Geneva’s Bruellan Wealth Management called Odey Bruellan.
Odey Asset Management's Odey European Inc. fund was ranked No. 5 on Bloomberg's 2012 list of the 100 Top-Performing Large Hedge Funds.[16]
In 2016, it was reported that Odey saw his personal fortune plummet by £200 million after profits at Odey Asset Management suffered a significant decline. His salary was slashed as profits were down nearly 45% from the previous year.[17][18] Later that year, his hedge fun won about 15% of its value following the results of Brexit.[19]
Personal life[edit]
Odey was briefly married to Rupert Murdoch's eldest daughter, Prudence, although the pair quickly separated.[20] The marriage lasted 15 months.
He subsequently married Nichola Pease, deputy chairman of JO Hambro Capital Management and a member of one of the founding families of Barclays Bank.[2][9][21][22] Nichola is younger daughter of Sir Richard Pease, 3rd Baronet, and a sister of Carolyn Varley (wife of John Varley) and Richard Pease, a funds manager.[23] He had no children by his first wife, and three children, two sons and one daughter, by his second wife. The sons were born in 1994 and 1999, and the daughter in 1997.[24]
Odey reportedly enjoys shooting and fishing. He lives in Chelsea, London, and has a house in English Bicknor, where a pork sausage has been named after him by a neighbour.[21]

Early life[edit]
Odey was born in east Yorkshire, the only son of (George) Richard Odey.[5] In 1980, his sister Caroline Jane Odey married Hon. Henry David Montgomery (heir apparent to the viscountcy), the son of David Montgomery, 2nd Viscount Montgomery of Alamein, and they have three children.[6]
He was educated at Harrow School, where his father had been head boy, and graduated from Christ Church, Oxford in 1980 with a degree in history and economics.
His father was from a family of Yorkshire industrialists, and his grandfather George Odey, "a formidable bully", had been the Conservative MP for Beverley.[7] His mother was from the "prominent" Clitherow family.[7]
Soon after graduation, he found out that his father had huge debts, and the trustees made him responsible for Hotham Hall, a 4,000-acre estate that had been in his mother's family since 1720.[7] Aged 23, he sold everything.[7] According to Odey, his father was a "wastrel from beginning to end", and survived on handouts from his son.[7]
Early career[edit]
After university he qualified as a barrister but instead joined Framlington fund managers, leaving to work for Barings International where he managed the Baring European Growth Trust. He ran continental European pension funds at Barings and at Framlington.[2][4][8]
Odey Asset Management[edit]
Odey founded Odey Asset Management in 1991.[8] George Soros was one of the original investors, seeding Odey $150 million.[4] He suffered large losses in 1994 when the Federal Reserve unexpectedly lifted interest rates (one of his funds lost 44 per cent of its value), but went on to thrive, for instance by foreseeing that the value of insurers would rise after the September 11 attacks on New York in 2001.[4][9]
Through the early part of the 2000s Odey worked closely with Hugh Hendry, whom he had recruited and who ran Odey's top performing Continental Europe Fund. Hendry left in 2005 to establish Eclectica Asset Management. In reference to Hendry, Odey himself said: "Odey in the 1990s was a one-man band; Odey in the 2000s was a two-man band."[4]
Odey came to wide attention in 2008 when he paid himself £28 million after successfully anticipating the credit crunch.[9] That year his return was 54.8 per cent.[4] He had been bearish about the position of banks for a number of years, shorting Bradford & Bingley as early as 2005, questioning the German landesbanks and warning consistently about the dangers of debt and inflated house prices. He continued his short positions into early 2009 but in April took longer positions as he predicted the market rally of that year.[2] The Times newspaper selected Odey as a "Business Big Shot" in 2008.[10]
In May 2009 Odey attracted some controversy for saying in The Times that he would leave the country to avoid paying 50% income tax.[11]
He was at the centre of further controversy when it was suggested that he financially backed anti-EU campaigners in the Irish referendum on the Lisbon Treaty[12] while some hedge funds had taken out specific bets on the insolvency of the country in the event that the vote not be carried.[13] The Treaty passed by a margin of 67.1 per cent to 32.9 per cent.[14] Odey denied that he had funded the Libertas 'no' campaign in faxes issued to RTÉ and TV3.[15]
In May 2010, Odey Asset Management formed a new investment management firm with Geneva’s Bruellan Wealth Management called Odey Bruellan.
Odey Asset Management's Odey European Inc. fund was ranked No. 5 on Bloomberg's 2012 list of the 100 Top-Performing Large Hedge Funds.[16]
In 2016, it was reported that Odey saw his personal fortune plummet by £200 million after profits at Odey Asset Management suffered a significant decline. His salary was slashed as profits were down nearly 45% from the previous year.[17][18] Later that year, his hedge fun won about 15% of its value following the results of Brexit.[19]
Personal life[edit]
Odey was briefly married to Rupert Murdoch's eldest daughter, Prudence, although the pair quickly separated.[20] The marriage lasted 15 months.
He subsequently married Nichola Pease, deputy chairman of JO Hambro Capital Management and a member of one of the founding families of Barclays Bank.[2][9][21][22] Nichola is younger daughter of Sir Richard Pease, 3rd Baronet, and a sister of Carolyn Varley (wife of John Varley) and Richard Pease, a funds manager.[23] He had no children by his first wife, and three children, two sons and one daughter, by his second wife. The sons were born in 1994 and 1999, and the daughter in 1997.[24]
Odey reportedly enjoys shooting and fishing. He lives in Chelsea, London, and has a house in English Bicknor, where a pork sausage has been named after him by a neighbour.[21]

In April 2011 the firm had $6.5 to $7 billion under management, with Odey personally running $4 billion of assets.[4]Contents1 Early life2 Early career3 Odey Asset Management4 Personal life5 ReferencesEarly lifeOdey was born in east Yorkshire, the only son of (George) Richard Odey.[5] In 1980, his sister Caroline Jane Odey married Hon. Henry David Montgomery (heir apparent to the viscountcy), the son of David Montgomery, 2nd Viscount Montgomery of Alamein, and they have three children.[6]He was educated at Harrow School, where his father had been head boy, and graduated from Christ Church, Oxford in 1980 with a degree in history and economics.His father was from a family of Yorkshire industrialists, and his grandfather George Odey, "a formidable bully", had been the Conservative MP for Beverley.[7] His mother was from the "prominent" Clitherow family.[7]Soon after graduation, he found out that his father had huge debts, and the trustees made him responsible for Hotham Hall, a 4,000-acre estate that had been in his mother's family since 1720.[7] Aged 23, he sold everything.[7] According to Odey, his father was a "wastrel from beginning to end", and survived on handouts from his son.[7]Early careerAfter university he qualified as a barrister but instead joined Framlington fund managers, leaving to work for Barings International where he managed the Baring European Growth Trust. He ran continental European pension funds at Barings and at Framlington.[2][4][8]Odey Asset ManagementOdey founded Odey Asset Management in 1991.[8] George Soros was one of the original investors, seeding Odey $150 million.[4] He suffered large losses in 1994 when the Federal Reserve unexpectedly lifted interest rates (one of his funds lost 44 per cent of its value), but went on to thrive, for instance by foreseeing that the value of insurers would rise after the September 11 attacks on New York in 2001.[4][9]Through the early part of the 2000s Odey worked closely with Hugh Hendry, whom he had recruited and who ran Odey's top performing Continental Europe Fund. Hendry left in 2005 to establish Eclectica Asset Management. In reference to Hendry, Odey himself said: "Odey in the 1990s was a one-man band; Odey in the 2000s was a two-man band."[4]Odey came to wide attention in 2008 when he paid himself £28 million after successfully anticipating the credit crunch.[9] That year his return was 54.8 per cent.[4] He had been bearish about the position of banks for a number of years, shorting Bradford & Bingley as early as 2005, questioning the German landesbanks and warning consistently about the dangers of debt and inflated house prices. He continued his short positions into early 2009 but in April took longer positions as he predicted the market rally of that year.[2] The Times newspaper selected Odey as a "Business Big Shot" in 2008.[10]In May 2009 Odey attracted some controversy for saying in The Times that he would leave the country to avoid paying 50% income tax.[11]He was at the centre of further controversy when it was suggested that he financially backed anti-EU campaigners in the Irish referendum on the Lisbon Treaty[12] while some hedge funds had taken out specific bets on the insolvency of the country in the event that the vote not be carried.[13] The Treaty passed by a margin of 67.1 per cent to 32.9 per cent.[14] Odey denied that he had funded the Libertas 'no' campaign in faxes issued to RTÉ and TV3.[15]In May 2010, Odey Asset Management formed a new investment management firm with Geneva’s Bruellan Wealth Management called Odey Bruellan.Odey Asset Management's Odey European Inc. fund was ranked No. 5 on Bloomberg's 2012 list of the 100 Top-Performing Large Hedge Funds.[16]In 2016, it was reported that Odey saw his personal fortune plummet by £200 million after profits at Odey Asset Management suffered a significant decline. His salary was slashed as profits were down nearly 45% from the previous year.[17][18] Later that year, his hedge fun won about 15% of its value following the results of Brexit.[19]Personal lifeOdey was briefly married to Rupert Murdoch's eldest daughter, Prudence, although the pair quickly separated.[20] The marriage lasted 15 months.He subsequently married Nichola Pease, deputy chairman of JO Hambro Capital Management and a member of one of the founding families of Barclays Bank.[2][9][21][22] Nichola is younger daughter of Sir Richard Pease, 3rd Baronet, and a sister of Carolyn Varley (wife of John Varley) and Richard Pease, a funds manager.[23] He had no children by his first wife, and three children, two sons and one daughter, by his second wife. The sons were born in 1994 and 1999, and the daughter in 1997.[24]Odey reportedly enjoys shooting and fishing. He lives in Chelsea, London, and has a house in English Bicknor, where a pork sausage has been named after him by a neighbour.[21]References^ "Sunday Times Rich List".

Crispin Odey’s Unconstrained Approach to Hedge Funds

							The hedge fund manager has built a leading U.K. firm with conviction bets across multiple markets. His investors know how costly that can be.

Page 1 of 4


Crispin Odey was never big on China. The eponymous founder
    and CIO of $12.8 billion, London-based hedge fund firm Odey
    Asset Management visited the mainland in 2013 and didnt
    enjoy the experience. The jet lag was a killer, the trip felt
    like an endless series of meetings, and, most important, he
    didnt see anything he wanted to invest in. In the spring
    of 2014, however, China began to dominate Odeys thinking
    thanks to research published by Diana Choyleva, chief economist
    at Lombard Street Research in London.
Rapidly rising wages and the appreciation of the yuan meant
    that Chinas labor costs were outstripping its
    productivity, increasing by about 21 percent in dollar terms
    since the end of 2007, Choyleva asserted. In response to slower
    growth, Beijing had flooded the economy with debt, but as the
    country was growing less competitive as an exporter, that debt
    burden was becoming more dangerous. The economist estimated
    that the yuan was overvalued by as much as 10 to 15
    percent.
Odey had little direct exposure to China, but
    Choylevas work strengthened his bearish convictions,
    particularly about Europe. A hard landing in China would
    cascade through the emerging markets and make it all the more
    difficult for the European Union to resolve its debt problems
    and restore growth, leaving the U.S. as the last man standing
    in the global economy. In June 2014 he repositioned the
    investment portfolio of his $2.9 billion flagship Odey European
    Fund, becoming net short European equities and ramping up a big
    long position in the U.S. dollar. He was also short the
    Australian dollar, a proxy for Chinese growth and a reflection
    of his prognosis for the Australian economy.
Explaining his rationale in an apocalyptic letter to
    investors in December, Odey wrote, we have used all our
    monetary firepower to avoid the first downturn in 200709,
    so we are really at a dangerous point to try and counter the
    effects of a slowing China, falling commodities and EM
    incomes. If economic activity falters, he added,
    then there will be a painful round of debt
    defaults. The downturn, he warned, was in its infancy:
    It is too early to see what will happen  a change
    of this magnitude means the darkness and the mist is very
    great. 
Little did Odeys investors know how prophetic he was
    being. After a modest start to the year, the investor was
    caught off guard this spring when weak U.S. economic indicators
    caused the dollar to decline and European stocks rallied in
    response to stronger-than-expected data. The Odey European Fund
    lost a staggering 19.6 percent in April, leaving it down more
    than 18 percent for the first four months of the year.
Odey was not alone. Most hedge funds have struggled to
    generate noteworthy returns recently as quantitative easing by
    major central banks has buoyed markets; many hedge fund
    managers began this year believing the dollar was the place to
    be, only to suffer when the greenback wilted. Yet Odeys
    losses were outsize by any measure. They evoked memories of a
    misstep two decades ago, when a bearish Odey loaded up on bonds
    in anticipation of a deflationary cycle but instead saw U.S.
    interest rates spike and bond prices crash, nearly taking down
    his firm in the process.
For many other managers a one-month drawdown like
    Aprils  the worst in Odeys nearly 25-year
    hedge fund career  would spell disaster. But the colorful
    and opinionated investor has shown a remarkable ability to
    adjust and bounce back. A student of history and economics, he
    knows the truth behind the saying often attributed to economist
    John Maynard Keynes: The market can remain irrational
    longer than you can remain solvent. Although Odey still
    harbors deep misgivings about the global economy, he tapered
    his positions in late April and acknowledges that quantitative
    easing by the European Central Bank is gaining more traction
    than he anticipated.
April is a classic example of when its all
    looking like its happening and suddenly  bang
     the market says, No, its not going to be
    now; QE is going to save the day, he tells
    Institutional Investor. I get routed for a
    little while. You have to cut your losses and
    regroup.
A European equity fund taking big positions in currencies
    and making a bold prognosis for Chinas economic outlook
    is unusual, but Odey is no ordinary hedge fund manager.
    Although he started out as a long-only equity manager, he has
    insisted on investing in any market that makes sense to him,
    modeling his style on that of his initial backer, George Soros.
    He also has a history of making  and mostly winning
     bold bets. As one investor puts it, Crispin does
    what other fund managers think but are afraid to do.
    Crucially, Odey has a loyal client base  much of it
    high-net-worth individuals rather than institutional money
     that understands his strategy and respects his
    investment acumen.
Those investors have been rewarded over the long haul by
    Odeys formula. Even after the April losses, his hedge
    fund firm, one of the oldest in London, has delivered
    annualized returns of 12.51 percent since inception in 1992.
    Although he now has suffered 20 percent losses on three
    occasions in his career, Odey has navigated some of the
    toughest market tests with aplomb, performing strongly through
    the tech boom and bust in the late 1990s and early 2000s and
    excelling during the global financial crisis: His European fund
    returned 130 percent over the course of 2007 and 2008.
Statistically, most hedge funds have their best returns in
    their first three years of existence. Odey is the rare manager
    who has mostly gotten better over time. Yet his performance has
    always been volatile, something he makes no bones about.
    I make money very quickly in surprising moments, he
    says. I am also quite good at losing money.
The statement is typical Odey  at once brash and
    self-deprecating, in the manner of someone confident in his
    beliefs and comfortable in his skin. An English iconoclast,
    steeped in tradition yet skeptical of authority, he has a
    network of friends and contacts that is second to none. He also
    occupies an influential position on the political spectrum. A
    devotee of former prime minister Margaret Thatcher, Odey has
    been critical of todays Conservative Party leader, newly
    reelected Prime Minister David Cameron. He wants Britain to
    steer a much more independent course from the European Union
    and has given money to the U.K. Independence Party, which
    advocates British withdrawal from the EU. As the U.K.
    approaches a referendum on EU membership in the next two years,
    Odey will be a key player to watch.
Odey Asset Management is more than just the man. The firm is
    still in the same offices where it started  an
    early-Georgian town house on Upper Grosvenor Street, just down
    the road from the American Embassy  but the staff has
    grown to 113 people, including investment, risk management and
    research teams. The firm offers a number of different funds,
    run by a variety of portfolio managers, most notably co-head of
    research James Hanbury, who runs more than $2 billion, as well
    as Tim Bond, Feras Al-Chalabi, Michele Ragazzi and Massey
    Roborough. Hanbury and Bond have been posting strong returns
    and have their own strong investor bases.
Odey and chief executive David Fletcher, who joined the firm
    in 1995 and is responsible for managing and building the
    business, have been careful to cultivate a diverse group of
    investors who understand what they are getting when they invest
    with the CIO. You cant be a contrarian unless you
    have a client base, Fletcher says. We really like
    clients rather than tickets.
Yet despite its growth, the firm remains subject to the
    whims of its founder and CIO. Although the outfit long ago
    outgrew its Mayfair home, Odey refuses to move, necessitating
    the establishment of a second office around the corner to house
    back-office and marketing staff. Such a headstrong attitude
    makes Fletchers job more challenging, but it has given
    the firm its character and edge. As Fletcher puts it,
    Its important to have unreasonable inputs into a
    business.
ROBIN CRISPIN WILLIAM ODEY was born on October 12, 1959, in
    Hotham, a Yorkshire village near the North Sea port of Hull.
    His grandfather George Odey was a self-made man who rose from
    private secretary to the chairman to become the head of storied
    English leather goods manufacturer Barrow, Hepburn & Gale,
    which produces the iconic red leather briefcases carried by
    U.K. government ministers. His father, Richard, later worked
    there as managing director. Odey had a privileged upbringing.
    He attended Harrow School, an elite boys boarding school,
    where his father had once been head boy, a prestigious position
    akin to class president. At 16 he went up to the University of
    Oxford, graduating in 1980 with a degree in history and
    economics from Christ Church college.
He moved to London and with the encouragement of his
    grandfather trained to become a barrister, but he was quickly
    pulled in a different direction. His father lost his job over
    an accounting scandal at a tannery in Scotland and went on to
    lose money in a series of failed ventures; he survived on
    handouts from Odeys grandfather that were just enough to
    keep the creditors at bay. The losses forced Odey to sell the
    family home and left him with a strong desire to go out and
    make his own fortune, which to him meant one thing: finance. At
    the time, he was living with a friend who was a stockbroker in
    the City of London. I was just a poor lawyer, and he was
    a rich stockbroker, Odey recalls. The friend told him,
    Crispin, you could do this standing on your
    head.

Who are you calling mindless, Mr Odey?

Crispin Odey is not a big fan of index funds. Odey, a City of London hedge fund manager and darling of the financial media, whose net worth at the last count was put at around £900 million, recently complained that “naturally skilled investors are being driven out by mindless passive investing”.
Alas, what natural skill Odey may or may not possess appears to have deserted him in 2016. His flagship fund — Odey European Inc. — has apparently reported a loss of 49.5% for the calendar year. Yes, you read that correctly: 49.5%. Indeed it could have been worse; the fund was apparently down 60% at the end of September.
As Bloomberg’s Lisa Abramowicz has noted, Odey hardly put a foot right all year:
“For example, he believed that UK stocks could slump 80% after Britain’s vote to exit the European Union, but they’ve rallied by 15.5% since then. He bet that shares of Ashmore Group and Anglo American PLC would fall in March; they rallied more than 10% in the first 14 days of the month alone.”
To explain how catastrophic this fund’s performance was you need to put it into context. Last year’s financial markets were almost universally benign. It was a year, in short, in which it was hard not to make money. Not only did Odey manage it; he lost his investors almost half of their money. Simply to recoup those losses the fund will need to double in size.
Of course, investors entrust hedge fund managers with their money in the hope that they will deliver performance over and above market returns. The reality is that hedge funds have now underperformed low-cost index funds for seven years in succession.
Dan McCrum in the FT has compared the performance of two different strategies over the past ten years — 1. investing $100 in hedge funds, and 2. putting $60 in US stocks and $40 in Vanguard’s Total Bond Fund. Using the dual index fund approach, that $100 investment would have turned into $184, while the average hedge fund investor would be left with $159.
McCrum describes the hedge fund sector as “the premium part of the asset management industry, cosseting its sharpest minds in the most luxurious offices”. It certainly commands premium fees and charges. In return, investors think they’re receiving a premium product, like a designer suit or a high-performance sports car — something, let’s face it, with social cachet. 
In fact the real must-have investment vehicle has turned out to be a plain, dowdy and cheap-as-chips index tracker.
To quote William Bernstein: “You’re not going to impress the crowd at your country club by telling them you own shares of an index fund. Let them laugh; the joke’s on them.” It certainly was last year.

Early life[edit]
Odey was born in east Yorkshire, the only son of (George) Richard Odey.[5] In 1980, his sister Caroline Jane Odey married Hon. Henry David Montgomery (heir apparent to the viscountcy), the son of David Montgomery, 2nd Viscount Montgomery of Alamein, and they have three children.[6]
He was educated at Harrow School, where his father had been head boy, and graduated from Christ Church, Oxford in 1980 with a degree in history and economics.
His father was from a family of Yorkshire industrialists, and his grandfather George Odey, "a formidable bully", had been the Conservative MP for Beverley.[7] His mother was from the "prominent" Clitherow family.[7]
Soon after graduation, he found out that his father had huge debts, and the trustees made him responsible for Hotham Hall, a 4,000-acre estate that had been in his mother's family since 1720.[7] Aged 23, he sold everything.[7] According to Odey, his father was a "wastrel from beginning to end", and survived on handouts from his son.[7]
Early career[edit]
After university he qualified as a barrister but instead joined Framlington fund managers, leaving to work for Barings International where he managed the Baring European Growth Trust. He ran continental European pension funds at Barings and at Framlington.[2][4][8]
Odey Asset Management[edit]
Odey founded Odey Asset Management in 1991.[8] George Soros was one of the original investors, seeding Odey $150 million.[4] He suffered large losses in 1994 when the Federal Reserve unexpectedly lifted interest rates (one of his funds lost 44 per cent of its value), but went on to thrive, for instance by foreseeing that the value of insurers would rise after the September 11 attacks on New York in 2001.[4][9]
Through the early part of the 2000s Odey worked closely with Hugh Hendry, whom he had recruited and who ran Odey's top performing Continental Europe Fund. Hendry left in 2005 to establish Eclectica Asset Management. In reference to Hendry, Odey himself said: "Odey in the 1990s was a one-man band; Odey in the 2000s was a two-man band."[4]
Odey came to wide attention in 2008 when he paid himself £28 million after successfully anticipating the credit crunch.[9] That year his return was 54.8 per cent.[4] He had been bearish about the position of banks for a number of years, shorting Bradford & Bingley as early as 2005, questioning the German landesbanks and warning consistently about the dangers of debt and inflated house prices. He continued his short positions into early 2009 but in April took longer positions as he predicted the market rally of that year.[2] The Times newspaper selected Odey as a "Business Big Shot" in 2008.[10]
In May 2009 Odey attracted some controversy for saying in The Times that he would leave the country to avoid paying 50% income tax.[11]
He was at the centre of further controversy when it was suggested that he financially backed anti-EU campaigners in the Irish referendum on the Lisbon Treaty[12] while some hedge funds had taken out specific bets on the insolvency of the country in the event that the vote not be carried.[13] The Treaty passed by a margin of 67.1 per cent to 32.9 per cent.[14] Odey denied that he had funded the Libertas 'no' campaign in faxes issued to RTÉ and TV3.[15]
In May 2010, Odey Asset Management formed a new investment management firm with Geneva’s Bruellan Wealth Management called Odey Bruellan.
Odey Asset Management's Odey European Inc. fund was ranked No. 5 on Bloomberg's 2012 list of the 100 Top-Performing Large Hedge Funds.[16]
In 2016, it was reported that Odey saw his personal fortune plummet by £200 million after profits at Odey Asset Management suffered a significant decline. His salary was slashed as profits were down nearly 45% from the previous year.[17][18] Later that year, his hedge fun won about 15% of its value following the results of Brexit.[19]
Personal life[edit]
Odey was briefly married to Rupert Murdoch's eldest daughter, Prudence, although the pair quickly separated.[20] The marriage lasted 15 months.
He subsequently married Nichola Pease, deputy chairman of JO Hambro Capital Management and a member of one of the founding families of Barclays Bank.[2][9][21][22] Nichola is younger daughter of Sir Richard Pease, 3rd Baronet, and a sister of Carolyn Varley (wife of John Varley) and Richard Pease, a funds manager.[23] He had no children by his first wife, and three children, two sons and one daughter, by his second wife. The sons were born in 1994 and 1999, and the daughter in 1997.[24]
Odey reportedly enjoys shooting and fishing. He lives in Chelsea, London, and has a house in English Bicknor, where a pork sausage has been named after him by a neighbour.[21]

In May 2009 Odey attracted some controversy for saying in The Times that he would leave the country to avoid paying 50% income tax.[11]
He was at the centre of further controversy when it was suggested that he financially backed anti-EU campaigners in the Irish referendum on the Lisbon Treaty[12] while some hedge funds had taken out specific bets on the insolvency of the country in the event that the vote not be carried.[13] The Treaty passed by a margin of 67.1 per cent to 32.9 per cent.[14] Odey denied that he had funded the Libertas 'no' campaign in faxes issued to RTÉ and TV3.[15]
In May 2010, Odey Asset Management formed a new investment management firm with Geneva’s Bruellan Wealth Management called Odey Bruellan.
Odey Asset Management's Odey European Inc. fund was ranked No. 5 on Bloomberg's 2012 list of the 100 Top-Performing Large Hedge Funds.[16]
In 2016, it was reported that Odey saw his personal fortune plummet by £200 million after profits at Odey Asset Management suffered a significant decline. His salary was slashed as profits were down nearly 45% from the previous year.[17][18] Later that year, his hedge fun won about 15% of its value following the results of Brexit.[19]
Personal life[edit]
Odey was briefly married to Rupert Murdoch's eldest daughter, Prudence, although the pair quickly separated.[20] The marriage lasted 15 months.
He subsequently married Nichola Pease, deputy chairman of JO Hambro Capital Management and a member of one of the founding families of Barclays Bank.[2][9][21][22] Nichola is younger daughter of Sir Richard Pease, 3rd Baronet, and a sister of Carolyn Varley (wife of John Varley) and Richard Pease, a funds manager.[23] He had no children by his first wife, and three children, two sons and one daughter, by his second wife. The sons were born in 1994 and 1999, and the daughter in 1997.[24]
Odey reportedly enjoys shooting and fishing. He lives in Chelsea, London, and has a house in English Bicknor, where a pork sausage has been named after him by a neighbour.[21]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
