Wealth Planning

At Paradigm Financial Partners, we adopt a value based approach to retirement income and estate legacy planning. We know that it is important to first understand more about our clients and that means their vision, values and goals. Only with this greater knowledge and collaborative efforts, will we be able to help our clients build an effective plan that they will readily adopt as their own.
The planning process is the foundation or cornerstone of our partnership with our clients. It provides the framework to build wealth management and wealth insurance product solutions.
The plans are highly customized or tailored and no two plans are identical.
 

Business ClientsIndividual Clients



With business clients, we are looking at providing the following services:
A review of corporate structure:
	Recent trend to Limited Liability Companies instead of S corporations.Addition of C corporations as Management Companies.The focus is asset protection, fringe benefit opportunities and tax shifting strategies.

A close look at Discriminatory Executive Benefit plans including golden handcuffs and golden parachute plans as part of key employee retention and enhanced retirement income.Consideration for Business Succession and Exit Planning Strategies. Right now, there has typically not been much focus on the future and how the older generation will retire. The key is to plan well ahead and start funding a future buy out where both older and younger principals fund this future liability.Examination of all Tax Qualified Planning options to see whether funding these plans with a 100% current tax deduction, compound growth and income taxable distributions makes sense.Feasibility of adding a Captive Property and Casualty Insurance company (IRC section 831 (b) of the IRS regulations to see if this innovative strategy makes sense as a way of providing additional protection against losses outside the scope of the typical P&C contracts as well as a way to build surplus and lower taxes.

 
With individual clients or the business owners personal planning, we have a number of planning approaches that we employ:
The Roadmap planning analysis that looks at retirement, legacy planning and survivor’s income needs.Paradigm Planning Squared allows clients to look through a single portal to view all of their assets with daily automatic updates. This planning tool provides a Monte Carlo approach based on varying historical returns by asset class. There is also outstanding reporting capabilities.

We look forward to helping you in the above areas where you experience first hand our high level of communication and care that we feel for our clients.
