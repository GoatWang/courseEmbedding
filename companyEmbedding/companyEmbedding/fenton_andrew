Fabric is sold by the yard. A yard is measured as 36 inches in length by the standard width of the roll. For example, if you purchase 1 yard of a fabric with a width of 54-inches, you will receive a piece of fabric which is 36 inches long by 54 inches wide.

All stock fabrics ship within 48 hours.  We will confirm availability upon receipt of your order.   If you prefer to check stock prior to placing an order, please email us the manufacturer, the pattern name or number, the color and the quantity.  We will get back to you immediately with stock information.
 



Limit 20 swatches per order. US addresses only.
Our fabric swatch is a memo sample ranging from 4 " x 6" to 12" x 18" in size.  The sizes are cut randomly.  We are unable to order specific sizes.  If you need a large sample, we recommend ordering one whole yard.


Samples are not guaranteed for dye lot.  If you need to match a specific dye lot, please request a cut for approval with your fabric order.
All swatches are shipped by first class mail.  Please allow 7-10 days for transit time.  Swatches normally ship within 48-72 hours upon receipt of your order.  Occasionally, we might have back-orders, in which case we will advise you of the estimated ship time.


If you no longer need the sample, a return envelope is provided for your convenience.   This eliminates waste and saves the environment.  You are not obligated to return the sample.
