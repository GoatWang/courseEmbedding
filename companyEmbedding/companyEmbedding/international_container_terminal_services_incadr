History[edit]
ICTSI was established by Filipino businessman Enrique K. Razon, whose family has been managing harbors in the Philippines for three generations, in connection with the bidding for the Manila International Container Terminal (MICT) contract. In February 2015, Forbes magazine named Razon the Third Richest Man in the Philippines, with a personal wealth of $5.2 billion.[6]
In May 1988, the Philippine Ports Authority awarded the MICT contract to ICTSI, which started its operations of MICT on June 12, 1988. In March 1992, ICTSI's shares were listed on the Manila and Makati Stock Exchanges (now the Philippine Stock Exchange) following the initial public offering of its shares.
The principal business of ICTSI is the management, operation, and development of container terminals. The company directly operates the MICT at the Port of Manila. In addition to its core container terminal activities, ICTSI has developed an inland container depot in Calamba, Laguna linked via rail to the MICT. The company has entered into a joint venture with a local company to develop a container terminal in Batangas.
After consolidating its base and flagship operations at the MICT, ICTSI launched an aggressive international and domestic expansion program in 1994 and now has operations in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, China, Colombia, Congo, Croatia, Ecuador, Georgia, Honduras, Indonesia, Iraq, Madagascar, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan and Poland.
In 2010, ICTSI attempted to enter the United States market when it signed a 25-year lease to operate Terminal 6, the sole shipping container terminal at the Port of Portland, Oregon. Workers at the terminal claimed that ICTSI "decimated labor relations with its Portland workforce by creating a work atmosphere of hostility, based on a model of employee intimidation that is ICTSI's method of operation around the world."[7] In February 2014, a safety inspection by the Occupational Health and Safety Administration "found ICTSI Oregon to be in violation of more than a dozen worker safety codes, such as not informing employees about potential exposure to airborne lead and having workers operate machinery that lacked proper guards against flying objects." OSHA imposed fines of $18,360 against ICTSI Oregon for the violations.[8] In October 2013 [9] and in February 2015, the terminal's primary customer, Hanjin, announced that it would cease calling on the ICTSI terminal, taking between 65-80% of the terminal's business to other ports.[10] Hapag-Lloyd ceased service to the terminal in April 2015,[11] and Westwood Shipping Lines ceased service in May 2016, with no ships calling since.[12] In February 2017, the Port of Portland and ICTSI announced they had reached a deal to end their lease agreement early.[13]
In September 2012, Capital Group Companies CGC has acquired 8.7% of the company shares.[2]
Asia - Pacific[edit]
Manila International Container Terminal, Manila, Philippines
In 1988, ICTSI won in an international tender a 25+25-year concession to manage, operate and develop the Manila International Container Terminal (MICT), ICTSI’s flagship operation and the Philippines’ leading international trading gateway. ICTSI’s responsibilities include: port management, operations and administration, port development and construction including port planning and programming supply of all equipment, and investment risk.
The MICT is one of the three terminals in the Port of Manila, the core of the Philippine port system. The MICT is located between the North and the South Harbors, protruding westward into the Manila Bay at the mouth of the Pasig River, the city's major waterway. A dedicated container terminal, the MICT mainly handles international containerized cargo. ICTSI also handles bulk cargo at the MICT basin anchorage.
The MICT today is the Philippines' largest international container terminal in terms of volume and capacity, capturing 65 percent market share in the Port of Manila. Guaranteed efficiencies make it the most efficient in the country, at par with the best terminals in the world. Moreover, seamlessly integrated operational and administrative systems make it the most modern and efficient terminal in the Philippines.

ICTSI and CMA Terminals ink agreement for a 25% stake in Lekki International Container Terminal Services LFTZ Enterprise in Nigeria

International Container Terminal Services, Inc. (ICTSI) and CMA Terminals, a 100 percent subsidiary of the CMA CGM Group, are proud to announce their future cooperation in Nigeria by signing an agreement for ICTSI to sell 25 percent of the container terminal in Nigeria, Lekki International Container Terminal Services LFTZ Enterprise (LICTSLE), to CMA Terminals.  

This adds one further major milestone that has been achieved since the signing of the sub- concession for the terminal in 2012.

LICTSLE will be providing a solution to the current congestion in the local market in Nigeria, and overall serve as regional transshipment hub in West Africa, allowing the countries connected with the hub to grow sustainably.  

With a straight-line quay of 1200m and a yard area of 66 hectares, this modern facility, which is expected to be fully operational in 2017, provides the market with an annual capacity of 2.5 million TEUs. This capacity will serve the Nigerian market in the long run, and will ease capacity pressure. The terminal is designed to allow for further capacity growth exceeding the initial 2.5 million TEU.

The advantageous location, 60 km east of metropolitan Lagos, will be combined with state-of-the-art facilities including 14 post-Panamax quay cranes.

Farid Salem, CMA CGM Group executive officer declares: “We are very pleased with this cooperation with ICTSI. This major future investment is undoubtedly a great opportunity for the CMA CGM Group through its dedicated subsidiary CMA Terminals, to further increase its presence in Nigeria, a country in continuous development.”

Jens O. Floe, ICTSI Senior Vice President responsible for the Africa Region says, “The involvement of the CMA CGM Group shows the interest in West Africa and the confidence there is in the Nigerian market with the product we provide as we will strive to become the supplier of choice in West Africa as the principal transshipment hub, giving our customers a sustainable competitive advantage in the market range.”

History[edit]
ICTSI was established by Filipino businessman Enrique K. Razon, whose family has been managing harbors in the Philippines for three generations, in connection with the bidding for the Manila International Container Terminal (MICT) contract. In February 2015, Forbes magazine named Razon the Third Richest Man in the Philippines, with a personal wealth of $5.2 billion.[6]
In May 1988, the Philippine Ports Authority awarded the MICT contract to ICTSI, which started its operations of MICT on June 12, 1988. In March 1992, ICTSI's shares were listed on the Manila and Makati Stock Exchanges (now the Philippine Stock Exchange) following the initial public offering of its shares.
The principal business of ICTSI is the management, operation, and development of container terminals. The company directly operates the MICT at the Port of Manila. In addition to its core container terminal activities, ICTSI has developed an inland container depot in Calamba, Laguna linked via rail to the MICT. The company has entered into a joint venture with a local company to develop a container terminal in Batangas.
After consolidating its base and flagship operations at the MICT, ICTSI launched an aggressive international and domestic expansion program in 1994 and now has operations in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, China, Colombia, Congo, Croatia, Ecuador, Georgia, Honduras, Indonesia, Iraq, Madagascar, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan and Poland.
In 2010, ICTSI attempted to enter the United States market when it signed a 25-year lease to operate Terminal 6, the sole shipping container terminal at the Port of Portland, Oregon. Workers at the terminal claimed that ICTSI "decimated labor relations with its Portland workforce by creating a work atmosphere of hostility, based on a model of employee intimidation that is ICTSI's method of operation around the world."[7] In February 2014, a safety inspection by the Occupational Health and Safety Administration "found ICTSI Oregon to be in violation of more than a dozen worker safety codes, such as not informing employees about potential exposure to airborne lead and having workers operate machinery that lacked proper guards against flying objects." OSHA imposed fines of $18,360 against ICTSI Oregon for the violations.[8] In October 2013 [9] and in February 2015, the terminal's primary customer, Hanjin, announced that it would cease calling on the ICTSI terminal, taking between 65-80% of the terminal's business to other ports.[10] Hapag-Lloyd ceased service to the terminal in April 2015,[11] and Westwood Shipping Lines ceased service in May 2016, with no ships calling since.[12] In February 2017, the Port of Portland and ICTSI announced they had reached a deal to end their lease agreement early.[13]
In September 2012, Capital Group Companies CGC has acquired 8.7% of the company shares.[2]

Manila International Container Terminal, Manila, Philippines
In 1988, ICTSI won in an international tender a 25+25-year concession to manage, operate and develop the Manila International Container Terminal (MICT), ICTSI’s flagship operation and the Philippines’ leading international trading gateway. ICTSI’s responsibilities include: port management, operations and administration, port development and construction including port planning and programming supply of all equipment, and investment risk.
The MICT is one of the three terminals in the Port of Manila, the core of the Philippine port system. The MICT is located between the North and the South Harbors, protruding westward into the Manila Bay at the mouth of the Pasig River, the city's major waterway. A dedicated container terminal, the MICT mainly handles international containerized cargo. ICTSI also handles bulk cargo at the MICT basin anchorage.
The MICT today is the Philippines' largest international container terminal in terms of volume and capacity, capturing 65 percent market share in the Port of Manila. Guaranteed efficiencies make it the most efficient in the country, at par with the best terminals in the world. Moreover, seamlessly integrated operational and administrative systems make it the most modern and efficient terminal in the Philippines.

History[edit]
ICTSI was established by Filipino businessman Enrique K. Razon, whose family has been managing harbors in the Philippines for three generations, in connection with the bidding for the Manila International Container Terminal (MICT) contract. In February 2015, Forbes magazine named Razon the Third Richest Man in the Philippines, with a personal wealth of $5.2 billion.[6]
In May 1988, the Philippine Ports Authority awarded the MICT contract to ICTSI, which started its operations of MICT on June 12, 1988. In March 1992, ICTSI's shares were listed on the Manila and Makati Stock Exchanges (now the Philippine Stock Exchange) following the initial public offering of its shares.
The principal business of ICTSI is the management, operation, and development of container terminals. The company directly operates the MICT at the Port of Manila. In addition to its core container terminal activities, ICTSI has developed an inland container depot in Calamba, Laguna linked via rail to the MICT. The company has entered into a joint venture with a local company to develop a container terminal in Batangas.
After consolidating its base and flagship operations at the MICT, ICTSI launched an aggressive international and domestic expansion program in 1994 and now has operations in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, China, Colombia, Congo, Croatia, Ecuador, Georgia, Honduras, Indonesia, Iraq, Madagascar, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan and Poland.
In 2010, ICTSI attempted to enter the United States market when it signed a 25-year lease to operate Terminal 6, the sole shipping container terminal at the Port of Portland, Oregon. Workers at the terminal claimed that ICTSI "decimated labor relations with its Portland workforce by creating a work atmosphere of hostility, based on a model of employee intimidation that is ICTSI's method of operation around the world."[7] In February 2014, a safety inspection by the Occupational Health and Safety Administration "found ICTSI Oregon to be in violation of more than a dozen worker safety codes, such as not informing employees about potential exposure to airborne lead and having workers operate machinery that lacked proper guards against flying objects." OSHA imposed fines of $18,360 against ICTSI Oregon for the violations.[8] In October 2013 [9] and in February 2015, the terminal's primary customer, Hanjin, announced that it would cease calling on the ICTSI terminal, taking between 65-80% of the terminal's business to other ports.[10] Hapag-Lloyd ceased service to the terminal in April 2015,[11] and Westwood Shipping Lines ceased service in May 2016, with no ships calling since.[12] In February 2017, the Port of Portland and ICTSI announced they had reached a deal to end their lease agreement early.[13]
In September 2012, Capital Group Companies CGC has acquired 8.7% of the company shares.[2]
Asia - Pacific[edit]
Manila International Container Terminal, Manila, Philippines
In 1988, ICTSI won in an international tender a 25+25-year concession to manage, operate and develop the Manila International Container Terminal (MICT), ICTSI’s flagship operation and the Philippines’ leading international trading gateway. ICTSI’s responsibilities include: port management, operations and administration, port development and construction including port planning and programming supply of all equipment, and investment risk.
The MICT is one of the three terminals in the Port of Manila, the core of the Philippine port system. The MICT is located between the North and the South Harbors, protruding westward into the Manila Bay at the mouth of the Pasig River, the city's major waterway. A dedicated container terminal, the MICT mainly handles international containerized cargo. ICTSI also handles bulk cargo at the MICT basin anchorage.
The MICT today is the Philippines' largest international container terminal in terms of volume and capacity, capturing 65 percent market share in the Port of Manila. Guaranteed efficiencies make it the most efficient in the country, at par with the best terminals in the world. Moreover, seamlessly integrated operational and administrative systems make it the most modern and efficient terminal in the Philippines.
New Container Terminal 1, Subic Bay Freeport, Olongapo
In June 2007, the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (SBMA) awarded SBITC the concession to operate the New Container Terminal – 1 (NCT – 1) at the Subic Bay Freeport.
After transferring its operations from the NSD Terminal to NCT – 1, SBITC began operating NCT – 1 in April 2008. The terminal was formally inaugurated in May of the same year.
New Container Terminal 2, Subic Bay Freeport, Olongapo
In September 2011, the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority awarded the Contract for the Operation and Management of the New Container Terminal 2 (NCT-2) to ICTSI Subic, Inc.
NCT-2 is the second phase of the Subic port modernization project co-funded by the Japanese government through the Japan Bank for International Cooperation.
Bauan International Port, Batangas
In 1997, ICTSI formed the Bauan International Port, Inc. (BIPI), a joint venture company with Atlantic Gulf and the Pacific Co. (AG&P), to manage, operate and develop the 20-hectares Bauan Terminal. Marubeni Philippines later joined the consortium.

(YRDICTL) and operated Berths 38 and 39, mostly handling domestic cargo at that time, and gradually building up foreign trade cargo and reached over 50 percent in 2013.
In May 2014, the Chinese government, through the Shandong Ministry of Commerce, approved the consolidation of port services in Yantai. The move enabled ICTSI to purchase 51 percent shares of DP World Yantai Co. Ltd., which operates in Berths 51, 52, 61 and 62. DP World Yantai Co. Ltd. was renamed to Yantai International Container Terminals Ltd. (YICT) and handles all foreign trade cargo in the Yantai market exclusively.

ICTSI’s responsibilities include: port management, operations and administration, port development and construction including port planning and programming supply of all equipment, and investment risk.
The MICT is one of the three terminals in the Port of Manila, the core of the Philippine port system. The MICT is located between the North and the South Harbors, protruding westward into the Manila Bay at the mouth of the Pasig River, the city's major waterway. A dedicated container terminal, the MICT mainly handles international containerized cargo. ICTSI also handles bulk cargo at the MICT basin anchorage.
The MICT today is the Philippines' largest international container terminal in terms of volume and capacity, capturing 65 percent market share in the Port of Manila. Guaranteed efficiencies make it the most efficient in the country, at par with the best terminals in the world. Moreover, seamlessly integrated operational and administrative systems make it the most modern and efficient terminal in the Philippines.

Where applicable, a project is considered as such until the end of construction and ramp-up to full capacity (with the exception of mining projects, where the date of commissioning signifies the end of the project). Projects must have a:  a) Start date b) Estimate for completion c) Initial investment estimate  Data For state-owned projects, initial information about the start date and estimates for completion and investment are taken from original signed contracts, along with addendums and annexes. If original contracts cannot be obtained, information is taken from public documents, presentations, news articles from BNamericas archives, and external sources. In cases where contracts are subject to approval by legislators, the start date is the date of the law or legislative approval. In the case of private projects, information is taken from public sources, such as stock exchange filings, annual reports, company presentations, third party research and press releases. In judging the timing of investment decisions for private projects, great care was taken to differentiate between large projects receiving environmental approval and proceeding directly to construction, and smaller projects where the investment decision hinges on securing financing. Best care is taken to ensure that recorded data is correct at the time of entry and that each entry is backed with a relevant source. The greatest care possible was taken to ensure consistency of information in order make a like-for-like comparison in project costs. Insofar as the figures rely on disclosure by the organization or company responsible, the figures can be considered to be conservative in nature. No attempt was made to adjust figures for inflation during the course of research or for consideration of the time value of money. Validation In the case of state-owned projects, validation is carried out where possible with either a member of the consortium, EPC contractor, a relevant state agency or advisors to either party. Currency Projects costs are measured in US dollars.
