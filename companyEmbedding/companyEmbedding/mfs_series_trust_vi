SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained via the Commission's Web site by searching for the file number, or an applicant using the Company name box, at http://www.sec.gov/​search/​search.htm or by calling (202) 551-8090.
Applicants' Representations
1. Each Trust is organized as a Massachusetts business trust and is registered under the Act as an open-end management investment company. Each Trust may consist of one or more series and may offer additional series in the future (“Funds”). MFS, a Delaware corporation, is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Start Printed Page 62471serves as the investment adviser to each Fund.[1] 

2. Some Funds, including money market Funds that rely on rule 2a-7 under the Act (“Money Market Funds”), may lend money to banks or other entities by entering into repurchase agreements, purchasing other short-term instruments, or, in the case of Funds other than the Money Market Funds, investing in the MFS Institutional Money Market Fund (“IMMF”) pursuant to rule 12d1-1 under the Act. Other Funds may borrow money from the same or similar banks for temporary purposes to satisfy redemption requests, to cover unanticipated cash shortfalls such as a trade “fail” in which cash payment for a security sold by a Fund has been delayed, or for other temporary purposes. Currently, the Trusts have a committed credit facility provided by a syndicate of lenders and uncommitted lines of credit with two separate banks (collectively, the “Loan Agreements”). The Funds also have an overdraft facility with their custodians.
3. If a Fund were to borrow money under a Loan Agreement, the Fund would pay interest on the borrowed cash at a rate which would be higher than the rate that would be earned by other (non-borrowing) Funds on investments in repurchase agreements and other short-term instruments of the same maturity as the bank loan. In addition, while bank borrowings generally can supply needed cash to cover unanticipated redemptions and sales fails, the borrowing Funds incur commitment fees and/or other charges involved in obtaining a bank loan.
4. Applicants request an order that would permit each Trust to enter into master interfund lending agreements (“Interfund Lending Agreements”) that would permit each Fund to lend and borrow money for temporary purposes directly to and from each other Fund through a credit facility (“Interfund Loan”). Applicants believe that the proposed credit facility would reduce the Funds' borrowing costs and enhance their ability to earn higher interest rates on short-term lendings. Although the proposed credit facility would reduce the Funds' need to borrow from banks, the Funds would be free to establish or renew committed lines of credit or other borrowing arrangements with unaffiliated banks.
5. Applicants anticipate that the credit facility would provide a borrowing Fund with significant savings when the cash position of the Fund is insufficient to meet temporary cash requirements. This situation could arise when redemptions exceed anticipated volumes and certain Funds have insufficient cash on hand to satisfy such redemptions. When a Fund liquidates portfolio securities to meet redemption requests, it often does not receive payment in settlement for up to three days (or longer for certain foreign transactions). The credit facility would provide a source of immediate, short-term liquidity pending settlement of the sale of portfolio securities.
6. Applicants also propose using the credit facility when a sale of securities “fails” due to circumstances such as a delay in the delivery of cash to a Fund's custodian or improper delivery instructions by the broker effecting the transaction. Sales fails may present a cash shortfall if a Fund has undertaken to purchase securities using the proceeds from the securities sold. As a result, the Fund could fail on its intended purchase due to lack of funds from the previous sale, resulting in additional cost to the Fund, or sell a security on a same-day settlement basis, earning a lower return on the investment. Use of the credit facility under these circumstances would enable the Fund to have access to immediate short-term liquidity.
7. While bank borrowings generally can supply needed cash to cover unanticipated redemptions and sales fails, under the proposed credit facility a borrowing Fund would pay lower interest rates than those offered by banks on short-term loans. In addition, Funds making short-term cash loans directly to other Funds would earn interest at a rate higher than they otherwise could obtain from investing their cash in repurchase agreements. Thus, applicants believe that the proposed credit facility would benefit both borrowing and lending Funds.
8. The interest rate charged to a Fund on any Interfund Loan (“Interfund Loan Rate”) would be the average of the “Repo Rate” and the “Bank Loan Rate,” both as defined below. The Repo Rate on any day would be the highest rate available to a lending Fund from investing in overnight repurchase agreements. The Bank Loan Rate on any day would be calculated by the “Interfund Lending Committee” (as defined below) each day an Interfund Loan is made according to a formula established by each Fund's board of trustees (“Fund Board”) intended to approximate the lowest interest rate at which bank short-term loans would be available to the Funds. The formula would be based upon a publicly available rate (e.g., Federal funds rates and/or Libor), plus an additional spread of basis points and would vary with this rate so as to reflect changing bank loan rates. The initial formula and any subsequent modifications to the formula would be subject to the approval of each Fund Board. Each Fund Board would at least annually review the continuing appropriateness of using the method of calculating the Bank Loan Rate, as well as the relationship between the Bank Loan Rate and current bank loan rates that would be available to the Funds.
9. The credit facility would be administered by investment professionals and administrative personnel from MFS (the “Interfund Lending Committee”). No portfolio manager, including research analysts with portfolio management responsibilities, for any Fund will serve as a member of the Interfund Lending Committee. Under the proposed credit facility, senior members of MFS' investment management team and senior administrative and management personnel (the “Investment Management Committee”) or a portfolio manager for each participating Fund could provide standing instructions to the Interfund Lending Committee that the participating Fund is authorized to participate as a borrower or lender; alternatively, the portfolio manager could provide instructions from time to time as to when the Fund wishes to participate as a borrower or a lender. The Interfund Lending Committee, no more frequently than once daily in the morning of each business day that a transaction is requested under the credit facility pursuant to instructions (an “Interfund Lending Day”), would request and collect data on the uninvested cash and borrowing requirements of all participating Funds from the Funds' custodian. Once it has determined the aggregate amount of cash available for loans and borrowing demand, the Interfund Lending Committee would allocate loans among borrowing Funds without any further communication from a Fund's portfolio managers. Applicants expect there will typically be more available uninvested cash each day than borrowing demand. After the Interfund Lending Committee Start Printed Page 62472has allocated cash for Interfund Loans, MFS' cash desk personnel would invest any remaining cash in accordance with the Funds' investment policies and practices in the ordinary course.
10. The Interfund Lending Committee would allocate borrowing demand and cash available for lending among the Funds on what the Interfund Lending Committee believes to be an equitable basis, subject to certain administrative considerations applicable to all participating Funds, such as the time of filing requests to participate, minimum loan lot sizes, the need to minimize the number of transactions and associated administrative costs, and the amount of the existing borrowings outstanding. To reduce transaction costs, each Interfund Loan normally would be allocated in a manner intended to minimize the number of participants necessary to complete the loan transaction. The method of allocation and related administrative procedures would be approved by each Fund Board, including a majority of trustees who are not “interested persons” of the Fund, as defined in section 2(a)(19) of the Act (“Independent Fund Board Members”), to ensure that both borrowing and lending Funds participate on an equitable basis.
11. The Interfund Lending Committee would (a) monitor the Interfund Loan Rates charged and the other terms and conditions of the Interfund Loans; (b) limit the borrowings and loans entered into by each Fund to ensure that they comply with the Fund's investment policies and limitations; (c) ensure equitable treatment of each Fund; and (d) directly or through MFS make quarterly reports to each Fund Board concerning any transactions by the Funds under the credit facility and the Interfund Loan Rate charged.
12. MFS, through the Interfund Lending Committee, would administer the credit facility as a fiduciary as part of its duties under the investment management contract with each Fund and provide administrative support pursuant to the administrative services agreement between each Fund and MFS and would receive no additional fee as compensation for its services.
13. No Fund may participate in the credit facility unless: (a) The Fund has obtained shareholder approval for its participation, if such approval is required by law; (b) the Fund has fully disclosed all material information concerning the credit facility in its prospectus and/or statement of additional information (“SAI”); and (c) the Fund's participation in the credit facility is consistent with its investment objectives, limitations and organizational documents.
14. In connection with the credit facility, applicants request an order under (a) section 6(c) of the Act granting relief from sections 18(f) and 21(b) of the Act; (b) section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act granting relief from section 12(d)(1) of the Act; (c) sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the Act granting relief from sections 17(a)(1), 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Act; and (d) under section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act to permit certain joint arrangements.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Section 17(a)(3) of the Act generally prohibits any affiliated person, or affiliated person of an affiliated person, from borrowing money or other property from a registered investment company. Section 21(b) of the Act generally prohibits any registered management company from lending money or other property to any person if that person controls or is under common control with the company. Section 2(a)(3)(C) of the Act defines an “affiliated person” of another person, in part, to be any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, the other person. Applicants state that the Funds may be under common control by virtue of having MFS as their common investment adviser and/or by having a common Fund Board and officers.
2. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that an exemptive order may be granted where an exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Section 17(b) of the Act authorizes the Commission to exempt a proposed transaction from section 17(a) provided that the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned, and the transaction is consistent with the policy of the investment company as recited in its registration statement and reports filed under the Act and with the general purposes of the Act. Applicants believe that the proposed arrangements satisfy these standards for the reasons discussed below.
3. Applicants submit that sections 17(a)(3) and 21(b) of the Act were intended to prevent a party with strong potential adverse interests to, and some influence over the investment decisions of, a registered investment company from causing or inducing the investment company to engage in lending transactions that unfairly inure to the benefit of such party and that are detrimental to the best interests of the investment company and its shareholders. Applicants assert that the proposed credit facility transactions do not raise these concerns because: (a) MFS, through the Interfund Lending Committee, would administer the program as a fiduciary; (b) all Interfund Loans would consist only of uninvested cash reserves that the lending Fund otherwise would invest in short-term repurchase agreements or other short-term instruments; (c) the Interfund Loans would not involve a greater risk than such other investments; (d) the lending Fund would receive interest at a rate higher than it could otherwise obtain through such other investments; and (e) the borrowing Fund would pay interest at a rate lower than otherwise available to it under its bank loan agreements. Moreover, applicants believe that the other terms and conditions in the application would effectively preclude the possibility of any Fund obtaining an undue advantage over any other Fund.
4. Section 17(a)(1) of the Act generally prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or an affiliated person of an affiliated person, from selling any securities or other property to the company. Section 17(a)(2) of the Act generally prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such a person, from purchasing securities or other property from the investment company. Section 12(d)(1) of the Act generally makes it unlawful for a registered investment company to purchase or otherwise acquire any security issued by any other investment company except in accordance with the limitations set forth in that section.
5. Applicants state that the obligation of a borrowing Fund to repay an Interfund Loan may constitute a security for the purposes of sections 17(a)(1) and 12(d)(1). Applicants also state that any pledge of assets in connection with an Interfund Loan could be construed as a purchase of the borrowing Fund's securities or other property for purposes of section 17(a)(2) of the Act. Section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt persons or transactions from any provision of section 12(d)(1) if and to the extent such exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors. Applicants contend that the standards under sections 6(c), 17(b), and 12(d)(1)(J) are satisfied for all the reasons set forth above in support of their request for relief from sections Start Printed Page 6247317(a)(3) and 21(b) and for the reasons discussed below. Applicants also state that the requested relief from section 17(a)(2) of the Act meets the standards of section 6(c) and 17(b) because any collateral pledged to secure an Interfund Loan would be subject to the same conditions imposed by any other lender to a Fund that imposes conditions on the quality of or access to collateral for a borrowing (if the lender is another Fund) or the same or less restrictive conditions (in any other circumstance). Any collateral pledged to secure an Interfund Loan will be available solely to secure repayment of such Interfund Loan.
6. Applicants state that, among other things, section 12(d)(1) was intended to prevent the pyramiding of investment companies in order to avoid imposing on investors additional and duplicative costs and fees attendant upon multiple layers of investment companies. Applicants submit that the proposed credit facility does not involve these abuses. Applicants note that there will be no duplicative costs or fees to the Funds or shareholders, and that MFS will receive no additional compensation for its services in administering the credit facility through the Interfund Lending Committee. Applicants also note that the entire purpose of the proposed credit facility is to provide economic benefits for all of the participating Funds and their shareholders.
7. Section 18(f)(1) of the Act prohibits open-end investment companies from issuing any senior security except that a company is permitted to borrow from any bank; provided, that immediately after the borrowing, there is asset coverage of at least 300 per centum for all borrowings of the company. Under section 18(g) of the Act, the term “senior security” includes any bond, debenture, note or similar obligation or instrument constituting a security and evidencing indebtedness. Applicants request relief from section 18(f)(1) to the limited extent necessary to implement the credit facility (because the lending Funds are not banks).
8. Applicants believe that granting relief under section 6(c) is appropriate because the Funds would remain subject to the requirement of section 18(f)(1) that all borrowings of a Fund, including combined interfund and bank borrowings, have at least 300% asset coverage. Based on the conditions and safeguards described in the application, applicants also submit that to allow the Funds to borrow from other Funds pursuant to the proposed credit facility is consistent with the purposes and policies of section 18(f)(1).
9. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act generally prohibit any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or affiliated person of an affiliated person, when acting as principal, from effecting any joint transactions in which the company participates unless the transaction is approved by the Commission. Rule 17d-1(b) provides that in passing upon applications filed under the rule, the Commission will consider whether the participation of a registered investment company in a joint enterprise on the basis proposed is consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act and the extent to which the company's participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants.
10. Applicants submit that the purpose of section 17(d) is to avoid overreaching by and unfair advantage to investment company insiders. Applicants believe that the credit facility is consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act in that it offers both reduced borrowing costs and enhanced returns on loaned funds to all participating Funds and their shareholders. Applicants note that each Fund would have an equal opportunity to borrow and lend on equal terms consistent with its investment policies and fundamental investment limitations. Applicants therefore believe that each Fund's participation in the credit facility will be on terms that are no different from or less advantageous than that of other participating Funds.
Applicants' Conditions
Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions:
1. The Interfund Loan Rate will be the average of the Repo Rate and the Bank Loan Rate.
2. On each business day that the Interfund Lending Committee considers whether to use Interfund Loans, the Interfund Lending Committee will compare the Bank Loan Rate with the Repo Rate and will make cash available for Interfund Loans only if the Interfund Loan Rate is: (a) More favorable to the lending Fund than the Repo Rate and, if applicable, the yield of any money market fund approved by the Investment Management Committee as a money market fund in which the lending Fund could otherwise invest; and (b) more favorable to the borrowing Fund than the Bank Loan Rate.
3. If a Fund has outstanding borrowings, any Interfund Loans to the Fund: (a) Will be at an interest rate equal to or lower than any outstanding bank loan; (b) will be secured at least on an equal priority basis with at least an equivalent percentage of collateral to loan value as any outstanding bank loan that requires collateral; (c) will have a maturity no longer than any outstanding bank loan (and in any event not over seven days); and (d) will provide that, if an event of default by the Fund occurs under any agreement evidencing an outstanding bank loan to the Fund, that event of default will automatically (without need for action or notice by the lending Fund) constitute an immediate event of default under the Interfund Lending Agreement entitling the lending Fund to call the Interfund Loan (and exercise all rights with respect to any collateral) and that such call will be made if the lending bank exercises its right to call its loan under its agreement with the borrowing Fund.
4. A Fund may make an unsecured borrowing through the proposed credit facility if its outstanding borrowings from all sources immediately after the interfund borrowing total 10% or less of its total assets, provided that if the Fund has a secured loan outstanding from any other lender, including but not limited to another Fund, the Fund's interfund borrowing will be secured on at least an equal priority basis with at least an equivalent percentage of collateral to loan value as any outstanding loan that requires collateral. If a Fund's total outstanding borrowings immediately after an interfund borrowing would be greater than 10% of its total assets, the Fund may borrow through the proposed credit facility only on a secured basis. A Fund may not borrow through the proposed credit facility or from any other source if its total outstanding borrowings immediately after such borrowing would be more than 331/3% of its total assets.
5. Before any Fund that has outstanding interfund borrowings may, through additional borrowings, cause its outstanding borrowings from all sources to exceed 10% of its total assets, the Fund must first secure each outstanding Interfund Loan by the pledge of segregated collateral with a market value at least equal to 102% of the outstanding principal value of the loan. If the total outstanding borrowings of a Fund with outstanding Interfund Loans exceed 10% of its total assets for any other reason (such as a decline in net asset value or because of shareholder redemptions), the Fund will within one business day thereafter: (a) Repay all its outstanding Interfund Loans; (b) reduce its outstanding indebtedness to 10% or less of its total assets; or (c) secure each outstanding Interfund Loan by the pledge of segregated collateral with a Start Printed Page 62474market value at least equal to 102% of the outstanding principal value of the loan until the Fund's total outstanding borrowings cease to exceed 10% of its total assets, at which time the collateral called for by this condition 5 shall no longer be required. Until each Interfund Loan that is outstanding at any time that a Fund's total outstanding borrowings exceeds 10% is repaid or the Fund's total outstanding borrowings cease to exceed 10% of its total assets, the Fund will mark the value of the collateral to market each day and will pledge such additional collateral as is necessary to maintain the market value of the collateral that secures each outstanding Interfund Loan at least equal to 102% of the outstanding principal value of the Interfund Loan.
6. No Fund may lend to another Fund through the proposed credit facility if the loan would cause its aggregate outstanding loans through the proposed credit facility to exceed 15% of the lending Fund's current net assets at the time of the loan.
7. A Fund's Interfund Loans to any one Fund shall not exceed 5% of the lending Fund's net assets.
8. The duration of Interfund Loans will be limited to no more than the number of days required to receive payment for securities sold, up to a maximum of seven days. Loans effected within seven days of each other will be treated as separate loan transactions for purposes of this condition.
9. The Fund's borrowings through the proposed credit facility, as measured on the day when the most recent loan was made, will not exceed the greater of 125% of the Fund's total net cash redemptions or 102% of sales fails for the preceding seven calendar days.
10. Each Interfund Loan may be called on one business day's notice by a lending Fund and may be repaid on any day by a borrowing Fund.
11. A Fund's participation in the proposed credit facility must be consistent with its investment objectives and limitations and organizational documents.
12. The Interfund Lending Committee, on each Interfund Lending Day, will calculate total Fund borrowing and lending demand through the proposed credit facility, and allocate loans on an equitable basis among the Funds, without the intervention of any portfolio manager of participating Funds. The Interfund Lending Committee will not solicit cash for loans from any Fund or prospectively publish or disseminate the amount of current borrowing demand to the Investment Management Committee or portfolio managers of the Funds. Once it determines the aggregate amount of cash available for loans and borrowing demand, the Interfund Lending Committee will allocate loans among borrowing Funds without any further communication from a Fund's portfolio managers. If there is more available uninvested cash than borrowing demand on any Interfund Lending Day, any remaining cash will be invested in accordance with the Funds' investment policies and practices in the ordinary course.
13. The Interfund Lending Committee will monitor the Interfund Loan Rates charged and the other terms and conditions of the Interfund Loans and will make a quarterly report to each Fund Board concerning the participation of the Funds in the proposed credit facility and the terms and other conditions of any extensions of credit under the credit facility.
14. Each Fund Board, including a majority of the Independent Fund Board Members, will:
(a) Review, no less frequently than quarterly, each Fund's participation in the proposed credit facility during the preceding quarter for compliance with the conditions of any order permitting such transactions;
(b) Review at least annually the continuing appropriateness of the method used to calculate the Bank Loan Rate; and
(c) Review, no less frequently than annually, the continuing appropriateness of each Fund's participation in the proposed credit facility.
15. In the event an Interfund Loan is not paid according to its terms and such default is not cured within two business days from its maturity or from the time the lending Fund makes a demand for payment under the provisions of the Interfund Lending Agreement, MFS will promptly refer such loan for arbitration to an independent arbitrator who was selected by each Fund Board involved in the loan who will serve as arbitrator of disputes concerning Interfund Loans.[2] 
           The arbitrator will resolve any dispute promptly, and the arbitrator's decision will be binding on both Funds. The arbitrator will submit, at least annually, a written report to each Fund Board setting forth a description of the nature of any dispute and the actions taken by the Funds to resolve the dispute.
16. Each Fund will maintain and preserve for a period of not less than six years from the end of the fiscal year in which any transaction by it under the proposed credit facility occurred, the first two years in an easily accessible place, written records of all such transactions setting forth a description of the terms of the transactions, including the amount, the maturity and the Interfund Loan Rate, the rate of interest available at the time on overnight repurchase agreements and commercial bank borrowings, and such other information presented to the Fund Board in connection with the review required by conditions 13 and 14.
17. MFS, through or on behalf of the Interfund Lending Committee, will prepare and submit to the Fund Board for review an initial report describing how the proposed credit facility will operate and the procedures to be implemented to ensure that all Funds are treated fairly. For each calendar quarter after the commencement of the credit facility, the Interfund Lending Committee will report on the operations of the credit facility at the Fund Board's quarterly meetings.
Each Fund's chief compliance officer (“CCO”), as defined in rule 38a-1(4) under the Act, shall prepare an annual report for its Fund Board each year that the Fund participates in the proposed credit facility, that evaluates the Fund's compliance with the terms and conditions of the application and the procedures established to achieve such compliance. Each Fund's CCO will also annually file a certification pursuant to Item 77Q3 of Form N-SAR as such Form may be revised, amended, or superseded from time to time for each year that the Fund participates in the proposed credit facility, that certifies that the Fund and MFS have established procedures reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the terms and conditions of the order. In particular, such certification will address procedures designed to achieve the following objectives:
(a) That the Interfund Loan Rate is higher than the Repo Rate, but lower than the Bank Loan Rate;
(b) Compliance with the collateral requirements as set forth in the Interfund Loan Borrowing Conditions;
(c) Compliance with the percentage limitations on interfund borrowing and lending;
(d) Allocation of interfund borrowing and lending demand in an equitable manner and in accordance with procedures established by the Fund Board; and
(e) That the interest rate on any Interfund Loan does not exceed the interest rate on any third-party borrowings of a borrowing Fund at the time of the Interfund Loan. Start Printed Page 62475Additionally, each Fund's independent auditors, in connection with their audit examinations of the Fund, will review the operation of the credit facility for compliance with the Interfund Loan Borrowing Conditions and their review will form the basis, in part, of the auditor's report on internal accounting controls in Form N-SAR.
18. No Fund will participate in the proposed credit facility upon receipt of requisite regulatory approval unless it has fully disclosed in its prospectus and/or SAI all material facts about its intended participation.

	LETTER
	FROM THE CHAIRMAN AND CEO





	 




	Dear Shareholders:




	The U.S. economy continues to gain strength. Manufacturing output, construction activity and consumer confidence are all at multi-year highs, auto sales are robust,
	and




	U.S. labor market reports show broad progress. Even a slowdown in the pace of rising house prices is seen as making the market more sustainable. Economists have a favorable outlook, and broad
	stock indices reflect that.




	However, challenges dominate the rest of the global economy. China is struggling to boost its industrial output and
	Japans economic turnaround appears to have hit a setback after its sales tax increase in April. The eurozone economy is being held back by persistently high unemployment and dangerously low inflation, leading the European Central Bank to take
	more




	aggressive stimulus action. With robust corporate earnings, the markets greatest concerns relate to conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine. In addition, speculation continues on when the
	U.S. Federal Reserve will begin tightening its monetary policy now that the U.S. economy has regained some traction.




	As always at
	MFS®, active risk management is integral to how we manage your investments. We use a collaborative process, sharing insights across asset classes, regions and economic sectors. Our global team of investment professionals uses a multidisciplined,
	long-term, diversified investment approach.




	We understand that these are challenging economic times. We believe we can serve you best by applying proven
	principles, such as asset allocation and diversification, over the long term. We are confident that this approach can help you as you work with your financial advisors to reach your goals in the years ahead.




	Respectfully,



	 







	Robert J. Manning





	Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




	MFS Investment Management




	October 16, 2014

	(a)




	Ratings are assigned to portfolio securities utilizing ratings from Moodys, Fitch, and Standard & Poors rating agencies and applying the following hierarchy:
	If all three agencies provide a rating, the middle rating (after dropping the highest and lowest ratings) is assigned; if two of the three agencies rate a security, the lower of the two is assigned. Ratings are shown in the S&P scale. All
	ratings are subject to change. The fund is not rated by these agencies.








	(o)




	Less than 0.1%.








	(u)




	For purposes of this presentation, accrued interest, where applicable, is included.






	From time to time Other Assets Less Liabilities may be negative due to timing of cash receipts.




	Percentages are based
	on net assets as of 8/31/14.




	The portfolio is actively managed and current holdings may be different.

	PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

	THROUGH 8/31/14






	Total returns as well as the current 7-day yield have been provided
	for the applicable time periods. Performance results reflect the percentage change in net asset value, including the reinvestment of any dividends and capital gains distributions. (See Notes to Performance Summary.)





	Performance data shown represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at
	$1.00 per share, you could lose money on your investment in the fund. An investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency. The performance
	shown does not reflect the deduction of taxes, if any, that a shareholder would pay on fund distributions or the redemption of fund shares.

	Yields quoted are based on the latest seven days ended as of August 31, 2014, with dividends annualized. The yield quotations more
	closely reflect the current earnings of the fund than the total return quotations. Shares of the fund can be purchased at net asset value without a sales charge.





	Notes to Performance Summary





	Performance results reflect any applicable expense subsidies, waivers and
	adjustments in effect during the periods shown. Without such subsidies and waivers the funds performance results would be less favorable. Please see the prospectus and financial statements for complete details. All results are historical and
	assume the reinvestment of any dividends and capital gain distributions.

	EXPENSE TABLE






	Fund expenses borne by the shareholders during the period, March 1, 2014 through August 31, 2014





	As
	a shareholder of the fund, you incur ongoing costs, including fund expenses. This example is intended to help you understand your ongoing costs (in dollars) of investing in the fund and to compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in
	other mutual funds.




	The example is based on an investment of $1,000 invested at the beginning of the period and held for the entire period March 1,
	2014 through August 31, 2014.





	Actual Expenses





	The first line of the following table provides information about actual account values and actual expenses. You may use the information in this line, together with
	the amount you invested, to estimate the expenses that you paid over the period. Simply divide your account value by $1,000 (for example, an $8,600 account value divided by $1,000 = 8.6), then multiply the result by the number in the first line
	under the heading entitled Expenses Paid During Period to estimate the expenses you paid on your account during this period.





	Hypothetical
	Example for Comparison Purposes





	The second line of the following table provides information about hypothetical account values and hypothetical
	expenses based on the funds actual expense ratio and an assumed rate of return of 5% per year before expenses, which is not the funds actual return. The hypothetical account values and expenses may not be used to estimate the actual
	ending account balance or expenses you paid for the period. You may use this information to compare the ongoing costs of investing in the fund and other funds. To do so, compare this 5% hypothetical example with the 5% hypothetical examples that
	appear in the shareholder reports of the other funds.




	Please note that the expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight your ongoing costs only
	and do not reflect any transactional costs, such as sales charges (loads). Therefore, the second line of the table is useful in comparing ongoing costs only, and will not help you determine the relative total costs of owning different funds. In
	addition, if these transactional costs were included, your costs would have been higher.

	FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS





	The financial highlights table is intended to help you understand the funds financial performance for the past 5 years. Certain information reflects
	financial results for a single fund share. The total returns in the table represent the rate by which an investor would have earned (or lost) on an investment in the fund share class (assuming reinvestment of all distributions) held for the entire
	period.

	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS






	(1) Business and Organization





	MFS Institutional Money
	Market Portfolio (the fund) is a diversified series of MFS Series Trust XIV (the trust). The trust is organized as a Massachusetts business trust and is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as an open-end management
	investment company. This fund is available only to investment companies managed by MFS. MFS does not receive a management fee from this fund.




	The fund
	is an investment company and accordingly follows the investment company accounting and reporting guidance of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946 Financial Services  Investment Companies.




	On July 23, 2014, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission adopted amendments to its money market fund regulations. At this time, management is
	evaluating the potential implications of the changes.





	(2) Significant Accounting Policies






	General

	 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
	and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of increases and decreases in net assets from operations
	during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. In the preparation of these financial statements, management has evaluated subsequent events occurring after the date of the funds Statement of Assets and
	Liabilities through the date that the financial statements were issued.




	In June 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-11, Transfers and
	Servicing (Topic 860)  Repurchase-to-Maturity Transactions, Repurchase Financings, and Disclosures (ASU 2014-11). ASU 2014-11 changes the accounting for repurchase-to-maturity transactions (i.e., repurchase agreements that settle
	at the same time as the maturity of the transferred financial asset) and enhances the required disclosures for repurchase agreements and other similar transactions. Although still evaluating the potential impacts of ASU 2014-11 to the fund,
	management expects that the impact of the funds adoption will be limited to additional financial statement disclosures which would first be effective for interim reporting periods beginning after March 15, 2015.





	Balance Sheet Offsetting

	 The funds accounting policy with respect to balance sheet offsetting is that, absent an event of default by the
	counterparty or a termination of the agreement, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Master Agreement does not result in an offset of reported amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities in the Statement of Assets and
	Liabilities across transactions between the fund and the applicable counterparty. The funds right to setoff may be restricted or prohibited by the bankruptcy or insolvency laws of the particular jurisdiction to which a specific master netting
	agreement counterparty is subject. Balance sheet offsetting disclosures, to the extent applicable to the fund, have been included in the funds Significant Accounting Policies note under the captions for each of the funds

	in-scope

	financial instruments and transactions.

	Notes to Financial Statements  continued





	 





	Investment Valuations

	 Pursuant to procedures approved by the Board of Trustees, investments held by the fund are generally
	valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value. Amortized cost involves valuing an instrument at its cost as adjusted for amortization of premium or accretion of discount rather than its current market value. The amortized cost value of
	an instrument can be different from the market value of an instrument.




	Various inputs are used in determining the value of the funds assets or
	liabilities. These inputs are categorized into three broad levels. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an investments level within the fair value
	hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The funds assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers
	factors specific to the investment. Level 1 includes unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 includes other significant observable market-based inputs (including quoted prices for similar securities,
	interest rates, prepayment speed, and credit risk). Level 3 includes unobservable inputs, which may include the advisers own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments. The following is a summary of the levels used as of
	August 31, 2014 in valuing the funds assets or liabilities:

	Repurchase Agreements

	 The fund enters into repurchase agreements under the terms of Master Repurchase Agreements with approved counterparties. Each
	repurchase agreement is recorded at cost. The fund requires that the securities collateral in a repurchase transaction be transferred to a custodian. The fund monitors, on a daily basis, the value of the collateral to ensure that its value,
	including accrued interest, is greater than amounts owed to the fund under each such repurchase agreement. Upon an event of default under a Master Repurchase Agreement, the

	non-defaulting

	party may close out
	all transactions traded under such agreement and net amounts owed under each transaction to one net amount payable by one party to the other. Absent an event of default, the Master Repurchase Agreement does not result in an offset of reported
	amounts of assets and liabilities in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities across transactions between the fund and the applicable counterparty. At period end, the fund had investments in repurchase agreements with a gross value of $4,899,000
	included in Investments in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. The value of the related collateral exceeded the value of the repurchase agreements at period end.





	Indemnifications

	 Under the funds organizational documents, its officers and Trustees may be indemnified against certain liabilities and expenses arising out of the performance of their duties to
	the fund. Additionally, in the normal course of business, the fund enters into agreements with service providers that may contain




	 




	14







	Table of Contents





	Notes to Financial Statements  continued





	 




	indemnification clauses. The funds maximum exposure under these agreements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the fund that have not yet occurred.





	Investment Transactions and Income

	 Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Interest income is recorded on the accrual
	basis. All premium and discount is amortized or accreted for financial statement purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.





	Fees Paid Indirectly

	 The funds custody fee may be reduced according to an arrangement that measures the value of cash deposited with the custodian by the fund. This amount, for the year ended
	August 31, 2014, is shown as a reduction of total expenses in the Statement of Operations.





	Tax Matters and Distributions

	 The fund
	intends to qualify as a regulated investment company, as defined under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code, and to distribute all of its taxable income, including realized capital gains. As a result, no provision for federal income tax is
	required. The funds federal tax returns, when filed, will remain subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service for a three year period. Management has analyzed the funds tax positions taken on federal and state tax returns for
	all open tax years and does not believe that there are any uncertain tax positions that require recognition of a tax liability.




	Distributions to
	shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Certain capital accounts in the
	financial statements are periodically adjusted for permanent differences in order to reflect their tax character. These adjustments have no impact on net assets or net asset value per share. Temporary differences which arise from recognizing certain
	items of income, expense, gain or loss in different periods for financial statement and tax purposes will reverse at some time in the future. Distributions in excess of net investment income or net realized gains are temporary overdistributions for
	financial statement purposes resulting from differences in the recognition or classification of income, expenses, or distributions for financial statement and tax purposes.




	During the year August 31, 2014, there were no significant adjustments due to differences between book and tax accounting.




	The tax character of distributions declared to shareholders for the last two fiscal years is as follows:



	 



























	 




	  





	8/31/14

	$4,764,578




	  




	  




	 




	$6,218,779




	  







	The federal tax cost and the tax basis components of distributable earnings were as follows:

	)

	Table of Contents





	Notes to Financial Statements  continued





	 




	Under the Regulated Investment Company Modernization Act of 2010 (the Act), net capital losses recognized for fund fiscal
	years beginning after August 31, 2011 may be carried forward indefinitely, and their character is retained as short-term and/or

	long-term

	losses (post-enactment losses). Previously, net
	capital losses were carried forward for eight years and treated as short-term losses (pre-enactment losses). As a transition rule, the Act requires that all post-enactment net capital losses be used before pre-enactment net capital
	losses.




	As of August 31, 2014, the fund had capital loss carryforwards available to offset future realized gains. Such pre-enactment losses expire
	as follows:

	(3) Transactions with Affiliates






	Investment Adviser

	 The fund has an investment advisory agreement with MFS to provide overall investment management and related administrative services and facilities to the fund. MFS receives no
	compensation under this agreement.





	Shareholder Servicing Agent

	 MFS Service Center, Inc. (MFSC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of MFS, provides
	transfer agent and recordkeeping functions in connection with the issuance, transfer, and redemption of shares of the fund under a Shareholder Servicing Agent Agreement. MFSC is not paid a fee for providing these services. MFSC receives payment from
	the fund for out-of-pocket expenses paid by MFSC on behalf of the fund. For the year ended August 31, 2014, these costs amounted to $812. The fund may also pay shareholder servicing related costs to non-related parties.





	Administrator

	 MFS provides the fund with certain financial, legal, shareholder, and other administrative services under a Master Administrative
	Services Agreement between the fund and MFS. MFS is not paid a fee for providing these services.





	Trustees and Officers Compensation

	 The fund may pay compensation to independent Trustees in the form of a retainer, attendance fees, and additional compensation to Board and Committee chairpersons. The fund does not pay compensation directly to Trustees or officers of the fund
	who are also officers of the investment adviser, all of whom receive remuneration for their services to the fund from MFS. Certain officers and Trustees of the fund are officers or directors of MFS, MFD, and MFSC. The independent Trustees do not
	currently receive compensation from the fund.





	Other

	 This fund and certain other funds managed by MFS (the funds) have entered into
	services agreements (the Agreements) which provide for payment of fees by the funds to Tarantino LLC and Griffin Compliance LLC in return for the provision of services of an Independent Chief Compliance Officer (ICCO) and Assistant ICCO,
	respectively, for the funds. The funds can terminate the Agreements with Tarantino LLC and Griffin Compliance LLC at any time under the terms of the Agreements. The ICCO is an officer of the funds and the sole member of Tarantino LLC. Prior to
	June 1, 2014, Robyn L. Griffin served as the Assistant ICCO and was an officer of the funds. Ms. Griffin is the sole member of Griffin Compliance LLC. Effective May 31, 2014, Ms. Griffin resigned as Assistant ICCO and the service
	agreement between the funds and Griffin Compliance LLC was terminated. For the year ended August 31, 2014, the aggregate fees paid by the fund to Tarantino LLC and Griffin Compliance LLC were




	 




	16







	Table of Contents





	Notes to Financial Statements  continued





	 




	$27,303. MFS has agreed to reimburse the fund for a portion of the payments made by the fund in the amount of $8,196, which is included in the reduction of total expenses in the Statement of
	Operations. Additionally, MFS has agreed to bear all expenses associated with office space, other administrative support, and supplies provided to the ICCO and Assistant ICCO.





	(4) Shares of Beneficial Interest





	The funds Declaration of Trust permits the Trustees to issue an
	unlimited number of full and fractional shares of beneficial interest.




	The fund is solely invested in by other MFS funds for the purpose of investing
	excess cash balances on a short-term basis. The MFS funds do not invest in this fund for the purpose of exercising management or control. At the end of the period, the MFS International Value Fund, the MFS Emerging Markets Debt Fund, the MFS Growth
	Fund, and the MFS Value Fund were the owners of record of approximately 19%, 13%, 7%, and 6%, respectively, of the value of outstanding voting shares of the fund. No other MFS fund owned more than 5% of the value of outstanding voting shares of the
	fund.





	(5) Line of Credit





	The fund and certain
	other funds managed by MFS participate in a $1.1 billion unsecured committed line of credit, subject to a $1 billion sublimit, provided by a syndication of banks under a credit agreement. Borrowings may be made for temporary financing needs.
	Interest is charged to each fund, based on its borrowings, generally at a rate equal to the higher of the Federal Reserve funds rate or one month LIBOR plus an agreed upon spread. A commitment fee, based on the average daily, unused portion of the
	committed line of credit, is allocated among the participating funds at the end of each calendar quarter. In addition, the fund and other funds managed by MFS have established unsecured uncommitted borrowing arrangements with certain banks for
	temporary financing needs. Interest is charged to each fund, based on its borrowings, at a rate equal to the Federal Reserve funds rate plus an agreed upon spread. For the year ended August 31, 2014, the funds commitment fee and interest
	expense were $21,397 and $0, respectively, and are included in Miscellaneous expense in the Statement of Operations.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM





	To the Board of Trustees of MFS Series Trust XIV and the Shareholders of MFS Institutional Money Market Portfolio:




	We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including the portfolio of investments, of MFS Institutional Money Market Portfolio (one of
	the series of MFS Series Trust XIV) (the Fund) as of August 31, 2014, and the related statement of operations for the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and
	the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended. These financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Funds management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
	statements and financial highlights based on our audits.




	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
	Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. The Fund is not required to
	have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
	circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
	supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included
	confirmation of securities owned as of August 31, 2014, by correspondence with the custodian and brokers; where replies were not received from brokers, we performed other auditing procedures. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
	basis for our opinion.




	In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
	financial position of MFS Institutional Money Market Portfolio as of August 31, 2014, the results of its operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial
	highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

	BOARD REVIEW OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT





	The Investment Company Act of 1940 requires that both the full Board of Trustees and a majority of the non-interested (independent) Trustees, voting
	separately, annually approve the continuation of the Funds investment advisory agreement with MFS. The Trustees consider matters bearing on the Fund and its advisory arrangements at their meetings throughout the year, including a review of
	performance data at each regular meeting. In addition, the independent Trustees met several times over the course of three months beginning in May and ending in July, 2014 (contract review meetings) for the specific purpose of
	considering whether to approve the continuation of the investment advisory agreement for the Fund and the other investment companies that the Board oversees (the MFS Funds). The independent Trustees were assisted in their evaluation of
	the Funds investment advisory agreement by independent legal counsel, from whom they received separate legal advice and with whom they met separately from MFS during various contract review meetings. The independent Trustees were also assisted
	in this process by the MFS Funds Independent Chief Compliance Officer, a full-time senior officer appointed by and reporting to the independent Trustees.




	In connection with their deliberations regarding the continuation of the investment advisory agreement, the Trustees, including the independent Trustees, considered such information and factors as they believed, in
	light of the legal advice furnished to them and their own business judgment, to be relevant. The investment advisory agreement for the Fund was considered separately, although the Trustees also took into account the common interests of all MFS Funds
	in their review. As described below, the Trustees considered the nature, quality, and extent of the various investment advisory, administrative, and shareholder services performed by MFS under the existing investment advisory agreement and other
	arrangements with the Fund.




	As part of their deliberations, the Trustees took into account that the Fund was formed solely to act as a cash sweep
	vehicle for other MFS Funds, and that shares of the Fund are not distributed or sold to the public. The Trustees gave substantial consideration to the fact that MFS does not charge a separate advisory fee to the Fund under the investment advisory
	agreement or charge transfer agency fees, administrative services fees, sales loads or distribution and service fees to the Fund, but that MFS receives advisory and other fees from the MFS Funds that invest their cash balances in the Fund.




	In connection with their contract review meetings, the Trustees received and relied upon materials that included, among other items:
	(i) information provided by Lipper Inc., an independent third party, on the investment performance of the Fund for various time periods ended December 31, 2013 and the investment performance of a group of funds with substantially similar
	investment classifications/objectives (the Lipper performance universe), (ii) information provided by Lipper Inc. on the Funds fees and expenses and the fees and expenses of comparable funds identified by Lipper Inc. (the
	Lipper expense group), (iii) information as to whether and to what extent applicable expense waivers and reimbursements are observed for the Fund, (iv) information regarding MFS financial results and financial condition,
	including MFS and certain of its affiliates estimated profitability from services performed for the Fund and the MFS Funds as a whole, and compared to MFS institutional business, (v) MFS views regarding the outlook for
	the mutual fund industry and the strategic business




	 




	24







	Table of Contents





	Board Review of Investment Advisory Agreement  continued





	 




	plans of MFS, (vi) descriptions of various functions performed by MFS for the Funds, such as compliance monitoring and portfolio trading practices, and (vii) information regarding the
	overall organization of MFS, including information about MFS senior management and other personnel providing investment advisory, administrative and other services to the Fund and the other MFS Funds. The comparative performance, fee and
	expense information prepared and provided by Lipper Inc. was not independently verified and the independent Trustees did not independently verify any information provided to them by MFS.




	The Trustees conclusion as to the continuation of the investment advisory agreement was based on a comprehensive consideration of all information provided to the Trustees and not the result of any single
	factor. Some of the factors that figured particularly in the Trustees deliberations are described below, although individual Trustees may have evaluated the information presented differently from one another, giving different weights to
	various factors. It is also important to recognize that the fee arrangements for the Fund and other MFS Funds are the result of years of review and discussion between the independent Trustees and MFS, that certain aspects of such arrangements may
	receive greater scrutiny in some years than in others, and that the Trustees conclusions may be based, in part, on their consideration of these same arrangements during the course of the year and in prior years.




	Based on information provided by Lipper Inc. and MFS, the Trustees reviewed the Funds total return investment performance as well as the performance of peer
	groups of funds over various time periods. The Trustees placed particular emphasis on the total return performance of the Funds shares in comparison to the performance of funds in its Lipper performance universe over the three-year period
	ended December 31, 2013, which the Trustees believed was a long enough period to reflect differing market conditions. The total return performance of the Funds shares was in the 1st quintile relative to the other funds in the universe for
	this three-year period (the 1st quintile being the best performers and the 5th quintile being the worst performers). The total return performance of the Funds shares was in the 1st quintile for the one-year period and the 2nd quintile for the
	five-year period ended December 31, 2013 relative to the Lipper performance universe. Because of the passage of time, these performance results may differ from the performance results for more recent periods, including those shown elsewhere in
	this report.




	In the course of their deliberations, the Trustees took into account information provided by MFS in connection with the contract review
	meetings, as well as during investment review meetings conducted with portfolio management personnel during the course of the year regarding the Funds performance. After reviewing these and related factors, the Trustees concluded, within the
	context of their overall conclusions regarding the investment advisory agreement, that they were satisfied with MFS responses and efforts relating to investment performance.




	In assessing the reasonableness of the Funds expenses, the Trustees considered, among other information, the total expense ratio of the Funds shares as a percentage of average daily net assets and the
	total expense ratios of peer groups of funds based on information provided by Lipper Inc., noting that the Funds total expense ratio was expected to be relatively low because, as noted above, the Fund does not bear advisory expenses. The
	Trustees considered that, according to the Lipper data (which takes into




	 




	25







	Table of Contents





	Board Review of Investment Advisory Agreement  continued





	 




	account any expense limitations that were in effect during the Funds last fiscal year), the Funds total expense ratio was lower than the Lipper expense group median. Because the Fund
	does not pay an advisory fee, the Trustees did not consider the extent to which economies of scale would be realized due to the Funds growth of assets, whether fee levels reflect economies of scale for the Funds shareholders, or the fees
	paid by similar funds to other investment advisers or by similar clients of MFS.




	The Trustees also considered information prepared by MFS relating to
	MFS costs and profits with respect to the Fund, the MFS Funds considered as a group, and other investment companies and accounts advised by MFS, as well as MFS methodologies used to determine and allocate its costs to the MFS Funds, the
	Fund and other accounts and products for purposes of estimating profitability.




	In addition, the Trustees considered MFS resources and related
	efforts to continue to retain, attract and motivate capable personnel to serve the Fund. The Trustees also considered current and developing conditions in the financial services industry, including the presence of large and well-capitalized
	companies which are spending, and appear to be prepared to continue to spend, substantial sums to engage personnel and to provide services to competing investment companies. In this regard, the Trustees also considered the financial resources of MFS
	and its ultimate parent, Sun Life Financial Inc. The Trustees also considered the advantages and possible disadvantages to the Fund of having an adviser that also serves other investment companies as well as other accounts.




	The Trustees also considered the nature, quality, cost, and extent of administrative, transfer agency, and distribution services provided to the Fund by MFS and its
	affiliates under agreements and plans other than the investment advisory agreement. The Trustees also considered the nature, extent and quality of certain other services MFS performs or arranges for on the Funds behalf, which may include
	securities lending programs, directed expense payment programs, class action recovery programs, and MFS interaction with third-party service providers, principally custodians and

	sub-custodians.

	The
	Trustees concluded that the various non-advisory services provided by MFS and its affiliates on behalf of the Fund were satisfactory.




	The Trustees also
	considered benefits to MFS from the use of the Funds portfolio brokerage commissions, if applicable, to pay for investment research and various other factors. Additionally, the Trustees considered so-called fall-out benefits to MFS
	such as reputational value derived from serving as investment manager to the Fund.




	Based on their evaluation of factors that they deemed to be material,
	including those factors described above, the Board of Trustees, including the independent Trustees, concluded that the Funds investment advisory agreement with MFS should be continued for an additional one-year period, commencing
	August 1, 2014.

	AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT.







	Messrs. Robert E. Butler, John P. Kavanaugh and Robert W. Uek and Meses. Maryanne L. Roepke and Laurie J. Thomsen, members of the Audit Committee, have
	been determined by the Board of Trustees in their reasonable business judgment to meet the definition of audit committee financial expert as such term is defined in Form N-CSR. In addition, Messrs. Butler, Kavanaugh and Uek, and Meses.
	Roepke and Thomsen are independent members of the Audit Committee (as such term has been defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission in regulations implementing Section 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002). The Securities
	and Exchange Commission has stated that the designation of a person as an audit committee financial expert pursuant to this Item 3 on the Form N-CSR does not impose on such a person any duties, obligations or liability that are greater than the
	duties, obligations or liability imposed on such person as a member of the Audit Committee and the Board of Trustees in the absence of such designation or identification.

	This amount reflects the fees billed to MFS and MFS Related Entities for non-audit services relating directly to the operations and financial reporting

	Item 4(e)(1):





	Set forth below are the policies and procedures established by the Audit Committee of the Board of Trustees relating to the pre-approval of audit and non-audit related services:




	To the extent required by applicable law, pre-approval by the Audit Committee of the Board is needed for all audit and permissible non-audit services
	rendered to the Funds and all permissible non-audit services rendered to MFS or MFS Related Entities if the services relate directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Registrant. Pre-approval is currently on an
	engagement-by-engagement basis. In the event pre-approval of such services is necessary between regular meetings of the Audit Committee and it is not practical to wait to seek pre-approval at the next regular meeting of the Audit Committee,
	pre-approval of such services may be referred to the Chair of the Audit Committee for approval; provided that the Chair may not pre-approve any individual engagement for such services exceeding $50,000 or multiple engagements for such services in
	the aggregate exceeding $100,000 in each period between regular meetings of the Audit Committee. Any engagement pre-approved by the Chair between regular meetings of the Audit Committee shall be presented for ratification by the entire Audit
	Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting.





	Item 4(e)(2):





	None, or 0%, of the services relating to the Audit-Related Fees, Tax Fees and All Other Fees paid by the Fund and MFS and MFS Related Entities relating directly to the operations and financial reporting
	of the Registrant disclosed above were approved by the audit committee pursuant to paragraphs (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X (which permits audit committee approval after the start of the engagement with respect to services other than
	audit, review or attest services, if certain conditions are satisfied).





	Item 4(f):

	Not applicable.








	Item 4(h):

	The Registrants Audit Committee has considered whether the provision by a Registrants independent registered public
	accounting firm of non-audit services to MFS and MFS Related Entities that were not pre-approved by the Committee (because such services did not relate directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Registrant) was compatible with
	maintaining the independence of the independent registered public accounting firm as the Registrants principal auditors.

	Commissions rules and forms.





	 





	(b)




	There were no changes in the registrants internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the Act) that occurred during the second

	Code of Ethics for Principal Executive and Principal Financial Officers





	Effective October 1, 2014




	 






	I.






	Policy Purpose and Summary







	Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that the each MFS Fund registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 adopt a
	code of ethics for senior financial officers, applicable to its principal financial officer and principal accounting officer.



	 






	II.






	Overview






	 





	 





	A.






	Covered Officers/Purpose of the Code







	This code of ethics (this Code) has been adopted by the funds (collectively, Funds and each, Fund) under supervision of the MFS Funds Board (the Board) and
	applies to the Funds Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer (the Covered Officers each of whom is set forth in Exhibit A) for the purpose of promoting:



	 





	 




	




	 





	honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships;






	 





	 




	




	 





	full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that the Funds file with, or submit to, the Securities and Exchange
	Commission (SEC) and in other public communications made by the Funds;






	 





	 




	




	 





	compliance by the Funds with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	accountability for adherence to the Code.












	 





	B.






	Conduct Guidelines







	Each
	Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as well as apparent conflicts of interest. In addition, each Covered Officer should not place his or her personal
	interests ahead of the Funds interests and should endeavor to act honestly and ethically. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Covered Officer must:



	 





	 




	




	 





	not use his or her personal influence or personal relationships improperly to influence investment decisions or financial reporting for any Fund
	whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the detriment of the Fund; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	not cause a Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the benefit the Fund.







	The following activities, which could create the appearance of a conflict of interest, are permitted only
	with the approval of the Funds Chief Legal Officer (CLO):



	 





	 




	




	 





	service as a director on the board of any for profit company;






	 





	 




	




	 





	running for political office;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the receipt of any Fund business-related gift in excess of $300;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the receipt of any entertainment from any company with which a Fund has current or prospective business dealings unless such entertainment is
	business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of impropriety;






	 





	 




	




	 





	any material ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship with, any Fund service providers (e.g., custodian banks, audit firms),
	other than the Funds investment adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person thereof;






	 





	 




	




	 





	a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction charges or spreads paid by a Fund for effecting portfolio transactions or for
	selling or redeeming shares, other than an interest arising from the Covered Officers employment or securities ownership.






	 





	 





	C.






	Disclosure and Compliance






	 





	 




	




	 





	Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself or herself with the disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Funds;






	 





	 




	




	 





	each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others to misrepresent, facts about a Fund to others, whether within or outside the
	Fund, including to the Funds trustees and auditors, and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;






	 





	 




	




	 





	each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or her area of Fund responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the
	Funds and the adviser with the goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC and in other public communications made by the Funds; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote compliance within his or her area of Fund responsibility with the standards and
	restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and regulations.












	 





	D.






	Reporting and Accountability







	Each Covered Officer must:



	 





	 




	




	 





	upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon becoming a Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Boards that he or she has received,
	read, and understands the Code;






	 





	 




	




	 





	annually thereafter affirm to the Boards that he or she has complied with the requirements of the Code;






	 





	 




	




	 





	annually report to the CLO affiliations and relationships which are or may raise the appearance of a conflict of interest with the Covered
	Officers duties to the Funds, as identified in the annual Trustee and Officer Questionnaire;






	 





	 




	




	 





	not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any officer or employee of the Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of potential violations
	that are made in good faith; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	notify the CLO promptly if he or she knows of any violation of this Code. Failure to do so is itself a violation of this Code.







	The CLO is responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which questions are presented under
	it, granting waivers upon consultation with the appropriate Board or its designee, investigating violations, and has the authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation. The CLO will report requests for waivers to the appropriate Board
	(or a designee thereof) promptly upon receipt of a waiver request and will periodically report to the appropriate Board any approvals granted since the last report.




	The CLO will take all appropriate action to investigate any potential violations reported to him or her and to report any violations to the appropriate Board. If the Board concurs that a violation has
	occurred, it will consider appropriate action, which may include review of, and appropriate modifications to, applicable policies and procedures; notification to appropriate personnel of the investment adviser or its board; or a recommendation to
	dismiss the Covered Officer.




	Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, be disclosed as provided by
	SEC rules.



	 





	 





	E.






	Confidentiality







	All
	reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code and under the direction of the CLO will be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters
	shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the appropriate Funds Board, its counsel, counsel to the Boards independent trustees and senior management and the board of directors of the Funds investment adviser and its counsel.









	 





	F.






	Internal Use







	The Code is
	intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact, circumstance, or legal conclusion.



	 






	III.






	Supervision







	The Board of
	Trustees of the Fund, including a majority of the Trustees who are not interested persons (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Fund, shall review no less frequently than annually, a report from the CLO regarding the affirmations of the
	principal executive officer and the principal financial officer as to compliance with this Code.



	 






	IV.






	Interpretation and Escalation







	Breaches of the Code are reviewed by the CLO and communicated to the Board of Trustees of the affected Fund(s). Interpretations of this Policy shall be made from time to time by the CLO, as needed, and
	questions regarding the application of this Policy to a specific set of facts are escalated to the CLO.



	 






	V.






	Authority







	Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.



	 






	VI.






	Monitoring







	Adherence to
	this policy is monitored by the CLO.



	 






	VII.






	Related Policies







	This
	Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other policies or procedures of the
	Funds, the Funds adviser, principal underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are superseded by this Code to the extent that they
	overlap or conflict with the provisions of this Code. The Funds and their investment advisers codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act and any other codes or policies or procedures adopted by the Funds or their
	investment adviser or other service providers are separate requirements and are not part of this Code.



	 






	VIII.






	Amendment







	Any amendments
	to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibit A, must be approved or ratified by a majority vote of each Board, including a majority of independent trustees.



	 






	IX.






	Recordkeeping







	All
	required books, records and other documentation shall be retained in accordance with MFS related record retention policy.





	Additional
	procedures may need to be implemented by departments to properly comply with this policy.
