Mr. Woodman was a founding partner of Robertson Colman Stephens & Woodman in 1978 and of Woodman, Kirkpatrick & Gilbreath in 1982. Previously, Mr. Woodman worked in the investment banking division of Merrill Lynch for 23 years, where he spent 16 years as director of West Coast corporate financing until 1978. Mr. Woodman serves as a director of Medallion Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of Medallion Financial Corp., a publicly traded commercial finance company. In addition, Mr. Woodman previously served as Chairman of both Woodman Laboratories, Inc., a privately owned consumer products company, and SciClone Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a publicly traded biotechnology company. We believe Mr. Woodman's longstanding prior service on our Board of Directors, long career in investment banking and his experience as an investor in numerous public and private companies provide the requisite qualifications, skills, perspectives, and experience that make him well qualified to serve as Director Emeritus.

172






451 BroadwayMillbrae, CA 94030


        (650) 692-1042
    






This is my go to place to buy fresh produce.  I get their double happiness oranges whenever they're in stock.  They carry all the specialty items I love to use in my cooking including, thyme, basil, sage, San Marzano tomatoes, different blends of olive oils, anchovies, capers, and Dececco pasta.  Good selection of pears and berries too.  Everything is reasonably priced, and in a good location.  It's near restaurants, coffee, banks, and the post office.  You can pick up some groceries while running other errands.







So I'm going to update this review based on what I can come up with... 
This is in regards to a fraudulent charge that I got on my CC. I have a specific credit card that I used to churn mileage points on. This credit card only gets used at supermarkets and no online shopping at all. I only shop in Millbrae and visit 4-5 places on regular basis. Deans Produce is the only place that takes credit card but only by the "swiping option". They put a sign that says swipe only, no chips. Of the other places that I use this card, all of them use chip.. As part of the industry standard, everyone is required by law to take chip cards by using the EMV chip reader. And, we have not heard of any hackers being able to duplicate EMV chips, only by reading magnetic swipes.  

My CC company text me asking about a charge from Walmart Superstore in Southern Cali. The only way I think the card got compromised is because of the swiping. I use my chip at the other grocery stores that I shop at. This is only my speculation, hopefully they can update their system and accept chips. Definitely for the security of their customers. 

Be careful of your credit card, and also be careful of the charges, check your receipts. Some of the workers type in fake item codes for wrong items because they don't know the produce names.







Dean's Produce is a great place for fresh produce. Located on Broadway, Millbrae, this place is my go-to for fresh produce because it is one of only a few places that mainly has fresh produce unlike Safeway, which mainly has processed foods with preservatives. This way I know which products are getting older and which products are fresher. Plus, they are not too expensive too. 

I have been here many times, usually to buy fruit as they have an impressive collection of exotic fruit like durian, dragon fruit, and papaya. In fact if it were not for this place to exist as it had since many many years ago, I would never have tried dragon fruit. Other food products include bottled drinks in the cold aisle located at the back, and snacks as well as spices in the middle of the aisles, which by the way, are a bit too tight to walk through smoothly. 

Unfortunately, as good as this place gets, parking is very tough on Broadway which makes it inconvenient to try and go to Dean's Produce only to find that there is no nearby parking for as long as half an hour. However, on the bright side, the store is on Broadway making it a very appealing place to walk, eat, buy, and talk. Overall, Dean's Produce is a decent store, although I would generally only come to buy fresh fruits when I have the time. With that, thank you for some nice visits Dean's Produce!







About a week ago I went into deans produce and I am always here always shopping here. I decided to buy some olives and they were all rotten inside so I went to go back the next day to tell them I totally understand that it's not the workers fault but when I went it to give it back and give them a heads up the Asian older lady was extremely disrespectful. I'm not to sure what her name was because they have no name tags there but The way she was replying to me was disrespectful and she needs to treat her customers right what kind of customer service is this.







Excellent selection of low cost/high quality produce. The store is kinda hidden and obviously parking can be tough, since this is the Burlingame Ave of Millbrae and clearly this is where the rubber meets the road. 

I've been in at least a dozen times and this most recent visit brought me to something that I've become quite intrigued by. Fresh jam. Yes, fresh jam!! I know, I should have covered this part of the foodie aisle years ago, but I was reminded of the PB&J crustless sandwiches of my childhood and never wanted to relive those moments. Until now. I picked up a jar of fresh blueberry jelly and slathered some over an English muffin with Almond butter and boy oh boy was it delicious!! 

I also noticed that they offer some exotic fruits that typical grocery stores don't offer all that much. Items such as:

Papaya
Young coconut
Bitter melon
Dragon fruit
Durian (stanky stank fruit I think)
and so so many others

I wanna visit more often, but I find myself at Safeway far too often. Maybe, just maybe, I can visit this spot weekly and feel better about myself when I sit down to enjoy a sliver of dragon fruit.







There is way more variety and fresh produce here than the other local Asian markets.  However, it's hard to beat the quality and prices at the nearby Farmer's market on Saturdays or the Safeway Down the street sometimes.  If you want middle eastern ingredients, this is the place to go.

Parking is ample on the street or nearby lots.  The cashiers are extremely helpful and nice.  They'll even give you a box to carry your groceries if you don't want to pay for the bags.







If you're on a fixed budget, don't go there! Trader Joe's is cheaper. Some of their produces are not fresh enough either.







I have a soft spot for this place! It's as if I'm on a dusty cobbled street in Greece, Portugal, Turkey . . . and accidentally wandered into a small shop of goods, full to the gills with sundry stuff, all unexpected little out of the way treasures. I love going in here with no agenda, just to discover whatever catches my eye, e.g. I got my first taste of dragonfruit from there! I bought just one and watched a youtube video of how to cut it :-) It's one of the rare places that carries cherimoyas, passion fruit, lychees, rambutan, starfruits, and loads of exotic fruits. This is my go to place for buying baked beans and HP sauce from England--it's half the price of grocery shops, where the markup is ridiculous. They have assorted bulk olives in brine, and fresh feta, as well as interesting drinks, e.g. nectars and kefir. I love their aisle of sardines, olive oils, tuna, etc. and my husband lusts for the imported chocolates, sesame/peanut bars. Oh how I wish I wasn't doing gluten-free, cuz they have foccacia's, fresh baked breads from the bakery; of course, they have produce and such, but I wish they made more of an effort to get organic fruits and veggies. Their customer service is as authentic as you might imagine--they're super helpful when I want to return or exchange something. They also have another location in San Mateo, which is larger and with more items, but it has a different vibe: more like an ordinary grocer's. I far prefer this Millbrae location.







What??? 
No. 
Today's purchases: went directly into the garbage!!!

Daikon, spoiled and or completely moldy inside(?)
Melon, inedible and crunchy, dry and mealy. 

See my photo.
I don't see why people flock to this place, Dean should get some standards. 

Too far away to go and complain, and can't serve daikon oroshi w my saba shio yaki tonight. Lame.







Yes, a great variety of ethnic foods, meats and breads.  Same with the vegetables and fruits. BUT check your receipt!!!!    I checked the receipt while emptying the bag at home I was charged for items I never bought AND got OVERCHARGED for fruit by the pound.   This is the SECOND time this happened to me at the same store!!!!!!

 I ever go to Dean's Produce in Millbrae again, I will check my receipt right after the clerk is done and BEFORE I leave the store!!







Great place for produce. Always come here to get fruit for my juicer. The price is much cheaper then other places like Safeway and lucky. The only thing is the produce expires fast so if I'm not going to use it the same day I usually go to Safeway.







I usually come here for my weekly fruits and veggies shopping.

Produce is fresh and clean. Same with the fruits as well. 

They do have middle eastern products as well (cheese, olive oil, breads, etc...)

This is the only place where I buy my honey from as well! 

Once in a blue moon, they do have rare tropical fruits which I am very lucky to find. 

Price is reasonable as well. Wish the store was a little bit more cleaner though..







When we lived in Millbrae, we frequented this grocery store.  I loved it because the produce is so fresh and less expensive than Safeway that's just down the street.  The produce is exceptionally fabulous in the summer.  :)  Employees are ok.  Not super friendly like other stores but decent.

They also have exotic desserts and foods from different countries too.  Bread from Sheng Kee, Kinder and Milka chocolates, baklava, etc.  Fun place to explore.  Great fresh produce at great prices.  Wish there was something similar near our new residence.  Dean's Produce and Sprouts are my faves for fresh, inexpensive produce.







Best place to buy fruits and veggies in Millbrae. They also have a good selection of canned pickles, veggies and fish. There's an Eastern European/Middle Eastern influence, which I love.







Fresh, everything is fresh and very suitable prices. Love their Greek cheese! and you can about everything you need if you are shopping Mediterranean or Middle Eastern Food.







Um, am I missing something here??

I had high expectations for this location, given the # of reviews... but compared to its San Mateo counterpart, it just really doesn't stand up to par. First of all, their produce options are very limited (where were the avocados??), and they seem to place more of an emphasis on their internationally imported items like canned goods and whatnots. Also, the produce doesn't look very clean and the store itself isn't organized as nicely.

Everything here just looks so drab and unclean -- not what I expected at all. I now trek down to San Mateo just to visit that location, as it is MUCH cleaner and the selection of produce is way better/fresher.







A much better place to go for produce than Safeway or Lucky's. Although those places may have more variety, Dean's has harder-to-find fruits and vegetables, like passion fruit and guava, and everything is at a lower price. I always walk away surprised at how little my groceries cost. In addition to produce, they also carry dry goods, a wide variety of spices (seriously, almost any spice you'd want for dirt cheap prices--whole cardamon, dried hibiscus, fennel seeds, etc.), and certain Mediterranean/Middle Eastern/Asian goods. I like to get kalamata olives and feta cheese here for my salads. If they had meat, this would be my one-stop shop.







Every Sunday, I look forward to my weekly Dean's trip. They have a phenomenal selection of inexpensive, high quality produce and ethnic groceries. 

If you are looking for specialty items, Dean's will most likely have it!







Ive been shopping at the newer one in San Mateo for a while now. Only been to this one a couple times. It was a nice day and we were eating in the area. Lots of good product but the unique things are the Greek and other European items you dont see in your average markets. A place where i can regularly get my Borjomi water!







Dean's is such a gem and probably my favorite shop in Millbrae.  Their selection of exotic and regular produce is pretty comprehensive & their prices are cheap!  They beat any Safeway or Whole Foods easily.  The produce is high quality and fresh.  I was able to pick up mangosteen, lychee, Hawaiian papaya, and a variety of tomatoes in one stop.  It's a good place to stop by often because they offer in-season produce and the variety the you can choose from is extensive. They also have plenty of snacks that you can't find at most other places like the KinderSurprise chocolate eggs - which my kids really love.

This is my go to place to buy fresh produce.  I get their double happiness oranges whenever they're in stock.  They carry all the specialty items I love to use in my cooking including, thyme, basil, sage, San Marzano tomatoes, different blends of olive oils, anchovies, capers, and Dececco pasta.  Good selection of pears and berries too.  Everything is reasonably priced, and in a good location.  It's near restaurants, coffee, banks, and the post office.  You can pick up some groceries while running other errands.

Updated review



So I'm going to update this review based on what I can come up with... This is in regards to a fraudulent charge that I got on my CC. I have a specific credit card that I used to churn mileage points on. This credit card only gets used at supermarkets and no online shopping at all. I only shop in Millbrae and visit 4-5 places on regular basis. Deans Produce is the only place that takes credit card but only by the "swiping option". They put a sign that says swipe only, no chips. Of the other places that I use this card, all of them use chip.. As part of the industry standard, everyone is required by law to take chip cards by using the EMV chip reader. And, we have not heard of any hackers being able to duplicate EMV chips, only by reading magnetic swipes.  My CC company text me asking about a charge from Walmart Superstore in Southern Cali. The only way I think the card got compromised is because of the swiping. I use my chip at the other grocery stores that I shop at. This is only my speculation, hopefully they can update their system and accept chips. Definitely for the security of their customers. Be careful of your credit card, and also be careful of the charges, check your receipts. Some of the workers type in fake item codes for wrong items because they don't know the produce names.

Be very aware if your cashier is the young chinese girl that barely speaks english. She's a recent hire and doesn't know her produce. I had a basket of vegetables and fruits which ended up to be $47. Feeling a little weird, I decided to look through the receipt as I walked out the door. I had stuff on the list that I didn't buy, and stuff that I did buy weren't on the list. Didin't buy but was charged: * Asparagus - 3.58lbs @ $2.99/lb = $10.70. * Apricot - 4.21lbs @ $0.99/lb = $4.17Just those two items was close to $15 bucks of overcharging. Not sure how she even got those weight on the scale when those items don't exist in my basket. Weird?Also there was another instance where I asked why they didn't carry "Double Happiness" oranges. The same lady told me they do. I looked at the oranges that she pointed to, it was some "Naval" brand which doesn't taste as good. I said it wasn't the same thing, she said "trust me, it's the same." UHH OK! Btw, all said and done in cantonese. Mr. Dean, I hope you get rid of this girl. She's doing you no good, and you may loose customers. You can check the below info if you need to track which employee it was. I have their name on the receipt as well. Receipt date- 6/24/15Time- 17:09:08Term- 1Store- 1Trx- 374

I have a soft spot for this place! It's as if I'm on a dusty cobbled street in Greece, Portugal, Turkey . . . and accidentally wandered into a small shop of goods, full to the gills with sundry stuff, all unexpected little out of the way treasures. I love going in here with no agenda, just to discover whatever catches my eye, e.g. I got my first taste of dragonfruit from there! I bought just one and watched a youtube video of how to cut it :-) It's one of the rare places that carries cherimoyas, passion fruit, lychees, rambutan, starfruits, and loads of exotic fruits. This is my go to place for buying baked beans and HP sauce from England--it's half the price of grocery shops, where the markup is ridiculous. They have assorted bulk olives in brine, and fresh feta, as well as interesting drinks, e.g. nectars and kefir. I love their aisle of sardines, olive oils, tuna, etc. and my husband lusts for the imported chocolates, sesame/peanut bars. Oh how I wish I wasn't doing gluten-free, cuz they have foccacia's, fresh baked breads from the bakery; of course, they have produce and such, but I wish they made more of an effort to get organic fruits and veggies. Their customer service is as authentic as you might imagine--they're super helpful when I want to return or exchange something. They also have another location in San Mateo, which is larger and with more items, but it has a different vibe: more like an ordinary grocer's. I far prefer this Millbrae location.

Yes, a great variety of ethnic foods, meats and breads.  Same with the vegetables and fruits. BUT check your receipt!!!!    I checked the receipt while emptying the bag at home I was charged for items I never bought AND got OVERCHARGED for fruit by the pound.   This is the SECOND time this happened to me at the same store!!!!!! I ever go to Dean's Produce in Millbrae again, I will check my receipt right after the clerk is done and BEFORE I leave the store!!

Great place for produce. Always come here to get fruit for my juicer. The price is much cheaper then other places like Safeway and lucky. The only thing is the produce expires fast so if I'm not going to use it the same day I usually go to Safeway.

I usually come here for my weekly fruits and veggies shopping.Produce is fresh and clean. Same with the fruits as well. They do have middle eastern products as well (cheese, olive oil, breads, etc...)This is the only place where I buy my honey from as well! Once in a blue moon, they do have rare tropical fruits which I am very lucky to find. Price is reasonable as well. Wish the store was a little bit more cleaner though..

When we lived in Millbrae, we frequented this grocery store.  I loved it because the produce is so fresh and less expensive than Safeway that's just down the street.  The produce is exceptionally fabulous in the summer.  :)  Employees are ok.  Not super friendly like other stores but decent.They also have exotic desserts and foods from different countries too.  Bread from Sheng Kee, Kinder and Milka chocolates, baklava, etc.  Fun place to explore.  Great fresh produce at great prices.  Wish there was something similar near our new residence.  Dean's Produce and Sprouts are my faves for fresh, inexpensive produce.

Best place to buy fruits and veggies in Millbrae. They also have a good selection of canned pickles, veggies and fish. There's an Eastern European/Middle Eastern influence, which I love.

Um, am I missing something here??I had high expectations for this location, given the # of reviews... but compared to its San Mateo counterpart, it just really doesn't stand up to par. First of all, their produce options are very limited (where were the avocados??), and they seem to place more of an emphasis on their internationally imported items like canned goods and whatnots. Also, the produce doesn't look very clean and the store itself isn't organized as nicely.Everything here just looks so drab and unclean -- not what I expected at all. I now trek down to San Mateo just to visit that location, as it is MUCH cleaner and the selection of produce is way better/fresher.

A much better place to go for produce than Safeway or Lucky's. Although those places may have more variety, Dean's has harder-to-find fruits and vegetables, like passion fruit and guava, and everything is at a lower price. I always walk away surprised at how little my groceries cost. In addition to produce, they also carry dry goods, a wide variety of spices (seriously, almost any spice you'd want for dirt cheap prices--whole cardamon, dried hibiscus, fennel seeds, etc.), and certain Mediterranean/Middle Eastern/Asian goods. I like to get kalamata olives and feta cheese here for my salads. If they had meat, this would be my one-stop shop.

Ive been shopping at the newer one in San Mateo for a while now. Only been to this one a couple times. It was a nice day and we were eating in the area. Lots of good product but the unique things are the Greek and other European items you dont see in your average markets. A place where i can regularly get my Borjomi water!

Dean's is such a gem and probably my favorite shop in Millbrae.  Their selection of exotic and regular produce is pretty comprehensive & their prices are cheap!  They beat any Safeway or Whole Foods easily.  The produce is high quality and fresh.  I was able to pick up mangosteen, lychee, Hawaiian papaya, and a variety of tomatoes in one stop.  It's a good place to stop by often because they offer in-season produce and the variety the you can choose from is extensive. They also have plenty of snacks that you can't find at most other places like the KinderSurprise chocolate eggs - which my kids really love.








Yum!  Hawaiian papaya from Dean's.

This is my go to place to buy fresh produce.  I get their double happiness oranges whenever they're in stock.  They carry all the specialty items I love to use in my cooking including, thyme, basil, sage, San Marzano tomatoes, different blends of olive oils, anchovies, capers, and Dececco pasta.  Good selection of pears and berries too.  Everything is reasonably priced, and in a good location.  It's near restaurants, coffee, banks, and the post office.  You can pick up some groceries while running other errands.







So I'm going to update this review based on what I can come up with... 
This is in regards to a fraudulent charge that I got on my CC. I have a specific credit card that I used to churn mileage points on. This credit card only gets used at supermarkets and no online shopping at all. I only shop in Millbrae and visit 4-5 places on regular basis. Deans Produce is the only place that takes credit card but only by the "swiping option". They put a sign that says swipe only, no chips. Of the other places that I use this card, all of them use chip.. As part of the industry standard, everyone is required by law to take chip cards by using the EMV chip reader. And, we have not heard of any hackers being able to duplicate EMV chips, only by reading magnetic swipes.  

My CC company text me asking about a charge from Walmart Superstore in Southern Cali. The only way I think the card got compromised is because of the swiping. I use my chip at the other grocery stores that I shop at. This is only my speculation, hopefully they can update their system and accept chips. Definitely for the security of their customers. 

Be careful of your credit card, and also be careful of the charges, check your receipts. Some of the workers type in fake item codes for wrong items because they don't know the produce names.







Dean's Produce is a great place for fresh produce. Located on Broadway, Millbrae, this place is my go-to for fresh produce because it is one of only a few places that mainly has fresh produce unlike Safeway, which mainly has processed foods with preservatives. This way I know which products are getting older and which products are fresher. Plus, they are not too expensive too. 

I have been here many times, usually to buy fruit as they have an impressive collection of exotic fruit like durian, dragon fruit, and papaya. In fact if it were not for this place to exist as it had since many many years ago, I would never have tried dragon fruit. Other food products include bottled drinks in the cold aisle located at the back, and snacks as well as spices in the middle of the aisles, which by the way, are a bit too tight to walk through smoothly. 

Unfortunately, as good as this place gets, parking is very tough on Broadway which makes it inconvenient to try and go to Dean's Produce only to find that there is no nearby parking for as long as half an hour. However, on the bright side, the store is on Broadway making it a very appealing place to walk, eat, buy, and talk. Overall, Dean's Produce is a decent store, although I would generally only come to buy fresh fruits when I have the time. With that, thank you for some nice visits Dean's Produce!







About a week ago I went into deans produce and I am always here always shopping here. I decided to buy some olives and they were all rotten inside so I went to go back the next day to tell them I totally understand that it's not the workers fault but when I went it to give it back and give them a heads up the Asian older lady was extremely disrespectful. I'm not to sure what her name was because they have no name tags there but The way she was replying to me was disrespectful and she needs to treat her customers right what kind of customer service is this.







Excellent selection of low cost/high quality produce. The store is kinda hidden and obviously parking can be tough, since this is the Burlingame Ave of Millbrae and clearly this is where the rubber meets the road. 

I've been in at least a dozen times and this most recent visit brought me to something that I've become quite intrigued by. Fresh jam. Yes, fresh jam!! I know, I should have covered this part of the foodie aisle years ago, but I was reminded of the PB&J crustless sandwiches of my childhood and never wanted to relive those moments. Until now. I picked up a jar of fresh blueberry jelly and slathered some over an English muffin with Almond butter and boy oh boy was it delicious!! 

I also noticed that they offer some exotic fruits that typical grocery stores don't offer all that much. Items such as:

Papaya
Young coconut
Bitter melon
Dragon fruit
Durian (stanky stank fruit I think)
and so so many others

I wanna visit more often, but I find myself at Safeway far too often. Maybe, just maybe, I can visit this spot weekly and feel better about myself when I sit down to enjoy a sliver of dragon fruit.







There is way more variety and fresh produce here than the other local Asian markets.  However, it's hard to beat the quality and prices at the nearby Farmer's market on Saturdays or the Safeway Down the street sometimes.  If you want middle eastern ingredients, this is the place to go.

Parking is ample on the street or nearby lots.  The cashiers are extremely helpful and nice.  They'll even give you a box to carry your groceries if you don't want to pay for the bags.







If you're on a fixed budget, don't go there! Trader Joe's is cheaper. Some of their produces are not fresh enough either.







I have a soft spot for this place! It's as if I'm on a dusty cobbled street in Greece, Portugal, Turkey . . . and accidentally wandered into a small shop of goods, full to the gills with sundry stuff, all unexpected little out of the way treasures. I love going in here with no agenda, just to discover whatever catches my eye, e.g. I got my first taste of dragonfruit from there! I bought just one and watched a youtube video of how to cut it :-) It's one of the rare places that carries cherimoyas, passion fruit, lychees, rambutan, starfruits, and loads of exotic fruits. This is my go to place for buying baked beans and HP sauce from England--it's half the price of grocery shops, where the markup is ridiculous. They have assorted bulk olives in brine, and fresh feta, as well as interesting drinks, e.g. nectars and kefir. I love their aisle of sardines, olive oils, tuna, etc. and my husband lusts for the imported chocolates, sesame/peanut bars. Oh how I wish I wasn't doing gluten-free, cuz they have foccacia's, fresh baked breads from the bakery; of course, they have produce and such, but I wish they made more of an effort to get organic fruits and veggies. Their customer service is as authentic as you might imagine--they're super helpful when I want to return or exchange something. They also have another location in San Mateo, which is larger and with more items, but it has a different vibe: more like an ordinary grocer's. I far prefer this Millbrae location.







What??? 
No. 
Today's purchases: went directly into the garbage!!!

Daikon, spoiled and or completely moldy inside(?)
Melon, inedible and crunchy, dry and mealy. 

See my photo.
I don't see why people flock to this place, Dean should get some standards. 

Too far away to go and complain, and can't serve daikon oroshi w my saba shio yaki tonight. Lame.







Yes, a great variety of ethnic foods, meats and breads.  Same with the vegetables and fruits. BUT check your receipt!!!!    I checked the receipt while emptying the bag at home I was charged for items I never bought AND got OVERCHARGED for fruit by the pound.   This is the SECOND time this happened to me at the same store!!!!!!

 I ever go to Dean's Produce in Millbrae again, I will check my receipt right after the clerk is done and BEFORE I leave the store!!







Great place for produce. Always come here to get fruit for my juicer. The price is much cheaper then other places like Safeway and lucky. The only thing is the produce expires fast so if I'm not going to use it the same day I usually go to Safeway.







I usually come here for my weekly fruits and veggies shopping.

Produce is fresh and clean. Same with the fruits as well. 

They do have middle eastern products as well (cheese, olive oil, breads, etc...)

This is the only place where I buy my honey from as well! 

Once in a blue moon, they do have rare tropical fruits which I am very lucky to find. 

Price is reasonable as well. Wish the store was a little bit more cleaner though..







When we lived in Millbrae, we frequented this grocery store.  I loved it because the produce is so fresh and less expensive than Safeway that's just down the street.  The produce is exceptionally fabulous in the summer.  :)  Employees are ok.  Not super friendly like other stores but decent.

They also have exotic desserts and foods from different countries too.  Bread from Sheng Kee, Kinder and Milka chocolates, baklava, etc.  Fun place to explore.  Great fresh produce at great prices.  Wish there was something similar near our new residence.  Dean's Produce and Sprouts are my faves for fresh, inexpensive produce.







Best place to buy fruits and veggies in Millbrae. They also have a good selection of canned pickles, veggies and fish. There's an Eastern European/Middle Eastern influence, which I love.







Fresh, everything is fresh and very suitable prices. Love their Greek cheese! and you can about everything you need if you are shopping Mediterranean or Middle Eastern Food.







Um, am I missing something here??

I had high expectations for this location, given the # of reviews... but compared to its San Mateo counterpart, it just really doesn't stand up to par. First of all, their produce options are very limited (where were the avocados??), and they seem to place more of an emphasis on their internationally imported items like canned goods and whatnots. Also, the produce doesn't look very clean and the store itself isn't organized as nicely.

Everything here just looks so drab and unclean -- not what I expected at all. I now trek down to San Mateo just to visit that location, as it is MUCH cleaner and the selection of produce is way better/fresher.







A much better place to go for produce than Safeway or Lucky's. Although those places may have more variety, Dean's has harder-to-find fruits and vegetables, like passion fruit and guava, and everything is at a lower price. I always walk away surprised at how little my groceries cost. In addition to produce, they also carry dry goods, a wide variety of spices (seriously, almost any spice you'd want for dirt cheap prices--whole cardamon, dried hibiscus, fennel seeds, etc.), and certain Mediterranean/Middle Eastern/Asian goods. I like to get kalamata olives and feta cheese here for my salads. If they had meat, this would be my one-stop shop.







Every Sunday, I look forward to my weekly Dean's trip. They have a phenomenal selection of inexpensive, high quality produce and ethnic groceries. 

If you are looking for specialty items, Dean's will most likely have it!







Ive been shopping at the newer one in San Mateo for a while now. Only been to this one a couple times. It was a nice day and we were eating in the area. Lots of good product but the unique things are the Greek and other European items you dont see in your average markets. A place where i can regularly get my Borjomi water!







Dean's is such a gem and probably my favorite shop in Millbrae.  Their selection of exotic and regular produce is pretty comprehensive & their prices are cheap!  They beat any Safeway or Whole Foods easily.  The produce is high quality and fresh.  I was able to pick up mangosteen, lychee, Hawaiian papaya, and a variety of tomatoes in one stop.  It's a good place to stop by often because they offer in-season produce and the variety the you can choose from is extensive. They also have plenty of snacks that you can't find at most other places like the KinderSurprise chocolate eggs - which my kids really love.

This is my go to place to buy fresh produce.  I get their double happiness oranges whenever they're in stock.  They carry all the specialty items I love to use in my cooking including, thyme, basil, sage, San Marzano tomatoes, different blends of olive oils, anchovies, capers, and Dececco pasta.  Good selection of pears and berries too.  Everything is reasonably priced, and in a good location.  It's near restaurants, coffee, banks, and the post office.  You can pick up some groceries while running other errands.

Updated review



So I'm going to update this review based on what I can come up with... This is in regards to a fraudulent charge that I got on my CC. I have a specific credit card that I used to churn mileage points on. This credit card only gets used at supermarkets and no online shopping at all. I only shop in Millbrae and visit 4-5 places on regular basis. Deans Produce is the only place that takes credit card but only by the "swiping option". They put a sign that says swipe only, no chips. Of the other places that I use this card, all of them use chip.. As part of the industry standard, everyone is required by law to take chip cards by using the EMV chip reader. And, we have not heard of any hackers being able to duplicate EMV chips, only by reading magnetic swipes.  My CC company text me asking about a charge from Walmart Superstore in Southern Cali. The only way I think the card got compromised is because of the swiping. I use my chip at the other grocery stores that I shop at. This is only my speculation, hopefully they can update their system and accept chips. Definitely for the security of their customers. Be careful of your credit card, and also be careful of the charges, check your receipts. Some of the workers type in fake item codes for wrong items because they don't know the produce names.

Be very aware if your cashier is the young chinese girl that barely speaks english. She's a recent hire and doesn't know her produce. I had a basket of vegetables and fruits which ended up to be $47. Feeling a little weird, I decided to look through the receipt as I walked out the door. I had stuff on the list that I didn't buy, and stuff that I did buy weren't on the list. Didin't buy but was charged: * Asparagus - 3.58lbs @ $2.99/lb = $10.70. * Apricot - 4.21lbs @ $0.99/lb = $4.17Just those two items was close to $15 bucks of overcharging. Not sure how she even got those weight on the scale when those items don't exist in my basket. Weird?Also there was another instance where I asked why they didn't carry "Double Happiness" oranges. The same lady told me they do. I looked at the oranges that she pointed to, it was some "Naval" brand which doesn't taste as good. I said it wasn't the same thing, she said "trust me, it's the same." UHH OK! Btw, all said and done in cantonese. Mr. Dean, I hope you get rid of this girl. She's doing you no good, and you may loose customers. You can check the below info if you need to track which employee it was. I have their name on the receipt as well. Receipt date- 6/24/15Time- 17:09:08Term- 1Store- 1Trx- 374

Dean's Produce is a great place for fresh produce. Located on Broadway, Millbrae, this place is my go-to for fresh produce because it is one of only a few places that mainly has fresh produce unlike Safeway, which mainly has processed foods with preservatives. This way I know which products are getting older and which products are fresher. Plus, they are not too expensive too. I have been here many times, usually to buy fruit as they have an impressive collection of exotic fruit like durian, dragon fruit, and papaya. In fact if it were not for this place to exist as it had since many many years ago, I would never have tried dragon fruit. Other food products include bottled drinks in the cold aisle located at the back, and snacks as well as spices in the middle of the aisles, which by the way, are a bit too tight to walk through smoothly. Unfortunately, as good as this place gets, parking is very tough on Broadway which makes it inconvenient to try and go to Dean's Produce only to find that there is no nearby parking for as long as half an hour. However, on the bright side, the store is on Broadway making it a very appealing place to walk, eat, buy, and talk. Overall, Dean's Produce is a decent store, although I would generally only come to buy fresh fruits when I have the time. With that, thank you for some nice visits Dean's Produce!

About a week ago I went into deans produce and I am always here always shopping here. I decided to buy some olives and they were all rotten inside so I went to go back the next day to tell them I totally understand that it's not the workers fault but when I went it to give it back and give them a heads up the Asian older lady was extremely disrespectful. I'm not to sure what her name was because they have no name tags there but The way she was replying to me was disrespectful and she needs to treat her customers right what kind of customer service is this.

Excellent selection of low cost/high quality produce. The store is kinda hidden and obviously parking can be tough, since this is the Burlingame Ave of Millbrae and clearly this is where the rubber meets the road. I've been in at least a dozen times and this most recent visit brought me to something that I've become quite intrigued by. Fresh jam. Yes, fresh jam!! I know, I should have covered this part of the foodie aisle years ago, but I was reminded of the PB&J crustless sandwiches of my childhood and never wanted to relive those moments. Until now. I picked up a jar of fresh blueberry jelly and slathered some over an English muffin with Almond butter and boy oh boy was it delicious!! I also noticed that they offer some exotic fruits that typical grocery stores don't offer all that much. Items such as:PapayaYoung coconutBitter melonDragon fruitDurian (stanky stank fruit I think)and so so many othersI wanna visit more often, but I find myself at Safeway far too often. Maybe, just maybe, I can visit this spot weekly and feel better about myself when I sit down to enjoy a sliver of dragon fruit.

There is way more variety and fresh produce here than the other local Asian markets.  However, it's hard to beat the quality and prices at the nearby Farmer's market on Saturdays or the Safeway Down the street sometimes.  If you want middle eastern ingredients, this is the place to go.Parking is ample on the street or nearby lots.  The cashiers are extremely helpful and nice.  They'll even give you a box to carry your groceries if you don't want to pay for the bags.

If you're on a fixed budget, don't go there! Trader Joe's is cheaper. Some of their produces are not fresh enough either.

I have a soft spot for this place! It's as if I'm on a dusty cobbled street in Greece, Portugal, Turkey . . . and accidentally wandered into a small shop of goods, full to the gills with sundry stuff, all unexpected little out of the way treasures. I love going in here with no agenda, just to discover whatever catches my eye, e.g. I got my first taste of dragonfruit from there! I bought just one and watched a youtube video of how to cut it :-) It's one of the rare places that carries cherimoyas, passion fruit, lychees, rambutan, starfruits, and loads of exotic fruits. This is my go to place for buying baked beans and HP sauce from England--it's half the price of grocery shops, where the markup is ridiculous. They have assorted bulk olives in brine, and fresh feta, as well as interesting drinks, e.g. nectars and kefir. I love their aisle of sardines, olive oils, tuna, etc. and my husband lusts for the imported chocolates, sesame/peanut bars. Oh how I wish I wasn't doing gluten-free, cuz they have foccacia's, fresh baked breads from the bakery; of course, they have produce and such, but I wish they made more of an effort to get organic fruits and veggies. Their customer service is as authentic as you might imagine--they're super helpful when I want to return or exchange something. They also have another location in San Mateo, which is larger and with more items, but it has a different vibe: more like an ordinary grocer's. I far prefer this Millbrae location.

Yes, a great variety of ethnic foods, meats and breads.  Same with the vegetables and fruits. BUT check your receipt!!!!    I checked the receipt while emptying the bag at home I was charged for items I never bought AND got OVERCHARGED for fruit by the pound.   This is the SECOND time this happened to me at the same store!!!!!! I ever go to Dean's Produce in Millbrae again, I will check my receipt right after the clerk is done and BEFORE I leave the store!!

Great place for produce. Always come here to get fruit for my juicer. The price is much cheaper then other places like Safeway and lucky. The only thing is the produce expires fast so if I'm not going to use it the same day I usually go to Safeway.

I usually come here for my weekly fruits and veggies shopping.Produce is fresh and clean. Same with the fruits as well. They do have middle eastern products as well (cheese, olive oil, breads, etc...)This is the only place where I buy my honey from as well! Once in a blue moon, they do have rare tropical fruits which I am very lucky to find. Price is reasonable as well. Wish the store was a little bit more cleaner though..

When we lived in Millbrae, we frequented this grocery store.  I loved it because the produce is so fresh and less expensive than Safeway that's just down the street.  The produce is exceptionally fabulous in the summer.  :)  Employees are ok.  Not super friendly like other stores but decent.They also have exotic desserts and foods from different countries too.  Bread from Sheng Kee, Kinder and Milka chocolates, baklava, etc.  Fun place to explore.  Great fresh produce at great prices.  Wish there was something similar near our new residence.  Dean's Produce and Sprouts are my faves for fresh, inexpensive produce.

Best place to buy fruits and veggies in Millbrae. They also have a good selection of canned pickles, veggies and fish. There's an Eastern European/Middle Eastern influence, which I love.

Um, am I missing something here??I had high expectations for this location, given the # of reviews... but compared to its San Mateo counterpart, it just really doesn't stand up to par. First of all, their produce options are very limited (where were the avocados??), and they seem to place more of an emphasis on their internationally imported items like canned goods and whatnots. Also, the produce doesn't look very clean and the store itself isn't organized as nicely.Everything here just looks so drab and unclean -- not what I expected at all. I now trek down to San Mateo just to visit that location, as it is MUCH cleaner and the selection of produce is way better/fresher.

A much better place to go for produce than Safeway or Lucky's. Although those places may have more variety, Dean's has harder-to-find fruits and vegetables, like passion fruit and guava, and everything is at a lower price. I always walk away surprised at how little my groceries cost. In addition to produce, they also carry dry goods, a wide variety of spices (seriously, almost any spice you'd want for dirt cheap prices--whole cardamon, dried hibiscus, fennel seeds, etc.), and certain Mediterranean/Middle Eastern/Asian goods. I like to get kalamata olives and feta cheese here for my salads. If they had meat, this would be my one-stop shop.

Every Sunday, I look forward to my weekly Dean's trip. They have a phenomenal selection of inexpensive, high quality produce and ethnic groceries. If you are looking for specialty items, Dean's will most likely have it!

Ive been shopping at the newer one in San Mateo for a while now. Only been to this one a couple times. It was a nice day and we were eating in the area. Lots of good product but the unique things are the Greek and other European items you dont see in your average markets. A place where i can regularly get my Borjomi water!

Dean's is such a gem and probably my favorite shop in Millbrae.  Their selection of exotic and regular produce is pretty comprehensive & their prices are cheap!  They beat any Safeway or Whole Foods easily.  The produce is high quality and fresh.  I was able to pick up mangosteen, lychee, Hawaiian papaya, and a variety of tomatoes in one stop.  It's a good place to stop by often because they offer in-season produce and the variety the you can choose from is extensive. They also have plenty of snacks that you can't find at most other places like the KinderSurprise chocolate eggs - which my kids really love.








Yum!  Hawaiian papaya from Dean's.
