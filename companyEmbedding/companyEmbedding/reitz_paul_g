Maurice Taylor, Chairman, states, "This has been a six year process. Six years ago we hired a search firm to find a Wheel President, a Tire President and a Chief Financial Officer (CFO). When it was time to select the President of Titan, after approximately four years, the Board decided that they could once again retain a search firm or choose one of these three candidates. They determined the right candidate was Paul Reitz, who was made President two years ago and has now earned the right to become both CEO and President. Paul has demonstrated that he is not only intelligent but he knows how to build and lead a strong team.  I look forward to advising him on various engineering products and helping out with new wheel operations in Russia and Brazil.  I will continue visiting our customers and promoting the benefits of our LSW products, along with making an appearance at a few investor conferences."
Mr. Reitz, who is 44 years old, joined the Company in July 2010 as CFO and was promoted to President in February 2014.  Prior to joining Titan, he was the Chief Accounting Officer for Carmike Cinemas based in Columbus, GA.  Mr. Reitz has also held leadership positions with McLeodUSA Publishing, Yellow Book USA Inc., and Deloitte and Touche LLP. He has a Master's of Business Administration Degree from the University of Iowa and a Bachelor of Business Administration Degree from Northwood University. Paul is married with two children who share their parents' passion for sports.
Maurice M. Taylor, Jr., who has been an integral part of Titan since its inception more than 33 years ago, will continue to serve as Chairman of Titan's Board of Directors.

Mission:To provide a center for the performing arts and to foster and broaden community opportunity to enjoy the arts through a year-round schedule of events and performances presented through the the auspices of the Paul G. Reitz Theater.About Us:The exterior of the Paul G. Reitz Theater in DuBois tells the whole story.  This unique theater, located in downtown DuBois at 36 E. Scribner Ave., looks like a church. No wonder. Built in 1887, the theater was a church for nearly all of its 133 years. It was one of the few structures that survived the fire of 1888, which destroyed most of the city. It was the home of the Cornerstone Baptist Church until 1992 when Cultural Resources Inc., an organization of civic-minded community leaders, purchased the structure with the intent of converting it into a theater...

        Titan Names Paul Reitz as CEO
    



        Titan announces Paul G. Reitz has been promoted to the position of CEO, a title he will hold in addition to that of President.
    




        Titan Tire Corp., a subsidiary of Titan Intl.
    



        December 13, 2016
    




The Board of Directors of Titan International Inc. has promoted Paul G. Reitz to Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and President effective January 1, 2017.Maurice Taylor, Chairman, states, "This has been a 6-year process. Six years ago we hired a search firm to find a Wheel President, a Tire President and a Chief Financial Officer (CFO). When it was time to select the President of Titan, after approximately 4 years, the board decided that they could once again retain a search firm or choose one of these three candidates. They determined the right candidate was Paul Reitz, who was made President 2 years ago and has now earned the right to become both CEO and President. Paul has demonstrated that he is not only intelligent but he knows how to build and lead a strong team. I look forward to advising him on various engineering products and helping out with new wheel operations in Russia and Brazil. I will continue visiting our customers and promoting the benefits of our LSW products, along with making an appearance at a few investor conferences."Reitz, who is 44 years old, joined the company in July 2010 as CFO and was promoted to President in February 2014. Prior to joining Titan, he was the Chief Accounting Officer for Carmike Cinemas based in Columbus, GA. Reitz has also held leadership positions with McLeodUSA Publishing, Yellow Book USA Inc., and Deloitte and Touche LLP. He has a Master's of Business Administration Degree from the University of Iowa and a Bachelor of Business Administration Degree from Northwood University. Reitz is married with two children who share their parents' passion for sports.Maurice M. Taylor, Jr., who has been an integral part of Titan since its inception more than 33 years ago, will continue to serve as Chairman of Titan's Board of Directors.
