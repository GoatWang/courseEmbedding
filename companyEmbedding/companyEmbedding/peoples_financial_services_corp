(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Management's Discussion and Analysis 2016 versus 2015  (Dollars in thousands, except per share data)  Management's Discussion and Analysis appearing on the following pages should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis 2016 versus 2015 contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Forward-Looking Discussion:  In addition to the historical information contained in this document, the discussion presented may contain and, from time to time, may make, certain statements that constitute forward-looking statements. Words such as "expects," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates" and other similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as "will," "should," "would" and "could" are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are not historical facts, but instead represent the current expectations, plans or forecasts of Peoples Financial Services Corp. and its subsidiaries regarding its future operating results, financial position, asset quality, credit reserves, credit losses, capital levels, dividends, liquidity, service charges, cost savings, effective tax rate, impact of changes in fair value of financial assets and liabilities, impact of new accounting and regulatory guidance, legal proceedings and other matters relating to us and the securities that we may offer from time to time. These statements are not guarantees of future results or performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict, change over time and are often beyond our control. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, forward-looking statements.  You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement and should consider the uncertainties and risks discussed in the "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report, among others, and in any of our subsequent Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") filings. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that arise after the date the forward-looking statement was made. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements referred to in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") are incorporated by reference into the MD&A. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year's presentation.  Critical Accounting Policies:  Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to establish critical accounting policies and make accounting estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during those reporting periods.  For a discussion of the recent Accounting Standards Updates ("ASU") issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") refer to Note 1 entitled "Summary of significant accounting policies - Recent accounting standards," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.  An accounting estimate requires assumptions about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements if a different amount within a range of estimates were used or if estimates changed from period to period. Readers of this report should understand that estimates are made considering facts and circumstances at a point in time, and changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results that differ from when those estimates were made. Significant estimates that are particularly susceptible to material change within the near term relate to the determination of allowance for loan losses, determination of other-than-temporary impairment of investment securities, fair value of financial instruments, the valuation of real estate acquired in connection with foreclosures or satisfaction of loans, the valuation of deferred tax assets, the valuation of acquired assets and liabilities assumed in business combinations, and the impairment of goodwill. Actual amounts could differ from those estimates.  -30-  Table of Contents  We maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level we believe adequate to absorb probable credit losses related to individually evaluated loans, as well as probable incurred losses inherent in the remainder of the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The balance in the allowance for loan losses account is based on past events and current economic conditions.  The allowance for loan losses account consists of an allocated element and an unallocated element. The allocated element consists of a specific portion for the impairment of loans individually evaluated and a formula portion for loss contingencies on those loans collectively evaluated. The unallocated element, if any, is used to cover inherent losses that exist as of the evaluation date, but which have not been identified as part of the allocated allowance using our impairment evaluation methodology due to limitations in the process.  We monitor the adequacy of the allocated portion of the allowance quarterly and adjust the allowance as necessary through normal operations. This ongoing evaluation reduces potential differences between estimates and actual observed losses. The determination of the level of the allowance for loan losses is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. Accordingly, management cannot ensure that charge-offs in future periods will not exceed the allowance for loan losses or that additional increases in the allowance for loan losses will not be required, resulting in an adverse impact on operating results.  In determining the requirement to record an other-than-temporary impairment on securities owned by us, four main characteristics are considered including:  Fair values of financial instruments, in cases where quoted market prices are not available, are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques which are subject to change.  Real estate acquired in connection with foreclosures or in satisfaction of loans is adjusted to fair value based upon current estimates derived through independent appraisals less cost to sell. However, proceeds realized from sales may ultimately be higher or lower than those estimates.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities. The amount of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, to the amount that, based on available evidence, will more likely than not be realized. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes.  The acquired assets and liabilities assumed in business combinations are measured at fair value as of the acquisition date. In many cases, determining the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities requires the Company to estimate cash flows expected to result from those assets and liabilities and to discount those cash flows at appropriate rates of interest, which required the utilization of significant estimates and judgment in accounting for the acquisition.  Goodwill is evaluated at least annually for impairment or more frequently if conditions indicate potential impairment exist. Any impairment losses arising from such testing are reported in the income statement in the current period as a separate line item within operations.  For a further discussion of our critical accounting policies, refer to Note 1 entitled, "Summary of significant accounting policies," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to this Annual Report. This note lists the significant accounting policies used by us in the development and presentation of the consolidated financial statements. This MD&A, the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial statement disclosures identify and address  -31-  Table of Contents  key variables and other qualitative and quantitative factors that are necessary for the understanding and evaluation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  Operating Environment:  The United States economy slowed in 2016, as the gross domestic product ("GDP"), the value of all goods and services produced in the Nation, came in at an annual rate of 1.9 percent in the fourth quarter, compared to 3.5 percent in the third quarter. The economy grew at 1.6 percent for all of 2016, the worst performance since 2011, after growing at a rate of 2.6 percent in 2015. Again in 2016, the Federal Reserve Board's Federal Open Market Committee ("FOMC") remained on hold for the majority of the year, keeping the target federal funds rate at a range of .25% to .50%. At their December 2016 meeting, the FOMC raised interest rates for the first time in 2016, when they voted to set the new target federal funds rate at a range of .50% to .75%, a 25 basis point increase. The FOMC stated at this meeting that they expect economic conditions will continue to improve and have targeted 3 additional rate hikes in 2017.  Inflation picked up somewhat in 2016, as the consumer price index ("CPI") registered 2.1 percent for 2016, just eclipsing the FOMC's benchmark of 2.0 percent. The CPI was 0.7 percent in 2015. Moreover, the core personal consumption expenditure price index, which ignores food and energy, averaged 2.2 percent in 2016.  On a national level, employment conditions improved in 2016. The civilian labor force increased 1.7 million, while the number of people employed increased 2.1 million in 2016. As a result, the annual unemployment rate for the U.S. fell in 2016 when compared to 2015. All sectors of employment, with the exception of manufacturing, reported employment gains from the end of 2015.  National, Pennsylvania, New York and our market area's non-seasonally-adjusted annual unemployment rates in 2016 and 2015, are summarized as follows:   2016 2015 United States 4.9 % 5.4 % New York (statewide) 4.9 5.3 Pennsylvania (statewide) 5.4 5.1 Broome County 5.4 6.1 Bucks County 4.6 4.5 Lackawanna County 5.7 5.7 Lehigh County 5.5 5.2 Luzerne County 6.4 6.3 Monroe County 6.3 6.2 Montgomery County 4.2 4.0 Susquehanna County 5.5 5.4 Wayne County 5.8 5.7 Wyoming County 6.2 % 5.9 %  Employment conditions deteriorated for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 2016 as evidenced by an increase in the unemployment rate to 5.4 percent in 2016 from 5.1 percent in 2015. Conversely, the unemployment rate for New York State dropped to 4.9 percent in 2016, from 5.3 percent in 2015. With respect to the markets we serve, the unemployment rate increased in eight of the counties in which we have branches or ATM locations, remained the same in one and decreased in one. The lowest unemployment rate in 2016, for all of the counties we serve, was Montgomery County at 4.2 percent. The slight downturn in employment figures in a majority of our markets could have a negative impact on loan performance.  With respect to the banking industry, net income for all Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC")-insured banks in 2016 totaled $171.7 billion, an increase of $7.8 billion or 4.8 percent from 2015. Approximately 65.2 percent of all institutions reported higher net income in 2016, while only 4.2 percent reported net losses. This is the lowest annual proportion of unprofitable institutions for the industry since 2004. Loan loss provisions of $47.8 billion in 2016 were $10.7 billion or 28.8 percent more than banks set aside in 2015. This is the second consecutive year that loan loss  -32-  Table of Contents  provisions have been higher than the preceding year, and the total allocation for 2015 was the largest amount since 2012. Net interest income increased for the third year in a row, by $29.8 billion or 6.9 percent. Noninterest income was $0.8 billion or 0.3 percent below the level of 2015, as servicing fee income decreased by $0.8 billion or 7.4 percent. Realized gains on sales of loans were $1.9 billion or 14.0 percent higher than a year ago. Total noninterest expense decreased $5.1 billion or 1.2 percent comparing 2016 and 2015. The average return on average assets for 2016 was 1.04 percent, unchanged from 2015.  The United States economy continued to improve in 2016. This could affect future interest rates which may adversely impact bank earnings as net interest margins compress from the inability of management to keep fund costs low. Continuous expense control, sound balance sheet management and lower loan loss provisions could offset some of the negative impact of the reduction in net interest margins.  Review of Financial Position:  Peoples Financial Services Corp., a bank holding company incorporated under the laws of Pennsylvania, provides a full range of financial services through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Peoples Security Bank and Trust Company ("Peoples Bank"), including its subsidiary, Peoples Advisors, LLC (collectively, the "Company" or "Peoples"). On November 30, 2013, Penseco Financial Services Corporation, a financial holding company incorporated under the laws of Pennsylvania ("Penseco"), merged with and into Peoples Financial Services Corp., with Peoples Financial Services Corp. being the surviving corporation (the "Merger"), pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated June 28, 2013 (the "Merger Agreement"). In connection with the Merger, on December 1, 2013, Penseco's former banking subsidiary, Penn Security Bank and Trust Company, merged with and into Peoples Neighborhood Bank (the "Bank Merger"), and the resulting institution adopted the name, "Peoples Security Bank and Trust Company." The Company services its retail and commercial customers through twenty-five full-service community banking offices located within the Lackawanna, Lehigh, Luzerne, Monroe, Montgomery, Susquehanna, Wayne and Wyoming Counties of Pennsylvania and Broome County of New York.  Peoples Bank is a state-chartered bank and trust company under the jurisdiction of the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Peoples Bank's primary product is loans to small- and medium-sized businesses. Other lending products include one-to-four family residential mortgages and consumer loans. Peoples Bank primarily funds its loans by offering open time deposits to commercial enterprises and individuals. Other deposit product offerings include certificates of deposits and various demand deposit accounts.  Peoples Advisors, LLC, a member-managed limited liability company, provides investment advisory services through a third party to individuals and small businesses.  Peoples Advisors, LLC did not meet the quantitative threshold for required segment disclosure in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). Peoples Bank's twenty-five community banking offices, all similar with respect to economic characteristics, share a majority of the following aggregation criteria: (i) products and services;  The Company faces competition primarily from commercial banks, thrift institutions and credit unions within its Pennsylvania and New York market, many of which are substantially larger in terms of assets and capital. In addition, mutual funds and security brokers compete for various types of deposits, and consumer, mortgage, leasing and insurance companies compete for various types of loans and leases. Principal methods of competing for banking and permitted nonbanking services include price, nature of product, quality of service and convenience of location.  The Company and Peoples Bank are subject to regulations of certain federal and state regulatory agencies and undergo periodic examinations.  -33-  Table of Contents  Total assets, loans and deposits were $2.0 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2016. Total assets, loans and deposits grew 9.9 percent, 14.3 percent and 9.1 percent, respectively, compared to 2015 year-end balances.  The loan portfolio consisted of $1.1 billion of business loans, including commercial and commercial real estate loans, and $424.0 million in retail loans, including residential mortgage and consumer loans at December 31, 2016. Total investment securities were $269.9 million at December 31, 2016, including $259.4 million of investment securities classified as available-for sale and $10.5 million classified as held-to-maturity. Total deposits consisted of $353.7 million in noninterest-bearing deposits and $1.2 billion in interest-bearing deposits at December 31, 2016.  Stockholders' equity equaled $256.6 million, or $34.71 per share, at December 31, 2016, and $248.8 million, or $33.57 per share, at December 31, 2015. Dividends declared for the 2016 amounted to $1.24 per share representing 46.8 percent of net income.  Nonperforming assets equaled $14.2 million or 0.93 percent of loans, net and foreclosed assets at December 31, 2016, up from $12.5 million or 0.93 percent at December 31, 2015. The allowance for loan losses equaled $16.0 million or 1.04 percent of loans, net, at December 31, 2016, compared to $13.0 million or 0.97 percent at year-end 2015. Loans charged-off, net of recoveries equaled $2.0 million or 0.14 percent of average loans in 2016, compared to $1.1 million or 0.08 percent of average loans in 2015.  Investment Portfolio:  Primarily, our investment portfolio provides a source of liquidity needed to meet expected loan demand and generates a reasonable return in order to increase our profitability. Additionally, we utilize the investment portfolio to meet pledging requirements and reduce income taxes. At December 31, 2016, our portfolio consisted primarily of short-term U.S. Treasury and Government agency securities, which provide a source of liquidity and intermediate-term, tax-exempt state and municipal obligations, which mitigate our tax burden.  Our investment portfolio is subject to various risk elements that may negatively impact our liquidity and profitability. The greatest risk element affecting our portfolio is market risk or interest rate risk ("IRR"). Understanding IRR, along with other inherent risks and their potential effects, is essential in effectively managing the investment portfolio.  Market risk or IRR relates to the inverse relationship between bond prices and market yields. It is defined as the risk that increases in general market interest rates will result in market value depreciation. A marked reduction in the value of the investment portfolio could subject us to liquidity strains and reduced earnings if we are unable or unwilling to sell these investments at a loss. Moreover, the inability to liquidate these assets could require us to seek alternative funding, which may further reduce profitability and expose us to greater risk in the future. In addition, since the majority of our investment portfolio is designated as available-for-sale and carried at estimated fair value, with net unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity, market value depreciation could negatively impact our capital position.  For the majority of 2016 the FOMC kept the target federal funds rate at a range of 0.25% to 0.50%. At their December 2016 meeting, the FOMC decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 0.50% to 0.75%. The FOMC expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. Our investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed-rate bonds. As a result, changes in the velocity and magnitude of future FOMC actions can significantly influence the fair value of our portfolio. Specifically, the parts of the yield curve most closely related to our investments include the 2-year and 10-year U.S. Treasury securities. The yield on the 2-year U.S. Treasury note affects the values of our U.S. Treasury and Government agency securities, whereas the 10-year U.S. Treasury note influences the value of tax-exempt state and municipal obligations. The yield on the 2-year U.S. Treasury ranged from a low of 56  -34-  Table of Contents  basis points to a high of 129 basis points during 2016 before ending the year at 1.20 percent. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury ranged from a low of 137 basis points to a high of 260 basis points while ending 2016 at 2.45 percent. Since bond prices move inversely to yields, we experienced a decline in the aggregate fair value of our investment portfolio when comparing December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2015 due to higher rates at year end 2016. The net unrealized holding gains included in our available-for-sale investment portfolio was $553 thousand at December 31, 2016 compared to $4.6 million at December 31, 2015. We reported net unrealized holding gains, included as a separate component of stockholders' equity of $359 thousand, net of income taxes of $194 thousand, at December 31, 2016, and $3.0 million, net of income taxes of $1.6 million, at December 31, 2015. An increase in interest rates could negatively impact the market value of our investments and our capital position. In order to monitor the potential effects a rise in interest rates could have on the value of our investments, we perform stress test modeling on the portfolio. Stress tests conducted on our portfolio at December 31, 2016, indicated that should general market rates increase by 100, 200 and 300 basis points, we would anticipate declines of 3.0 percent, 6.1 percent and 9.1 percent in the market value of our portfolio.  The carrying values of the major classifications of investment securities and their respective percentages of total investment securities for the past three years are summarized as follows:  Distribution of investment securities   2016 2015 2014 December 31, Amount % Amount % Amount % U.S. Treasury securities $ 7,438 2.76 % $ 9,999 3.37 % 48,550 13.70 U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises 80,913 29.98 69,060 23.25 $ 96,245 27.17 % State and municipals: Taxable 15,225 5.64 16,545 5.57 17,407 4.91 Tax-exempt 119,462 44.25 131,789 44.36 100,271 28.31 Mortgage-backed securities: U.S. Government agencies 21,110 7.82 31,652 10.66 37,576 10.61 U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises 25,779 9.55 37,999 12.79 54,202 15.30 Total $ 269,927 100.00 % $ 297,044 100.00 % $ 354,251 100.00 %  Investment securities decreased $27.1 million, to $269.9 million at December 31, 2016, from $297.0 million at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016, the investment portfolio consisted of $259.4 million of investment securities classified as available-for-sale and $10.5 million classified as held-to-maturity. Strong loan demand during the first three quarters of 2016 resulted in using a portion of the investment cash flow to fund loans. Excess cash flow from investment payments and repayments was directed back into the investment portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2016. Security purchases totaled $62.0 million in 2016, with the majority of the purchases consisting of short-term U.S. Treasury securities and intermediate- term U.S. government sponsored enterprises securities. Investment purchases in 2015 amounted to $90.4 million.  Repayments of investment securities totaled $54.7 million in 2016 and $60.8 million in 2015. We received proceeds of $27.4 million from the sale of investment securities in 2016 and $82.0 million in 2015. Net gains recognized on the sale of investment securities available-for-sale totaled $623 in 2016 and $1,189 in 2015. The 2016 sales consisted of $17.1 million of short-term U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises securities and $10.3 million of short-term U.S. Treasury securities. We continually analyze the investment portfolio with respect to its exposure to various risk elements.  The composition of our investment portfolio changed during 2016 as a result of the aforementioned transactions. Short-term bullet U.S. Treasury and U.S. Government-sponsored enterprise securities comprised 32.7 percent of our total portfolio at year-end 2016 compared to 26.6 percent at the end of 2015. Tax-exempt municipal obligations declined slightly as a percentage of the total portfolio to 44.3 percent at year-end 2016 from 44.4 percent at the end of 2015. The weighted average life of the investment portfolio shortened to 4.4 years at December 31, 2016 from 5.0 years at year end 2015, while the effective duration of the investment portfolio increased slightly to 2.9 years at December 31, 2016 from 2.7 years at December 31, 2015.  -35-  . . .

SCRANTON, Pa., Feb. 2, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Peoples Financial Services Corp. ("Peoples") (NASDAQ:   PFIS), the bank holding company for Peoples Security Bank and Trust Company, announced today that its board of directors has authorized a stock repurchase plan providing for the purchase of up to 225,000 shares of its outstanding common stock.  The timing, price and volume of repurchases will be based on market conditions, relevant securities laws and other factors.  The stock repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.  The stock repurchase program does not require Peoples to repurchase any specific number of shares, and Peoples may terminate the repurchase program at any time.  Peoples currently has approximately 7,404,606 shares of common stock outstanding.
About Peoples Financial Services Corp.  
Peoples Financial Services Corp. is the parent company of Peoples Security Bank and Trust Company, a community bank serving Lackawanna, Lehigh, Luzerne, Monroe, Susquehanna, Wayne and Wyoming Counties in Pennsylvania and Broome County in New York through 24 offices. Each office, interdependent with the community, offers a comprehensive array of financial products and services to individuals, businesses, not-for-profit organizations and government entities. Peoples' business philosophy includes offering direct access to senior management and other officers and providing friendly, informed and courteous service, local and timely decision making, flexible and reasonable operating procedures and consistently applied credit policies.
Safe Harbor Forward-Looking Statements:  
We make statements in this press release, and we may from time to time make other statements regarding our outlook or expectations for future financial or operating results and/or other matters regarding or affecting Peoples Financial Services Corp., Peoples Security Bank and Trust Company, and its subsidiaries (collectively, "Peoples") that are considered "forward-looking statements" as defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Such forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of such words as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "should," "planned," "estimated," "intend" and "potential." For these statements, Peoples claims the protection of the statutory safe harbors for forward-looking statements.
Peoples cautions you that a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those currently anticipated in any forward-looking statement. Such factors include, but are not limited to: prevailing economic and political conditions, particularly in our market area; credit risk associated with our lending activities; changes in interest rates, loan demand, real estate values and competition; changes in accounting principles, policies, and guidelines; changes in any applicable law, rule, regulation or practice with respect to tax or legal issues; our ability to identify and address cyber-security risks and other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory and technological factors affecting Peoples' operations, pricing, products and services and other factors that may be described in Peoples' Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time.
In addition to these risks, acquisitions and business combinations, present risks other than those presented by the nature of the business acquired. Acquisitions and business combinations may be substantially more expensive to complete than originally anticipated, and the anticipated benefits may be significantly harder-or take longer-to achieve than expected. As regulated financial institutions, our pursuit of attractive acquisition and business combination opportunities could be negatively impacted by regulatory delays or other regulatory issues. Regulatory and/or legal issues related to the pre-acquisition operations of an acquired or combined business may cause reputational harm to Peoples following the acquisition or combination, and integration of the acquired or combined business with ours may result in additional future costs arising as a result of those issues.
The forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this release, and, except as may be required by applicable law or regulation, Peoples assumes no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those projected in the forward-looking statements.

There's an advantage in working with a financial advisor who knows you – and your financial goals. That's what makes Edward Jones different from other investment firms. Supporting the relationship between you and your financial advisor shapes nearly every aspect of our business.
You may have seen one of our 12,000 offices in your community. That's because we believe you deserve more than a 1-800 number when it comes to your financial future.
What you may not know is that we're a Fortune 500 company with thousands of associates and sophisticated technology supporting your local financial advisor.
The Edward Jones approach in determining your goals, and developing tailored financial strategies, has been helping nearly 7 million clients for more than 90 years.
In fact, we like to think we became one of the largest financial services firms in the country by not acting that way. If you're ready to work with a different kind of investment firm—one that cares as much about why you're investing as what you invest in— you're ready to work with Edward Jones.

Focus On You

Focus On You




Every investment firm has principles. And they usually sound exactly the same. We believe Edward Jones is different in almost every way. Our principles were deliberately created with you in mind. We don't just talk about personal service. We're built to deliver it.
Your dedicated financial advisor – It's your financial future, so an 800-number or Internet search for financial advice doesn't cut it. You have a relationship with an Edward Jones financial advisor, who spends time to learn why you're investing and then develops a personalized strategy. No cookie-cutter plans here.
In your neighborhood – With more than 15,000 financial advisors, you shouldn't have to go far to find an Edward Jones office in your community. That means you can actually meet with a financial advisor to discuss what's important to you.
Tailored for individual investors - All of our resources – including investment research, online account access, easy-to-understand statements, sophisticated software and detailed reports – are developed with you in mind.
Experienced support team - Backing up this personal service is a Fortune 500 company with thousands of people and advanced technology. Your financial advisor uses these resources to develop the best strategy for you.
We spend the time and have the knowledge to help you sort through complicated financial questions. Most financial services firms claim to focus on you and your needs, but can they really do it? We believe Edward Jones is uniquely positioned from the ground up to provide the attention, respect and service you deserve.

Prepare for Your First Appointment 
Learn more



Prepare for Your First Appointment 




We're honored that you're considering working with us to help achieve your financial goals. Here are three ways you can prepare our first meeting.


Think about why you're investing
Understanding the "why" will help you be better prepared to discuss your goals and strategies to help reach them. What's important to you and your family? What do you want to achieve?


Gather your statements
If you've worked with a financial advisor before, it's helpful to know about your current investments and your experience to date. If you're new to the investing world, we promise to talk with you, not at you. Our goal is to empower you with the knowledge you'll need to pursue your goals.


Bring your questions
We want to make sure to answer any investment questions you may have, as well as how we can best work together. What do you expect? How often do you want to touch base?

Invested in the Community






We are invested in our community
We value the communities where we work, so we're committed to giving back. You'll find our associates serving clients in our offices, but you'll also find us investing our time and talents to support local organizations and great causes. Many Financial Advisors are on Chambers of Commerce and serve as board members and event coordinators for local organizations, and our associates volunteer, donate and support a variety of charitable organizations.







Tour De Ted
Each year, branch and Home Office associates take to the road to raise funds for cancer research for the firm's annual Tour de Ted. In memory of Ted Jones, former managing partner who died from cancer, the first Tour de Ted showcased the firm's community-oriented culture while paying tribute to the history of Edward Jones. Volunteers rode the path of the original "wire" that connected Pueblo, Colo., to St. Louis, Mo., which created our branch network.







Emergency Assistance
Sixteen Financial Advisors in Texas decided to set aside one day out of their busy schedules to give back to their community. They volunteered at the Montgomery County Emergency Assistance facility by painting offices and hallways, and sorting and tagging clothes.







School Supply Drive
Eight local Edward Jones Financial Advisors teamed up on behalf of school children, clearly demonstrating their commitment to family values. Their school supply drive brought in hundreds of classroom necessities, from notebooks and markers to tissues and cleaning wipes.







Habitat for Humanity
When investors wanted to save for a new home, Edward Jones was there to help. Associates from Ontario, Canada, helped a local family reach its goal of home ownership in another way when they came together for the Habitat for Humanity build in Amherstburg, Ont., the first such home built in this community.







Pedal the Cause
We're proud of our associates who joined the fight against cancer as Edward Jones Pedal the Cause riders. More than 200 bike riders from across the U.S. took to the streets (and the Katy Trail) to help fundraise for cancer research.







Walk to End Alzheimer's®
At Edward Jones, we live and work in the communities we serve. We want to make a difference in people’s lives, both in and out of the office. Alzheimer’s disease has a significant impact on individuals, family, friends and community. That’s why we’ve chosen to partner with the Alzheimer’s Association as the National Presenting Sponsor of the Walk to End Alzheimer’s®. We invite you to join us in the fight to end this terrible disease.
