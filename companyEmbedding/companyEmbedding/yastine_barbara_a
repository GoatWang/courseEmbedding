Ally Financial





Ally Financial Inc. said Barbara Yastine, the head of its banking unit, will step down, a move that comes less than two months after Jeffrey Brown took over as the auto lender’s chief executive.  Yastine, who served as chief executive, chairman and president of the banking unit, will remain with the company until June to assist with the transition. She became CEO of Ally Bank in May 2012 and had joined the company two years earlier as chief administrative officer. Ally

                                         said a successor would be named in the near term.  The Detroit-based company, which was formerly known as GMAC, named Brown to succeed Michael Carpenter as CEO in early February. Carpenter’s comments about a decision by former parent General Motors Co. to shut the company out of a lucrative leasing business didn’t sit well with Ally’s board, The Wall Street Journal reported at the time.   An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.

Mastercard welcomes UK court ruling to block $18 billion class action suitMastercard Inc.   on Friday welcomed a decision by a U.K. court to block a 14 billion pound ($18 billion) class action suit against the company that alleged it had overcharged more than 45 million Britons over a 16-year stretch. The Competition Appeal Tribunal sided with the card issuer, which argued that the claims were unsuitable to be brought under a collective actions regime. "We welcome the Competition Appeal Tribunal's judgment refusing certification for the proposed collective action," the company said in a statement. The suit was brought by law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP, and centered on interchange fees, which are charged to the banks of merchants that accept MasterCard debit and credit cards. The firm alleged that Mastercard had set fees at too high a level. Mastercard shares were up 0.6% and have gained 25% in 2017, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average   has gained 9%.
