I stumbled across Dr. Woodburn and I am so glad I did. I can honestly not say enough good things about him.  He actually cares, is attentive and will not stop until he gets answers for you.  I have been to him multiple times now and I have never been disappointed.  BUT-he is extremely hard to get in with for new patients...because everyone loves him!

Mark D. Woodburn and Terry LaCore: Lit. Rel. No. 20702 / September 4, 2008















Home | Previous Page






























U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
Litigation Release No. 20702 / September 4, 2008
Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No. 2872 / September 4, 2008
Securities and Exchange Commission v. Mark D. Woodburn and Terry LaCore, Civil Action No. 3:08-cv-1555-G/Northern District of Texas (Dallas Division)
On September 3, 2008, the Commission filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas charging two former officers of Natural Health Trends Corp. ("NHT") of Dallas, Texas, with securities fraud and other violations arising from undisclosed related party transactions from 2001 through 2005. The defendants are Mark D. Woodburn, of Southlake, Texas, NHT's former president, director and CFO, and Terry LaCore, of Flower Mound, Texas, the former president of NHT's chief subsidiary and an NHT director.
According to the complaint, from 2001 through August 2005, NHT's top distributor paid Woodburn and LaCore, directly and indirectly, approximately $2.5 million in undisclosed payments. The complaint also alleges that, in February 2004, Woodburn caused NHT to loan $256,200 to a Woodburn family-controlled company, and later took steps to conceal related party nature of the loan when it was discovered by NHT's new accounting management in the fall of 2004. As a result of Woodburn and LaCore's activities, the complaint continues, NHT failed to disclose, or inadequately disclosed, the related party transactions in periodic filings, registration statements, and proxy statements.
Woodburn and LaCore agreed to settle the SEC's charges without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint. Woodburn agreed to settle charges that he violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Sections 10(b) and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b2-2, 14a-3, and 14a-9, and aided and abetted NHT's violations of Section 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13. LaCore agreed to settle charges that he violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b) and 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-2, 14a-3, and 14a-9 and aided and abetted Woodburn's violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 14a-3 and 14a-9. Each agreed to be permanently enjoined from violations of the specified statutes and to a five-year officer and director bar. Woodburn agreed to pay a $60,000 civil penalty, and LaCore agreed to pay a $50,000 civil penalty.

An assignment agreement is a document used to assign rights and responsibilities to a party. If a party (''assignor'') is overwhelmed with work, and can not adequately fill their responsibilities to an individual or company (''obligor''), they can assign them to a third party (''assignee'').

These documents may include debt assignment as well. The agreement details the rights and obligations for each party, and the terms under which the agreement was made. It may also include the consent and release by the parties, any changes made to the obligations of the assigning party, governing law, information about the scope of authority the new party receives, and other issues.

You might use an assignment agreement if you were hired to provide a service to a business, such as web design, and due to extenuating circumstances, you were unable to perform the obligations you assumed. You would perhaps choose to hire a subcontractor to fulfill your responsibilities, upon consent of the obligated party.

Ex-CFO Settles Self-Dealing Fraud Charges Former president and finance chief of Natural Health Trends, along with a unit executive, come to terms in SEC civil case.Stephen Taub, CFO.com | USSeptember 4, 2008
The former president and CFO of a Dallas health-product marketing company, along with another one-time executive, settled Securities and Exchange Commission civil charges that they engaged in a fraud arising from undisclosed related-party transactions.
Mark D. Woodburn, former president, director and CFO of Natural Health Trends Corp., agreed to pay a $60,000 penalty, while Terry LaCore, the former president of NHT's chief subsidiary and an NHT director, agreed to pay $50,000. Both individuals agreed to settle the SEC's charges without admitting to or denying allegations in the complaint.
The SEC alleged that from 2001 through August 2005, NHT's top distributor paid Woodburn and LaCore, directly and indirectly, about $2.5 million in undisclosed payments. Also, in February 2004 Woodburn caused NHT to loan $256,200 to a Woodburn family-controlled company, and that fall took steps to conceal the related-party nature of the loan after NHT's new accounting management discovered it.
As a result of Woodburn and LaCore's activities, NHT failed to disclose, or inadequately disclosed, the related party transactions in periodic filings, registration statements, and proxy statements, according to the complaint.
 After NHT discovered the extent of the executives' conduct in the fall of 2005, it demoted, and later terminated, Woodburn and Lacore. NHT's stock price dropped about 25 percent after the company's October 5, 2005 announcement that it was demoting the officers, who had failed to cooperate with an Audit Committee investigation initiated in the fall of 2004, the SEC noted.
Under the settlement, each of the two individuals also agreed to a five-year officer and director bar.
