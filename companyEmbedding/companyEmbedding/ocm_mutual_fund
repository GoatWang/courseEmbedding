GOLD
THE PREEMINENT
FORM OF MONEY




Experienced Management Delivering a Gold Related Asset for Investors in Uncertain Monetary Times.
OCM Gold Fund is a precious metals mutual fund designed for investors seeking portfolio diversification and a potential hedge against monetary debasement. OCM Management has a strong belief and understanding in gold’s monetary attributes and seeks to deliver investment performance through a disciplined approach utilizing its in depth knowledge of gold and the precious metals mining industry.






OCM Gold Fund
EXPERTISE AND EXPERIENCE
THE OCM ADVANTAGE




Employing the knowledge of its long tenured portfolio manager with over 30 years’ experience in the gold sector, the Fund invests in major gold producers, intermediate and junior gold producers along with exploration and development companies. While predominately value oriented, the Fund seeks out companies that are growing production and reserves on a per share basis utilizing a disciplined approach to return on capital. The Fund also seeks out special growth opportunities within the precious metals sector.
OCM Gold Fund has historically low portfolio turnover of less than 10% per annum. The Fund asset size allows for investment flexibility with liquid participation in all sectors of the gold mining industry, including micro-cap, and has a long history of portfolio tax efficient management.






GOLD
AN ESSENTIAL ASSET




The OCM Gold Fund is designed for long-term investors desiring diversification of their investment portfolio with a gold related asset to hedge against monetary debasement. The Fund invests primarily in common stocks of gold and silver mining companies that tend to be more volatile than gold bullion and require a specialized understanding of the precious metals mining industry. The OCM Gold Fund is managed by its long-time portfolio manager, Greg Orrell, who brings over 30 years of investment experience in the precious metals sector to allocating the Fund’s capital through an active disciplined investment approach. We believe an investment in gold and gold related assets is a long-term strategic investment that can play an essential part in a diversified investment portfolio. The OCM Gold Fund is committed to providing its investors with a gold related asset that seeks to meet their needs and investment objectives.






Portfolio Manager
GREG ORRELL




The OCM Gold Fund has been managed by its long-time portfolio manager Greg Orrell since 1996. He is one of the longest tenured gold fund portfolio managers in the industry. With over 32 years of investment experience in the precious metals mining sector along with a deep understanding of gold’s monetary role, Greg is uniquely qualified to manage the assets of the fund. The specialized nature of the gold sector demands experience to evaluate and identify opportunities and cycles within the sector while managing the associated risks. Greg’s experience and belief in gold as money is what sets the OCM Gold Fund apart and aligns the Fund with its shareholders.
Greg is also the president of Orrell Capital Management, investment adviser to the Fund, and received his BS in Economics and Business Administration from Saint Mary’s College of California.




 






Invested in Our Investors
Fund Profile
The OCM Gold Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation by investing primarily in common stocks of gold and silver mining companies. The OCM Gold Fund is designed for investors desiring diversification of their investment portfolio with a gold related asset to hedge against currency devaluation or inflation and are willing to accept the risk and volatility associated with investments in gold and gold mining shares.
We believe gold is money and history has shown that all fiat credit based currencies ultimately become worthless over time. Investing in the OCM Gold Fund provides investors access to a firm who understands the history of money while also providing a knowledgeable and disciplined approach to investments in the precious metal mining sector.

Advisor
Founded in 1991, Orrell Capital Management (OCM) is a boutique SEC registered investment adviser specializing in the precious metals mining industry.  The Firm’s depth of knowledge and breadth of experience in the gold mining industry are unique to the sector.

Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the OCM Gold Fund. This and other important information about a Fund is contained in a Fund’s Prospectus, which can be obtained by calling 1-800-779-4681. The Prospectus should be read carefully before investing. Funds are distributed by Northern Lights Distributors, LLC, FINRA/SIPC. Orrell Capital Management, Inc. and Northern Lights Distributors are not affiliated.
MUTUAL FUNDS INVOLVE RISK INCLUDING POSSIBLE LOSS OF PRINCIPAL
There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its objective.

The prices of securities of gold and precious metals producers have been subject to substantial price fluctuations over short periods of time and may be affected by unpredictable international monetary and political developments such as currency devaluations or revaluations, economic and social conditions within a country, trade imbalances, or trade or currency restrictions between countries. The prices of gold and other precious metals may decline versus the dollar, which would adversely affect the market prices of the securities of gold and precious metals producers. Because the Fund concentrates its investments in the gold mining industry, a development adversely affecting that industry (for example, changes in the mining laws which increase production costs) would have a greater adverse effect on the Fund than it would if the Fund invested in a number of different industries.
Many of the companies in which the Fund invests are smaller capitalization companies (namely, companies with a market capitalization of $4 billion or less). Smaller capitalization companies typically have relatively lower revenues, limited product lines, lack of management depth and a smaller share of the market for their products or services than larger capitalization companies. The stocks of smaller capitalization companies tend to have less trading volume than stocks of larger capitalization companies. Less trading volume may make it more difficult for the investment adviser to sell stocks of smaller capitalization companies at quoted market prices. Finally, there are periods when investing in smaller capitalization stocks falls out of favor with investors and the stocks of smaller capitalization companies underperform.
Medium capitalization companies tend to be more susceptible to adverse business or economic events than large capitalization companies, and there is a risk that the securities of medium capitalization companies may have limited liquidity and greater price volatility than securities of large capitalization companies.
There are risks associated with investing in foreign common stocks that are in addition to the risks associated with investing in U.S. common stocks. The U.S. dollar value of foreign securities traded in foreign currencies (and any dividends and interest earned) may be affected unfavorably by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. An increase in the U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which securities held by the Fund are traded will adversely affect the Fund. The Fund may invest in stocks of foreign companies that are classified under the Internal Revenue Code as passive foreign investment companies (“PFICs”). To the extent that the Fund invests in these securities, the Fund may be subject to an interest charge in addition to federal income tax (at ordinary income rates) on (i) any “excess distribution” received on the stock of a PFIC, or (ii) any gain from disposition of PFIC stock that was acquired in an earlier taxable year. This interest charge and ordinary income tax treatment may apply even if the Fund distributes such income as a taxable dividend to its shareholders. To the extent possible, the Fund will adopt tax strategies to avoid the interest charge and the ordinary income tax treatment. Such tax strategies may accelerate the recognition of income by the Fund (without the receipt of cash) and increase the amount required to be distributed by the Fund to avoid taxation. In addition, such tax strategies may require the Fund to liquidate other investments to meet its distribution requirement (including when it may not be advantageous for the Fund to liquidate such investments), which may accelerate the recognition of gain and affect the Fund’s total return. Foreign securities markets tend to have less trading volume and are more volatile than U.S. securities markets. Less trading volume makes it more difficult to sell foreign securities at quoted prices. There is the risk that political, social or economic events in a country may adversely affect the Fund’s investments in the country. There is the risk that investors in a foreign securities market may not be afforded the same protections as investors in U.S. securities markets. This is also the risk that it may be more difficult, costly and slower to enforce legal rights of the Fund in foreign countries.

Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the OCM Gold Fund.

There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its objective.

The prices of securities of gold and precious metals producers have been subject to substantial price fluctuations over short periods of time and may be affected by unpredictable international monetary and political developments such as currency devaluations or revaluations, economic and social conditions within a country, trade imbalances, or trade or currency restrictions between countries. The prices of gold and other precious metals may decline versus the dollar, which would adversely affect the market prices of the securities of gold and precious metals producers. Because the Fund concentrates its investments in the gold mining industry, a development adversely affecting that industry (for example, changes in the mining laws which increase production costs) would have a greater adverse effect on the Fund than it would if the Fund invested in a number of different industries.
Many of the companies in which the Fund invests are smaller capitalization companies (namely, companies with a market capitalization of $4 billion or less). Smaller capitalization companies typically have relatively lower revenues, limited product lines, lack of management depth and a smaller share of the market for their products or services than larger capitalization companies. The stocks of smaller capitalization companies tend to have less trading volume than stocks of larger capitalization companies. Less trading volume may make it more difficult for the investment adviser to sell stocks of smaller capitalization companies at quoted market prices. Finally, there are periods when investing in smaller capitalization stocks falls out of favor with investors and the stocks of smaller capitalization companies underperform.
Medium capitalization companies tend to be more susceptible to adverse business or economic events than large capitalization companies, and there is a risk that the securities of medium capitalization companies may have limited liquidity and greater price volatility than securities of large capitalization companies.
There are risks associated with investing in foreign common stocks that are in addition to the risks associated with investing in U.S. common stocks. The U.S. dollar value of foreign securities traded in foreign currencies (and any dividends and interest earned) may be affected unfavorably by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. An increase in the U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which securities held by the Fund are traded will adversely affect the Fund. The Fund may invest in stocks of foreign companies that are classified under the Internal Revenue Code as passive foreign investment companies (“PFICs”). To the extent that the Fund invests in these securities, the Fund may be subject to an interest charge in addition to federal income tax (at ordinary income rates) on (i) any “excess distribution” received on the stock of a PFIC, or (ii) any gain from disposition of PFIC stock that was acquired in an earlier taxable year. This interest charge and ordinary income tax treatment may apply even if the Fund distributes such income as a taxable dividend to its shareholders. To the extent possible, the Fund will adopt tax strategies to avoid the interest charge and the ordinary income tax treatment. Such tax strategies may accelerate the recognition of income by the Fund (without the receipt of cash) and increase the amount required to be distributed by the Fund to avoid taxation. In addition, such tax strategies may require the Fund to liquidate other investments to meet its distribution requirement (including when it may not be advantageous for the Fund to liquidate such investments), which may accelerate the recognition of gain and affect the Fund’s total return. Foreign securities markets tend to have less trading volume and are more volatile than U.S. securities markets. Less trading volume makes it more difficult to sell foreign securities at quoted prices. There is the risk that political, social or economic events in a country may adversely affect the Fund’s investments in the country. There is the risk that investors in a foreign securities market may not be afforded the same protections as investors in U.S. securities markets. This is also the risk that it may be more difficult, costly and slower to enforce legal rights of the Fund in foreign countries.

Gold – Gold Mining Shares Climbing Wall of Worry? – OCM Gold Fund

Gold – Gold Mining Shares Climbing Wall of Worry?

It is almost across the board long-time gold investors are looking for gold and shares of gold mining companies to correct after a strong first quarter. Worried about the commercial short position in gold contracts on the Comex and over-bought technical readings and “because it has gone up” appear to be the reasoning. Perhaps there will be a pull back, but what investors forget is that bear markets teach you how not to make money in bull markets because you are so afraid of the market turning tail again. Gold investors should take note, the complete wash out in the sector over the past five years combined with the low sector market capitalization means only a small movement of capital looking to reposition into gold will push share prices higher or limit the extent of a correction. Additionally, the Gold/XAU ratio is still in the early phases of recovering from extreme levels as investors appreciate management efforts on capital discipline and cost controls enacted over the past couple of years. Currently at 17.57, the Gold/XAU ratio it could easily drop in half from here to get closer to historical averages. Take a look at the chart below.

Sourced Global Insight and CSI
The XAU Index is a capitalization-weighted index featuring sixteen widely held securities in the gold and silver mining and production industry or companies investing in such mining and production companies.
What is Driving Gold?  Is it the Fed? The Presidential Election? Weak Global Economy?
It is all of the above. The Federal Reserve’s lift off interest rate increase no longer overhangs the gold market and now the Fed’s credibility is being questioned with its ability to “normalize” rates being viewed by many as a fallacy because it is captive to weakening financial asset prices. Now the prospect for negative rates spreading from Japan and Europe to the U.S. is starting to become a real possibility if the global economy fails to accelerate over the next 12 months. Another factor creeping into the gold market is the uncertainty surrounding the presidential election in the U.S. The world view of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is not favorable. Additionally, confidence in equity markets is beginning to wane and the Dow/Gold ratio appears to have reversed trend pointing to gold outperforming equity markets. Recall Dow/Gold ratio has historically bottomed at 1:1 when confidence is lost in financial assets. See Dow/Gold ratio chart below.

Sourced Global Insight and CSI
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is a price-weighted average of 30 significant stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq.
Negative Rates Prompt German Insurer Munich Re to Hold Gold
Faced with a negative interest rate environment in Europe, Munich Re has allocated 1.4% of its €231 billion portfolio to gold bullion and recently added physical cash. Munich Re’s Chief Executive Nikolaus von Bomhard commented regarding ECB policy, “The side effects of the ECB policy is of course now having quite devastating consequences. I think they are solving the wrong problem with the wrong remedies.”  Von Bomhard concerns speak to the uncertain outcome of extreme monetary policies by Western central bankers. The risk/reward of having cash balances in banks with the risk of bail-ins or bank failures with zero to negative interest rates clearly favors having physical cash and gold in von Bomhard’s opinion, one that may gain momentum across Europe the longer negative rates persist.

India’s Gold Monetization Scheme Failing…as Expected
“The country’s finance minister announced a scheme to monetise the gold holdings of India’s families, but the finance minister back at home, the housewife, is having none of it…’I am not even able to convince my wife to part with her jewellery, which she hardly uses,’ one official reportedly said at the meeting.” The effort to thwart gold imports and thus limit the strain on India’s current account is failing as only 3 tonnes have been deposited out of an estimated 20,000 tonnes held in country over the past year.

World Gold Production by Country
A couple of comments on world gold production. China miraculously remains in the top position without one Chinese Mining company among the top ten gold producing mining companies in the world. If you read a bit of skepticism into that comment, you would be correct. Chinese and Russian gold production doesn’t hit world markets as the gold is consumed within the countries, with both central banks active in purchasing gold for their own accounts. South Africa once produced 1500 tonnes of gold per year going back to the 1970’s. We are still of the opinion world gold production is set to decline 20% or more over the next 5 to 10 years.

There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its objective.

The prices of securities of gold and precious metals producers have been subject to substantial price fluctuations over short periods of time and may be affected by unpredictable international monetary and political developments such as currency devaluations or revaluations, economic and social conditions within a country, trade imbalances, or trade or currency restrictions between countries. The prices of gold and other precious metals may decline versus the dollar, which would adversely affect the market prices of the securities of gold and precious metals producers. Because the Fund concentrates its investments in the gold mining industry, a development adversely affecting that industry (for example, changes in the mining laws which increase production costs) would have a greater adverse effect on the Fund than it would if the Fund invested in a number of different industries.
Many of the companies in which the Fund invests are smaller capitalization companies (namely, companies with a market capitalization of $4 billion or less). Smaller capitalization companies typically have relatively lower revenues, limited product lines, lack of management depth and a smaller share of the market for their products or services than larger capitalization companies. The stocks of smaller capitalization companies tend to have less trading volume than stocks of larger capitalization companies. Less trading volume may make it more difficult for the investment adviser to sell stocks of smaller capitalization companies at quoted market prices. Finally, there are periods when investing in smaller capitalization stocks falls out of favor with investors and the stocks of smaller capitalization companies underperform.
Medium capitalization companies tend to be more susceptible to adverse business or economic events than large capitalization companies, and there is a risk that the securities of medium capitalization companies may have limited liquidity and greater price volatility than securities of large capitalization companies.
There are risks associated with investing in foreign common stocks that are in addition to the risks associated with investing in U.S. common stocks. The U.S. dollar value of foreign securities traded in foreign currencies (and any dividends and interest earned) may be affected unfavorably by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. An increase in the U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which securities held by the Fund are traded will adversely affect the Fund. The Fund may invest in stocks of foreign companies that are classified under the Internal Revenue Code as passive foreign investment companies (“PFICs”). To the extent that the Fund invests in these securities, the Fund may be subject to an interest charge in addition to federal income tax (at ordinary income rates) on (i) any “excess distribution” received on the stock of a PFIC, or (ii) any gain from disposition of PFIC stock that was acquired in an earlier taxable year. This interest charge and ordinary income tax treatment may apply even if the Fund distributes such income as a taxable dividend to its shareholders. To the extent possible, the Fund will adopt tax strategies to avoid the interest charge and the ordinary income tax treatment. Such tax strategies may accelerate the recognition of income by the Fund (without the receipt of cash) and increase the amount required to be distributed by the Fund to avoid taxation. In addition, such tax strategies may require the Fund to liquidate other investments to meet its distribution requirement (including when it may not be advantageous for the Fund to liquidate such investments), which may accelerate the recognition of gain and affect the Fund’s total return. Foreign securities markets tend to have less trading volume and are more volatile than U.S. securities markets. Less trading volume makes it more difficult to sell foreign securities at quoted prices. There is the risk that political, social or economic events in a country may adversely affect the Fund’s investments in the country. There is the risk that investors in a foreign securities market may not be afforded the same protections as investors in U.S. securities markets. This is also the risk that it may be more difficult, costly and slower to enforce legal rights of the Fund in foreign countries.

Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the OCM Gold Fund. This and other important information about a Fund is contained in a Fund’s Prospectus, which can be obtained by calling 1-800-779-4681. The Prospectus should be read carefully before investing. Funds are distributed by Northern Lights Distributors, LLC, FINRA/SIPC. Orrell Capital Management, Inc. and Northern Lights Distributors are not affiliated.
MUTUAL FUNDS INVOLVE RISK INCLUDING POSSIBLE LOSS OF PRINCIPAL
There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its objective.

The prices of securities of gold and precious metals producers have been subject to substantial price fluctuations over short periods of time and may be affected by unpredictable international monetary and political developments such as currency devaluations or revaluations, economic and social conditions within a country, trade imbalances, or trade or currency restrictions between countries. The prices of gold and other precious metals may decline versus the dollar, which would adversely affect the market prices of the securities of gold and precious metals producers. Because the Fund concentrates its investments in the gold mining industry, a development adversely affecting that industry (for example, changes in the mining laws which increase production costs) would have a greater adverse effect on the Fund than it would if the Fund invested in a number of different industries.
Many of the companies in which the Fund invests are smaller capitalization companies (namely, companies with a market capitalization of $4 billion or less). Smaller capitalization companies typically have relatively lower revenues, limited product lines, lack of management depth and a smaller share of the market for their products or services than larger capitalization companies. The stocks of smaller capitalization companies tend to have less trading volume than stocks of larger capitalization companies. Less trading volume may make it more difficult for the investment adviser to sell stocks of smaller capitalization companies at quoted market prices. Finally, there are periods when investing in smaller capitalization stocks falls out of favor with investors and the stocks of smaller capitalization companies underperform.
Medium capitalization companies tend to be more susceptible to adverse business or economic events than large capitalization companies, and there is a risk that the securities of medium capitalization companies may have limited liquidity and greater price volatility than securities of large capitalization companies.
There are risks associated with investing in foreign common stocks that are in addition to the risks associated with investing in U.S. common stocks. The U.S. dollar value of foreign securities traded in foreign currencies (and any dividends and interest earned) may be affected unfavorably by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. An increase in the U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which securities held by the Fund are traded will adversely affect the Fund. The Fund may invest in stocks of foreign companies that are classified under the Internal Revenue Code as passive foreign investment companies (“PFICs”). To the extent that the Fund invests in these securities, the Fund may be subject to an interest charge in addition to federal income tax (at ordinary income rates) on (i) any “excess distribution” received on the stock of a PFIC, or (ii) any gain from disposition of PFIC stock that was acquired in an earlier taxable year. This interest charge and ordinary income tax treatment may apply even if the Fund distributes such income as a taxable dividend to its shareholders. To the extent possible, the Fund will adopt tax strategies to avoid the interest charge and the ordinary income tax treatment. Such tax strategies may accelerate the recognition of income by the Fund (without the receipt of cash) and increase the amount required to be distributed by the Fund to avoid taxation. In addition, such tax strategies may require the Fund to liquidate other investments to meet its distribution requirement (including when it may not be advantageous for the Fund to liquidate such investments), which may accelerate the recognition of gain and affect the Fund’s total return. Foreign securities markets tend to have less trading volume and are more volatile than U.S. securities markets. Less trading volume makes it more difficult to sell foreign securities at quoted prices. There is the risk that political, social or economic events in a country may adversely affect the Fund’s investments in the country. There is the risk that investors in a foreign securities market may not be afforded the same protections as investors in U.S. securities markets. This is also the risk that it may be more difficult, costly and slower to enforce legal rights of the Fund in foreign countries.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

3 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 3 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 70 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund scores Average because it delivered returns that were in the middle 35% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


High


This fund's expenses are rated as High because they are above the 80th percentile when compared with other funds in the category.





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks long-term growth of capital.




Strategy



The fund principally invests (normally at least 80% of its net assets, plus borrowings for investment purposes) in equity securities of domestic and foreign companies of any size engaged in all sectors of the gold mining and precious metals industries. A foreign company is one that is organized under the laws of a foreign country and has the principal trading market for its stock in a foreign country. The fund is non-diversified.


Risk



The gold industry can be significantly affected by international monetary and political developments such as currency devaluations or revaluations, central bank movements, economic and social conditions within a country, trade imbalances, or trade or currency restrictions between countries. Fluctuations in the price of gold and precious metals can dramatically affect the profitability of companies in the gold and precious metals sector and can directly affect the value of the securities issued by such companies. Sector funds can be more volatile because of their narrow concentration in a specific industry. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average

This fund scores Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 40th and 60th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund scores Average because it delivered returns that were in the middle 35% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Risk



The gold industry can be significantly affected by international monetary and political developments such as currency devaluations or revaluations, central bank movements, economic and social conditions within a country, trade imbalances, or trade or currency restrictions between countries. Fluctuations in the price of gold and precious metals can dramatically affect the profitability of companies in the gold and precious metals sector and can directly affect the value of the securities issued by such companies. Sector funds can be more volatile because of their narrow concentration in a specific industry. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. Transaction Fee:A transaction fee is similar to a  brokerage fee or commission which you pay when you buy or sell a stock. For some funds available through Fidelity you are required to pay a transaction fee. However, you will not pay a sales load on Transaction Fee (TF) funds. You will only be charged a transaction fee when you buy a FundsNetwork TF fund, not when you sell one. All other fees and expenses described in a fund's prospectus still apply. You can choose to buy or sell shares directly from the fund itself or its principal underwriter or distributor without paying a transaction fee to Fidelity.Online Transaction Fees:  $49.95 for most funds.  Certain funds will have a transaction fee of $75. To identify any applicable transaction fees associated with the purchase of a given fund, please refer to the "Fees and Distributions" tab.Fidelity Automated Service Telephone (FAST): 25% off representative-assisted rates, Maximum: $187.50, Minimum:$75Representative-Assisted: 0.75% of principal, Maximum: $250, Minimum: $100Automatic Investment: $5 per transaction, after the initial investment.Sales load:A sales charge added to the price of the fund.  Funds have different sales charge structures, including front-end loads, back-end loads (deferred), and no loads. Sales loads can either be charged when a fund is purchased, commonly known as a front-end load, or when a fund is sold, known as a deferred load. Not  all funds charge a load. Refer to the Loads, Expense and Minimums section of the fund's prospectus for details on these amounts. Although no load funds do not have a front-end or deferred load, they may incur other fees, such as a 12b-1 fee.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
7. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
8. StyleMap� depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
9. Please note Regional Diversification information is based on the equity components only.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
