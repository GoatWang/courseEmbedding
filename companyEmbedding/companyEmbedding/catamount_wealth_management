      “Our promise is this...we will always put your interests first. We will get to know your hopes and dreams, and we will always be there for you because at Financial Engines that's what we do.”        



LARRY M. RAFFONE
President and Chief Executive Officer




Connect with a top Financial Advisor in your area who will work hard for you.
You need to build a high-quality relationship that serves your needs and preferences.
        A key role of an advisor is to listen to your needs and concerns, and to provide the objective feedback and experience in financial markets that will keep your plans on track. Most of us wouldn’t dream of performing surgery on ourselves, pleading our own case in court, or designing structural supports for a house. But, amazingly, many doctors, lawyers, architects – and people from all walks of life – design and carry out their own financial plans. A financial advisor is not someone to meet once and never see again.
      





Do-it-yourself financial planning can be time-consuming and often delivers unfavorable results.
If you have built up significant savings of at least $50,000 or more, it is time to consider bringing in a professional financial advisor to help preserve and expand your nest egg. Someone trained, credentialed and experienced in financial planning can help you design and execute a plan that best meets your needs and tolerance for risk. And there’s no better time than the present to get started.

		Our Approach
	 




Our investment strategy is conservative and sensible, geared to building wealth over the long term. We look to grow our clients’ assets over time by compounding returns, not over days or months, but over a complete market cycle. Our approach to investing is straightforward and based on proven methodologies. We work closely with our clients to determine their investment goals and risk tolerance. We have high quality investment managers with demonstrable track records. This is how we implement our strategy.
IDENTIFY MARKET TRENDS
Understanding overall market trends is a key element in investing. After that, it is finding the balance between participating in a rising market and preserving capital in a declining market. We do not limit ourselves to a “buy and hold” mentality but rather adapt to market conditions and invest accordingly.
ESTABLISHING PARAMETERS
We employ stop-loss protection in order to limit our downside risk and preserve principal. The understanding is that the discipline of selling is just as important as buying. In addition, such strategy takes the emotion out of investing, which also prevents major losses.
RISK VS. REWARD
When evaluating an investment, it is important to understand the concept of risk vs. reward. In the simplest terms, the higher the reward, the greater the risk. We work closely with our clients to tailor investment portfolios that align with their goals and objectives, but more importantly, match their expectations.
DIVERSIFICATION
A diversified portfolio is essential to manage risk. Diversification can be achieved typically through minimal positions which represent different industry sectors. We build portfolios of complementary investments, typically a mixture of fixed income products (bonds) and equities (stocks), both domestic and international.
BUILDING WEALTH
Once we have established a solid foundation, we focus on providing clients with superior returns and less volatility. Our investment plan is simple—a plan steeped in a philosophy adhering to a long term, disciplined strategy; one that is flexible with its expectations and rigid with its rules of investing.

		Our Investment Philosophy
	 At Catamount Wealth Management we continuously assess our investments in terms of quality, risk and market conditions. We monitor our positions and evaluate them against our stringent screening criteria. We stay agile, adjusting as necessary in order to optimize profitability. Tactics that support our strategy for long-term wealth management include:
MONITORING MACROECONOMIC TRENDS
We pay close attention to the myriad of influences on the financial markets. Factors include the political landscape, monetary and fiscal policy, economic data and forecasts, foreign markets and exchange rates, inflation trends, interest rates, investor sentiment, etc.
EXTENSIVE RESEARCH
Research is key to our investment philosophy. There are thousands of publicly traded companies across hundreds of industry groups. We identify and select top performing companies based on:
Key fundamental analytics including:
• Financial strength, cash flow, earnings acceleration
• Management quality, dedication and experience
• Top quality, innovative products, strong pipeline
• Market share, competition
Key technical analytics including:
• Top sectors
• Trading range and volume
• Liquidity
MODIFYING POSITIONS
We manage portfolios pro-actively. We consistently adjust and upgrade clients’ portfolios to combat the ever-changing investment environment by identifying the newest leaders, sectors and industries. Such management aims toward maximizing gains and mitigating losses.
STRINGENT SELECTION PROCESS
When choosing equities, we select companies that are market leaders based on their competitive advantage and their proven ability to innovate. These companies tend to enjoy commanding market share, giving them pricing leverage which is a key component for reliable profitability.

      “Our promise is this...we will always put your interests first. We will get to know your hopes and dreams, and we will always be there for you because at Financial Engines that's what we do.”        



LARRY M. RAFFONE
President and Chief Executive Officer




Connect with a top Financial Advisor in your area who will work hard for you.
You need to build a high-quality relationship that serves your needs and preferences.
        A key role of an advisor is to listen to your needs and concerns, and to provide the objective feedback and experience in financial markets that will keep your plans on track. Most of us wouldn’t dream of performing surgery on ourselves, pleading our own case in court, or designing structural supports for a house. But, amazingly, many doctors, lawyers, architects – and people from all walks of life – design and carry out their own financial plans. A financial advisor is not someone to meet once and never see again.
      





Do-it-yourself financial planning can be time-consuming and often delivers unfavorable results.
If you have built up significant savings of at least $50,000 or more, it is time to consider bringing in a professional financial advisor to help preserve and expand your nest egg. Someone trained, credentialed and experienced in financial planning can help you design and execute a plan that best meets your needs and tolerance for risk. And there’s no better time than the present to get started.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
