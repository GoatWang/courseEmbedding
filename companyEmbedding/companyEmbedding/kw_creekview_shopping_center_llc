	CHARTER OF WILMINGTON TRUST, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION







	ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION




	OF




	WILMINGTON TRUST,
	NATIONAL ASSOCIATION



	For the purpose of organizing an association to perform any lawful activities of national banks, the undersigned
	do enter into the following articles of association:


	FIRST. The title of this association shall be Wilmington Trust, National Association.


	SECOND. The main office of the association shall be in the City of Wilmington, County of New Castle, State of Delaware. The general business of the
	association shall be conducted at its main office and its branches.


	THIRD. The board of directors of this association shall consist of not less than five
	nor more than twenty-five persons, unless the OCC has exempted the bank from the 25-member limit. The exact number is to be fixed and determined from time to time by resolution of a majority of the full board of directors or by resolution of a
	majority of the shareholders at any annual or special meeting thereof. Each director shall own common or preferred stock of the association or of a holding company owning the association, with an aggregate par, fair market or equity value $1,000.
	Determination of these values may be based as of either (i) the date of purchase or (ii) the date the person became a director, whichever value is greater. Any combination of common or preferred stock of the association or holding company
	may be used.


	Any vacancy in the board of directors may be filled by action of a majority of the remaining directors between meetings of
	shareholders. The board of directors may not increase the number of directors between meetings of shareholders to a number which:


	 




	 


	1)


	exceeds by more than two the number of directors last elected by shareholders where the number was 15 or less; or




	 




	 


	2)


	exceeds by more than four the number of directors last elected by shareholders where the number was 16 or more, but in no event shall the number of directors exceed 25, unless the OCC has exempted the bank from the
	25-member limit.




	Directors shall be elected for terms of one year and until their successors are elected and qualified.
	Terms of directors, including directors selected to fill vacancies, shall expire at the next regular meeting of shareholders at which directors are elected, unless the directors resign or are removed from office. Despite the expiration of a
	directors term, the director shall continue to serve until his or her successor is elected and qualifies or until there is a decrease in the number of directors and his or her position is eliminated.


	Honorary or advisory members of the board of directors, without voting power or power of final decision in matters concerning the business of
	the association, may be appointed by resolution of a majority of the full board of directors, or by resolution of shareholders at any annual or special meeting. Honorary or advisory directors shall not be counted to determine the number of directors
	of the association or the presence of a quorum in connection with any board action, and shall not be required to own qualifying shares.


	FOURTH. There
	shall be an annual meeting of the shareholders to elect directors and transact whatever other business may be brought before the meeting. It shall be held at the main office or any other convenient place the board of directors may designate, on the
	day of each year specified therefor in the bylaws, or, if that day falls on a legal holiday in the state in which the association is located, on the next following banking day. If no election is held on the day fixed, or in the event of a legal
	holiday on the following banking day, an election may be held on any subsequent day within 60 days of the day fixed, to be designated by the board of directors, or, if the directors fail to fix the day, by shareholders representing two-thirds of the
	shares issued and outstanding. In all cases at least 10 days advance notice of the time, place and purpose of a shareholders meeting shall be given to the shareholders by first class mail, unless the OCC determines that an emergency
	circumstance exists. The sole shareholder of the bank is permitted to waive notice of the shareholders meeting.





	In all elections of directors, the number of votes each common shareholder may cast will be
	determined by multiplying the number of shares such shareholder owns by the number of directors to be elected. Those votes may be cumulated and cast for a single candidate or may be distributed among two or more candidates in the manner selected by
	the shareholder. If, after the first ballot, subsequent ballots are necessary to elect directors, a shareholder may not vote shares that he or she has already fully cumulated and voted in favor of a successful candidate. On all other questions, each
	common shareholder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by him or her.


	Nominations for election to the board of
	directors may be made by the board of directors or by any stockholder of any outstanding class of capital stock of the association entitled to vote for election of directors. Nominations other than those made by or on behalf of the existing
	management shall be made in writing and be delivered or mailed to the president of the association not less than 14 days nor more than 50 days prior to any meeting of shareholders called for the election of directors; provided, however, that if less
	than 21 days notice of the meeting is given to shareholders, such nominations shall be mailed or delivered to the president of the association not later than the close of business on the seventh day following the day on which the notice of meeting
	was mailed. Such notification shall contain the following information to the extent known to the notifying shareholder:


	 




	 


	1)


	The name and address of each proposed nominee.




	 




	 


	2)


	The principal occupation of each proposed nominee.




	 




	 


	3)


	The total number of shares of capital stock of the association that will be voted for each proposed nominee.




	 




	 


	4)


	The name and residence address of the notifying shareholder.




	 




	 


	5)


	The number of shares of capital stock of the association owned by the notifying shareholder.




	Nominations not made in accordance herewith may, in his/her discretion, be disregarded by the chairperson of the meeting, and the vote tellers
	may disregard all votes cast for each such nominee. No bylaw may unreasonably restrict the nomination of directors by shareholders.


	A
	director may resign at any time by delivering written notice to the board of directors, its chairperson, or to the association, which resignation shall be effective when the notice is delivered unless the notice specifies a later effective date.


	A director may be removed by shareholders at a meeting called to remove the director, when notice of the meeting stating that the purpose
	or one of the purposes is to remove the director is provided, if there is a failure to fulfill one of the affirmative requirements for qualification, or for cause; provided, however, that a director may not be removed if the number of votes
	sufficient to elect the director under cumulative voting is voted against the directors removal.


	FIFTH. The authorized amount of capital stock of
	this association shall be ten thousand shares of common stock of the par value of one hundred dollars ($100) each; but said capital stock may be increased or decreased from time to time, according to the provisions of the laws of the United States.


	No holder of shares of the capital stock of any class of the association shall have any preemptive or preferential right of subscription
	to any shares of any class of stock of the association, whether now or hereafter authorized, or to any obligations convertible into stock of the association, issued, or sold, nor any right of subscription to any thereof other than such, if any, as
	the board of directors, in its discretion, may from time to time determine and at such price as the board of directors may from time to time fix. Preemptive rights also must be approved by a vote of holders of two-thirds of the banks
	outstanding voting shares. Unless otherwise specified in these articles of association or required by law, (1) all matters requiring shareholder action, including amendments to the articles of association, must be approved by shareholders
	owning a majority voting interest in the outstanding voting stock, and (2) each shareholder shall be entitled to one vote per share.





	Unless otherwise specified in these articles of association or required by law, all shares of
	voting stock shall be voted together as a class, on any matters requiring shareholder approval. If a proposed amendment would affect two or more classes or series in the same or a substantially similar way, all the classes or series so affected must
	vote together as a single voting group on the proposed amendment.


	Shares of one class or series may be issued as a dividend for shares of
	the same class or series on a pro rata basis and without consideration. Shares of one class or series may be issued as share dividends for a different class or series of stock if approved by a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the class
	or series to be issued, unless there are no outstanding shares of the class or series to be issued. Unless otherwise provided by the board of directors, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to a share dividend shall be the date
	authorized by the board of directors for the share dividend.


	Unless otherwise provided in the bylaws, the record date for determining
	shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at any meeting is the close of business on the day before the first notice is mailed or otherwise sent to the shareholders, provided that in no event may a record date be more than 70 days before the
	meeting.


	If a shareholder is entitled to fractional shares pursuant to a stock dividend, consolidation or merger, reverse stock split or
	otherwise, the association may: (a) issue fractional shares; (b) in lieu of the issuance of fractional shares, issue script or warrants entitling the holder to receive a full share upon surrendering enough script or warrants to equal a
	full share; (c) if there is an established and active market in the associations stock, make reasonable arrangements to provide the shareholder with an opportunity to realize a fair price through sale of the fraction, or purchase of the
	additional fraction required for a full share; (d) remit the cash equivalent of the fraction to the shareholder; or (e) sell full shares representing all the fractions at public auction or to the highest bidder after having solicited and
	received sealed bids from at least three licensed stock brokers; and distribute the proceeds pro rata to shareholders who otherwise would be entitled to the fractional shares. The holder of a fractional share is entitled to exercise the rights for
	shareholder, including the right to vote, to receive dividends, and to participate in the assets of the association upon liquidation, in proportion to the fractional interest. The holder of script or warrants is not entitled to any of these rights
	unless the script or warrants explicitly provide for such rights. The script or warrants may be subject to such additional conditions as: (1) that the script or warrants will become void if not exchanged for full shares before a specified date;
	and (2) that the shares for which the script or warrants are exchangeable may be sold at the option of the association and the proceeds paid to scriptholders.


	The association, at any time and from time to time, may authorize and issue debt obligations, whether or not subordinated, without the
	approval of the shareholders. Obligations classified as debt, whether or not subordinated, which may be issued by the association without the approval of shareholders, do not carry voting rights on any issue, including an increase or decrease in the
	aggregate number of the securities, or the exchange or reclassification of all or part of securities into securities of another class or series.


	SIXTH.
	The board of directors shall appoint one of its members president of this association, and one of its members chairperson of the board and shall have the power to appoint one or more vice presidents, a secretary who shall keep minutes of the
	directors and shareholders meetings and be responsible for authenticating the records of the association, and such other officers and employees as may be required to transact the business of this association.


	A duly appointed officer may appoint one or more officers or assistant officers if authorized by the board of directors in accordance with the
	bylaws.


	The board of directors shall have the power to:


	 




	 


	1)


	Define the duties of the officers, employees, and agents of the association.




	 




	 


	2)


	Delegate the performance of its duties, but not the responsibility for its duties, to the officers, employees, and agents of the association.




	 




	 


	3)


	Fix the compensation and enter into employment contracts with its officers and employees upon reasonable terms and conditions consistent with applicable law.









	 


	4)


	Dismiss officers and employees.




	 




	 


	5)


	Require bonds from officers and employees and to fix the penalty thereof.




	 




	 


	6)


	Ratify written policies authorized by the associations management or committees of the board.




	 




	 


	7)


	Regulate the manner in which any increase or decrease of the capital of the association shall be made, provided that nothing herein shall restrict the power of shareholders to increase or decrease the capital of the
	association in accordance with law, and nothing shall raise or lower from two-thirds the percentage required for shareholder approval to increase or reduce the capital.




	 




	 


	8)


	Manage and administer the business and affairs of the association.




	 




	 


	9)


	Adopt initial bylaws, not inconsistent with law or the articles of association, for managing the business and regulating the affairs of the association.




	 




	 


	10)


	Amend or repeal bylaws, except to the extent that the articles of association reserve this power in whole or in part to shareholders.




	 




	 


	11)


	Make contracts.




	 




	 


	12)


	Generally perform all acts that are legal for a board of directors to perform.




	SEVENTH. The board of
	directors shall have the power to change the location of the main office to any other place within the limits of Wilmington, Delaware, without the approval of the shareholders, or with a vote of shareholders owning two-thirds of the stock of such
	association for a relocation outside such limits and upon receipt of a certificate of approval from the Comptroller of the Currency, to any other location within or outside the limits of Wilmington Delaware, but not more than 30 miles beyond such
	limits. The board of directors shall have the power to establish or change the location of any branch or branches of the association to any other location permitted under applicable law, without approval of shareholders, subject to approval by the
	Comptroller of the Currency.


	EIGHTH. The corporate existence of this association shall continue until termination according to the laws of the United
	States.


	NINTH. The board of directors of this association, or any one or more shareholders owning, in the aggregate, not less than 50 percent of the
	stock of this association, may call a special meeting of shareholders at any time. Unless otherwise provided by the bylaws or the laws of the United States, a notice of the time, place, and purpose of every annual and special meeting of the
	shareholders shall be given at least 10 days prior to the meeting by first-class mail, unless the OCC determines that an emergency circumstance exists. If the association is a wholly-owned subsidiary, the sole shareholder may waive notice of the
	shareholders meeting. Unless otherwise provided by the bylaws or these articles, any action requiring approval of shareholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting.


	TENTH. For purposes of this Article Tenth, the term institution-affiliated party shall mean any institution-affiliated party of the association as
	such term is defined in 12 U.S.C. 1813(u).


	Any institution-affiliated party (or his or her heirs, executors or administrators) may be
	indemnified or reimbursed by the association for reasonable expenses actually incurred in connection with any threatened, pending or completed actions or proceedings and appeals therein, whether civil, criminal, governmental, administrative or
	investigative, in accordance with and to the fullest extent permitted by law, as such law now or hereafter exists; provided, however, that when an administrative proceeding or action instituted by a federal banking agency results in a final order or
	settlement pursuant to which such person: (i) is assessed a civil money penalty, (ii) is removed from office or prohibited from participating in the conduct of the affairs of the association, or (iii) is required to cease and desist
	from or to take any affirmative action described in 12 U.S.C. 1818(b) with respect to the association, then the association shall require the repayment of all legal fees and expenses advanced pursuant to the next succeeding paragraph and may not
	indemnify such institution-affiliated parties (or their heirs, executors or administrators) for expenses, including expenses for legal fees, penalties or





	other payments incurred. The association shall provide indemnification in connection with an action or proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by an institution-affiliated party (or by his or her
	heirs, executors or administrators) only if such action or proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the board of directors.


	Expenses incurred by an institution-affiliated party (or by his or her heirs, executors or administrators) in connection with any action or
	proceeding under 12 U.S.C. 164 or 1818 may be paid by the association in advance of the final disposition of such action or proceeding upon (a) a determination by the board of directors acting by a quorum consisting of directors who are not
	parties to such action or proceeding that the institution-affiliated party (or his or her heirs, executors or administrators) has a reasonable basis for prevailing on the merits, (b) a determination that the indemnified individual (or his or
	her heirs, executors or administrators) will have the financial capacity to reimburse the bank in the event he or she does not prevail, (c) a determination that the payment of expenses and fees by the association will not adversely affect the
	safety and soundness of the association, and (d) receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such institution-affiliated party (or by his or her heirs, executors or administrators) to repay such advancement in the event of a final order or
	settlement pursuant to which such person: (i) is assessed a civil money penalty, (ii) is removed from office or prohibited from participating in the conduct of the affairs of the association, or (iii) is required to cease and desist
	from or to take any affirmative action described in 12 U.S.C. 1818(b) with respect to the association. In all other instances, expenses incurred by an institution-affiliated party (or by his or her heirs, executors or administrators) in connection
	with any action or proceeding as to which indemnification may be given under these articles of association may be paid by the association in advance of the final disposition of such action or proceeding upon (a) receipt of an undertaking by or
	on behalf of such institution-affiliated party (or by or on behalf of his or her heirs, executors or administrators) to repay such advancement in the event that such institution-affiliated party (or his or her heirs, executors or administrators) is
	ultimately found not to be entitled to indemnification as authorized by these articles of association and (b) approval by the board of directors acting by a quorum consisting of directors who are not parties to such action or proceeding or, if
	such a quorum is not obtainable, then approval by stockholders. To the extent permitted by law, the board of directors or, if applicable, the stockholders, shall not be required to find that the institution-affiliated party has met the applicable
	standard of conduct provided by law for indemnification in connection with such action or proceeding.


	In the event that a majority of the
	members of the board of directors are named as respondents in an administrative proceeding or civil action and request indemnification, the remaining members of the board may authorize independent legal counsel to review the indemnification request
	and provide the remaining members of the board with a written opinion of counsel as to whether the conditions delineated in the first four paragraphs of this Article Tenth have been met. If independent legal counsel opines that said conditions have
	been met, the remaining members of the board of directors may rely on such opinion in authorizing the requested indemnification.


	In the
	event that all of the members of the board of directors are named as respondents in an administrative proceeding or civil action and request indemnification, the board shall authorize independent legal counsel to review the indemnification request
	and provide the board with a written opinion of counsel as to whether the conditions delineated in the first four paragraphs of this Article Tenth have been met. If legal counsel opines that said conditions have been met, the board of directors may
	rely on such opinion in authorizing the requested indemnification.


	To the extent permitted under applicable law, the rights of
	indemnification and to the advancement of expenses provided in these articles of association (a) shall be available with respect to events occurring prior to the adoption of these articles of association, (b) shall continue to exist after
	any restrictive amendment of these articles of association with respect to events occurring prior to such amendment, (c) may be interpreted on the basis of applicable law in effect at the time of the occurrence of the event or events giving
	rise to the action or proceeding, or on the basis of applicable law in effect at the time such rights are claimed, and (d) are in the nature of contract rights which may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction as if the association
	and the institution-affiliated party (or his or her heirs, executors or administrators) for whom such rights are sought were parties to a separate written agreement.





	The rights of indemnification and to the advancement of expenses provided in these articles of
	association shall not, to the extent permitted under applicable law, be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which any such institution affiliated party (or his or her heirs, executors or administrators) may now or hereafter be otherwise entitled
	whether contained in these articles of association, the bylaws, a resolution of stockholders, a resolution of the board of directors, or an agreement providing such indemnification, the creation of such other rights being hereby expressly
	authorized. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the rights of indemnification and to the advancement of expenses provided in these articles of association shall not be deemed exclusive of any rights, pursuant to statute or otherwise,
	of any such institution-affiliated party (or of his or her heirs, executors or administrators) in any such action or proceeding to have assessed or allowed in his or her favor, against the association or otherwise, his or her costs and expenses
	incurred therein or in connection therewith or any part thereof.


	If this Article Tenth or any part hereof shall be held unenforceable in
	any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, it shall be deemed modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable, and the remainder of this Article Tenth shall remain fully enforceable.


	The association may, upon affirmative vote of a majority of its board of directors, purchase insurance to indemnify its institution-affiliated
	parties to the extent that such indemnification is allowed in these articles of association; provided, however, that no such insurance shall include coverage to pay or reimburse any institution-affiliated party for the cost of any judgment or civil
	money penalty assessed against such person in an administrative proceeding or civil action commenced by any federal banking agency. Such insurance may, but need not, be for the benefit of all institution-affiliated parties.


	ELEVENTH. These articles of association may be amended at any regular or special meeting of the shareholders by the affirmative vote of the holders of a
	majority of the stock of this association, unless the vote of the holders of a greater amount of stock is required by law, and in that case by the vote of the holders of such greater amount. The associations board of directors may propose one
	or more amendments to the articles of association for submission to the shareholders.

	other place and time as the board of directors may designate, or if that date falls on a legal holiday in Delaware, on the next following banking day. Notice of the meeting shall be mailed by first class mail, postage prepaid, at least 10 days and
	no more than 60 days prior to the date thereof, addressed to each shareholder at his/her address appearing on the books of the association. If, for any cause, an election of directors is not made on that date, or in the event of a legal holiday, on
	the next following banking day, an election may be held on any subsequent day within 60 days of the date fixed, to be designated by the board of directors, or, if the directors fail to fix the date, by shareholders representing two-thirds of the

	The
	board of directors may fix a record date for determining shareholders entitled to notice and to vote at any meeting, in reasonable proximity to the date of giving notice to the shareholders of such meeting. The record date for determining

	If an annual or special shareholders
	meeting is adjourned to a different date, time, or place, notice need not be given of the new date, time or place, if the new date, time or place is announced at the meeting before adjournment, unless any additional items of business are to be
	considered, or the association becomes aware of an intervening event materially affecting any matter to be voted on more than 10 days prior to the date to which the meeting is adjourned. If a new record date for the adjourned meeting is fixed,
	however, notice of the adjourned meeting must be given to persons who are shareholders as of the new record date. If, however, the meeting to elect the directors is adjourned before the election takes place, at least ten days notice of the new

	Proxies shall be dated and filed with the records of the meeting. Proxies with facsimile signatures may be used and unexecuted proxies may be counted upon receipt of a written confirmation from the shareholder. Proxies meeting the above requirements
	submitted at any time during a meeting shall be accepted.



	Section 5. Quorum

	. A majority of the outstanding capital stock,
	represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at any meeting of shareholders, unless otherwise provided by law, or by the shareholders or directors pursuant to Article IX, Section 2, but less than a quorum may adjourn any
	meeting, from time to time, and the meeting may be held, as adjourned, without further notice. A majority of the votes cast shall decide every question or matter submitted to the shareholders at any meeting, unless otherwise provided by law or by
	the articles of association, or by the shareholders or directors pursuant to Article IX, Section 2. If a meeting for the election of directors is not held on the fixed date, at least 10 days notice must be given by first-class mail to the

	number that would constitute a quorum, no business may be transacted, except selecting directors to fill vacancies in conformance with Article II, Section 7. If a quorum is present, the board of directors may take action through the vote of a
	majority of the directors who are in attendance.

	of the board of directors.

	last examination the affairs of the association or cause suitable examinations to be made by auditors responsible only to the board of directors and to report the result of such examination in writing to the board of directors at the next regular
	meeting thereafter. Such report shall state whether the association is in a sound condition, and whether adequate internal controls and procedures are being maintained and shall recommend to the board of directors such changes in the manner of
	conducting the affairs of the association as shall be deemed advisable.


	Notwithstanding the provisions of the first paragraph of this

	Fiduciary Activities





	Section 1. Trust Audit Committee.

	There shall be a Trust Audit Committee composed of not less than 2 directors, appointed by the
	board of directors, which shall, at least once during each calendar year make suitable audits of the associations fiduciary activities or cause suitable audits to be made by auditors responsible only to the board, and at such time shall
	ascertain whether fiduciary powers have been administered according to law, Part 9 of the Regulations of the Comptroller of the Currency, and sound fiduciary principles. Such committee: (1) must not include any officers of the bank or an
	affiliate who participate significantly in the administration of





	the banks fiduciary activities; and (2) must consist of a majority of members who are not also members of any committee to which the board of directors has delegated power to manage
	and control the fiduciary activities of the bank.

	ARTICLE VI





	Stock and
	Stock Certificates





	Section 1. Transfers

	. Shares of stock shall be transferable on the books of the association, and a
	transfer book shall be kept in which all transfers of stock shall be recorded. Every person becoming a shareholder by such transfer shall in proportion to such shareholders shares, succeed to all rights of the prior holder of such shares. The
	board of directors may impose conditions upon the transfer of the stock reasonably calculated to simplify the work of the association with respect to stock transfers, voting at shareholder meetings and related matters and to protect it against
	fraudulent transfers.



	Section 2. Stock Certificates

	. Certificates of stock shall bear the signature of the president (which

	as an authorized officer, and the seal of the association shall be engraved thereon. Each certificate shall recite on its face that the stock represented thereby is transferable only upon the books of the association properly endorsed.

	accepted on behalf of the association by the chairperson of the board, or the president, or any vice president, or the secretary, or the treasurer, or, if in connection with the exercise of fiduciary powers of the association, by any of those
	offices or by any trust officer. Any such instruments may also be executed, acknowledged, verified, delivered or accepted on behalf of the association in such other manner and by such other officers as the board of directors may from time to time
	direct. The provisions of this section 2 are supplementary to any other provision of these bylaws.



	Section 3. Records

	articles of association, the bylaws and the proceedings of all meetings of the shareholders, the board of directors, and standing committees of the board of directors shall be recorded in appropriate minute books provided for that purpose. The

	Section 4. Corporate Governance Procedures.

	To the extent not inconsistent with federal banking statutes and regulations, or safe
	and sound banking practices, the association may follow the Delaware General Corporation Law, Del. Code Ann. tit. 8 (1991, as amended 1994, and as amended thereafter) with respect to matters of corporate governance procedures.



	Section 5. Indemnification.

	For purposes of this Section 5 of Article VIII, the term institution-affiliated party
	shall mean any institution-affiliated party of the association as such term is defined in 12 U.S.C. 1813(u).


	Any institution-affiliated
	party (or his or her heirs, executors or administrators) may be indemnified or reimbursed by the association for reasonable expenses actually incurred in connection with any threatened, pending or completed actions or proceedings and appeals
	therein, whether civil, criminal, governmental, administrative or investigative, in accordance with and to the fullest extent permitted by law, as such law now or hereafter exists; provided, however, that when an administrative proceeding or action
	instituted by a federal banking agency results in a final order or settlement pursuant to which such person: (i) is assessed a civil money penalty, (ii) is removed from office or prohibited from participating in the conduct of the affairs
	of the association, or (iii) is required to cease and desist from or to take any affirmative action described in 12 U.S.C. 1818(b) with respect to the association, then the association shall require the repayment of all legal fees and expenses
	advanced pursuant to the next succeeding paragraph and may not indemnify such institution-affiliated parties (or their heirs, executors or administrators) for expenses, including expenses for legal fees, penalties or other payments incurred. The
	association shall provide indemnification in connection with an action or proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by an institution-affiliated party (or by his or her heirs, executors or administrators) only if such action or proceeding (or part
	thereof) was authorized by the board of directors.


	Expenses incurred by an institution-affiliated party (or by his or her heirs,
	executors or administrators) in connection with any action or proceeding under 12 U.S.C. 164 or 1818 may be paid by the association in advance





	of the final disposition of such action or proceeding upon (a) a determination by the board of directors acting by a quorum consisting of directors who are not parties to such action or
	proceeding that the institution-affiliated party (or his or her heirs, executors or administrators) has a reasonable basis for prevailing on the merits, (b) a determination that the indemnified individual (or his or her heirs, executors or
	administrators) will have the financial capacity to reimburse the bank in the event he or she does not prevail, (c) a determination that the payment of expenses and fees by the association will not adversely affect the safety and soundness of
	the association, and (d) receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such institution-affiliated party (or by his or her heirs, executors or administrators) to repay such advancement in the event of a final order or settlement pursuant to
	which such person: (i) is assessed a civil money penalty, (ii) is removed from office or prohibited from participating in the conduct of the affairs of the association, or (iii) is required to cease and desist from or to take any
	affirmative action described in 12 U.S.C. 1818(b) with respect to the association. In all other instances, expenses incurred by an institution-affiliated party (or by his or her heirs, executors or administrators) in connection with any action or
	proceeding as to which indemnification may be given under these articles of association may be paid by the association in advance of the final disposition of such action or proceeding upon (a) receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such
	institution-affiliated party (or by or on behalf of his or her heirs, executors or administrators) to repay such advancement in the event that such institution-affiliated party (or his or her heirs, executors or administrators) is ultimately found
	not to be entitled to indemnification as authorized by these bylaws and (b) approval by the board of directors acting by a quorum consisting of directors who are not parties to such action or proceeding or, if such a quorum is not obtainable,
	then approval by stockholders. To the extent permitted by law, the board of directors or, if applicable, the stockholders, shall not be required to find that the institution-affiliated party has met the applicable standard of conduct provided by law
	for indemnification in connection with such action or proceeding.


	In the event that a majority of the members of the board of directors
	are named as respondents in an administrative proceeding or civil action and request indemnification, the remaining members of the board may authorize independent legal counsel to review the indemnification request and provide the remaining members
	of the board with a written opinion of counsel as to whether the conditions delineated in the first four paragraphs of this Section 5 of Article VIII have been met. If independent legal counsel opines that said conditions have been met, the
	remaining members of the board of directors may rely on such opinion in authorizing the requested indemnification.


	In the event that all
	of the members of the board of directors are named as respondents in an administrative proceeding or civil action and request indemnification, the board shall authorize independent legal counsel to review the indemnification request and provide the
	board with a written opinion of counsel as to whether the conditions delineated in the first four paragraphs of this Section 5 of Article VIII have been met. If legal counsel opines that said conditions have been met, the board of directors may
	rely on such opinion in authorizing the requested indemnification.


	To the extent permitted under applicable law, the rights of
	indemnification and to the advancement of expenses provided in these articles of association (a) shall be available with respect to events occurring prior to the adoption of these bylaws, (b) shall continue to exist after any restrictive
	amendment of these bylaws with respect to events occurring prior to such amendment, (c) may be interpreted on the basis of applicable law in effect at the time of the occurrence of the event or events giving rise to the action or proceeding, or
	on the basis of applicable law in effect at the time such rights are claimed, and (d) are in the nature of contract rights which may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction as if the association and the institution-affiliated party
	(or his or her heirs, executors or administrators) for whom such rights are sought were parties to a separate written agreement.


	The
	rights of indemnification and to the advancement of expenses provided in these bylaws shall not, to the extent permitted under applicable law, be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which any such institution-affiliated party (or his or her
	heirs, executors or administrators) may now or hereafter be otherwise entitled whether contained in the associations articles of association, these bylaws, a resolution of stockholders, a resolution of the board of directors, or an agreement
	providing such indemnification, the creation of such other rights being hereby expressly authorized. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the rights of indemnification and to the advancement of expenses provided in these bylaws shall
	not be deemed exclusive of





	any rights, pursuant to statute or otherwise, of any such institution-affiliated party (or of his or her heirs, executors or administrators) in any such action or proceeding to have assessed or
	allowed in his or her favor, against the association or otherwise, his or her costs and expenses incurred therein or in connection therewith or any part thereof.


	If this Section 5 of Article VIII or any part hereof shall be held unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, it
	shall be deemed modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable, and the remainder of this Section 5 of Article VIII shall remain fully enforceable.


	The association may, upon affirmative vote of a majority of its board of directors, purchase insurance to indemnify its institution-affiliated
	parties to the extent that such indemnification is allowed in these bylaws; provided, however, that no such insurance shall include coverage for a final order assessing civil money penalties against such persons by a bank regulatory agency. Such
	insurance may, but need not, be for the benefit of all institution-affiliated parties.



	ARTICLE IX





	Inspection and Amendments





	Section 1. Inspection

	. A copy of the bylaws of the association, with all amendments, shall at all times be kept in a convenient
	place at the main office of the association, and shall be open for inspection to all shareholders during banking hours.



	Section 2. Amendments

	. The bylaws of the association may be amended, altered or repealed, at any regular meeting of the board of
	directors, by a vote of a majority of the total number of the directors except as provided below, and provided that the following language accompany any such change.

We started looking at the housing market in Austin, when my husband was made Associate Professor at UT, Austin; and we had pretty much a few months to plan and execute our move. Since we were moving from overseas, we talked to as many real estate agents as possible on the phone, prior to our first visit to the area for “house hunting.” Already from our first phone conversation, Mark Strub stood apart from other “highly reviewed agents” in the area, such as Eric Bramlett. Mark was funny, likable, and a genuinely good person. He was not just “doing business;” he took the time to get to know us and our unique preferences, before setting us up with our own MLS search page for potential listings.  As first time homebuyers, we had a lot of questions about everything; and there was not a single question that Mark did not know the answer to. He was always available and extremely proactive with all of his communication. He also seemed to have a really good handle on listings, sending us emails about places that were going to come on the market before they even did and keeping us ahead of the game.  When the time came for our three day house hunting trip to Austin, Mark went out of his way to be available anytime we wanted to look at places, day or night. Once we narrowed down our search to a particular community, Central Austin, Mark not only scheduled for us to see all the available houses in that area, but also the schools, as this was our top priority as parents of three school aged children. When we found our “dream home;” Mark was incredibly helpful in bargaining with the seller and getting us the price that we were comfortable paying. At our closing, he was the first one to congratulate us. By that time, he had became somewhat of a “family friend.” He is certainly much more than our “broker.” Over the past three months, we have taken Mark’s expert opinion on things ranging from “types of roofing materials” to “what to do in Austin with kids on weekends.” Mark is now helping us renovate our new house using the amazing connections that he has in Austin. He literally knows anyone and everyone in the real estate market: arborists, inspectors, electricians, contractors- you name it, and Mark can get you in contact with them!In short, Mark Strub is the best realtor you can ask for. He will get you your  dream house and not stop until you are 100 percent happy with everything! I would definitely go to Mark again for anything related to real estate in Austin. The Roman Lopez Real Estate TeamPriscilla R. ratedA year prior to selling our house, I started doing my research around the neighborhood at the different agents that were selling the houses in our area. I would monitor each house in how long they took to sold, how much they sold for and how it was presented to the buyer. Though I had never met this Realtor, on paper he looked awesome. He was always able to sell the home in days or a couple of weeks, the staging of the homes looked great and his clients were always getting asking price.  When it came time to pick a Realtor, I went with my gut and chose the Roman Lopez Team. This was the right choice for our family. We needed to sell our home and buy our new home in a 45 day span. Roman Lopez and Melissa Galvan did an awesome job in helping us buy and sell our home. Melissa and Roman were always a call away and were helpful in what ever questions we needed answer. Roman did an awesome job going to our house and telling us what we needed to do to improve our home to make it more appealing to the buyer. Though i didn't want to go thru all the work of purging the house, painting and improving the look at the house and staging the house, Roman was spot on on what the buyer would want. He was right and it paid off. Roman and his team made this transaction run smoothly. When it came time to pick a buyer, Roman was always there guiding us with his professional advice. Melissa was also wonderful in the buying process. We met with her to discuss the type of home we wanted and the budget we were looking for. We had picked a subdivision that we wanted to live in and while the house that we wanted was not available, we found another house for us to live in. She was great in giving us advice at what to look for when buying a home. She was always an email, phone call or text away and she was always informative in answering our questions. Both Roman and Melissa were also there for the closing of selling and buying our home. They made this process seamless. I would definitely recommend this team when you are looking to buy or sell a home.Century 21 HSK - Jeff & Wendy Mitchler RealtorsAshley A. ratedMy husband and I recently bought our first home with the help of Jeff and Wendy. Let me tell you, Wendy Mitchler is knowledgeable, personable, fantastic at negotiating, and all around wonderful. Jeff is great too! He tries to make it to every inspection so that he is able to assist clients in asking the correct questions to the Inspector. This was so helpful!We had met with a few Realtors by the time we met Wendy. Right away she blew us away. While other Realtors wanted us to sign with them right away, Wendy was patient and walked us through the entire process of buying a house (including going over the contract) so that we would know what to expect as well as know what we were to expect of her. She was very clear about her role - which wasn't pushing us into a house we were unsure about. She is very adamant about her clients loving their home - not just liking it.We had looked at 40 houses at the minimum when we made an offer on our new home. Wendy helped us come up with an offer and helped tweak the contract to benefit us as much as possible. We ended up paying 15k under the apraisal of the house, got a 1k check from the sellers as a painting allowance, and got the fridge thrown in as well. We won't be in the market for another house anytime soon, but if we were, there would be no doubt in our minds of who we would use. We can't thank Jeff and Wendy enough for their patience, time and genuine caring.Austin Bee RealtyDomonique D. ratedCalled Chris up. All I could hear through his deep subdued muffled voice, and the telephone static (turns out he was eating while on his headset) was the address of the apartment we were to meet at, and that we'd meet in 5 minutes.  See you there I said.  After finishing up riding with a realtor with a personality unappealing to my palette, Chris was a breath of fresh air. That's why I liked him. He was at ease in himself. At the same time, Chris was very aware of the changes and apartments in Austin.  I would list a place I saw on Craigslist and he would tell me about the real estate agency and aspects of the apartment.  All the while, he gave random facts about Austin.  He told me about the shooting in 1966 from the University Tower, and how the two police who took down the gunmen argued over who pulled the trigger first.  He's been at this 15 years. Chris breathes this city. He showed me several off the path gems in my price range.  He also really saved me from a challenging situation. The apt I signed with 4 months ago told me my apt wasn't ready 2 days prior to my move in (this Friday). So I chose the 3rd place Chris showed me, and emailed the realtor before writing this.In conclusion, I'd like to say Chris is authentic Austin.  He could easily costar in Slackers 2.  I'll always remember the solar powered flower rocking shades, bobbing up and down on his dashboard forever and ever. Amen.The Roman Lopez Real Estate TeamDnomyar Z. ratedRoman Lopez is an asset. If your looking to buy or sell a home look no further. Roman Lopez is the go to realtor. He is hands down the best ! From our initial consultation to the delivery of my new keys. Roman Lopez was with me every step of the way. He surpassed my real estate expectations. He educated me on many unfamiliar aspects of the real estate market. Roman Lopez is a true professional. He's extremely experienced, very knowledgeable and a pleasure to work with. As a first time home buyer late Dec. 2012 I had a million questions and Roman always had the right answer. I felt comfortable knowing that this home buying decision was a huge step and I had the best support I needed from my realtor. Roman was extremely patient throughout the process and was quick to respond to all my emails, text, or phone calls. Roman's negotiation skills are top notch. Very impressive. He is an extreme professional. Roman Lopez is your realtor. He's loyal and will work tirelessly to achieve the end goal you desire in regards to your real estate needs. If I ever need to sell or buy another home I know who to go to. You should too. Roman Lopez is my realtor for life...The Roman Lopez Real Estate TeamClarissa L. ratedMy experience with Roman was extremely positive. In Early 2012, I was looking for a home that would fit my needs, but more importantly my daughters schooling needs as well. He came to my former house and asked me all the important questions that could help him in finding a home that would suit my needs. It was shortly thereafter that he had homes lined up and ready to go, and not only did they suit my needs, they were WAY more than I expected seeing. Meaning, he took the time to find safe, comfortable homes that had some extra bonuses that would make my living experience even nicer. He went out of his way to show me these homes and let my daughter trek through them and give her thumbs up of approval (or not)! I have NEVER met a more caring realtor that wasn't just in it to make a fast buck, he truly took the time to listen to me and was patient as I was going through a major life transition. Not only did we find the perfect home, but it was literally the perfect neighborhood, that I can today call, family. I got lucky, or maybe Roman is just that awesome...perhaps BOTH! =) You can only go RIGHT with Roman, and I will send everyone I know to him!Century 21 HSK - Jeff & Wendy Mitchler RealtorsAshley H. ratedIf you are looking for quality realtors who truly care about their clients Wendy and Jeff Mitchler are the ones to choose. My husband and I put our first home up for sale in April, and within hours of listing it we had a full price offer. Wendy and Jeff did an excellent job marketing our house, and made our first experience selling a home smooth and painless. Since our home sold so quickly, we moved fast and found the perfect home that we wanted to put an offer on. Due to the crazy real estate market in the area, houses were going into multiple offers as soon as they went on the market. Wendy and Jeff were always available to show us any house we wanted to see the day it came on the market so that we didn't miss an opportunity on the house of our dreams. Despite our dream home being in multiple offers, Wendy's expert negotiation skills not only got the sellers to accept our offer, she even got almost all of our closing costs paid by them! Finding a quality Realtor can be difficult. Choosing Wendy and Jeff Mitchler makes that decision so easy, and makes it one you won't regret! The Roman Lopez Real Estate TeamTimothy S. ratedThe Roman Lopez Real Estate Team: Dee Dee JohnsonLoved itDee Dee Johnson was our agent at Roman Lopez Real Estate. Dee Dee worked with us to buy our new home in North West Hills - Austin, Texas. She is has an impressive fund of knowledgeable about the real estate market in Austin - and it's a tough buyer's market. She was super available to us, and she was gracious enough to work in the evenings and weekends as we were restricted in our day time hours owing to our new jobs. She made to process smooth and easy. She has excellent interpersonal skills and a pleasant demeanor. She was always prompt and well prepared. This is the 7th home I have bought and Dee Dee really made it the most pleasurable of the bunch. We referred Dee Dee to my parents for their move to Austin to be with us. I am happy to say Dee Dee has quickly and professionally help my parents buy their new home. I would defiantly use Dee Dee again. I can't say enough to thank Dee Dee for the help she provided our family in locating our new Austin homes!512 Realtybiffordmichael rated512 get low reviews but i'm assuming it's because they don't play. They mean what they say and while making you do something you aren't excited to do is frustrating, it's SO nice to see when you have issues that they sort them out just as fast as they've had you sorted out. The management are super-quick to address ANY issue, by e-mail or return phone call, this is the FIRST apartment management company I've ever been associated with that does preventative maintenance! Seriously, fixing things or replacing them before there is an issue. In particular I've dealt with the team of Jamie/Rachel/Loren and they are champs. Pure quality, dealing with issues that are bizarre or random with the same level of intensity and speed as issues that are potential safety or comfort oriented. I've been in my 512 unit for 2 plus years and when I finish my work in this area in 2 years we'll be choosing them 512 Realty for our home buying needs based on their excellent work as property managers!Mark Str�b - Str�b ResidentialMegan L. ratedMark helped us put an offer on a house in central Austin and helped us through a painful process with our lender. Mark and his team were excellent in keeping my husband and I sane as our lender (who my husband and I chose) kept messing up our loan and pushing out the closing date. Mark was able to help us successfully negotiate with the seller (Greater Austin Builders) so we could ensure we didn't lose the house due to the lender issue. Mark always has great recommendations and so far he has been right both times we have used his services. He is definitely a really great guy and both my husband and I are so thankful for him and his team. It is very apparent that Mark and his entire team care so much about their clients. We kept Mark busy with emails and he always made us a priority and we always felt like we were his only client even if he had a million others at the time.I will always recommend Mark Strub and his team when someone is looking for a top notch realty team.
