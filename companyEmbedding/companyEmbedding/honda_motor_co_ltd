ในวาระที่รถจักรยานยนต์ ซูเปอร์คับ จะมียอดจาหน่ายสะสมครบ 100 ล้านคัน ในปีนี้ และเตรียมพร้อมก้าวสู่การฉลองวางจาหน่ายครบ 60 ปีในปี 2018 ฮอนด้า ขอนาเสนอเรื่องราวประวัติของ ซูเปอร์คับ รถจักรยานยนต์ที่ครองใจผู้ใช้ทั่วโลก นับตั้งแต่ปี 1958 จนปัจจุบัน

สิ่งที่ชาวญี่ปุ่นต้องการอย่างแท้จริงคืออะไร 
จุดเริ่มต้นของการเดินทางเพื่อค้นหาความล้ำสมัย

มร.โซอิจิโร  ฮอนด้า  กับทีมวิศวกรผู้พัฒนาซูเปอร์คับจากการไวกายาและลองผิดลองถูกหลายเดือน  นำมาซึ่งรถจักรยานยนต์อันทรงเอกลักษณ์ของฮอนด้า

อะไรจะดีกว่ากัน ระหว่างรถจักรยานยนต์แบบโมเพดกับแบบสกูตเตอร์ มร.โซอิจิโร ฮอนด้า ประธานบริษัทฮอนด้ามอเตอร์ และ มร.ทาเคโอะ ฟูจิซาวา กรรมการบริหารอาวุโสในขณะนั้นได้เดินทางไปยุโรป เพื่อค้นหาคำตอบและไอเดียในการพัฒนาผลิตภัณฑ์ใหม่ แต่สิ่งที่ทั้งสองได้พบคือความแตกต่างของภูมิประเทศและลักษณะการใช้งานรถจักรยานยนต์ขนาดเล็กในแต่ละประเทศ ทำให้ทั้งสองมั่นใจว่ายุคสมัยกำลังต้องการรถจักรยานยนต์ขนาดเล็กแบบใหม่ที่ไม่เคยมีมาก่อน และนั่นคือจุดเริ่มของการเดินทางเพื่อค้นหาความนำสมัยของฮอนด้า



สิ่งที่ทั้งสองท่านวาดฝันไว้หลังจากกลับจากยุโรปคือคอมมิวเตอร์ที่ไม่เคยมีมาก่อน


มร.โจซาบุโร คิมูระผู้ออกแบบซูเปอร์คับ (ถ่ายเมื่อปี 2009)


　ปลาย ค.ศ. 1956 ถึงต้น ค.ศ.1957 จากการเดินทางไปศึกษางานที่ทวีปยุโรป ทำให้ไอเดียในการพัฒนารถจักรยานยนต์ใหม่ของ มร.ฮอนด้า และ  มร.ฟูจิซาวา เริ่มเป็นรูปเป็นร่างมากขึ้น ด้านรูปทรงต้องไม่เหมือนทั้งโมเพดและสกูตเตอร์และเป็นรถที่ลูกค้าชาวญี่ปุ่นต้องการเป็นเจ้าของ มีคอนเซปต์การขับขี่รูปแบบใหม่ควบคุมได้ง่าย ทั้งยังมีสไตล์ที่เป็นเอกลักษณ์บ่งบอกความเป็นญี่ปุ่นและความเป็นฮอนด้า พร้อมทั้งเป็นผลิตภัณฑ์ที่ค้ำจุนรากฐานของบริษัท และตอบโจทย์ความคาดหวังของพนักงานฮอนด้าที่รอการกลับมาและการตัดสินใจของผู้บริหารทั้งสองท่าน
　มร.อาคิระ อาคิมะ วิศวกรผู้รับผิดชอบออกแบบระบบส่งกำลัง เล่าว่า “ตอนนั้น เราคุยกันในบริษัทเสมอ และเห็นตรงกันว่า “แม้การพัฒนาเครื่องยนต์ให้มีขนาดใหญ่ขึ้นจะเป็นสิ่งที่สำคัญ แต่ที่สำคัญกว่าคือการพัฒนารถจักรยานยนต์ขนาดเล็กที่ทุกคนสามารถเป็นเจ้าของได้ ซึ่งจะเป็นจุดเริ่มต้นใหม่ที่สำคัญของฮอนด้า” 
　ในที่สุด แนวทางในการพัฒนารถจักรยานยนต์ใหม่ที่ผู้บริหารทั้งสองได้มอบให้ก็คือ “พัฒนารถจักรยานยนต์ที่เหมาะมือ” และ “พัฒนารถจักรยานยนต์ที่ใช้งานง่าย” โดยมีรายละเอียดสำคัญ 4 ประการคือ
- เครื่องยนต์แบบ 4 จังหวะให้กำลังแรง แต่เสียงเบาและประหยัดเชื้อเพลิง
          - ตัวถังมีรูปทรงและขนาดที่ผู้หญิงสามารถขึ้นลงได้ง่าย
          - ระบบเกียร์แบบใหม่ ไม่ต้องมีคันคลัชขณะเปลี่ยนเกียร์
          - มีดีไซน์ล้ำสมัย แต่คุ้นเคยได้ง่าย และไม่น่าเบื่อ
　มร.โจซาบุโร คิมูระ นักออกแบบผลิตภันฑ์ซึ่งขณะนั้นเพิ่งร่วมงานกับฮอนด้าในเดือนพฤศจิกายน ค.ศ. 1956 ยังจำได้ถึงวันที่ได้รับแนวทางการพัฒนาดังกล่าว
　“ตอนนั้น มร.ฮอนด้าบอกว่า ถนนในญี่ปุ่นไม่ดี จึงต้องใช้เครื่องยนต์สี่แรงม้าเป็นอย่างต่ำ รถจักรยานยนต์ใหม่นี้ต้องขับขี่ได้ง่ายบนสถาพถนนที่ขรุขระ” และ มร.ฟูจิซาวาก็เสริมว่า “ต้องเป็นรถจักรยานยนต์ที่ใครๆ ก็ขับขี่ได้อย่างมั่นใจโดยเฉพาะผู้หญิง และเครื่องยนต์ต้องถูกซ่อนไว้ด้วย”
　ปีค.ศ. 1957 ทีมได้เริ่มการพัฒนาเครื่องยนต์แบบ OHV 50 ซีซี 4 สูบ ขึ้นเป็นครั้งแรกของโลก และเพื่อรองรับกับสภาพถนนที่ขรุขระในขณะนั้น จึงต้องบังคับได้ง่ายและมั่นคงแม้ขณะขับขี่ด้วยความเร็วต่ำ
　มร. คิมูระ กล่าวว่า “โจทย์เรื่องเครื่องยนต์สี่แรงม้านี่ยากมากครับ ในตอนนั้นรถรุ่น คับ F เครื่องยนต์ 2 จังหวะ 50 ซีซี ที่เราผลิตยังทำได้แค่ 1 แรงม้า ซึ่งหมายความว่าเราต้องพัฒนาเครื่องยนต์ให้มีกำลังเพิ่มขึ้นถึง 4 เท่า ในยุคที่ถนนสายหลักทั่วประเทศญี่ปุ่นยังปูคอนกรีตแค่เพียง 10 % เท่านั้น”
　แผนกออกแบบเครื่องยนต์ได้รับมอบหมายให้รับผิดชอบการพัฒนารถจักรยานยนต์รุ่นใหม่นี้ ในช่วงเริ่มต้นของการศึกษาแบบร่างโครงสร้างตัวถัง ไอเดียในการวางเครื่องยนต์แนวระนาบก็เกิดขึ้น โดยทีมมองว่าหากไม่ต้องการให้เห็นเครื่องยนต์และสามารถขึ้นขับขี่ได้ง่าย วิธีที่ดีที่สุดคือต้องวางเครื่องยนต์ในแนวระนาบ และออกแบบโครงตัวถังใหม่ให้แกนหลัก(tube)ต่ำเพื่อความสะดวกในการก้าวขึ้นขับขี่ ทีมงานใช้คอนเซปต์ “รูปทรงเพรียว = ขึ้นนั่งขับขี่ได้ง่าย” ในการพัฒนาการออกแบบช่วงแรก ราวกับเป็นรถจักรยานยนต์ที่แตกสายจากสกูตเตอร์ซึ่งกำลังเป็นที่นิยมในขณะนั้น 


มร.โซอิจิโร ฮอนด้า ยิ้มแย้มขณะลองนั่งบนรถต้นแบบที่เพิ่งเสร็จใหม่ๆ เมื่อเดือนพฤษภาคม ค.ศ.1958 (ภาพจากวารสารองค์กรในยุคนั้น)


　เพื่อป้องกันอาการเครื่องยนต์โอเวอร์ฮีท เจ้าหน้าที่ทีมพัฒนาเครื่องยนต์ได้ทดลองเจาะรูเพื่อระบายความร้อนที่ฝาครอบของฝาสูบ และขอให้ผู้ผลิตหัวเทียนผลิตหัวเทียนสเป็คพิเศษที่ต้องการ และอีกหลากหลายไอเดียแปลกใหม่เหนือความคาดหมายจนสามารถพัฒนาเครื่องยนต์ทรงพลัง 4.5 แรงม้า ที่ 9,500 รอบได้ในที่สุด นับเป็นเครื่องยนต์ที่ให้กำลังแรงสูงสุดในขณะนั้น
　และพร้อมกับการพัฒนาเครื่องยนต์ คือการพัฒนาระบบส่งกำลังที่สามารถทำงานร่วมกับคลัชอัตโนมัติแบบเหวี่ยงศูนย์ โดยออกแบบให้ไม่มีคันควบคุมคลัชที่มือจับด้านซ้ายของพวงมาลัย แต่ให้ใช้มือขวากับเท้าซ้ายร่วมกันควบคุมการเปลี่ยนเกียร์ นับเป็นไอเดียที่แหวกแนวอย่างยิ่ง ทำให้ความฝันในการสร้างรถจักรยานยนต์ที่ “เด็กส่งบะหมี สามารถขี่ด้วยมือเดียวได้” เป็นความจริง ตามที่ ม.ร.ฮอนด้า ได้เคยกล่าวไว้และเรามักได้ยินอยู่บ่อยครั้ง
　มร.อาคิมะ เล่าว่า “ตัวคลัชแบบเหวี่ยงศูนย์นั้นไม่ยาก แต่สิ่งที่ยากคือจะทำอย่างไรให้เข้าคลัชได้สอดคล้องกับการเปลี่ยนเกียร์ นอกจากนี้ อัตราส่วนของรอบหมุนของคันเหยียบสตาร์ทที่ทำให้ต้องเข้าคลัชอยู่ตลอดเวลาแม้ตอนหยุดรถ เป็นเงื่อนไขจำเป็นที่ต้องออกแบบให้เข้าคลัชค้างไว้แม้ตอนสตาร์ทเครื่อง” 
　เพื่อออกแบบให้มีโครงสร้างตามเงื่อนไขที่ดูเหมือนว่าขัดแย้งกันเองนี้ เป็นเรื่องยากที่จะหาไอเดียดีๆ ได้ มร.ฮอนด้า เองก็เป็นห่วง พยายามช่วยคิดด้วยตลอด ทุกเช้าท่านจะเดินเข้ามาในห้องออกแบบแล้วถามมาว่า “ไปถึงไหนแล้ว”
　มร.อาคิมะ กล่าวว่า “มีครั้งหนึ่ง ผมเสนอท่านว่า “ถ้าใช้เกลียวช่วย จะเปลี่ยนรอบหมุนของคันเหยียบสตาร์ทให้เกิดรอบหมุนทางเดียวกับแกนหมุนเครื่องยนต์ได้ แต่จะทำให้เกิดปัญหา co rotation รอบหมุนสวนทางกับแกนได้”  พอพูดจบเราก็แยกกันไปทำงาน แต่หลังจากนั้นมานั่งคิดดูใหม่ว่า “คลัชจะมีแรงหน่วงเกิดขึ้น อาจจะทำให้เกิดรอบหมุนทางเดียวกับแกนหมุนเครื่องยนต์ได้” พอคิดได้เช่นนั้น มร.ฮอนด้า ก็วิ่งเข้ามาแล้วบอกว่า “มันต้องเกิดแรงต้านทานที่คลัช อาจจะช่วยรอบหมุนได้” ผมก็บอก มร.ฮอนด้า ว่าผมกำลังคิดแบบเดียวกันพอดี ท่านก็หัวเราะว่า “บางครั้งเราก็คิดเหมือนกันพอดีนะ” หลังจากนั้น เราก็ใช้วิธีนี้ในการแก้ไขปัญหาได้สำเร็จ และผมก็โล่งใจที่พ้นจากความกดดันที่ท่านเข้ามาดูความคืบหน้าทุกๆเช้า”
　การที่ มร.ฮอนด้า เข้ามาที่ห้องออกแบบเป็นประจำนั้น มีที่มาจากจากการที่วิศวกรผู้รับผิดชอบได้หารือในข้อเทคนิคกันอยู่ ในบางครั้งต้องแสดงความคิดเห็นข้ามสายงาน ทำให้ มร.ฮอนด้า เป็นห่วงเข้ามาร่วมหารือด้วย เพื่อให้ได้โครงสร้างตามอุดมคติจึงจำเป็นต้องพูดคุยหารือกันอย่างเปิดอก ไม่ยึดติดกับหน้าที่ที่ตนรับผิดชอบและความอาวุโส พอคุยกันลงรายละเอียดลึกๆ แล้ว เมื่อ มร.ฮอนด้า คิดอะไรได้ก็จะใช้ชอล์กเขียนลงบนกระดานไปเรื่อยๆ จนเขียนรูปโครงสร้างเลยออกจากกระดาน บางทีก็เขียนลงบนพื้นก็มี ทุกคนก็จะมารวมตัวกันเป็นกลุ่มใหญ่ แล้วพอใครพูดอะไรขึ้นมา คนอื่นก็จะพูดเหตุผลอื่นๆ ตามมา ไม่ยึดติดกับสายงานที่ตนรับผิดชอบ ทุกคนจะแย่งกันแสดงความเห็นของตัวเอง ทำให้ท้ายที่สุดได้ไอเดียเป็นรูปเป็นร่างขึ้นมา เป็นจุดเริ่มของ “ไวกายา” (การพูดแสดงความคิดเห็นกันอย่างเสรี) เป็นการสร้างบรรยากาศหารือที่คึกคักได้ตามใจ บางครั้ง คุยกันหน้าดำคร่ำเครียด ทุกคนพูดด้วยอารมณ์ บางครั้ง มร.ฮอนด้า เองก็พูดสบถก็มี
　มร.คิมูระ เสริมว่า “คลัชแบบเหวี่ยงศูนย์เป็นเทคโนโลยีแบบใหม่ จึงไม่ได้สร้างกันได้ง่ายๆ ต้องใช้เวลาและมีความยากลำบากเป็นอย่างยิ่ง แต่ มร.อาคิมะ ซี่งเป็นวิศวกรผู้รับผิดชอบก็ไม่ยอมแพ้ พยายามหาทางต่างๆ จนพัฒนาได้มาทั้งสิ้น 8 ไอเดีย ซึ่งผลความพยายามนี้ ทำให้ ซูเปอร์คับ มีจุดเด่นด้านการใช้งานที่ง่าย สะดวก และผู้หญิงก็สามารถขับขี่ได้ง่าย”

　และพร้อมกับการพัฒนาเครื่องยนต์ คือการพัฒนาระบบส่งกำลังที่สามารถทำงานร่วมกับคลัชอัตโนมัติแบบเหวี่ยงศูนย์ โดยออกแบบให้ไม่มีคันควบคุมคลัชที่มือจับด้านซ้ายของพวงมาลัย แต่ให้ใช้มือขวากับเท้าซ้ายร่วมกันควบคุมการเปลี่ยนเกียร์ นับเป็นไอเดียที่แหวกแนวอย่างยิ่ง ทำให้ความฝันในการสร้างรถจักรยานยนต์ที่ “เด็กส่งบะหมี สามารถขี่ด้วยมือเดียวได้” เป็นความจริง ตามที่ ม.ร.ฮอนด้า ได้เคยกล่าวไว้และเรามักได้ยินอยู่บ่อยครั้ง
　มร.อาคิมะ เล่าว่า “ตัวคลัชแบบเหวี่ยงศูนย์นั้นไม่ยาก แต่สิ่งที่ยากคือจะทำอย่างไรให้เข้าคลัชได้สอดคล้องกับการเปลี่ยนเกียร์ นอกจากนี้ อัตราส่วนของรอบหมุนของคันเหยียบสตาร์ทที่ทำให้ต้องเข้าคลัชอยู่ตลอดเวลาแม้ตอนหยุดรถ เป็นเงื่อนไขจำเป็นที่ต้องออกแบบให้เข้าคลัชค้างไว้แม้ตอนสตาร์ทเครื่อง” 
　เพื่อออกแบบให้มีโครงสร้างตามเงื่อนไขที่ดูเหมือนว่าขัดแย้งกันเองนี้ เป็นเรื่องยากที่จะหาไอเดียดีๆ ได้ มร.ฮอนด้า เองก็เป็นห่วง พยายามช่วยคิดด้วยตลอด ทุกเช้าท่านจะเดินเข้ามาในห้องออกแบบแล้วถามมาว่า “ไปถึงไหนแล้ว”
　มร.อาคิมะ กล่าวว่า “มีครั้งหนึ่ง ผมเสนอท่านว่า “ถ้าใช้เกลียวช่วย จะเปลี่ยนรอบหมุนของคันเหยียบสตาร์ทให้เกิดรอบหมุนทางเดียวกับแกนหมุนเครื่องยนต์ได้ แต่จะทำให้เกิดปัญหา co rotation รอบหมุนสวนทางกับแกนได้”  พอพูดจบเราก็แยกกันไปทำงาน แต่หลังจากนั้นมานั่งคิดดูใหม่ว่า “คลัชจะมีแรงหน่วงเกิดขึ้น อาจจะทำให้เกิดรอบหมุนทางเดียวกับแกนหมุนเครื่องยนต์ได้” พอคิดได้เช่นนั้น มร.ฮอนด้า ก็วิ่งเข้ามาแล้วบอกว่า “มันต้องเกิดแรงต้านทานที่คลัช อาจจะช่วยรอบหมุนได้” ผมก็บอก มร.ฮอนด้า ว่าผมกำลังคิดแบบเดียวกันพอดี ท่านก็หัวเราะว่า “บางครั้งเราก็คิดเหมือนกันพอดีนะ” หลังจากนั้น เราก็ใช้วิธีนี้ในการแก้ไขปัญหาได้สำเร็จ และผมก็โล่งใจที่พ้นจากความกดดันที่ท่านเข้ามาดูความคืบหน้าทุกๆเช้า”
　การที่ มร.ฮอนด้า เข้ามาที่ห้องออกแบบเป็นประจำนั้น มีที่มาจากจากการที่วิศวกรผู้รับผิดชอบได้หารือในข้อเทคนิคกันอยู่ ในบางครั้งต้องแสดงความคิดเห็นข้ามสายงาน ทำให้ มร.ฮอนด้า เป็นห่วงเข้ามาร่วมหารือด้วย เพื่อให้ได้โครงสร้างตามอุดมคติจึงจำเป็นต้องพูดคุยหารือกันอย่างเปิดอก ไม่ยึดติดกับหน้าที่ที่ตนรับผิดชอบและความอาวุโส พอคุยกันลงรายละเอียดลึกๆ แล้ว เมื่อ มร.ฮอนด้า คิดอะไรได้ก็จะใช้ชอล์กเขียนลงบนกระดานไปเรื่อยๆ จนเขียนรูปโครงสร้างเลยออกจากกระดาน บางทีก็เขียนลงบนพื้นก็มี ทุกคนก็จะมารวมตัวกันเป็นกลุ่มใหญ่ แล้วพอใครพูดอะไรขึ้นมา คนอื่นก็จะพูดเหตุผลอื่นๆ ตามมา ไม่ยึดติดกับสายงานที่ตนรับผิดชอบ ทุกคนจะแย่งกันแสดงความเห็นของตัวเอง ทำให้ท้ายที่สุดได้ไอเดียเป็นรูปเป็นร่างขึ้นมา เป็นจุดเริ่มของ “ไวกายา” (การพูดแสดงความคิดเห็นกันอย่างเสรี) เป็นการสร้างบรรยากาศหารือที่คึกคักได้ตามใจ บางครั้ง คุยกันหน้าดำคร่ำเครียด ทุกคนพูดด้วยอารมณ์ บางครั้ง มร.ฮอนด้า เองก็พูดสบถก็มี
　มร.คิมูระ เสริมว่า “คลัชแบบเหวี่ยงศูนย์เป็นเทคโนโลยีแบบใหม่ จึงไม่ได้สร้างกันได้ง่ายๆ ต้องใช้เวลาและมีความยากลำบากเป็นอย่างยิ่ง แต่ มร.อาคิมะ ซี่งเป็นวิศวกรผู้รับผิดชอบก็ไม่ยอมแพ้ พยายามหาทางต่างๆ จนพัฒนาได้มาทั้งสิ้น 8 ไอเดีย ซึ่งผลความพยายามนี้ ทำให้ ซูเปอร์คับ มีจุดเด่นด้านการใช้งานที่ง่าย สะดวก และผู้หญิงก็สามารถขับขี่ได้ง่าย”

Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (本田技研工業株式会社, Honda Giken Kōgyō KK, IPA: [honda] ( listen); /ˈhɒndə/) is a Japanese public multinational conglomerate corporation primarily known as a manufacturer of automobiles, aircraft, motorcycles, and power equipment.
Honda has been the world's largest motorcycle manufacturer since 1959,[2][3] as well as the world's largest manufacturer of internal combustion engines measured by volume, producing more than 14 million internal combustion engines each year.[4] Honda became the second-largest Japanese automobile manufacturer in 2001.[5][6] Honda was the eighth largest automobile manufacturer in the world behind Toyota, Volkswagen Group, Hyundai Motor Group, General Motors, Ford, Nissan, and FIAT in 2015.[7]
Honda was the first Japanese automobile manufacturer to release a dedicated luxury brand, Acura, in 1986. Aside from their core automobile and motorcycle businesses, Honda also manufactures garden equipment, marine engines, personal watercraft and power generators, and other products. Since 1986, Honda has been involved with artificial intelligence/robotics research and released their ASIMO robot in 2000. They have also ventured into aerospace with the establishment of GE Honda Aero Engines in 2004 and the Honda HA-420 HondaJet, which began production in 2012. Honda has three joint-ventures in China (Honda China, Dongfeng Honda, and Guangqi Honda).
In 2013, Honda invested about 5.7% (US$6.8 billion) of its revenues in research and development.[8] Also in 2013, Honda became the first Japanese automaker to be a net exporter from the United States, exporting 108,705 Honda and Acura models, while importing only 88,357.[9]

History
Throughout his life, Honda's founder, Soichiro Honda, had an interest in automobiles. He worked as a mechanic at the Art Shokai garage, where he tuned cars and entered them in races. In 1937, with financing from his acquaintance Kato Shichirō, Honda founded Tōkai Seiki (Eastern Sea Precision Machine Company) to make piston rings working out of the Art Shokai garage.[10] After initial failures, Tōkai Seiki won a contract to supply piston rings to Toyota, but lost the contract due to the poor quality of their products.[10] After attending engineering school without graduating, and visiting factories around Japan to better understand Toyota's quality control processes, by 1941 Honda was able to mass-produce piston rings acceptable to Toyota, using an automated process that could employ even unskilled wartime laborers.[10][11]:16–19
Tōkai Seiki was placed under control of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry (called the Ministry of Munitions after 1943) at the start of World War II, and Soichiro Honda was demoted from president to senior managing director after Toyota took a 40% stake in the company.[10] Honda also aided the war effort by assisting other companies in automating the production of military aircraft propellers.[10] The relationships Honda cultivated with personnel at Toyota, Nakajima Aircraft Company and the Imperial Japanese Navy would be instrumental in the postwar period.[10] A US B-29 bomber attack destroyed Tōkai Seiki's Yamashita plant in 1944, and the Itawa plant collapsed in the 13 January 1945 Mikawa earthquake, and Soichiro Honda sold the salvageable remains of the company to Toyota after the war for ¥450,000, and used the proceeds to found the Honda Technical Research Institute in October 1946.[10][12]
With a staff of 12 men working in a 16 m2 (170 sq ft) shack, they built and sold improvised motorized bicycles, using a supply of 500 two-stroke 50 cc Tohatsu war surplus radio generator engines.[10][11]:19[13] When the engines ran out, Honda began building their own copy of the Tohatsu engine, and supplying these to customers to attach to their bicycles.[10][13] This was the Honda A-Type, nicknamed the Bata Bata for the sound the engine made.[10] In 1949, the Honda Technical Research Institute was liquidated for ¥1,000,000, or about US$5,000 today; these funds were used to incorporate Honda Motor Co., Ltd.[11]:21 At about the same time Honda hired engineer Kihachiro Kawashima, and Takeo Fujisawa who provided indispensable business and marketing expertise to complement Soichiro Honda's technical bent.[11]:21 The close partnership between Soichiro Honda and Fujisawa lasted until they stepped down together in October 1973.[11]:21
The first complete motorcycle, with both the frame and engine made by Honda, was the 1949 D-Type, the first Honda to go by the name Dream.[12][14] Honda Motor Company grew in a short time to become the world's largest manufacturer of motorcycles by 1964.[citation needed]
The first production automobile from Honda was the T360 mini pick-up truck, which went on sale in August 1963.[15] Powered by a small 356-cc straight-4 gasoline engine, it was classified under the cheaper Kei car tax bracket.[16] The first production car from Honda was the S500 sports car, which followed the T360 into production in October 1963. Its chain-driven rear wheels pointed to Honda's motorcycle origins.[17]
Over the next few decades, Honda worked to expand its product line and expanded operations and exports to numerous countries around the world. In 1986, Honda introduced the successful Acura brand to the American market in an attempt to gain ground in the luxury vehicle market. The year 1991 saw the introduction of the Honda NSX supercar, the first all-aluminum monocoque vehicle that incorporated a mid-engine V6 with variable-valve timing.[18]
CEO Tadashi Kume was succeeded by Nobuhiko Kawamoto in 1990. Kawamoto was selected over Shoichiro Irimajiri, who oversaw the successful establishment of Honda of America Manufacturing, Inc. in Marysville, Ohio. Both Kawamoto and Irimajiri shared a friendly rivalry within Honda, and Irimajiri would resign in 1992 due to health issues.
Following the death of Soichiro Honda and the departure of Irimajiri, Honda found itself quickly being outpaced in product development by other Japanese automakers and was caught off-guard by the truck and sport utility vehicle boom of the 1990s, all which took a toll on the profitability of the company. Japanese media reported in 1992 and 1993 that Honda was at serious risk of an unwanted and hostile takeover by Mitsubishi Motors, who at the time was a larger automaker by volume and flush with profits from their successful Pajero and Diamante.[19]
Kawamoto acted quickly to change Honda's corporate culture, rushing through market-driven product development that resulted in recreational vehicles such as the first generation Odyssey and the CR-V, and a refocusing away from some of the numerous sedans and coupes that were popular with Honda's engineers but not with the buying public. The most shocking change to Honda came when Kawamoto ended Honda's successful participation in Formula One after the 1992 season, citing costs in light of the takeover threat from Mitsubishi as well as the desire to create a more environmentally-friendly company image.[20]
Later, 1995 gave rise to the Honda Aircraft Company with the goal of producing jet aircraft under Honda's name.[21]
On 23 February 2015, Honda announced that CEO and President Takanobu Ito would step down and be replaced by Takahiro Hachigo by June; additional retirements by senior managers and directors were expected.[22]

Honda has also created joint ventures around the world, such as Honda Siel Cars and Hero Honda Motorcycles in India,[26] Guangzhou Honda and Dongfeng Honda in China, Boon Siew Honda in Malaysia and Honda Atlas in Pakistan.
Following the Japanese earthquake and tsunami in March 2011 Honda announced plans to halve production at its UK plants.[27] The decision was made to put staff at the Swindon plant on a 2-day week until the end of May as the manufacturer struggled to source supplies from Japan. It's thought around 22,500 cars were produced during this period.

Honda Accord






Tenth Generation Honda Civic






Honda CR-Z, the first sports coupe hybrid to come with a six-speed manual transmission


Honda's global lineup consists of the Fit, Civic, Accord, Insight, CR-V, CR-Z, Legend and two versions of the Odyssey, one for North America, and a smaller vehicle sold internationally. An early proponent of developing vehicles to cater to different needs and markets worldwide, Honda's lineup varies by country and may have vehicles exclusive to that region. A few examples are the latest Honda Odyssey minivan and the Ridgeline, Honda's first light-duty uni-body pickup truck. Both were designed and engineered primarily in North America and are produced there. Other example of exclusive models includes the Honda Civic five-door hatchback sold in Europe.
Honda's automotive manufacturing ambitions can be traced back to 1963, with the Honda T360, a kei car truck built for the Japanese market.[28] This was followed by the two-door roadster, the Honda S500 also introduced in 1963. In 1965, Honda built a two-door commercial delivery van, called the Honda L700. Honda's first four-door sedan was not the Accord, but the air-cooled, four-cylinder, gasoline-powered Honda 1300 in 1969. The Civic was a hatchback that gained wide popularity internationally, but it wasn't the first two-door hatchback built. That was the Honda N360, another Kei car that was adapted for international sale as the N600. The Civic, which appeared in 1972 and replaced the N600 also had a smaller sibling that replaced the air-cooled N360, called the Honda Life that was water-cooled.
The Honda Life represented Honda's efforts in competing in the kei car segment, offering sedan, delivery van and small pick-up platforms on a shared chassis. The Life StepVan had a novel approach that, while not initially a commercial success, appears to be an influence in vehicles with the front passengers sitting behind the engine, a large cargo area with a flat roof and a liftgate installed in back, and utilizing a transversely installed engine with a front-wheel-drive powertrain.
As Honda entered into automobile manufacturing in the late 1960s, where Japanese manufacturers such as Toyota and Nissan had been making cars since before WWII, it appears that Honda instilled a sense of doing things a little differently than its Japanese competitors. Its mainstay products, like the Accord and Civic (with the exception of its USA-market 1993–97 Passport which was part of a vehicle exchange program with Isuzu (part of the Subaru-Isuzu joint venture)), have always employed front-wheel-drive powertrain implementation, which is currently a long held Honda tradition. Honda also installed new technologies into their products, first as optional equipment, then later standard, like anti lock brakes, speed sensitive power steering, and multi-port fuel injection in the early 1980s. This desire to be the first to try new approaches is evident with the creation of the first Japanese luxury chain Acura, and was also evident with the all aluminum, mid-engined sports car, the Honda NSX, which also introduced variable valve timing technology, Honda calls VTEC.
The Civic is a line of compact cars developed and manufactured by Honda. In North America, the Civic is the second-longest continuously running nameplate from a Japanese manufacturer; only its perennial rival, the Toyota Corolla, introduced in 1968, has been in production longer.[29] The Civic, along with the Accord and Prelude, comprised Honda's vehicles sold in North America until the 1990s, when the model lineup was expanded. Having gone through several generational changes, the Civic has become larger and more upmarket, and it currently slots between the Fit and Accord.
Honda produces Civic hybrid, a hybrid electric vehicle that competes with the Toyota Prius, and also produces the Insight and CR-Z.
In 2008, Honda increased global production to meet demand for small cars and hybrids in the U.S. and emerging markets. The company shuffled U.S. production to keep factories busy and boost car output, while building fewer minivans and sport utility vehicles as light truck sales fell.[30]
Its first entrance into the pickup segment, the light duty Ridgeline, won Truck of the Year from Motor Trend magazine in 2006. Also in 2006, the redesigned Civic won Car of the Year from the magazine, giving Honda a rare double win of Motor Trend honors. Honda's 9th generation Civic also won the Car of the Year award based on a public survey held by PakWheels
It is reported that Honda plans to increase hybrid sales in Japan to more than 20% of its total sales in fiscal year 2011, from 14.8% in previous year.[31]
Five of United States Environmental Protection Agency's top ten most fuel-efficient cars from 1984 to 2010 comes from Honda, more than any other automakers. The five models are: 2000–2006 Honda Insight (53 mpg‑US or 4.4 L/100 km or 64 mpg‑imp combined), 1986–1987 Honda Civic Coupe HF (46 mpg‑US or 5.1 L/100 km or 55 mpg‑imp combined), 1994–1995 Honda Civic hatchback VX (43 mpg‑US or 5.5 L/100 km or 52 mpg‑imp combined), 2006– Honda Civic Hybrid (42 mpg‑US or 5.6 L/100 km or 50 mpg‑imp combined), and 2010– Honda Insight (41 mpg‑US or 5.7 L/100 km or 49 mpg‑imp combined).[32] The ACEEE has also rated the Civic GX as the greenest car in America for seven consecutive years.[33]
Motorcycles
For a list of motorcycle products, see List of Honda motorcycles.
Honda is the largest motorcycle manufacturer in Japan and has been since it started production in 1955.[10] At its peak in 1982, Honda manufactured almost three million motorcycles annually. By 2006 this figure had reduced to around 550,000 but was still higher than its three domestic competitors.[10]
During the 1960s, when it was a small manufacturer, Honda broke out of the Japanese motorcycle market and began exporting to the U.S. Working with the advertising agency Grey Advertising, Honda created an innovative marketing campaign, using the slogan "You meet the nicest people on a Honda." In contrast to the prevailing negative stereotypes of motorcyclists in America as tough, antisocial rebels, this campaign suggested that Honda motorcycles were made for the everyman. The campaign was hugely successful; the ads ran for three years, and by the end of 1963 alone, Honda had sold 90,000 motorcycles.[11]:{{{1}}}
Taking Honda's story as an archetype of the smaller manufacturer entering a new market already occupied by highly dominant competitors, the story of their market entry, and their subsequent huge success in the U.S. and around the world, has been the subject of some academic controversy. Competing explanations have been advanced to explain Honda's strategy and the reasons for their success.[34]
The first of these explanations was put forward when, in 1975, Boston Consulting Group (BCG) was commissioned by the UK government to write a report explaining why and how the British motorcycle industry had been out-competed by its Japanese competitors. The report concluded that the Japanese firms, including Honda, had sought a very high scale of production (they had made a large number of motorbikes) in order to benefit from economies of scale and learning curve effects. It blamed the decline of the British motorcycle industry on the failure of British managers to invest enough in their businesses to profit from economies of scale and scope.[35]




2004 Honda Super Cub


The second explanation was offered in 1984 by Richard Pascale, who had interviewed the Honda executives responsible for the firm's entry into the U.S. market. As opposed to the tightly focused strategy of low cost and high scale that BCG accredited to Honda, Pascale found that their entry into the U.S. market was a story of "miscalculation, serendipity, and organizational learning" – in other words, Honda's success was due to the adaptability and hard work of its staff, rather than any long term strategy.[36] For example, Honda's initial plan on entering the US was to compete in large motorcycles, around 300 cc. Honda's motorcycles in this class suffered performance and reliability problems when ridden the relatively long distances of the US highways.[11]:41–43 When the team found that the scooters they were using to get themselves around their U.S. base of San Francisco attracted positive interest from consumers that they fell back on selling the Super Cub instead.[11]:41–43
The most recent school of thought on Honda's strategy was put forward by Gary Hamel and C. K. Prahalad in 1989. Creating the concept of core competencies with Honda as an example, they argued that Honda's success was due to its focus on leadership in the technology of internal combustion engines.[37] For example, the high power-to-weight ratio engines Honda produced for its racing bikes provided technology and expertise which was transferable into mopeds. Honda's entry into the U.S. motorcycle market during the 1960s is used as a case study for teaching introductory strategy at business schools worldwide.[38]

Honda engines powered the entire 33-car starting field of the 2010 Indianapolis 500[43] and for the fifth consecutive race, there were no engine-related retirements during the running of the Memorial Day Classic.[44]
In the 1980s Honda developed the GY6 engine for use in motor scooters. Although no longer manufactured by Honda it is still commonly used in many Chinese, Korean and Taiwanese light vehicles.[45]
Honda, despite being known as an engine company, has never built a V8 for passenger vehicles. In the late 1990s, the company resisted considerable pressure from its American dealers for a V8 engine (which would have seen use in top-of-the-line Honda SUVs and Acuras), with American Honda reportedly sending one dealer a shipment of V8 beverages to silence them.[46] Honda considered starting V8 production in the mid-2000s for larger Acura sedans, a new version of the high end NSX sports car (which previously used DOHC V6 engines with VTEC to achieve its high power output) and possible future ventures into the American full-size truck and SUV segment for both the Acura and Honda brands, but this was cancelled in late 2008, with Honda citing environmental and worldwide economic conditions as reasons for the termination of this project.[47]
Robots




ASIMO at Expo 2005


ASIMO is the part of Honda's Research & Development robotics program. It is the eleventh in a line of successive builds starting in 1986 with Honda E0 moving through the ensuing Honda E series and the Honda P series. Weighing 54 kilograms and standing 130 centimeters tall, ASIMO resembles a small astronaut wearing a backpack, and can walk on two feet in a manner resembling human locomotion, at up to 6 km/h (3.7 mph). ASIMO is the world's only humanoid robot able to ascend and descend stairs independently.[48] However, human motions such as climbing stairs are difficult to mimic with a machine, which ASIMO has demonstrated by taking two plunges off a staircase.
Honda's robot ASIMO (see below) as an R&D project brings together expertise to create a robot that walks, dances and navigates steps. 2010 marks the year Honda has developed a machine capable of reading a user's brainwaves to move ASIMO. The system uses a helmet covered with electroencephalography and near-infrared spectroscopy sensors that monitor electrical brainwaves and cerebral blood flow—signals that alter slightly during the human thought process. The user thinks of one of a limited number of gestures it wants from the robot, which has been fitted with a Brain Machine Interface.[49]

Rubens Barrichello driving for Honda


Honda entered Formula One as a constructor for the first time in the 1964 season at the German Grand Prix with Ronnie Bucknum at the wheel. 1965 saw the addition of Richie Ginther to the team, who scored Honda's first point at the Belgian Grand Prix, and Honda's first win at the Mexican Grand Prix. 1967 saw their next win at the Italian Grand Prix with John Surtees as their driver. In 1968, Jo Schlesser was killed in a Honda RA302 at the French Grand Prix. This racing tragedy, coupled with their commercial difficulties selling automobiles in the United States, prompted Honda to withdraw from all international motorsport that year.
After a learning year in 1965, Honda-powered Brabhams dominated the 1966 French Formula Two championship in the hands of Jack Brabham and Denny Hulme. As there was no European Championship that season, this was the top F2 championship that year. In the early 1980s Honda returned to F2, supplying engines to Ron Tauranac's Ralt team. Tauranac had designed the Brabham cars for their earlier involvement. They were again extremely successful. In a related exercise, John Judd's Engine Developments company produced a turbo "Brabham-Honda" engine for use in IndyCar racing. It won only one race, in 1988 for Bobby Rahal at Pocono.
Honda returned to Formula One in 1983, initially with another Formula Two partner, the Spirit team, before switching abruptly to Williams in 1984. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Honda powered cars won six consecutive Formula One Constructors Championships. WilliamsF1 won the crown in 1986 and 1987. Honda switched allegiance again in 1988. New partners Team McLaren won the title in 1988, 1989, 1990 and 1991. Honda withdrew from Formula One at the end of 1992, although the related Mugen-Honda company maintained a presence up to the end of 1999, winning four races with Ligier and Jordan Grand Prix.
Honda debuted in the CART IndyCar World Series as a works supplier in 1994. The engines were far from competitive at first, but after development, the company powered six consecutive drivers championships. In 2003, Honda transferred its effort to the rival IRL IndyCar Series with Ilmor as joint development until 2006. In 2004, Honda-powered cars overwhelmingly dominated the IndyCar Series, winning 14 of 16 IndyCar races, including the Indianapolis 500, and claimed the IndyCar Series Manufacturers' Championship, Drivers' Championship and Rookie of the Year titles. From 2006 to 2011, Honda was the lone engine supplier for the IndyCar Series, including the Indianapolis 500. In the 2006 Indianapolis 500, for the first time in Indianapolis 500 history, the race was run without a single engine problem.[52] Since 2012, HPD has constructed turbocharged V-6 engines for its IndyCar effort.
During 1998, Honda considered returning to Formula One with their own team. The project was aborted after the death of its technical director, Harvey Postlethwaite. Honda instead came back as an official engine supplier to British American Racing (BAR) and Jordan Grand Prix. Honda bought a stake in the BAR team in 2004 before buying the team outright at the end of 2005, becoming a constructor for the first time since the 1960s. Honda won the 2006 Hungarian Grand Prix with driver Jenson Button.
It was announced on 5 December 2008, that Honda would be exiting Formula One with immediate effect due to the 2008 global economic crisis.[53] The team was sold to former team principal Ross Brawn, renamed Brawn GP and subsequently Mercedes.[54]
Honda became an official works team in the British Touring Car Championship in 2010.
Honda made an official announcement on 16 May 2013 that it will re-enter Formula One racing in 2015 as an engine supplier to the McLaren team.[55]

Main article: Honda Racing Corporation




Honda RC212V raced by Dani Pedrosa


Honda Racing Corporation (HRC) was formed in 1982. The company combines participation in motorcycle races throughout the world with the development of high potential racing machines. Its racing activities are an important source for the creation of leading edge technologies used in the development of Honda motorcycles. HRC also contributes to the advancement of motorcycle sports through a range of activities that include sales of production racing motorcycles, support for satellite teams, and rider education programs.
Soichiro Honda, being a race driver himself, could not stay out of international motorsport. In 1959, Honda entered five motorcycles into the Isle of Man TT race, the most prestigious motorcycle race in the world. While always having powerful engines, it took until 1961 for Honda to tune their chassis well enough to allow Mike Hailwood to claim their first Grand Prix victories in the 125 and 250 cc classes. Hailwood would later pick up their first Senior TT wins in 1966 and 1967. Honda's race bikes were known for their "sleek & stylish design" and exotic engine configurations, such as the 5-cylinder, 22,000 rpm, 125 cc bike and their 6-cylinder 250 cc and 297 cc bikes.
In 1979, Honda returned to Grand Prix motorcycle racing with the monocoque-framed, four-stroke NR500. The FIM rules limited engines to four cylinders, so the NR500 had non-circular, 'race-track', cylinders, each with 8 valves and two connecting rods, in order to provide sufficient valve area to compete with the dominant two-stroke racers. Unfortunately, it seemed Honda tried to accomplish too much at one time and the experiment failed. For the 1982 season, Honda debuted their first two-stroke race bike, the NS500 and in 1983, Honda won their first 500 cc Grand Prix World Championship with Freddie Spencer. Since then, Honda has become a dominant marque in motorcycle Grand Prix racing, winning a plethora of top level titles with riders such as Mick Doohan and Valentino Rossi. Honda also head the number of wins at the Isle of Man TT having notched up 227 victories in the solo classes and Sidecar TT,[56] including Ian Hutchinson's clean sweep at the 2010 races.[57] The outright lap record on the Snaefell Mountain Course is also held by Honda, set at the 2015 TT by John McGuinness at an average speed of 132.701 mph (213.562 km/h) on a Honda CBR1000RR.[58]
In the Motocross World Championship, Honda has claimed six world championships. In the World Enduro Championship, Honda has captured eight titles, most recently with Stefan Merriman in 2003 and with Mika Ahola from 2007 to 2010. In motorcycle trials, Honda has claimed three world championships with Belgian rider Eddy Lejeune.
Electric and alternative fuel vehicles




2009 Honda Civic GX hooked up to Phill refueling system


Compressed natural gas
The Honda Civic GX was for a long time the only purpose-built natural gas vehicle (NGV) commercially available in some parts of the U.S.[59][60] The Honda Civic GX first appeared in 1998 as a factory-modified Civic LX that had been designed to run exclusively on compressed natural gas. The car looks and drives just like a contemporary Honda Civic LX, but does not run on gasoline. In 2001, the Civic GX was rated the cleanest-burning internal combustion engine in the world by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).[61][62]
First leased to the City of Los Angeles, in 2005, Honda started offering the GX directly to the public through factory trained dealers certified to service the GX. Before that, only fleets were eligible to purchase a new Civic GX. In 2006, the Civic GX was released in New York, making it the second state where the consumer is able to buy the car.[63]
In June 2015, Honda announced its decision to phase out the commercialization of natural-gas powered vehicles to focus on the development of a new generation of electrified vehicles such as hybrids, plug-in electric cars and hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles. Since 2008, Honda has sold about 16,000 natural-gas vehicles, mainly to taxi and commercial fleets.[64]




Top: Brazilian flexible-fuel Honda Civic. Below: U.S. Honda Civic Hybrid


Flexible-fuel
Honda's Brazilian subsidiary launched flexible-fuel versions for the Honda Civic and Honda Fit in late 2006. As other Brazilian flex-fuel vehicles, these models run on any blend of hydrous ethanol (E100) and E20-E25 gasoline.[65][66] Initially, and in order to test the market preferences, the carmaker decided to produce a limited share of the vehicles with flex-fuel engines, 33 percent of the Civic production and 28 percent of the Fit models.[65][66] Also, the sale price for the flex-fuel version was higher than the respective gasoline versions, around US$1,000 premium for the Civic, and US$650 for the Fit, despite the fact that all other flex-fuel vehicles sold in Brazil had the same tag price as their gasoline versions.[66][67][68] In July 2009, Honda launched in the Brazilian market its third flexible-fuel car, the Honda City.[69]
During the last two months of 2006, both flex-fuel models sold 2,427 cars against 8,546 gasoline-powered automobiles,[70] jumping to 41,990 flex-fuel cars in 2007,[71] and reaching 93,361 in 2008.[72] Due to the success of the flex versions, by early 2009 a hundred percent of Honda's automobile production for the Brazilian market is now flexible-fuel, and only a small percentage of gasoline version is produced in Brazil for exports.[73]
In March 2009, Honda launched in the Brazilian market the first flex-fuel motorcycle in the world. Produced by its Brazilian subsidiary Moto Honda da Amazônia, the CG 150 Titan Mix is sold for around US$2,700.[74][75][76]
Hybrid electric
In late 1999, Honda launched the first commercial hybrid electric car sold in the U.S. market, the Honda Insight, just one month before the introduction of the Toyota Prius, and initially sold for US$20,000.[77][78] The first-generation Insight was produced from 2000 to 2006 and had a fuel economy of 70 miles per US gallon (3.4 L/100 km; 84 mpg‑imp) for the EPA's highway rating, the most fuel-efficient mass-produced car at the time.[77][78] Total global sales for the Insight amounted to only around 18,000 vehicles.[78] Cumulative global sales reached 100,000 hybrids in 2005 and 200,000 in 2007.[79]
Honda introduced the second-generation Insight in Japan in February 2009, and released it in other markets through 2009 and in the U.S. market in April 2009. At $19,800 as a five-door hatchback it will be the least expensive hybrid available in the U.S.[80]




2010 Honda Insight hybrid electric vehicle (Second generation)


Since 2002, Honda has also been selling the Honda Civic Hybrid (2003 model) in the U.S. market.[77] It was followed by the Honda Accord Hybrid, offered in model years 2005 through 2007. Sales of the Honda CR-Z began in Japan in February 2010, becoming Honda's third hybrid electric car in the market.[81] As of February 2011[update], Honda was producing around 200,000 hybrids a year in Japan.[82]
Sales of the Fit Hybrid began in Japan in October 2010, at the time, the lowest price for a gasoline-hybrid electric vehicle sold in the country.[83] The European version, called Honda Jazz Hybrid, was released in early 2011.[84] During 2011 Honda launched three hybrid models available only in Japan, the Fit Shuttle Hybrid, Freed Hybrid and Freed Spike Hybrid.[79]
Honda's cumulative global hybrid sales passed the 1 million unit milestone at the end of September 2012, 12 years and 11 months after sales of the first generation Insight began in Japan November 1999.[79] A total of 187,851 hybrids were sold worldwide in 2013, and 158,696 hybrids during the first six months of 2014.[85][86] As of June 2014[update], Honda has sold more than 1.35 million hybrids worldwide.[79][85][86]
Hydrogen fuel cell




Honda FCX Clarity hydrogen fuel cell vehicle


In Takanezawa, Japan, on 16 June 2008, Honda Motors produced the first assembly-line FCX Clarity, a hybrid hydrogen fuel cell vehicle. More efficient than a gas-electric hybrid vehicle, the FCX Clarity combines hydrogen and oxygen from ordinary air to generate electricity for an electric motor. In July 2014 Honda announced the end of production of the Honda FCX Clarity for the 2015 model.[87]
The vehicle itself does not emit any pollutants and its only by products are heat and water. The FCX Clarity also has an advantage over gas-electric hybrids in that it does not use an internal combustion engine to propel itself. Like a gas-electric hybrid, it uses a lithium ion battery to assist the fuel cell during acceleration and capture energy through regenerative braking, thus improving fuel efficiency. The lack of hydrogen filling stations throughout developed countries will keep production volumes low.[88] Honda will release the vehicle in groups of 150. California is the only U.S. market with infrastructure for fueling such a vehicle, though the number of stations is still limited. Building more stations is expensive, as the California Air Resources Board (CARB) granted $6.8 million for four H2 fueling stations, costing $1.7 million USD each.[89][90]
Honda views hydrogen fuel cell vehicles as the long term replacement of piston cars, not battery cars.[91]
Plug-in electric vehicles




Honda Fit EV concept unveiled at the 2010 Los Angeles Auto Show.


The all-electric Honda EV Plus was introduced in 1997 as a result of CARB's zero-emissions vehicle mandate and was available only for leasing in California. The EV plus was the first battery electric vehicle from a major automaker with non-lead–acid batteries The EV Plus had an all-electric range of 100 mi (160 km). Around 276 units were sold in the U.S. and production ended in 1999.[92][93]
The all-electric Honda Fit EV was introduced in 2012 and has a range of 82 mi (132 km).[94] The all-electric car was launched in the U.S. to retail customers in July 2012 with initial availability limited to California and Oregon.[95] Production is limited to only 1,100 units over the first three years. A total of 1,007 units have been leased in the U.S. through September 2014.[96][97][98] The Fit EV was released in Japan through leasing to local government and corporate customers in August 2012. Availability in the Japanese market is limited to 200 units during its first two years.[99] In July 2014 Honda announced the end of production of the Fit EV for the 2015 model.[87]
The Honda Accord Plug-in Hybrid was introduced in 2013 and has an all-electric range of 13 mi (21 km)[100] Sales began in the U.S. in January 2013 and the plug-in hybrid is available only in California and New York.[101] A total of 835 units have been sold in the U.S. through September 2014.[96][97][98] The Accord PHEV was introduced in Japan in June 2013 and is available only for leasing, primarily to corporations and government agencies.[102]
Marketing
Japan




Honda Clio (Saitama, Japan)


Starting in 1978, Honda in Japan decided to diversify its sales distribution channels, and created Honda Verno, which sold established products with a higher content of standard equipment and a more sporting nature.[103][104] The establishment of Honda Verno coincided with its new sports compact, called the Honda Prelude. Later, the Honda Vigor, the Honda Ballade, and the Honda Quint were added to Honda Verno stores. This approach was implemented due to efforts in place by rival Japanese automakers Toyota and Nissan.




Honda Primo (Osaka)


As sales progressed, Honda created two more sales channels, called Honda Clio in 1984, and Honda Primo in 1985. The Honda Clio chain sold products that were traditionally associated with Honda dealerships before 1978, like the Honda Accord, and Honda Primo sold the Honda Civic, kei cars, such as the Honda Today, superminis like the Honda Capa, along with other Honda products, such as farm equipment, lawn mowers, portable generators, marine equipment, plus motorcycles and scooters like the Honda Super Cub. A styling tradition was established when Honda Primo and Clio began operations, in that all Verno products had the rear license plate installed in the rear bumper, while Primo and Clio products had the rear license plate installed on the trunk lid or rear door for minivans.




Honda Verno (2008)


As time progressed and sales began to diminish partly due to the collapse of the Japanese "bubble economy", "supermini" and "kei" vehicles that were specific to Honda Primo were "badge engineered" and sold at the other two sales channels, thereby providing smaller vehicles that sold better at both Honda Verno and Honda Clio locations. As of March 2006, the three sales chains were discontinued, with the establishment of Honda Cars dealerships.[105] While the network was disbanded, some Japanese Honda dealerships still use the network names, offering all Japanese market Honda cars at all locations.




Honda Wing motorcycle dealership (Japan)


Honda sells genuine accessories through a separate retail chain called Honda Access for both their motorcycle, scooter and automobile products. In cooperation with corporate "keiretsu" partner Pioneer, Honda sells an aftermarket line of audio and in-car navigation equipment that can be installed in any vehicle under the brand name Gathers, which is available at Honda Access locations as well as Japanese auto parts retailers, such as Autobacs. Buyers of used vehicles are directed to a specific Honda retail chain that sells only used vehicles called Honda Auto Terrace.
In the spring of 2012, Honda in Japan introduced Honda Cars Small Store (Japanese) which is devoted to compact cars like the Honda Fit, and kei vehicles like the Honda N-One and Honda S660 roadster.

A Honda dealership in Ontario, Canada


In 2003, Honda released its Cog advertisement in the UK and on the Internet. To make the ad, the engineers at Honda constructed a Rube Goldberg Machine made entirely out of car parts from a Honda Accord Touring. To the chagrin of the engineers at Honda, all the parts were taken from two of only six hand-assembled pre-production models of the Accord. The advertisement depicted a single cog which sets off a chain of events that ends with the Honda Accord moving and Garrison Keillor speaking the tagline, "Isn't it nice when things just... work?" It took 606 takes to get it perfect.[106]
In 2004, they produced the Grrr advert, usually immediately followed by a shortened version of the 2005 Impossible Dream advert.
In December 2005, Honda released The Impossible Dream a two-minute panoramic advertisement filmed in New Zealand, Japan and Argentina which illustrates the founder's dream to build performance vehicles. While singing the song "Impossible Dream", a man reaches for his racing helmet, leaves his trailer on a minibike, then rides a succession of vintage Honda vehicles: a motorcycle, then a car, then a powerboat, then goes over a waterfall only to reappear piloting a hot air balloon, with Garrison Keillor saying "I couldn't have put it better myself" as the song ends. The song is from the 1960s musical Man Of La Mancha, sung by Andy Williams.
In 2006, Honda released its Choir advertisement, for the UK and the internet. This had a 60-person choir who sang the car noises as film of the Honda Civic are shown.
In the mid to late 2000s in the United States, during model close-out sales for the current year before the start of the new model year, Honda's advertising has had an animated character known simply as Mr. Opportunity, voiced by Rob Paulsen. The casual looking man talked about various deals offered by Honda and ended with the phrase "I'm Mr. Opportunity, and I'm knockin'", followed by him "knocking" on the television screen or "thumping" the speaker at the end of radio ads. In addition, commercials for Honda's international hatchback, the Jazz, are parodies of well-known pop culture images such as Tetris and Thomas The Tank Engine.
In late 2006, Honda released an ad with ASIMO exploring a museum, looking at the exhibits with almost childlike wonderment (spreading out its arms in the aerospace exhibit, waving hello to an astronaut suit that resembles him, etc.), while Garrison Keillor ruminates on progress. It concludes with the tagline: "More forwards please".
Honda also sponsored ITV's coverage of Formula One in the UK for 2007. However they had announced that they would not continue in 2008 due to the sponsorship price requested by ITV being too high.
In May 2007, focuses on their strengths in racing and the use of the Red H badge – a symbol of what is termed as "Hondamentalism". The campaign highlights the lengths that Honda engineers go to in order to get the most out of an engine, whether it is for bikes, cars, powerboats – even lawnmowers. Honda released its Hondamentalism campaign. In the TV spot, Garrison Keillor says, "An engineer once said to build something great is like swimming in honey", while Honda engineers in white suits walk and run towards a great light, battling strong winds and flying debris, holding on to anything that will keep them from being blown away. Finally one of the engineers walks towards a red light, his hand outstretched. A web address is shown for the Hondamentalism website. The digital campaign aims to show how visitors to the site share many of the Hondamentalist characteristics.
At the beginning of 2008, Honda released – the Problem Playground. The advert outlines Honda's environmental responsibility, demonstrating a hybrid engine, more efficient solar panels and the FCX Clarity, a hydrogen powered car. The 90 second advert has large scale puzzles, involving Rubik's Cubes, large shapes and a 3-dimensional puzzle.
On 29 May 2008, Honda, in partnership with Channel 4, broadcast a live advertisement. It showed skydivers jumping from an aeroplane over Spain and forming the letters H, O, N, D and A in mid-air. This live advertisement is generally agreed to be the first of its kind on British television. The advert lasted three minutes.[107]
In 2009, American Honda released the Dream the Impossible documentary series, a collection of 5–8 minute web vignettes that focus on the core philosophies of Honda. Current short films include Failure: The Secret to Success, Kick Out the Ladder and Mobility 2088. They have Honda employees as well as Danica Patrick, Christopher Guest, Ben Bova, Chee Pearlman, Joe Johnston and Orson Scott Card. The film series plays at dreams.honda.com.
Sports
In Australia, Honda advertised heavily during most motor racing telecasts, and was the official sponsor of the 2006 FIA Formula 1 telecast on broadcaster channel "Ten". In fact, it was the only manufacturer involved in the 2006 Indy Racing League season. In a series of adverts promoting the history of Honda's racing heritage, Honda claimed it "built" cars that won 72 Formula 1 Grand Prix. Skeptics[who?] have accused Honda of interpreting its racing history rather liberally, saying that virtually all of the 72 victories were achieved by Honda powered (engined) machines, whereas the cars themselves were designed and built by Lotus F1, Williams F1, and McLaren F1 teams, respectively. However, former and current staff of the McLaren F1 team have reiterated that Honda contributed more than just engines and provided various chassis, tooling, and aerodynamic parts as well as funding.[citation needed]
The late F1 driver Ayrton Senna stated that Honda probably played the most significant role in his three world championships. He had immense respect for founder, Soichiro Honda, and had a good relationship with Nobuhiko Kawamoto, the chairman of Honda at that time.

Results of 2016
18th MotoGP World Championship









Vol.2
At the halfway mark of the 2017 championship, Team Estrella Galicia 0,0 Marc VDS rider Jack Miller was 12th in the championship standings. Apart from two races he had finished empty-handed, at the Spanish Grand Prix and in Catalunya, the 22-year-old Australian scored championship points in seven races. 12th position at the halfway mark for him, is his best result of his three seasons in MotoGP racing.
From Rounds 3, the Grand Prix of the Americas, through 5, the French Grand Prix, Miller consistently placed himself in Q2. In France, he started the race weekend clocking the fastest lap time. The following day, in FP4, Miller had a scary high-speed crash at Turn 2, but fortunately escaped without injury. In qualifying, he set the 11th quickest lap time to start the race from Row 4. He finished the race in a brilliant eighth place, despite being battered and bruised. 
“I was a little fortunate today with some other riders having problems, but in racing you have to be in it at the finish to get the best result and that’s what we did. Considering my physical condition, I think I rode a good race despite struggling to pick up on exiting the corner. I’m happy to be back in the top ten both in the race and the points, but it’s only early in the season so there's still a lot of work to do. I had a good weekend going until my crash in FP4, so now I’ll go home and rest my body and get ready to come back stronger in Mugello.”
In the next race, the Italian Grand Prix at the Mugello circuit, Miller finished 15th and gained one championship point. Then one week later at the Barcelona-Catalunya circuit for the seventh round of the season, a rumor circulated in the paddock that Miller would ride in the Suzuka 8hours race in late July. When asked about it, Miller did not confirm anything but said, “Yeah, I mean I would like to, but we cannot say anything just yet." He was non-commital, avoiding dismissal of the speculation.
“I think the announcement will be soon. It's been something that I really wanted to do ever since I came back to Honda in 2015. Happy enough...maybe be going there this year would be good."
















Just before the race weekend for the Dutch TT, the announcement was made: Jack Miller would take part in the 40th Suzuka 8hours race, joining the MuSASHi RT HARC-PRO. Honda team, alongside Takumi Takahashi and Takaaki Nakagami.
After Friday’s free practice sessions, Miller finally revealed his feelings with a broad smile. 
"I’m really excited to get the opportunity to race over there. It’s something I’ve wanted to do for a while and to go over there with one of the best teams, it’s a big opportunity for me and I look forward to the challenge. It’s going to be a long, hot summer for me but it’s going to be good!"
Last year at TT Circuit Assen, Miller had won his first premier class race in dramatic style. For this year’s race, despite a lower starting grid position of 13th, he finished the race 6th, which was the best result for him so far this season.
“The first lap was not good, from my grid position I got stuck on the outside through all the right-hand turns and lost time, but once the group flattened out I got up to tenth in a group with Dani and Cal. I was a having a nice fight with Dani and then the rain came. I kept my pace to keep up the temperature in the slick tires, and pushed through to sixth. With more risks I might have been able to challenge for the podium but I wanted the points, this was a good result for me.”
At the German Grand Prix, Miller finished 15th. For the fist half of the 2017 season, Miller scored championship points in seven out of nine races, placing him 12th in the championship.
“Sitting at the moment, I'm twelfth in the standings, I would've liked to be inside the top 10, but you know, a couple of mistakes here and there cost us. But anyway, 41 points is decent to me, and showed well that we've improved this year. I am looking forward to making another, let's say 60 points in the second half of the season, which would be nice.”
Right after the race, Miller flew to Japan to join two days of Suzuka 8hours testing, on July 5 and 6. In the following week from July 11 to 13, he participated in official tests, demonstrating his ability to quickly adapt, living up to his potential as a world premier class rider.
“It was always a big question mark coming into this race because I never tested Superbikes, so I didn't know how I would perform on the bike. But now, we adapted to it very quickly. I feel from the beginning we've been quite fast. Not having many tests, but I'm not so far from my teammate. I think we have a very very strong team between us, which also helped to boost my confidence. We are all consistent, all of our long runs have been very good, so it seems that we will start a good race weekend. And of course, I've come here to win!”
Now that the long summer weekend at Suzuka has begun for Jack Miller, his best moments should be just around the corner.

History
Throughout his life, Honda's founder, Soichiro Honda, had an interest in automobiles. He worked as a mechanic at the Art Shokai garage, where he tuned cars and entered them in races. In 1937, with financing from his acquaintance Kato Shichirō, Honda founded Tōkai Seiki (Eastern Sea Precision Machine Company) to make piston rings working out of the Art Shokai garage.[10] After initial failures, Tōkai Seiki won a contract to supply piston rings to Toyota, but lost the contract due to the poor quality of their products.[10] After attending engineering school without graduating, and visiting factories around Japan to better understand Toyota's quality control processes, by 1941 Honda was able to mass-produce piston rings acceptable to Toyota, using an automated process that could employ even unskilled wartime laborers.[10][11]:16–19
Tōkai Seiki was placed under control of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry (called the Ministry of Munitions after 1943) at the start of World War II, and Soichiro Honda was demoted from president to senior managing director after Toyota took a 40% stake in the company.[10] Honda also aided the war effort by assisting other companies in automating the production of military aircraft propellers.[10] The relationships Honda cultivated with personnel at Toyota, Nakajima Aircraft Company and the Imperial Japanese Navy would be instrumental in the postwar period.[10] A US B-29 bomber attack destroyed Tōkai Seiki's Yamashita plant in 1944, and the Itawa plant collapsed in the 13 January 1945 Mikawa earthquake, and Soichiro Honda sold the salvageable remains of the company to Toyota after the war for ¥450,000, and used the proceeds to found the Honda Technical Research Institute in October 1946.[10][12]
With a staff of 12 men working in a 16 m2 (170 sq ft) shack, they built and sold improvised motorized bicycles, using a supply of 500 two-stroke 50 cc Tohatsu war surplus radio generator engines.[10][11]:19[13] When the engines ran out, Honda began building their own copy of the Tohatsu engine, and supplying these to customers to attach to their bicycles.[10][13] This was the Honda A-Type, nicknamed the Bata Bata for the sound the engine made.[10] In 1949, the Honda Technical Research Institute was liquidated for ¥1,000,000, or about US$5,000 today; these funds were used to incorporate Honda Motor Co., Ltd.[11]:21 At about the same time Honda hired engineer Kihachiro Kawashima, and Takeo Fujisawa who provided indispensable business and marketing expertise to complement Soichiro Honda's technical bent.[11]:21 The close partnership between Soichiro Honda and Fujisawa lasted until they stepped down together in October 1973.[11]:21
The first complete motorcycle, with both the frame and engine made by Honda, was the 1949 D-Type, the first Honda to go by the name Dream.[12][14] Honda Motor Company grew in a short time to become the world's largest manufacturer of motorcycles by 1964.[citation needed]
The first production automobile from Honda was the T360 mini pick-up truck, which went on sale in August 1963.[15] Powered by a small 356-cc straight-4 gasoline engine, it was classified under the cheaper Kei car tax bracket.[16] The first production car from Honda was the S500 sports car, which followed the T360 into production in October 1963. Its chain-driven rear wheels pointed to Honda's motorcycle origins.[17]
Over the next few decades, Honda worked to expand its product line and expanded operations and exports to numerous countries around the world. In 1986, Honda introduced the successful Acura brand to the American market in an attempt to gain ground in the luxury vehicle market. The year 1991 saw the introduction of the Honda NSX supercar, the first all-aluminum monocoque vehicle that incorporated a mid-engine V6 with variable-valve timing.[18]
CEO Tadashi Kume was succeeded by Nobuhiko Kawamoto in 1990. Kawamoto was selected over Shoichiro Irimajiri, who oversaw the successful establishment of Honda of America Manufacturing, Inc. in Marysville, Ohio. Both Kawamoto and Irimajiri shared a friendly rivalry within Honda, and Irimajiri would resign in 1992 due to health issues.
Following the death of Soichiro Honda and the departure of Irimajiri, Honda found itself quickly being outpaced in product development by other Japanese automakers and was caught off-guard by the truck and sport utility vehicle boom of the 1990s, all which took a toll on the profitability of the company. Japanese media reported in 1992 and 1993 that Honda was at serious risk of an unwanted and hostile takeover by Mitsubishi Motors, who at the time was a larger automaker by volume and flush with profits from their successful Pajero and Diamante.[19]
Kawamoto acted quickly to change Honda's corporate culture, rushing through market-driven product development that resulted in recreational vehicles such as the first generation Odyssey and the CR-V, and a refocusing away from some of the numerous sedans and coupes that were popular with Honda's engineers but not with the buying public. The most shocking change to Honda came when Kawamoto ended Honda's successful participation in Formula One after the 1992 season, citing costs in light of the takeover threat from Mitsubishi as well as the desire to create a more environmentally-friendly company image.[20]
Later, 1995 gave rise to the Honda Aircraft Company with the goal of producing jet aircraft under Honda's name.[21]
On 23 February 2015, Honda announced that CEO and President Takanobu Ito would step down and be replaced by Takahiro Hachigo by June; additional retirements by senior managers and directors were expected.[22]

Honda Accord






Tenth Generation Honda Civic






Honda CR-Z, the first sports coupe hybrid to come with a six-speed manual transmission


Honda's global lineup consists of the Fit, Civic, Accord, Insight, CR-V, CR-Z, Legend and two versions of the Odyssey, one for North America, and a smaller vehicle sold internationally. An early proponent of developing vehicles to cater to different needs and markets worldwide, Honda's lineup varies by country and may have vehicles exclusive to that region. A few examples are the latest Honda Odyssey minivan and the Ridgeline, Honda's first light-duty uni-body pickup truck. Both were designed and engineered primarily in North America and are produced there. Other example of exclusive models includes the Honda Civic five-door hatchback sold in Europe.
Honda's automotive manufacturing ambitions can be traced back to 1963, with the Honda T360, a kei car truck built for the Japanese market.[28] This was followed by the two-door roadster, the Honda S500 also introduced in 1963. In 1965, Honda built a two-door commercial delivery van, called the Honda L700. Honda's first four-door sedan was not the Accord, but the air-cooled, four-cylinder, gasoline-powered Honda 1300 in 1969. The Civic was a hatchback that gained wide popularity internationally, but it wasn't the first two-door hatchback built. That was the Honda N360, another Kei car that was adapted for international sale as the N600. The Civic, which appeared in 1972 and replaced the N600 also had a smaller sibling that replaced the air-cooled N360, called the Honda Life that was water-cooled.
The Honda Life represented Honda's efforts in competing in the kei car segment, offering sedan, delivery van and small pick-up platforms on a shared chassis. The Life StepVan had a novel approach that, while not initially a commercial success, appears to be an influence in vehicles with the front passengers sitting behind the engine, a large cargo area with a flat roof and a liftgate installed in back, and utilizing a transversely installed engine with a front-wheel-drive powertrain.
As Honda entered into automobile manufacturing in the late 1960s, where Japanese manufacturers such as Toyota and Nissan had been making cars since before WWII, it appears that Honda instilled a sense of doing things a little differently than its Japanese competitors. Its mainstay products, like the Accord and Civic (with the exception of its USA-market 1993–97 Passport which was part of a vehicle exchange program with Isuzu (part of the Subaru-Isuzu joint venture)), have always employed front-wheel-drive powertrain implementation, which is currently a long held Honda tradition. Honda also installed new technologies into their products, first as optional equipment, then later standard, like anti lock brakes, speed sensitive power steering, and multi-port fuel injection in the early 1980s. This desire to be the first to try new approaches is evident with the creation of the first Japanese luxury chain Acura, and was also evident with the all aluminum, mid-engined sports car, the Honda NSX, which also introduced variable valve timing technology, Honda calls VTEC.
The Civic is a line of compact cars developed and manufactured by Honda. In North America, the Civic is the second-longest continuously running nameplate from a Japanese manufacturer; only its perennial rival, the Toyota Corolla, introduced in 1968, has been in production longer.[29] The Civic, along with the Accord and Prelude, comprised Honda's vehicles sold in North America until the 1990s, when the model lineup was expanded. Having gone through several generational changes, the Civic has become larger and more upmarket, and it currently slots between the Fit and Accord.
Honda produces Civic hybrid, a hybrid electric vehicle that competes with the Toyota Prius, and also produces the Insight and CR-Z.
In 2008, Honda increased global production to meet demand for small cars and hybrids in the U.S. and emerging markets. The company shuffled U.S. production to keep factories busy and boost car output, while building fewer minivans and sport utility vehicles as light truck sales fell.[30]
Its first entrance into the pickup segment, the light duty Ridgeline, won Truck of the Year from Motor Trend magazine in 2006. Also in 2006, the redesigned Civic won Car of the Year from the magazine, giving Honda a rare double win of Motor Trend honors. Honda's 9th generation Civic also won the Car of the Year award based on a public survey held by PakWheels
It is reported that Honda plans to increase hybrid sales in Japan to more than 20% of its total sales in fiscal year 2011, from 14.8% in previous year.[31]
Five of United States Environmental Protection Agency's top ten most fuel-efficient cars from 1984 to 2010 comes from Honda, more than any other automakers. The five models are: 2000–2006 Honda Insight (53 mpg‑US or 4.4 L/100 km or 64 mpg‑imp combined), 1986–1987 Honda Civic Coupe HF (46 mpg‑US or 5.1 L/100 km or 55 mpg‑imp combined), 1994–1995 Honda Civic hatchback VX (43 mpg‑US or 5.5 L/100 km or 52 mpg‑imp combined), 2006– Honda Civic Hybrid (42 mpg‑US or 5.6 L/100 km or 50 mpg‑imp combined), and 2010– Honda Insight (41 mpg‑US or 5.7 L/100 km or 49 mpg‑imp combined).[32] The ACEEE has also rated the Civic GX as the greenest car in America for seven consecutive years.[33]
Motorcycles
For a list of motorcycle products, see List of Honda motorcycles.
Honda is the largest motorcycle manufacturer in Japan and has been since it started production in 1955.[10] At its peak in 1982, Honda manufactured almost three million motorcycles annually. By 2006 this figure had reduced to around 550,000 but was still higher than its three domestic competitors.[10]
During the 1960s, when it was a small manufacturer, Honda broke out of the Japanese motorcycle market and began exporting to the U.S. Working with the advertising agency Grey Advertising, Honda created an innovative marketing campaign, using the slogan "You meet the nicest people on a Honda." In contrast to the prevailing negative stereotypes of motorcyclists in America as tough, antisocial rebels, this campaign suggested that Honda motorcycles were made for the everyman. The campaign was hugely successful; the ads ran for three years, and by the end of 1963 alone, Honda had sold 90,000 motorcycles.[11]:{{{1}}}
Taking Honda's story as an archetype of the smaller manufacturer entering a new market already occupied by highly dominant competitors, the story of their market entry, and their subsequent huge success in the U.S. and around the world, has been the subject of some academic controversy. Competing explanations have been advanced to explain Honda's strategy and the reasons for their success.[34]
The first of these explanations was put forward when, in 1975, Boston Consulting Group (BCG) was commissioned by the UK government to write a report explaining why and how the British motorcycle industry had been out-competed by its Japanese competitors. The report concluded that the Japanese firms, including Honda, had sought a very high scale of production (they had made a large number of motorbikes) in order to benefit from economies of scale and learning curve effects. It blamed the decline of the British motorcycle industry on the failure of British managers to invest enough in their businesses to profit from economies of scale and scope.[35]




2004 Honda Super Cub


The second explanation was offered in 1984 by Richard Pascale, who had interviewed the Honda executives responsible for the firm's entry into the U.S. market. As opposed to the tightly focused strategy of low cost and high scale that BCG accredited to Honda, Pascale found that their entry into the U.S. market was a story of "miscalculation, serendipity, and organizational learning" – in other words, Honda's success was due to the adaptability and hard work of its staff, rather than any long term strategy.[36] For example, Honda's initial plan on entering the US was to compete in large motorcycles, around 300 cc. Honda's motorcycles in this class suffered performance and reliability problems when ridden the relatively long distances of the US highways.[11]:41–43 When the team found that the scooters they were using to get themselves around their U.S. base of San Francisco attracted positive interest from consumers that they fell back on selling the Super Cub instead.[11]:41–43
The most recent school of thought on Honda's strategy was put forward by Gary Hamel and C. K. Prahalad in 1989. Creating the concept of core competencies with Honda as an example, they argued that Honda's success was due to its focus on leadership in the technology of internal combustion engines.[37] For example, the high power-to-weight ratio engines Honda produced for its racing bikes provided technology and expertise which was transferable into mopeds. Honda's entry into the U.S. motorcycle market during the 1960s is used as a case study for teaching introductory strategy at business schools worldwide.[38]

Honda engines powered the entire 33-car starting field of the 2010 Indianapolis 500[43] and for the fifth consecutive race, there were no engine-related retirements during the running of the Memorial Day Classic.[44]
In the 1980s Honda developed the GY6 engine for use in motor scooters. Although no longer manufactured by Honda it is still commonly used in many Chinese, Korean and Taiwanese light vehicles.[45]
Honda, despite being known as an engine company, has never built a V8 for passenger vehicles. In the late 1990s, the company resisted considerable pressure from its American dealers for a V8 engine (which would have seen use in top-of-the-line Honda SUVs and Acuras), with American Honda reportedly sending one dealer a shipment of V8 beverages to silence them.[46] Honda considered starting V8 production in the mid-2000s for larger Acura sedans, a new version of the high end NSX sports car (which previously used DOHC V6 engines with VTEC to achieve its high power output) and possible future ventures into the American full-size truck and SUV segment for both the Acura and Honda brands, but this was cancelled in late 2008, with Honda citing environmental and worldwide economic conditions as reasons for the termination of this project.[47]
Robots




ASIMO at Expo 2005


ASIMO is the part of Honda's Research & Development robotics program. It is the eleventh in a line of successive builds starting in 1986 with Honda E0 moving through the ensuing Honda E series and the Honda P series. Weighing 54 kilograms and standing 130 centimeters tall, ASIMO resembles a small astronaut wearing a backpack, and can walk on two feet in a manner resembling human locomotion, at up to 6 km/h (3.7 mph). ASIMO is the world's only humanoid robot able to ascend and descend stairs independently.[48] However, human motions such as climbing stairs are difficult to mimic with a machine, which ASIMO has demonstrated by taking two plunges off a staircase.
Honda's robot ASIMO (see below) as an R&D project brings together expertise to create a robot that walks, dances and navigates steps. 2010 marks the year Honda has developed a machine capable of reading a user's brainwaves to move ASIMO. The system uses a helmet covered with electroencephalography and near-infrared spectroscopy sensors that monitor electrical brainwaves and cerebral blood flow—signals that alter slightly during the human thought process. The user thinks of one of a limited number of gestures it wants from the robot, which has been fitted with a Brain Machine Interface.[49]

Rubens Barrichello driving for Honda


Honda entered Formula One as a constructor for the first time in the 1964 season at the German Grand Prix with Ronnie Bucknum at the wheel. 1965 saw the addition of Richie Ginther to the team, who scored Honda's first point at the Belgian Grand Prix, and Honda's first win at the Mexican Grand Prix. 1967 saw their next win at the Italian Grand Prix with John Surtees as their driver. In 1968, Jo Schlesser was killed in a Honda RA302 at the French Grand Prix. This racing tragedy, coupled with their commercial difficulties selling automobiles in the United States, prompted Honda to withdraw from all international motorsport that year.
After a learning year in 1965, Honda-powered Brabhams dominated the 1966 French Formula Two championship in the hands of Jack Brabham and Denny Hulme. As there was no European Championship that season, this was the top F2 championship that year. In the early 1980s Honda returned to F2, supplying engines to Ron Tauranac's Ralt team. Tauranac had designed the Brabham cars for their earlier involvement. They were again extremely successful. In a related exercise, John Judd's Engine Developments company produced a turbo "Brabham-Honda" engine for use in IndyCar racing. It won only one race, in 1988 for Bobby Rahal at Pocono.
Honda returned to Formula One in 1983, initially with another Formula Two partner, the Spirit team, before switching abruptly to Williams in 1984. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Honda powered cars won six consecutive Formula One Constructors Championships. WilliamsF1 won the crown in 1986 and 1987. Honda switched allegiance again in 1988. New partners Team McLaren won the title in 1988, 1989, 1990 and 1991. Honda withdrew from Formula One at the end of 1992, although the related Mugen-Honda company maintained a presence up to the end of 1999, winning four races with Ligier and Jordan Grand Prix.
Honda debuted in the CART IndyCar World Series as a works supplier in 1994. The engines were far from competitive at first, but after development, the company powered six consecutive drivers championships. In 2003, Honda transferred its effort to the rival IRL IndyCar Series with Ilmor as joint development until 2006. In 2004, Honda-powered cars overwhelmingly dominated the IndyCar Series, winning 14 of 16 IndyCar races, including the Indianapolis 500, and claimed the IndyCar Series Manufacturers' Championship, Drivers' Championship and Rookie of the Year titles. From 2006 to 2011, Honda was the lone engine supplier for the IndyCar Series, including the Indianapolis 500. In the 2006 Indianapolis 500, for the first time in Indianapolis 500 history, the race was run without a single engine problem.[52] Since 2012, HPD has constructed turbocharged V-6 engines for its IndyCar effort.
During 1998, Honda considered returning to Formula One with their own team. The project was aborted after the death of its technical director, Harvey Postlethwaite. Honda instead came back as an official engine supplier to British American Racing (BAR) and Jordan Grand Prix. Honda bought a stake in the BAR team in 2004 before buying the team outright at the end of 2005, becoming a constructor for the first time since the 1960s. Honda won the 2006 Hungarian Grand Prix with driver Jenson Button.
It was announced on 5 December 2008, that Honda would be exiting Formula One with immediate effect due to the 2008 global economic crisis.[53] The team was sold to former team principal Ross Brawn, renamed Brawn GP and subsequently Mercedes.[54]
Honda became an official works team in the British Touring Car Championship in 2010.
Honda made an official announcement on 16 May 2013 that it will re-enter Formula One racing in 2015 as an engine supplier to the McLaren team.[55]

Main article: Honda Racing Corporation




Honda RC212V raced by Dani Pedrosa


Honda Racing Corporation (HRC) was formed in 1982. The company combines participation in motorcycle races throughout the world with the development of high potential racing machines. Its racing activities are an important source for the creation of leading edge technologies used in the development of Honda motorcycles. HRC also contributes to the advancement of motorcycle sports through a range of activities that include sales of production racing motorcycles, support for satellite teams, and rider education programs.
Soichiro Honda, being a race driver himself, could not stay out of international motorsport. In 1959, Honda entered five motorcycles into the Isle of Man TT race, the most prestigious motorcycle race in the world. While always having powerful engines, it took until 1961 for Honda to tune their chassis well enough to allow Mike Hailwood to claim their first Grand Prix victories in the 125 and 250 cc classes. Hailwood would later pick up their first Senior TT wins in 1966 and 1967. Honda's race bikes were known for their "sleek & stylish design" and exotic engine configurations, such as the 5-cylinder, 22,000 rpm, 125 cc bike and their 6-cylinder 250 cc and 297 cc bikes.
In 1979, Honda returned to Grand Prix motorcycle racing with the monocoque-framed, four-stroke NR500. The FIM rules limited engines to four cylinders, so the NR500 had non-circular, 'race-track', cylinders, each with 8 valves and two connecting rods, in order to provide sufficient valve area to compete with the dominant two-stroke racers. Unfortunately, it seemed Honda tried to accomplish too much at one time and the experiment failed. For the 1982 season, Honda debuted their first two-stroke race bike, the NS500 and in 1983, Honda won their first 500 cc Grand Prix World Championship with Freddie Spencer. Since then, Honda has become a dominant marque in motorcycle Grand Prix racing, winning a plethora of top level titles with riders such as Mick Doohan and Valentino Rossi. Honda also head the number of wins at the Isle of Man TT having notched up 227 victories in the solo classes and Sidecar TT,[56] including Ian Hutchinson's clean sweep at the 2010 races.[57] The outright lap record on the Snaefell Mountain Course is also held by Honda, set at the 2015 TT by John McGuinness at an average speed of 132.701 mph (213.562 km/h) on a Honda CBR1000RR.[58]
In the Motocross World Championship, Honda has claimed six world championships. In the World Enduro Championship, Honda has captured eight titles, most recently with Stefan Merriman in 2003 and with Mika Ahola from 2007 to 2010. In motorcycle trials, Honda has claimed three world championships with Belgian rider Eddy Lejeune.
Electric and alternative fuel vehicles




2009 Honda Civic GX hooked up to Phill refueling system


Compressed natural gas
The Honda Civic GX was for a long time the only purpose-built natural gas vehicle (NGV) commercially available in some parts of the U.S.[59][60] The Honda Civic GX first appeared in 1998 as a factory-modified Civic LX that had been designed to run exclusively on compressed natural gas. The car looks and drives just like a contemporary Honda Civic LX, but does not run on gasoline. In 2001, the Civic GX was rated the cleanest-burning internal combustion engine in the world by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).[61][62]
First leased to the City of Los Angeles, in 2005, Honda started offering the GX directly to the public through factory trained dealers certified to service the GX. Before that, only fleets were eligible to purchase a new Civic GX. In 2006, the Civic GX was released in New York, making it the second state where the consumer is able to buy the car.[63]
In June 2015, Honda announced its decision to phase out the commercialization of natural-gas powered vehicles to focus on the development of a new generation of electrified vehicles such as hybrids, plug-in electric cars and hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles. Since 2008, Honda has sold about 16,000 natural-gas vehicles, mainly to taxi and commercial fleets.[64]




Top: Brazilian flexible-fuel Honda Civic. Below: U.S. Honda Civic Hybrid


Flexible-fuel
Honda's Brazilian subsidiary launched flexible-fuel versions for the Honda Civic and Honda Fit in late 2006. As other Brazilian flex-fuel vehicles, these models run on any blend of hydrous ethanol (E100) and E20-E25 gasoline.[65][66] Initially, and in order to test the market preferences, the carmaker decided to produce a limited share of the vehicles with flex-fuel engines, 33 percent of the Civic production and 28 percent of the Fit models.[65][66] Also, the sale price for the flex-fuel version was higher than the respective gasoline versions, around US$1,000 premium for the Civic, and US$650 for the Fit, despite the fact that all other flex-fuel vehicles sold in Brazil had the same tag price as their gasoline versions.[66][67][68] In July 2009, Honda launched in the Brazilian market its third flexible-fuel car, the Honda City.[69]
During the last two months of 2006, both flex-fuel models sold 2,427 cars against 8,546 gasoline-powered automobiles,[70] jumping to 41,990 flex-fuel cars in 2007,[71] and reaching 93,361 in 2008.[72] Due to the success of the flex versions, by early 2009 a hundred percent of Honda's automobile production for the Brazilian market is now flexible-fuel, and only a small percentage of gasoline version is produced in Brazil for exports.[73]
In March 2009, Honda launched in the Brazilian market the first flex-fuel motorcycle in the world. Produced by its Brazilian subsidiary Moto Honda da Amazônia, the CG 150 Titan Mix is sold for around US$2,700.[74][75][76]
Hybrid electric
In late 1999, Honda launched the first commercial hybrid electric car sold in the U.S. market, the Honda Insight, just one month before the introduction of the Toyota Prius, and initially sold for US$20,000.[77][78] The first-generation Insight was produced from 2000 to 2006 and had a fuel economy of 70 miles per US gallon (3.4 L/100 km; 84 mpg‑imp) for the EPA's highway rating, the most fuel-efficient mass-produced car at the time.[77][78] Total global sales for the Insight amounted to only around 18,000 vehicles.[78] Cumulative global sales reached 100,000 hybrids in 2005 and 200,000 in 2007.[79]
Honda introduced the second-generation Insight in Japan in February 2009, and released it in other markets through 2009 and in the U.S. market in April 2009. At $19,800 as a five-door hatchback it will be the least expensive hybrid available in the U.S.[80]




2010 Honda Insight hybrid electric vehicle (Second generation)


Since 2002, Honda has also been selling the Honda Civic Hybrid (2003 model) in the U.S. market.[77] It was followed by the Honda Accord Hybrid, offered in model years 2005 through 2007. Sales of the Honda CR-Z began in Japan in February 2010, becoming Honda's third hybrid electric car in the market.[81] As of February 2011[update], Honda was producing around 200,000 hybrids a year in Japan.[82]
Sales of the Fit Hybrid began in Japan in October 2010, at the time, the lowest price for a gasoline-hybrid electric vehicle sold in the country.[83] The European version, called Honda Jazz Hybrid, was released in early 2011.[84] During 2011 Honda launched three hybrid models available only in Japan, the Fit Shuttle Hybrid, Freed Hybrid and Freed Spike Hybrid.[79]
Honda's cumulative global hybrid sales passed the 1 million unit milestone at the end of September 2012, 12 years and 11 months after sales of the first generation Insight began in Japan November 1999.[79] A total of 187,851 hybrids were sold worldwide in 2013, and 158,696 hybrids during the first six months of 2014.[85][86] As of June 2014[update], Honda has sold more than 1.35 million hybrids worldwide.[79][85][86]
Hydrogen fuel cell




Honda FCX Clarity hydrogen fuel cell vehicle


In Takanezawa, Japan, on 16 June 2008, Honda Motors produced the first assembly-line FCX Clarity, a hybrid hydrogen fuel cell vehicle. More efficient than a gas-electric hybrid vehicle, the FCX Clarity combines hydrogen and oxygen from ordinary air to generate electricity for an electric motor. In July 2014 Honda announced the end of production of the Honda FCX Clarity for the 2015 model.[87]
The vehicle itself does not emit any pollutants and its only by products are heat and water. The FCX Clarity also has an advantage over gas-electric hybrids in that it does not use an internal combustion engine to propel itself. Like a gas-electric hybrid, it uses a lithium ion battery to assist the fuel cell during acceleration and capture energy through regenerative braking, thus improving fuel efficiency. The lack of hydrogen filling stations throughout developed countries will keep production volumes low.[88] Honda will release the vehicle in groups of 150. California is the only U.S. market with infrastructure for fueling such a vehicle, though the number of stations is still limited. Building more stations is expensive, as the California Air Resources Board (CARB) granted $6.8 million for four H2 fueling stations, costing $1.7 million USD each.[89][90]
Honda views hydrogen fuel cell vehicles as the long term replacement of piston cars, not battery cars.[91]
Plug-in electric vehicles




Honda Fit EV concept unveiled at the 2010 Los Angeles Auto Show.


The all-electric Honda EV Plus was introduced in 1997 as a result of CARB's zero-emissions vehicle mandate and was available only for leasing in California. The EV plus was the first battery electric vehicle from a major automaker with non-lead–acid batteries The EV Plus had an all-electric range of 100 mi (160 km). Around 276 units were sold in the U.S. and production ended in 1999.[92][93]
The all-electric Honda Fit EV was introduced in 2012 and has a range of 82 mi (132 km).[94] The all-electric car was launched in the U.S. to retail customers in July 2012 with initial availability limited to California and Oregon.[95] Production is limited to only 1,100 units over the first three years. A total of 1,007 units have been leased in the U.S. through September 2014.[96][97][98] The Fit EV was released in Japan through leasing to local government and corporate customers in August 2012. Availability in the Japanese market is limited to 200 units during its first two years.[99] In July 2014 Honda announced the end of production of the Fit EV for the 2015 model.[87]
The Honda Accord Plug-in Hybrid was introduced in 2013 and has an all-electric range of 13 mi (21 km)[100] Sales began in the U.S. in January 2013 and the plug-in hybrid is available only in California and New York.[101] A total of 835 units have been sold in the U.S. through September 2014.[96][97][98] The Accord PHEV was introduced in Japan in June 2013 and is available only for leasing, primarily to corporations and government agencies.[102]
Marketing
Japan




Honda Clio (Saitama, Japan)


Starting in 1978, Honda in Japan decided to diversify its sales distribution channels, and created Honda Verno, which sold established products with a higher content of standard equipment and a more sporting nature.[103][104] The establishment of Honda Verno coincided with its new sports compact, called the Honda Prelude. Later, the Honda Vigor, the Honda Ballade, and the Honda Quint were added to Honda Verno stores. This approach was implemented due to efforts in place by rival Japanese automakers Toyota and Nissan.




Honda Primo (Osaka)


As sales progressed, Honda created two more sales channels, called Honda Clio in 1984, and Honda Primo in 1985. The Honda Clio chain sold products that were traditionally associated with Honda dealerships before 1978, like the Honda Accord, and Honda Primo sold the Honda Civic, kei cars, such as the Honda Today, superminis like the Honda Capa, along with other Honda products, such as farm equipment, lawn mowers, portable generators, marine equipment, plus motorcycles and scooters like the Honda Super Cub. A styling tradition was established when Honda Primo and Clio began operations, in that all Verno products had the rear license plate installed in the rear bumper, while Primo and Clio products had the rear license plate installed on the trunk lid or rear door for minivans.




Honda Verno (2008)


As time progressed and sales began to diminish partly due to the collapse of the Japanese "bubble economy", "supermini" and "kei" vehicles that were specific to Honda Primo were "badge engineered" and sold at the other two sales channels, thereby providing smaller vehicles that sold better at both Honda Verno and Honda Clio locations. As of March 2006, the three sales chains were discontinued, with the establishment of Honda Cars dealerships.[105] While the network was disbanded, some Japanese Honda dealerships still use the network names, offering all Japanese market Honda cars at all locations.




Honda Wing motorcycle dealership (Japan)


Honda sells genuine accessories through a separate retail chain called Honda Access for both their motorcycle, scooter and automobile products. In cooperation with corporate "keiretsu" partner Pioneer, Honda sells an aftermarket line of audio and in-car navigation equipment that can be installed in any vehicle under the brand name Gathers, which is available at Honda Access locations as well as Japanese auto parts retailers, such as Autobacs. Buyers of used vehicles are directed to a specific Honda retail chain that sells only used vehicles called Honda Auto Terrace.
In the spring of 2012, Honda in Japan introduced Honda Cars Small Store (Japanese) which is devoted to compact cars like the Honda Fit, and kei vehicles like the Honda N-One and Honda S660 roadster.

A Honda dealership in Ontario, Canada


In 2003, Honda released its Cog advertisement in the UK and on the Internet. To make the ad, the engineers at Honda constructed a Rube Goldberg Machine made entirely out of car parts from a Honda Accord Touring. To the chagrin of the engineers at Honda, all the parts were taken from two of only six hand-assembled pre-production models of the Accord. The advertisement depicted a single cog which sets off a chain of events that ends with the Honda Accord moving and Garrison Keillor speaking the tagline, "Isn't it nice when things just... work?" It took 606 takes to get it perfect.[106]
In 2004, they produced the Grrr advert, usually immediately followed by a shortened version of the 2005 Impossible Dream advert.
In December 2005, Honda released The Impossible Dream a two-minute panoramic advertisement filmed in New Zealand, Japan and Argentina which illustrates the founder's dream to build performance vehicles. While singing the song "Impossible Dream", a man reaches for his racing helmet, leaves his trailer on a minibike, then rides a succession of vintage Honda vehicles: a motorcycle, then a car, then a powerboat, then goes over a waterfall only to reappear piloting a hot air balloon, with Garrison Keillor saying "I couldn't have put it better myself" as the song ends. The song is from the 1960s musical Man Of La Mancha, sung by Andy Williams.
In 2006, Honda released its Choir advertisement, for the UK and the internet. This had a 60-person choir who sang the car noises as film of the Honda Civic are shown.
In the mid to late 2000s in the United States, during model close-out sales for the current year before the start of the new model year, Honda's advertising has had an animated character known simply as Mr. Opportunity, voiced by Rob Paulsen. The casual looking man talked about various deals offered by Honda and ended with the phrase "I'm Mr. Opportunity, and I'm knockin'", followed by him "knocking" on the television screen or "thumping" the speaker at the end of radio ads. In addition, commercials for Honda's international hatchback, the Jazz, are parodies of well-known pop culture images such as Tetris and Thomas The Tank Engine.
In late 2006, Honda released an ad with ASIMO exploring a museum, looking at the exhibits with almost childlike wonderment (spreading out its arms in the aerospace exhibit, waving hello to an astronaut suit that resembles him, etc.), while Garrison Keillor ruminates on progress. It concludes with the tagline: "More forwards please".
Honda also sponsored ITV's coverage of Formula One in the UK for 2007. However they had announced that they would not continue in 2008 due to the sponsorship price requested by ITV being too high.
In May 2007, focuses on their strengths in racing and the use of the Red H badge – a symbol of what is termed as "Hondamentalism". The campaign highlights the lengths that Honda engineers go to in order to get the most out of an engine, whether it is for bikes, cars, powerboats – even lawnmowers. Honda released its Hondamentalism campaign. In the TV spot, Garrison Keillor says, "An engineer once said to build something great is like swimming in honey", while Honda engineers in white suits walk and run towards a great light, battling strong winds and flying debris, holding on to anything that will keep them from being blown away. Finally one of the engineers walks towards a red light, his hand outstretched. A web address is shown for the Hondamentalism website. The digital campaign aims to show how visitors to the site share many of the Hondamentalist characteristics.
At the beginning of 2008, Honda released – the Problem Playground. The advert outlines Honda's environmental responsibility, demonstrating a hybrid engine, more efficient solar panels and the FCX Clarity, a hydrogen powered car. The 90 second advert has large scale puzzles, involving Rubik's Cubes, large shapes and a 3-dimensional puzzle.
On 29 May 2008, Honda, in partnership with Channel 4, broadcast a live advertisement. It showed skydivers jumping from an aeroplane over Spain and forming the letters H, O, N, D and A in mid-air. This live advertisement is generally agreed to be the first of its kind on British television. The advert lasted three minutes.[107]
In 2009, American Honda released the Dream the Impossible documentary series, a collection of 5–8 minute web vignettes that focus on the core philosophies of Honda. Current short films include Failure: The Secret to Success, Kick Out the Ladder and Mobility 2088. They have Honda employees as well as Danica Patrick, Christopher Guest, Ben Bova, Chee Pearlman, Joe Johnston and Orson Scott Card. The film series plays at dreams.honda.com.
Sports
In Australia, Honda advertised heavily during most motor racing telecasts, and was the official sponsor of the 2006 FIA Formula 1 telecast on broadcaster channel "Ten". In fact, it was the only manufacturer involved in the 2006 Indy Racing League season. In a series of adverts promoting the history of Honda's racing heritage, Honda claimed it "built" cars that won 72 Formula 1 Grand Prix. Skeptics[who?] have accused Honda of interpreting its racing history rather liberally, saying that virtually all of the 72 victories were achieved by Honda powered (engined) machines, whereas the cars themselves were designed and built by Lotus F1, Williams F1, and McLaren F1 teams, respectively. However, former and current staff of the McLaren F1 team have reiterated that Honda contributed more than just engines and provided various chassis, tooling, and aerodynamic parts as well as funding.[citation needed]
The late F1 driver Ayrton Senna stated that Honda probably played the most significant role in his three world championships. He had immense respect for founder, Soichiro Honda, and had a good relationship with Nobuhiko Kawamoto, the chairman of Honda at that time.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code
