Looking for a 401(k) or 403(b) plan loan?

When bills or debt feel overwhelming, it can be tempting to consider borrowing against your account in a 403(b) or a 401(k) plan. But the trade-offs can be steep—and we want to make sure you understand them.In the long run, you may pay more than the loan amount you withdraw, including:Any initial set-up and quarterly loan fees;Taxes you pay on the money you use to repay your loan; andLoan interest rates over timeOn top of that, you may miss out on potential growth and compounding of your earnings, which can be a major advantage of long-term savings in an account under 401(k) and 403(b) plans.To give you an idea, $20,000 in a 401(k) or 403(b) account could triple in 20 years at an average 7% rate of return —but not if you withdraw it today. Log in to learn more about retirement loans, and talk to your financial professional before you make a decision.

A Principal National Life Insurance Company Review for 2017


























BestLifeRates.org
You are here: Home / Companies / Get To Know The Principal National Life Insurance CompanyGet To Know The Principal National Life Insurance Company
Last Updated: May 2, 2017One of the older life insurance companies still in operation today, Principal began its journey in the middle of 1879 under the name it would hold for over a century, Bankers Life Association. Edward Temple who had a history in banking founded the company in Iowa and focused on issuing life insurance by membership only and with strict guidelines on who would be covered, and how the issuer would pay.
Of course, we all know a storied past doesn’t mean a spotless future. If this Principal National Life Insurance Company review, we help you understand the full scope of business they engage in, clarify their financial strength compared to other carriers, and bring to light what products they have available.
As always, make sure you do your own research before applying, regardless of which carrier you choose. Let’s talk Principal.
Our Principal National Life Insurance Company Review for 2017
After its first decade of business, it grew to a staggering $29 million in force coverage, which was big enough to require the company to move to bigger spaces in Des Moines, where it still resides. After thirty years of business, and the passing of its founder, Principal changed the way it did business by swapping out the old membership style and opting for a mutual life insurance company status.
Constant growth throughout the next few decades allowed Principal to begin offering health insurance in the ’40s, and within just five short years, this division of its business represented more than a third of its revenue stream.
Principal officially became Principal Financial Group in 1985, under which it still continues to transact business. The next step for Principal was going global, and it continues to have an active arm in seven countries on three separate continents.
2001 was also a landmark year as they filed to go public, where they are listed as PFG.
Principal’s Financial Strength & Ratings
Principal has the capacity to say it’s “A” rated from four of the major rating agencies, making it one of the best rated life insurance companies in America when based on financial strength, security, and solvency.
A.M. Best, Fitch, Moody’s, as well as Standard & Poor’s have all awarded Principal with a rating meaning the company is financially sound and likely to continue in such a stride. Here are those ratings, respectively:

A+
AA-
A1
A+

The company is big enough to host employment for nearly 15,000 people worldwide, and across four different segments of its business. Its among the top 100 Best Companies to Work For according to Forbes who does the ranking annually, as well as being named a top 50 Company for Women. There is also a strong presence in working with the United Way and other volunteering avenues.
Life Insurance Products
The life insurance products The Principal offers range from basic term life insurance products, to much more complex products like their variable universal life insurance choice.
Term Life
One of the more affordable carriers for term life insurance, Principal offers a few great privileges other companies don’t.
One of the lesser known products, which has just came to market from Principal National Life Insurance Company last year, is its $1 million no medical term policy. It is the first of its kind on the market, and uses state-of-the-art technology to determine a persons eligibility for up to a million in coverage with no physical exam.
Select from a 10-year, 15-year, 20-year, or a 30-year duration, a death benefit up to $1,000,000, and get approved without any kind of blood work or physical. If, for any reason, you don’t get approved for the accelerated product, you can still take the exam and get covered.
The term can be converted to permanent, with no further tests or proof of insurability.
Permanent Life
Principal National Life Insurance Company offers three tiers of permanent insurance:

Universal
Variable Universal
Survivorship Universal

The universal and variable universal options both allow you to get a permanent death benefit, with flexible premiums, but the cash accumulation portion is invested differently. With a variable product, you have the potential to gain additional growth by utilizing stock, bonds or mutual funds, yet you take on greater risk, too.
The survivorship life, also known as a second-to-die policy, is a great choice for more advanced planning, like magnifying earmarked cash when both parties within an estate pass away.
Other Products
Principal also offers many, many other products, not just life insurance. While we focus mainly on what life options a carrier has, it’s also important to know what the full scope of business they cover truly is.
As a quick example, they offers a range annuities, which often go hand-in-hand with life insurance. Choose from:

Fixed
Indexed
Variable
Immediate (Income)

Looking for a place to house your old 401(k) or 403(b)? Principal can help there, or with any other IRA-related investment or retirement accounts.
Principal also has disability insurance, to cover those times when you’re unable to work but need to secure your income.
Our Final Thoughts
Principal was founded on frugal ways of doing business so it could be done for the benefit of its members, and this strategy is still being employed today. Principal is competitive across several industries, too, not just life insurance.
Its core focus and marketing strategy aims to help individuals, families, and small businesses all across the nation and around the world. And in the life insurance market, they are succeeding. Innovation, very competitive rates, and a nice selection of products helps everyone meet their goals of insurance.
We find Principal to be a strong choice for you to cover yourself, your family, or your business.

Your Retirement Wellness Score



                Your Retirement Wellness Score indicates the percentage of your pre-retirement income that is estimated to be
                              available at the specified retirement age (based on your personalized inputs and current assumptions). Studies
                              suggest replacing at least 70-85% of your income in retirement.                *
              

                The score compares what you are estimated to have in monthly income at retirement against your estimated monthly
                                pre-retirement income. For example, based on your inputs you may have $1,000 per month when you retire, but your
                                monthly pre-retirement income is $2,000. Your Retirement Wellness Score would be 50.              

                This score, and what you will have, are merely estimates based on information provided by you and several
                              financial assumptions, including a 4.5% withdrawal rate. This information may be valued as of different dates.
                              This is not a guarantee of future income.              

                Your Retirement Wellness Score always assumes you are replacing 100% of your pre-retirement income.
                              So, it will not change if you make changes that impact your desired income in retirement.

One of the lesser known products, which has just come to market from Principal National Life Insurance Company, is its $1 million no medical term policy. It is the first of its kind in the market and uses state-of-the-art technology to determine a person’s eligibility for up to a million in coverage with no physical exam.The Principal  National Life Insurance Company was founded on frugal ways of doing business so it could be done for the benefit of its members, and this strategy is still being employed today. Principal is competitive across several industries, too, not just life insurance. Its core focus and marketing strategy aim to help individuals, families, and small businesses all across the nation and around the world.Principal has the capacity to say it’s “A” rated from four of the major rating agencies, making it one of the best rated life insurance companies in America when based on financial strength, security, and solvency. A.M. Best, Fitch, Moody’s, as well as Standard & Poor’s have all awarded Principal with a rating meaning the company is financially sound and likely to continue in such a stride.History:The Principal  National Life Insurance Company began its journey in the middle of 1879 under the name it would hold for over a century, Bankers Life Association. Edward Temple who had a history in banking founded the company in Iowa and focused on issuing life insurance by membership only and with strict guidelines on who would be covered, and how the issuer would pay.After its first decade of business, it grew to a staggering $29 million in force coverage, which was big enough to require the company to move to bigger spaces in Des Moines, where it still resides. After thirty years of business, and the passing of its founder, Principal changed the way it did business by swapping out the old membership style and opting for a mutual life insurance company status.Constant growth throughout the next few decades allowed Principal to begin offering health insurance in the ’40s, and within just five short years, this division of its business represented more than a third of its revenue stream.Principal officially became Principal Financial Group in 1985, under which it still continues to transact business. The next step for Principal was going global, and it continues to have an active arm in seven countries on three separate continents. 2001 was also a landmark year as they filed to go public.Company Ratings:CompanyRatingDescription A.M.

Perspective II®


Benefit Options
Guarantees You Can Count On. With more time spent in retirement, it's increasingly important to establish a steady stream of income that will last as long as you do. And if leaving an inheritance for future generations is a priority, you may want to consider an investment strategy with potential to grow your legacy. The optional living and death benefits offered by Perspective II can help you pursue your unique income and legacy goals.

Guarantees are backed by the claims-paying ability of Jackson National Life Insurance Company® or Jackson National Life Insurance Company of New York® and do not apply to the principal amount or investment performance of a variable annuity's separate account or its underlying investments.



What is a Variable Annuity? Variable annuities are long-term, tax-deferred investments designed for retirement, involve investment risks and may lose value. Earnings are taxable as ordinary income when distributed and may be subject to a 10% additional tax if withdrawn before age 59½.




Guarantee Your Income with Living Benefits



				Adding a living benefit to your variable annuity contract for an additional fee can provide you with a steady stream of lifetime* income. While many variable annuity companies offer pre-packaged living benefits, we understand that no investor's objectives are the same and only you and your advisor know which features best complement your objectives. That's why Jackson® offers a-la-carte options, so you only pay for the features you need — not for those you don't.
			
Jackson's LifeGuard Freedom® Suite of Living Benefits offers:

Guaranteed income that lasts as long as you do
The freedom to receive lifetime* income without compromising your investment strategy
The ability to control when and how you withdraw your money, which may help you manage your tax burden



Guarantee Your Legacy with Death Benefits†



				Just as an optional living benefit can help you grow and receive income throughout your lifetime — death benefits allow you to leave a financial legacy beyond your lifetime. A PerspectiveSM variable annuity includes a standard death benefit and the option to choose one of our enhanced benefits that for an additonal fee offers the potential to increase the amount of money you provide when the time comes.
			
When your goals shift from growing income to providing for future generations, Jackson's death benefits offer:

A guaranteed financial legacy
An opportunity to lock in growth
Options for tax-efficient transfer of your assets and the ability to avoid the time-consuming probate process



*On the contract anniversary on or immediately following the owner's (or older joint owner's) attained age 59½, the for-life guarantee becomes effective provided: 1) the contract value is greater than zero and 2) the contract has not been annuitized. If the owner (or older joint owner) is age 59½ on the effective date of the endorsement, then the for-life guarantee becomes effective on that date. 
†Death benefits terminate if the contract value reduces to zero.





Before investing, investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the variable annuity and its underlying investment options. The current contract prospectus and underlying fund prospectuses, which are contained in the same document, provide this and other important information. Please contact your representative or the Company to obtain the prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses carefully before investing or sending money.

Before investing, investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the variable annuity and its underlying investment options. The current contract prospectus and underlying fund prospectuses, which are contained in the same document, provide this and other important information. Please contact your representative or the Company to obtain the prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses carefully before investing or sending money.
The latest income date allowed is age 95, which is the required age to annuitize or take a lump sum. Please see the prospectus for important information regarding the annuitization of a contract.
Optional benefits may be elected at issue and, once elected, may not be cancelled or changed. Optional benefits are available for an extra charge in addition to the ongoing fees and expenses of the variable annuity. Only one optional living benefit and one optional death benefit may be elected per contract. May not be available in all states or on all products, and state variations may apply. The long-term advantage of the optional benefits will vary with the terms of the benefit option, the investment performance of the variable investment options selected, and the length of time the annuity is owned. As a result, in some circumstances the cost of an option may exceed the actual benefit paid under the option.
Tax deferral offers no additional value if an annuity is used to fund a qualified plan, such as a 401(k) or IRA, and may be found at a lower cost in other investment products. It also may not be available if the annuity is owned by a "non-natural person" such as a corporation or certain types of trusts.
Perspective II Variable and Fixed Annuity (VA620) is issued by Jackson National Life Insurance Company® (Home Office: Lansing, Michigan) and in New York, (VA620NY 09/12) by Jackson National Life Insurance Company of New York® (Home Office: Purchase, New York). Variable annuities are distributed by Jackson National Life Distributors LLC, member FINRA. May not be available in all states and state variations may apply. This contract has limitations and restrictions including possible withdrawal charges and excess interest adjustments (interest rate adjustments in New York) where applicable. Jackson® issues other annuities with similar features, benefits, limitations, and charges. Discuss them with your representative or contact Jackson for more information.
Jackson® is the marketing name for Jackson National Life Insurance Company® and Jackson National Life Insurance Company of New York®.
Firm and state variations may apply.

Short and Sharp: The twisted relationship between central banks and inflation

Investors currently face the challenge of the Federal Reserve’s belief that monetary policy needs to be tightened, despite missing inflationary pressures. This is not just a U.S. phenomenon, it’s a global one. In the euro-area, core inflation remains stubbornly low, yet the European Central Bank (ECB) is likely gearing up to announce its tapering plans.
