Unlike conventional MPI technologies that must be laboriously deployed and populated with patient data, the Verato Universal MPI is a pre-built, cloud-based, nationwide master patient index that enterprises can simply “plug into”—without the need for extensive algorithm tuning, data governance, data cleansing, or data stewardship processes.The Verato Universal MPI is pre-populated with pre-mastered and continuously-updated demographic data spanning the entire US population. It incorporates a powerful new matching technology called “referential matching” that leverages this pre-mastered database as an “answer key” to match and link identities that even world-class probabilistic algorithms can never match. And it is cloud-based, so it can rapidly be deployed.Learn more at our websiteCompetitors of VeratoJust Associates, IncJust Associates is a healthcare IT Consulting firm focused on improving the integrity of patient data.

Information Services

            The right information about the right person. All the time, every time.        






Get more accurate credit and health insurance information
  


    Informed business decisions often require the right information about customers, patients, members, policyholders, and applicants. But information service providers typically deliver incomplete information since the identities they're searching on are incorrect.
    

    Instead, Verato compares information requests on individuals to CARBON™ and matches them to the right identity. Our clients get the full scope of relevant information so they can make optimal decisions on people interacting with their business.
    




 
Credit
Make better credit decisions with more complete credit reports
                        



Verato generates comprehensive tri-merge credit reports that reflect a complete and accurate picture of a person's credit history. Other credit reporting services can omit as much as half of a person's relevant credit information due to unresolved identity records. Verato sees through inaccuracies in names, birthdates, and other identity attributes and uses truth matching to uncover all relevant information, even under misspellings or outdated maiden names. This allows Verato customers to make better-informed decisions based on a true account of the person's credit behavior. 

Tri-bureau reports from all three reporting agencies
Optimized with CARBON truth matching
Sourced by the most cost-effective provider







Health Insurance
Get reimbursements from secondary insurers and recover overpayments



Verato helps uncover other health insurance policies for optimal coordination of benefits to ensure primary insurance carriers don't overpay when secondary insurance exists. Other health insurance often goes unnoticed due to unresolved identities but Verato gives customers a complete account of the person's health insurance by matching against CARBON identities. This improves identification of other health insurance and secondary policies by 40 percent, saving Verato customers millions as they get appropriately reimbursed.

Webinar: 3 Strategies for Achieving Interoperability



                                                  Jun 27 2017                                            


The future of healthcare in the US is based on an assumption that every health IT system can interoperate with every other health IT system—which would enable better care coordination and reduce costs. But how far along are we at actually achieving full interoperability and what can we do to get there?
Join our webinar with the eHealth Initiative to learn about:

The larger challenge and strategy of achieving interoperability
How one large health system is achieving interoperability within its own four walls
Strategies for achieving interoperability not just within an organization, but also between organizations, and with payers, HIEs, and state and federal health agencies
The newest frontier of interoperability—called “identity interoperability”—and counterintuitive ways that organizations can achieve it






Webinar: Why A National Patient Identifier Is Not The Answer



                                                  Jun 21 2017                                            


Many health IT professionals believe a National Unique Patient Identifier (UPID) would solve the problems of patient identification and patient matching, but such an identifier is not the best solution.
Originally presented by Verato’s Founder and CTO Brent Williams at the 2017 CHIA Convention and Exhibit, this webinar will address:

The roots of the patient identification and patient matching problem
7 critical challenges that make a UPID infeasible and an impractical solution to these problems
The challenges of implementing a UPID in the United States versus other countries that have already implemented one
Alternative solutions to the patient identification problem

Webinar: Traditional MPIs are Dead. What’s next?



                                                  May 31 2017                                            


Master patient indexes (MPIs) and “enterprise” MPIs (eMPIs) aren’t cutting it anymore. The healthcare industry is long overdue for an MPI built from the ground up to solve its most pressing patient identity challenges. And it is long overdue for an MPI built to enable true “identity interoperability” between an enterprise’s diverse array of EHR, revenue cycle, and other IT systems.
Join our webinar with HIMSS to learn why traditional MPI and eMPI technologies will be made obsolete by a new generation of MPI technologies—called “universal” MPIs—that are:

Cloud based
Fast and easy to implement
Effortless to operate
Dramatically more precise due to a new “referential matching” architecture






Webinar: Traditional MPIs are Dead. What’s Next?



                                                  May 9 2017                                            


Master patient indexes (MPIs) and “enterprise” MPIs (eMPIs) struggled to solve yesterday’s patient matching needs and will fail to solve tomorrow’s. The healthcare industry is long overdue for an MPI built from the ground up to solve its most pressing patient identity challenges. And it is long overdue for an MPI built not just to consolidate patient identities, but to enable true “identity interoperability.”
Attend this webinar with Health Data Management to learn why traditional MPI and eMPI technologies will be made obsolete by a new generation of MPI technologies called “universal” MPIs.

About Verato

 
Verato offers a cloud-based platform that represents the new best-in-class identity resolution and matching technology. Compared to conventional master patient index (MPI) and master data management (MDM) tools, the Verato platform is 12x faster to deploy, 15x more precise, and has a 2.5x lower total cost of ownership.
Our technology was born from methods and algorithms used in counter-terrorism operations—finding suspects regardless of what identities they assumed. We took those same methods and algorithms and applied them to challenges faced by the commercial market—resolving identities regardless of whether those identities are represented by out-of-date, incorrect, incomplete, or inconsistent identification data like names, addresses, and birthdates.
The Verato platform enables healthcare organizations to assemble complete clinical pictures of their patients and perform more accurate analytics. It enables businesses to develop a single view of their customers across diverse brands and disparate channels. And it enables government departments and agencies to gain more accurate views of their citizens to provide more effective services.
We invested four years, millions of dollars, and thousands of man-hours of data science, data engineering, algorithmic, and cloud-services expertise to build the most comprehensive and precise identity resolution and matching technology on the market. And we built it in the cloud—so any enterprise can deploy it in weeks and scale it to support their largest challenges.

Financial Services

            Connecting customer identities across channels over time to measure risk exposure, combat fraud, and deliver superior customer service        








 Banking and Investments
            



 Life and Property Insurance






Verato enables a single view of banking and investment customers across channels 
Banks and brokers looking across engagement channels to identify new product opportunities or detect fraud are faced with poor quality customer data that prevents a single view of the customer. Current matching solutions still cannot see through this incomplete, out-of-date, or duplicate customer data. Verato helps financial institutions gain a complete view of customers across channels so they can effectively engage customers with better digital experiences and prevent fraudulent activity.




                        Verato offers a cloud-based platform that cleans, validates, and links customer records across systems so banking and investment firms can deliver engaging cross-channel customer experiences and prevent fraud                    






Integrate Customer Data to Deliver Cross-Channel Offerings


Financial institutions are integrating customer data across an increasing number of channels to create new offerings, but these different channels use different data formats and often contain outdated or inaccurate customer data. Verato helps financial institutions integrate their customer data from every channel and data format so they can track customer activity throughout the entire engagement lifecycle. Verato links customer records together using a revolutionary new matching engine that helps banking and investment firms introduce new cross-channel experiences that maximize customer engagement.





Improve Cyber Fraud Analytics


Customers are engaging with their finances from a wide variety of channels, making it increasingly difficult to link transactions, behavior patterns, and non-banking activity so they can identify and analyze fraud. Verato uses a revolutionary new matching engine to link customer identities across channels, engagement platforms, and systems, enabling banks and brokers to perform deeper and more powerful analytics of customers and their behavior to better identify and respond to fraud.






Verato enables insurance organizations to accurately identify customers and integrate customer data across their institutions 
Creating a single view of a customer is critical as service and product delivery models undergo dramatic changes. But it can be a difficult task—data about customers can be locked away inside siloed systems, fragmented by M&A activity, or simply scattered around the enterprise. On top of that, 30% of the identity data contained within customer records is old, inaccurate, mistyped, misspelled, erroneous, or incomplete—and current matching algorithms cannot see through this bad data to identify the same individual across systems.




                        Verato offers a cloud-based platform that provides real-time customer identification across channels, increases the accuracy of incoming customer data, and links customer data across systems to create a single view of the customer                    






Perform Real-Time Risk Measurement and Underwriting


As customers engage with new technology platforms, new insurance products and services must respond faster to changes in underlying customer data and better link identities to model risk in real-time. Old approaches relied on historical data and group behavior, but new risk measurement models have much shorter analytical windows that require understanding underwriting factors on specific customers. Verato links customer data across disparate systems so insurance companies gain a complete view of each customer for more accurate risk measurement and modeling. Verato also validates and identifies customers in real-time across platforms and engagement channels to enable real-time risk measurement and response.





Enable Big Data Integration and Predictive Analytics


Big data analytics let insurance companies gain new insights about customer behaviors, communications, and transactions. But varying data sources and data governance standards, as well as poor data quality, cause big data repositories to be disorganized and contain inaccurate or out-of-date customer information. Verato improves customer data quality in big data repositories, deduplicates customer records, and links customer data across repositories—allowing better predictive, statistical, and longitudinal analytics.





Improve Sales and Service


New sales, service, and delivery models require real-time customer identification at the point of engagement that is not available with traditional ETL, MDM, and data quality tools. And if data errors are not identified at the point of entry, they will persist downstream, causing inefficient sales campaigns and forcing costly retroactive data remediation. Verato offers a customer identification and data quality improvement solution that can be deployed within upfront business processes and systems to maximize the use of customer information and to ensure effective service and sales efforts.

Verato, Inc. Company Profile

00:21 EDT 29th July 2017 | BioPortfolio











      Verato offers a cloud-based platform that matches and links customer 
      records and identities across systems and enterprises. Verato uses a 
      âreferential matchingâ engine to achieve the highest match rates in the 
      industry, allowing healthcare, commercial, and government organizations 
      to develop a single view of their patients, customers, and citizens. 
      Verato delivers sub-second performance and securely scales to hundreds 
      of millions of transactions to support the largest organizations. Verato 
      maximizes time-to-value and minimizes total cost of ownership because 
      there is no on-premise software to implement. Verato is based in McLean, 
      VA.

About Verato

 
Verato offers a cloud-based platform that represents the new best-in-class identity resolution and matching technology. Compared to conventional master patient index (MPI) and master data management (MDM) tools, the Verato platform is 12x faster to deploy, 15x more precise, and has a 2.5x lower total cost of ownership.
Our technology was born from methods and algorithms used in counter-terrorism operations—finding suspects regardless of what identities they assumed. We took those same methods and algorithms and applied them to challenges faced by the commercial market—resolving identities regardless of whether those identities are represented by out-of-date, incorrect, incomplete, or inconsistent identification data like names, addresses, and birthdates.
The Verato platform enables healthcare organizations to assemble complete clinical pictures of their patients and perform more accurate analytics. It enables businesses to develop a single view of their customers across diverse brands and disparate channels. And it enables government departments and agencies to gain more accurate views of their citizens to provide more effective services.
We invested four years, millions of dollars, and thousands of man-hours of data science, data engineering, algorithmic, and cloud-services expertise to build the most comprehensive and precise identity resolution and matching technology on the market. And we built it in the cloud—so any enterprise can deploy it in weeks and scale it to support their largest challenges.
