At Woodford, it is very important to us that investors understand their investments and how they are being managed. We are keen to ensure the right people are invested in the right funds for the right reasons and can continually make informed investment decisions based on what’s right for them.
We offer investors a choice of three funds – all offering access to the investment expertise of Neil Woodford, one of the most respected fund managers of his generation. See the key differences between the three funds.
The CF Woodford Income Focus Fund is our newest fund. It has been developed to meet the demand from our investors for a fund offering a higher level of regular and sustainable income, with no compromise on quality
The CF Woodford Equity Income Fund is the original Woodford fund. It sits in the Investment Association (IA) UK Equity Income sector, aiming to offer investors capital growth and a growing income stream, paid quarterly. In line with our culture of simplicity, transparency and innovation, the fund has a clean and clear pricing structure. The Woodford Equity Income Feeder Fund provides offshore access to this fund.
The Woodford Patient Capital Trust is our innovative second fund – an investment trust, offering exposure to a mix of exciting, disruptive early-stage companies, together with some of Woodford’s high conviction mid and large capitalisation ideas. It aims to identify the best, untapped growth opportunities and deliver exceptional long-term returns. An innovative fee structure aligns manager and investor and reflects our conviction in this uniquely attractive investment opportunity.





This short film explains the key differences between the three funds

Home > Us 















The establishment of Woodford in 2014 has been the opportunity for Neil Woodford – one of the UK’s most highly-regarded fund managers – to distil 30 years of experience and learning into a business founded on his own principles.
Our ambition was not to be just another fund management company but to create something different and better for our investors. We believe that there are parts of our industry that have forgotten what it is that investors really want – too often they face noise and complexity and an industry focused on relative returns and short-term pressures. At Woodford, our approach is different, as all of our attention is on providing a positive long-term return for our clients.
And it is not just our investment approach that is different. We are building a strong and successful, transformational fund management business with a unique culture. A team of talented and passionate people, specialists in their individual fields, who share a vision for how a fund management company can and should operate and are united in their commitment to delivering outstanding outcomes for our clients.
It is an environment in which our investment managers can focus solely on managing money and delivering the performance our investors expect. Without the constraints of legacy infrastructure, we have anchored our Investment team in a dynamic, cutting-edge business that embraces both increased regulation and a fast-moving world. We have been able to make use of new technology and outsourcing models to provide an industry-leading infrastructure that is unrivalled in its effectiveness and efficiency.
We aim to deliver more than just profit. As well as enriching the lives of our clients, we are actively engaging with the wider community and building a fund management business that will generate value, not just for today’s generation but also for the generations of tomorrow.
Our goal is to set a new benchmark for how fund management companies do business – with client outcomes our absolute focus.


Investment approach


At Woodford, we feel strongly that existing and potential investors are entitled to understand what we’re doing with their money.
Understanding our long-term, disciplined and diligent investment approach is crucial in helping clients to decide whether investing with us would be right for them and to understand how their investments are being managed and the experience they can expect with Woodford.
First and foremost we are stock pickers. We combine rigorous fundamental analysis of companies with our perspective of the long-term macro-economic outlook and variables and how these might impact existing or potential holdings. This approach allows us to construct robust investment rationales and make informed decisions. We focus on what matters: the long term and the fundamentals.
An active strategy
We believe that being an active investor means doing something different from the market and adding value through the investment process.
Every investment we buy, we buy on merit – we never invest in companies to make our portfolios look more like the index. As a result, our portfolios tend to look and behave very differently to the general market. We are happy for our performance to be compared to the market (and our portfolio activity and performance are fully disclosed on our website) but we are confident that we can better it over the long term by doing things differently.
Company engagement
We are also active in our engagement with company management teams, as we want to represent our investors’ best interests in our discussions with management teams. We aim to ensure that management is aligned with shareholders and that the course set for the business will create long-term shareholder value. We engage with management to try to influence change where necessary. Successful investment requires a partnership between managers and owners.
Long-term focus
Our long-term approach to investment management is encapsulated in a patient capital investment style.
Equity markets take a random walk on a daily basis. The forces of fundamentals and valuation may be over-ridden by sentiment and the whim of the market in the short term, but it is the longer time periods that count. We look beyond the short-term noise and focus on the long-term drivers of share prices.
Our approach is focused on value discovery, not on price discovery. We believe that by focusing on valuation and identifying companies that can deliver sustainable growth, today or in the future, we can deliver great long-term outcomes for our investors.
Absolute focus
We believe investors expect a return. We don’t think we’ve done a good job if a fund falls in value, even if the market has delivered an even worse outcome. Protecting our investors’ capital is key.
Our approach is all about positive return over the long term. We do not pay attention to hype and we are not distracted by the desire for instant results. Instead we seek well-run, high-quality businesses – the fundamentals matter and Neil’s ability to make investment decisions that balance macro-views, business specifics and his view on management teams have resulted in exceptional long-term performance.
Of course value is not a product of history but of the future and that is why Neil and the Investment team continue to adopt their disciplined, diligent and focused methodology to spot opportunities and create positive outcomes for our clients.
In the case of younger businesses, investors do have to tolerate the prospect of loss on a stock-specific basis, although our due diligence efforts are designed to minimise this risk. We aim to achieve capital preservation through diversification, by investing in a larger number of smaller positions.
We acknowledge that there will be periods when a fund falls in value but we believe our disciplined strategy, with a focus on valuation and diligent stock picking, can help us prevent any temporary losses of capital becoming permanent. We focus on absolute risk and on delivering a positive return over the long term.
What matters to our clients matters to us and our sole focus is on delivering robust and reliable performance for investors.


Results


The foundations of our investment principles and approach have been at the heart of Neil’s successful investment philosophy for decades and have proved extremely rewarding for his investors. The approach has been fine-tuned over the years – as our fund managers have learnt from both successes and failures – but it has not changed in any material way.
Our aim of delivering consistent and attractive long-term performance has been achieved consistently throughout Neil Woodford’s career. We strongly believe that our disciplined approach is robust and repeatable and will continue to deliver real value for investors.
In the period since Woodford was established, our assets under management have grown steadily to £17.8bn (source Northern Trust, as at 31 May 2017), with all types of investor demonstrating belief in Neil and his team.

Championing growth and supporting the best of British
 



Home > Funds > Woodford Patient Capital Trust plc 















A uniquely attractive investment

Portfolio exposure to a mix of exciting, disruptive early-stage and early-growth companies, together with some of Woodford’s high conviction mid and large capitalisation ideas
Buying stakes in businesses with outstanding intellectual property and helping them fulfil their growth potential through the deployment of long-term patient capital
Aiming to identify the best, untapped growth opportunities and deliver exceptional long-term returns
An innovative fee structure, aligning manager and investor

The opportunity

Despite some of the best universities and finest intellectual property, the UK’s record of converting this into commercial success is poor
This is primarily due to a lack of appropriate capital investment – which creates a compelling investment opportunity
A long-term ‘patient capital’ approach can deliver extremely successful outcomes and help businesses fulfil their potential, while also helping to develop the UK’s ‘knowledge economy’ and support the much-needed economic rebalancing
Unrivalled and untapped growth opportunities offer potential for outstanding long-term returns

An investment team that shares a single goal

The fund is managed by Neil Woodford, widely regarded as one of the finest investors of his generation and with more than a decade’s experience of deploying long-term patient capital to young businesses
Neil is supported by a dedicated team that shares his approach and commitment to the goal of exceptional long-term performance for our clients
Three experienced fund managers work with Neil – each with a different skill set for depth of cross-market coverage
Three specialist analysts support the fund managers, providing them with valuable analysis and support on specific investment opportunities

Understanding early-stage risks

Young businesses have a very different risk profile to more mature companies – risks are much more stock-specific, which implies a lower correlation with equity markets in general and the wider economy
This may offer diversification benefits
It also means long-term outcomes are more binary – extremely attractive rewards for success but also risk of capital loss (as some businesses will inevitably fail to fulfil their potential)
We aim to mitigate this risk through rigorous analysis of the opportunity, an unwavering focus on valuation and diversification across a larger number of smaller positions

Who might the trust be suitable for?

A wide variety of UK adult investors able to invest a lump sum or make regular payments
Self-directed investors capable of evaluating the risks and merits of the trust (in particular the specific risks associated with investment in early-stage companies)
Advised investors with varied levels of interest, knowledge, confidence and experience
Looking for long-term (5 years+) investment growth
Not seeking regular income from this investment
Comfortable accepting that the value of investments in the trust can go down as well as up, that capital may be at risk and that performance varies over time (and share price is dependent on normal market forces of supply and demand rather than just the trust’s underlying NAV) and returns are not guaranteed






Who is this trust not suitable for?

Any investor who does not have sufficient resources to bear any loss resulting from the investment
Investors who are not prepared to take any risk with their money or put their capital at risk
Self-directed investors who are not able to evaluate the risks and merits of the fund
Any investor looking for guaranteed income or total return
Investors who are not prepared to accept short-term volatility as there will be periods when the fund falls in value

What is the liquidity profile of the product? 



Home > What is the liquidity profile of the product? 















The mid and large cap element of the trust will help provide the portfolio with liquidity. However, the relatively small capitalisation of early-stage and smaller capitalisation companies could cause the market in their shares to be less liquid and, as a consequence, their share price more volatile than may be the case with investments in larger companies. The trust may also invest in securities that are not readily tradable, which may make it difficult for us to sell investments and may lead to volatility in the market price of the trust’s shares.
