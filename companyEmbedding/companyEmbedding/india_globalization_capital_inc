Marijuana is the fastest growing industry in the world and the industry is just getting started.  
From Canada to Australia and Mexico to Germany, the legal marijuana industry continues to grow and is already a multi-billion-dollar market.
Marijuana is becoming big business and the industry's rapid growth has led to the creation of new high-growth sub-industries. Although there are numerous opportunities around the sale of legal cannabis, we believe the greatest and most profitable opportunities can be found on the biotech and healthcare side of the industry.
Biotech Beneficiaries of the Marijuana Movement
The biotech sector will be one of the greatest beneficiaries of the legal cannabis movement and we have already identified several leaders focused on this opportunity.
Marijuana is medicine. Biotech firms focused on developing treatments that are derived from marijuana have been successful. GW Pharmaceuticals' Sativex product is derived from cannabis and treats patients with Multiple Sclerosis. Currently, Sativex is being sold in 27 countries.
Biotech stocks do not trade like your normal investment. While companies like Apple (APPL) and Ford (F) tend to trade on earnings and revenue, biotech companies trade on FDA data and approvals.
A Biotech Firm to Watch
Last week, NYSE-traded India Globalization Capital, Inc. (IGC) announced its fiscal year 2017 financial results. The company is developing a product portfolio of phytocannabinoid-based therapies through cutting edge research for the treatment of a wide range of therapeutic indications.
In response to the earnings report, IGC CEO Ram Mukunda said, "In fiscal 2017, our major accomplishments include the advancement of our phytocannabinoid patent filing portfolio to large market indications. And in order to keep this focus on the medical cannabis industry, we disposed of our low-margin iron ore and electronic trading businesses, and retired about 10% of our outstanding common stock; thus reducing revenue, PP&E, and stockholder's equity.  We firmly believe that this planned strategic move positions our company for growth in one of the fastest growing industries in America."
Focused on Indications with Large Addressable Markets
IGC is focused on developing treatments for indications including neuropathic and cancer pain, epilepsy, end of life supportive care, adjunctive supportive therapies of chronic neurological and oncological diagnosis, which are life altering or life threatening.
Much of IGC's value is derived from its intellectual property and previously filed patents. In 2014, the company filed a patent for IGC-501 and IGC is currently finalizing the product development by conducting anecdotal testing. Later that year, IGC filed a patent for IGC-504
In February 2017, IGC filed a patent for IGC-506 which is used to treat eating disorders. The company expects to file an additional patent to finalize these products later this year while advancing its refractory epilepsy treatment for dogs and cats (IGC-505 and IGC-503).
In June, IGC announced a milestone and entered a definitive license agreement with the University of South Florida. Under the agreement, IGC is the exclusive licensee of the U.S. patent filing entitled, THC as a Potential Therapeutic Agent for Alzheimer's Disease. This is an important development for IGC as it works toward the development of a potential cannabis-based treatment for America's most expensive disease.
IGC acquired this patent to protect its proprietary formulation, IGC-AD1 which includes low-doses of THC and is intended to disrupt the buildup of amyloid beta plaques and alleviate some of the worst symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. If the patent is granted and proven, IGC will own a significant therapeutic pathway by which THC interacts with the human body.
Several Potential Catalysts for Growth
IGC has several significant catalysts for growth and its pipelines provides this potential for years to come. One of IGC's catalysts is when it shares data supporting its formulation, the patent application, the transition to clinical trials, as well as details of its commercialization initiatives.
IGC has come well off its recent highs and the company's valuation is attractive when compared to its competitors. The company is focused on several high growth opportunities as well as on developing intellectual property for the treatment of life altering or life threatening conditions.  
IGC continues to strengthen its management team and has made strategic alliances to support its initiatives. We continue to view IGC as a company to watch and you can learn more by downloading our report here.

NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / July 10, 2017 /Traders News Source, a leading independent equity research and corporate access firm focused on small and mid-cap public companies is issuing a comprehensive report with no obligation on India Globalization Capital Inc. (NYSE MKT:IGC) develops intellectual property for the treatment of life-altering or life-threatening conditions, through its research on phytocannabinoid therapies, in the United States. Presently IGC is focusing more on development of cannabis-based therapies to treat cachexia, nausea, vomiting, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, PTSD, and other life-altering conditions
In 2017 Medicare and Medicaid alone are expected to spend $175 billion on patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's. There are currently over 5.3 million Americans with Alzheimer's (AD). The cost of Alzheimer's has increased significantly and is expected to continue to surge higher. The number of patients is expected to double over the next 20 years and the direct costs are expected to exceed $450 billion per year in the next 12 years. There is still no accepted cure for Alzheimer's disease.
During June 2017, IGC announced that it has entered into a definitive license agreement with the University of South Florida making it an exclusive licensee of the U.S. patent filing entitled "THC as a Potential Therapeutic Agent for Alzheimer's Disease."By acquiring this patent filing, IGC is protecting a potential cannabis-based blockbuster treatment for America's most expensive disease.

In the past few years, research around cannabis has grown. Clinical trials have begun to reflect that side effects of THC and other cannabis products are tolerable to patients and reduce with time. There is trial data highlighting that, at proper doses, cannabinoids have positive side effects for Alzheimer's patients, such as a reduction in delusions and mood disorders.
The research on the effect of THC on Alzheimer's patients' cognitive function is also validated in two papers. One, published by the Salk Institute in 2016, validated the University of South Florida's finding that low doses of THC break up amyloid-beta plaques on neurons.Another, published this year in Nature, confirmed the therapeutic promise, showing that cognitive function was restored in aged mice, which were provided low doses of THC. The company is aggressively focusing on assembling a strong development team and a primary pipeline of four major products addressing large markets and possible blockbuster indications utilizing cannabis-based therapies.

You've probably heard this before.
As early as 2008, several reports, including one published in Molecular Pharmaceutics, began proposing various therapeutic pathways by which cannabinoids could treat Alzheimer’s Disease patients, but none were proven.
In 2014, a group of scientists made a breakthrough. The conclusions of their preclinical study were published in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease, under the title “The Potential Therapeutic Effects of THC on Alzheimer's Disease."
Put simply, "the paper argued that therapeutic, low [non-psychoactive] doses of THC (one of the main chemical compounds present in marijuana) could directly bind to a protein called amyloid-beta, preventing its aggregation and thereby slowing down the formation of amyloid-beta plaques around neurons," Dr. Chuanhai Cao, a professor of neurology and pharmacy at the University of South Florida Byrd Institute for Alzheimer’s and lead researcher on the publication, told Benzinga.
Cannabis executive and India Globalization Capital, Inc.(NYSE: IGC) CEO Ram Mukunda said, "In Alzheimer’s Disease, beta-amyloid aggregates into a plaque-like substance that builds around the neurons and disrupts communication between them. So of course, if low-doses of THC can break up those plaques and prevent them from forming in the first place, it's a huge breakthrough.”

Moving Forward
While the results of the aforementioned studies were promising, two issues remained. As one of the co-authors of the 2014 paper warned, “It's important to keep in mind that just because a drug may be effective, doesn’t mean it can be safely used by anyone.” The evidence was still regarded as “anecdotal” by the scientific community, and conducting more thorough research often proved highly challenging due to the illegality of cannabis around the world.
In the past few years, research around cannabis has grown. Diverse clinical trials have begun to show that the side effects of THC and other cannabis compounds are tolerable to most patients and diminish over time. There is trial data showing that, at proper doses, cannabinoids have positive side effects for Alzheimer’s patients, such as a reductions in delusions and mood disorders.
The breakthrough research on the effect of THC for Alzheimer’s patients' cognitive function has also been validated in at least two papers.
One paper, published by the Salk Institute in 2016, directly validated the University of South Florida’s finding that low doses of THC break up amyloid-beta plaques on neurons. Another paper, published this year in Nature, confirmed the therapeutic promise, showing that cognitive function was restored in old mice who were given low doses of THC.

Getting Funded
Not surprisingly, soon after discovering the pathway by which low-dose THC binds to amyloid beta plaques and prevents them from aggregating on neurons, the University of South Florida filed a patent for that mechanism with the title "THC as a Potential Therapeutic Agent for Alzheimer’s Disease."
After months of negotiations with the University of South Florida, India Globalization Capital bought the exclusive rights to the U.S. patent filing, thereby "protecting a potential cannabis-based blockbuster treatment for America’s most expensive disease."
"What IGC is going to do with this patent is take it to clinical trials," Mukunda said. "We have productized it, and there is more than sufficient evidence. So, now we are now talking to several different places to see where we can begin clinical testing on the path to FDA approval."
The company plans to test a few other endpoints for THC and Alzheimer's, setting itself up as the only player with a strategy to take a cannabis-based Alzheimer's drug to market. They're still in need of additional funding.
Other companies like GW Pharmaceuticals PLC- ADR (NASDAQ: GWPH), Zynerba Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ: ZYNE) and Insys Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ: INSY) are working on the treatment of other ailments like epilepsy, glaucoma and tumor cells with marijuana.
"[W]e are the only ones working on Alzheimer's,” Mukunda said.

This is why India globalization capital should have investors attention



 





      Submitted by Marijuana News on Mon, 07/17/2017 - 09:10    

Download our full report on India Globalization Capital HERE
Marijuana is the fastest growing industry in the world and the industry is just getting started.  
From Canada to Australia and Mexico to Germany, the legal marijuana industry continues to grow and is already a multi-billion-dollar market.
Marijuana is becoming big business and the industry’s rapid growth has led to the creation of new high-growth sub-industries. Although there are numerous opportunities around the sale of legal cannabis, we believe the greatest and most profitable opportunities can be found on the biotech and healthcare side of the industry.
Biotech Beneficiaries of the Marijuana Movement 
The biotech sector will be one of the greatest beneficiaries of the legal cannabis movement and we have already identified several leaders focused on this opportunity.
Marijuana is medicine. Biotech firms focused on developing treatments that are derived from marijuana have been successful. GW Pharmaceuticals’ Sativex product is derived from cannabis and treats patients with Multiple Sclerosis. Currently, Sativex is being sold in 27 countries.
Biotech stocks do not trade like your normal investment. While companies like Apple (APPL) and Ford (F) tend to trade on earnings and revenue, biotech companies trade on FDA data and approvals.
A Biotech Firm to Watch 
Last week, NYSE-traded India Globalization Capital, Inc. (IGC) announced its fiscal year 2017 financial results. The company is developing a product portfolio of phytocannabinoid-based therapies through cutting edge research for the treatment of a wide range of therapeutic indications.
In response to the earnings report, IGC CEO Ram Mukunda said, “In fiscal 2017, our major accomplishments include the advancement of our phytocannabinoid patent filing portfolio to large market indications. And in order to keep this focus on the medical cannabis industry, we disposed of our low-margin iron ore and electronic trading businesses, and retired about 10% of our outstanding common stock; thus reducing revenue, PP&E, and stockholder’s equity.  We firmly believe that this planned strategic move positions our company for growth in one of the fastest growing industries in America.”
Focused on Indications with Large Addressable Markets
IGC is focused on developing treatments for indications including neuropathic and cancer pain, epilepsy, end of life supportive care, adjunctive supportive therapies of chronic neurological and oncological diagnosis, which are life altering or life threatening.
Much of IGC’s value is derived from its intellectual property and previously filed patents. In 2014, the company filed a patent for IGC-501 and IGC is currently finalizing the product development by conducting anecdotal testing. Later that year, IGC filed a patent for IGC-504
In February 2017, IGC filed a patent for IGC-506 which is used to treat eating disorders. The company expects to file an additional patent to finalize these products later this year while advancing its refractory epilepsy treatment for dogs and cats (IGC-505 and IGC-503).

Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.

Cannabis Industry Outline — IGC, Inc. 

























































Cannabis HistoryAn understanding of the subspecies of the cannabis plant is imperative for a well-rounded comprehension of the history of cannabis and the role it plays in today’s modern era. Cannabis sativa, often described as “marijuana,” has psychoactive properties. On the contrary, Cannabis sativa L., commonly referred to as “hemp,” is a non-psychoactive form of cannabis. Further psychoactive species of cannabis are found in Cannabis indica and Cannabis ruderalis. Notably, however, Cannabis ruderalis is rarely used recreationally due to low Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content; these strains are high in the cannabinoid Cannabidiol (CBD), and hence are often used by medical users. Cannabis has often been described as a plant that follows humans. It is perhaps for this reason that the history of cannabis is extensive and dates back thousands of years. In fact, widespread belief exists that Bible verses such as Genesis 1:29-31, which states “[b]ehold, I have given you...Full TextCurrent State of AffairsIn a recent CNN interview with Dr. Sanjay Gupta as part of "Weed 3", President Barack Obama was asked “[t]here is a bill on the floor of the Senate now, proposing that marijuana get rescheduled from Schedule 1 (I) to Schedule 2 (II) – saying it has no medicinal benefit to possible medicinal benefit. Do you support that?” President Obama responded: You know, I think I'd have to take a look at the details, but I’m on record as saying that not only do I think carefully prescribed medical use of marijuana may in fact be appropriate and we should follow the science as opposed to ideology on this issue, but I’m also on record as saying that the more we treat some of these issues related to drug abuse from a public-health model and not just from an incarceration model, the better off we’re going to be. The significance of this statement by President Obama should not be underestimated; it is indicative of the constantly changing attitudes towards medical and recreational cannabis regulation across the nation. Currently, 23 states and... Full TextCannabis Politics and Overview of Bills in CongressAttitudes towards cannabis have transformed substantially across the U.S. Support for cannabis legalization is rapidly outpacing opposition; 53 percent of Americans believe cannabis should be made legal, compared with 44 percent supporting illegality of cannabis. However, not all segments of society support legalization. Approximately 39 percent of Republicans support legalization, compared to 63 percent of Democrats. Opposition to legalization is much higher among those aged 65 and older, and among Hispanics than non-Hispanic whites or blacks.49 Majorities across nearly all partisan and demographic groups believe possession of small amounts of cannabis should not result in jail time. Furthermore, approximately 69 percent of Americans believe alcohol...Full TextMarket SizeThe Colorado cannabis market is estimated to consume between 104.2 and 157.9 metric tons (MT) per year, accounting for Colorado residents and visitors.75 These numbers have been suggested using demand- and supply-oriented models limiting scope only to those aged 21 and over, although use among under-21s is widespread. Notably, demand-oriented formulae have been favored across the board for various reasons, including the lack of availability of data when using a supply-side approach. For this reason, discussions of this segment will adhere to a demand-based approach. In a demand-oriented approach, the number of users and the quantity of cannabis consumed by various users are estimated over a specified period of time, typically one month. Users are then subdivided based on frequency of use per month. Furthermore, the quantity demanded is tallied based upon dosage estimates, which can vary widely. Whilst frequency of cannabis use is easily ascertainable from survey reports, quantities consumed are...Full TextObstacles Faced by the IndustryBanking is likely the single most precarious issue for the legal cannabis industry. Since cannabis is still listed under CSA as a Schedule 1 (I) substance, it remains a federal-level crime to use, possess, and distribute it. This triggers anti-money laundering laws for banks. The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), enforced by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), requires banks to monitor customer accounts for suspicious activity associated with crime and terrorism. BSA requires banks to investigate their customers thoroughly and neither negligently nor knowingly conduct business with those acting illegally. FinCEN requires that financial institutions file Suspicious Activity reports (SAR) with the federal government when they know or suspect that an account holder is...Full Text

Dogs and Cats — IGC, Inc. 

























































ConvulsionsSeizures in dogs and cats are often caused by abnormal brain activity. They can be subtle or cause violent convulsions. Some seizures only occur once, but repeated seizures require treatment to prevent larger areas of the brain from becoming affected.Our strategyIGC has applied for a U.S patent based on a novel therapy using cannabinoid extracts. The therapy is administered, using a variety of delivery technologies, for indications in mammals such as dogs and cats. The therapy may also be useful in humans.  We expect to conduct metabolic profiling and apply to the FDA for trials.

THC and CBD — IGC, Inc. 

























































StrainsCannabis is grown in many strains. Each strain has a different level or ratio of cannabinoids that are a class of compounds that act on the cannabinoid receptors. Phytocannabinoids are naturally occurring cannabinoids found in the cannabis plant. There are over 60 different cannabinoids that have been isolated from the cannabis plant that exhibit varied effects. The role of most of these cannabinoids is yet to be fully understood.Delta 9 THCThe most commonly known, studied, and characterized cannabinoids are Tetrahydrocannabinol or THC, and Cannabidiol or CBD. THC (or its main isomer Delta-9 THC) was first isolated by Israeli scientists in 1964. It is responsible for the psychotropic effect (“high”) reported by cannabis users. Its synthetic form is prescribed in the U.S. and Canada under the brand name Marinol. The active ingredient Dronabinol (synthetic Delta-9 THC) is a light- yellow resinous oil that is formulated in sesame oil and administered in capsules. It is used to treat nausea and vomiting caused by cancer chemotherapy and  loss of appetite and weight loss in HIV patients.Cannabinoid Medicinal Properties






Source: http://loproconsulting.com/



CBD & Charlotte's WebBased on the strain of the cannabis plant, as much as 40% of the plant’s extract is cannabidiol or CBD. This phytocannabinoid appears to have a wider scope in medical applications than THC, which has attracted much more media attention. Unlike THC, CBD has no psychotropic effects. Though it has not been scientifically tested, CBD is believed (and has been anecdotally shown) to have various anti-psychotic, neuroprotective, anti-convulsive, anxiety-reductive, and anti-depressive properties. (Charlotte’s web for example is one of the high profile strains of cannabis that has a higher ratio of CBD to THC). Like the marijuana plant, the hemp plant is also a good source of CBD, and the hemp extract does not contain THC.LigandsTHC and CBD and other cannabinoids act as ligands. Imagine a receptor as a docking station and the class of ligands, small molecules with special properties, as little computers that dock with the docking station. The effect of this docking is to activate the receptor in a prescribed way, which then sets off the downstream biological behavior. Ligands can activate receptors positively (full agonists) or negatively (inverse agonists). Phytocannabinoids (like endocannabinoids) are ligands that are considered to be partial agonists as they play a milder modulatory role.ResearchMuch of the research focuses on discovering ligands that can interact with receptors associated with particular disorders. Phytocannabinoids are more interesting because they do more than interact with receptors. They interact with a range of cellular pathways that are implicated in cancer and other diseases. Thus the elevated interest in using phytocannabinoid based drugs.Our StrategyIGC’s strategy is to work with our network of specialists to discover novel applications of phytocannabinoids for pharmaceutical and nutraceutical therapies and products. Our focus is less on discovering ligands or ligand-receptor interactions and entirely on therapies that activate multiple receptors, pathways, and processes.

Zacks Rank:



 




Style Scores:



NA Value | NA Growth | NA Momentum | NA VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.
