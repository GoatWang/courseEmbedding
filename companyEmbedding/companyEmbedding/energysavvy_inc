The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

See open positions
Meet the Team





Talented people, making a difference
Utilities worldwide spend almost $30 billion a year to help their customers save money and energy. EnergySavvy gives them a greater impact. 
Our hiring bar is high since every person and their work is critical to our mission and the company’s success. We have and need all sorts of skills to create a team, a product and a company that’s much more than the sum of its parts.
And EnergySavvy is proud to be recognized as one of Washington’s Best Workplaces two years in a row by Puget Sound Business Journal, honored with a Tech Impact Award from Seattle Business Magazine, and thrilled to be named to the Global Cleantech 100.
  
















                    Our team is united by a passion to power the world efficiently. Great software is how we do it. Ready to join us?
                


                    We search far and wide for great talent. Recently we met energy and technology-minded folks in Seattle. We gave away some free cupcakes to boot.
                





Life at EnergySavvy

Why you’ll love working here


Compensation
Our startup ramen days are past — Competitive compensation, stock options, 401k.



Lunch on us
Catered lunches every day and a well-stocked kitchen with a mountain of snacks and drinks.



Creative space
Our collaborative office features an open cube-free layout, high ceilings, natural light, and lots of standing desks.



Fun times

Work/life balance
We work hard and have high expectations, but death marches suck. It takes balance and rest to do great work.



Time off
Paid holidays, paid time off, and a paid week between Christmas and New Years. Plus personal days when you need them.



Healthcare
We all get sick sometimes. Comprehensive health plan, optional HSA, and sick days when you need them.
