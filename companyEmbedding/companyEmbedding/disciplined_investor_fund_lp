Pentagram Investment Partners, LLC







Executive 
            Summary
Founded in 2001 in Boston, Pentagram Investment 
            Partners, LLC is an NFA and CFTC registered asset management company 
            specializing in alternative investments. Pentagram Investment 
            Partners manages several funds (the Pentagram Fund, LP and the 
			Pentagram Equity Fund, LP) which are run on a global macro basis, as well 
            as separately managed accounts.

Quincunx Management, LLC, an affiliate, is the 
			investment manager of the Pentagram Offshore Fund, Ltd., a Cayman 
			domiciled fund which is also run on the same global macro basis.  

 Perspective
Pentagram offers clients the expertise of a 
            management group with proven successful experience in leveraged and 
            non-leveraged products. We believe in offering focused investment 
            products in alternative and more traditional asset classes with a 
            total return orientation, developed after comprehensive analysis of 
            the global marketplace.
Successful investment management demands that 
            experienced and insightful specialists dedicate themselves in three 
            distinct areas.


The development of an exceptionally clear vision of 
              opportunities and risks in the global markets arena.

The creation of a disciplined investment process and a 
              culture that promotes stability of personnel and business 
              relationships.
              Effective communication and confidential relationships with 
              a select client base.
 


Investment Management 
            Process

“Knowledge from 
            Information”
Pentagram Investment Partners utilizes a top down investment 
            process that is implemented in three distinct 
            phases:


Quarterly top-down macroeconomic evaluation 
              is conducted based on input from outside Advisors, Wall Street and 
              Private Research, and select global macro economic 
              indicators.

Identified themes are tested against input 
              from trend following technical models provided by a consultancy 
              agreement with Warner Financial Select.

Portfolio is constructed and managed within 
              prescribed volatility tolerances.

Index funds could help lower long-term costs
Get the high quality and low costs you'd expect from the company that introduced indexing to individual investors.
What are index mutual funds?



Instead of hiring fund managers to actively select which stocks or bonds the fund will hold, an index fund buys all (or a representative sample) of the securities in a specific index, like the S&P 500 Index.The goal of an index fund is to track the performance of a specific market benchmark as closely as possible. That's why you may hear it referred to as a "passively managed" fund.

Index funds offer built-in benefits








Low costs
Because index funds hold investments until the index itself changes, they generally have lower management and transaction costs.
 




Lower risk through broader diversification
Some index funds give you exposure to potentially thousands of securities in a single fund.
 




Tax efficiency
Broad index funds generally don't trade as much as actively managed funds might, so they're typically generating less taxable income, which reduces the drag on your investments.
 
Compare index funds vs. actively managed funds 

Could actively managed funds help you beat the market?

Read more about what you should consider when choosing an index fund


You can get an index fund anywhere—why Vanguard?








We started the indexing revolution
Vanguard launched the first index fund for individual investors in 1976, and we've been fine-tuning both our benchmark selections and tracking skills ever since.Today, we have more than 60 unique funds that track indexes across the bond and stock markets, both U.S. and international, as well as sector-specific areas of the markets.
See a complete list of Vanguard index funds 

 




We've made it our business to keep your costs low
The average Vanguard index fund expense ratio is 71% less than the industry average.*
See the difference low-cost mutual funds can make 

See how Admiral™ Shares help lower your costs even more 

 


Low-cost investing for everyone



Our passion for low costs will always be our driving force. When others take notice, expense ratios fall more broadly. Everyone wins!
Learn more about The Vanguard Effect™


How would index funds fit into your portfolio?



Because of their low costs, broader diversification, and tax efficiency, index funds could be appropriate for any portion of your portfolio. In fact, the right balance of four of our broadest index funds could give you a complete portfolio, with full exposure to U.S. and international stock and bond markets.Get details on:

	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. Bond funds are subject to the risk that an issuer will fail to make payments on time and that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates or negative perceptions of an issuer's ability to make payments. Investments in stocks issued by non-U.S. companies are subject to risks including country/regional risk, which is the chance that political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions; and currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Funds that concentrate on a relatively narrow market sector face the risk of higher share-price volatility. Past performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.
	Vanguard provides services to the Vanguard funds and ETFs at cost.

footnote***The "Money 50" list published in the January/February 2017 Investor's Guide of Money magazine is based on mutual funds and ETFs that are low-cost and produce long-term returns that match or beat their benchmarks. Past performance cannot be used to predict future returns. Fund share prices will fluctuate, so investors could lose money if they sell when prices have fallen.
You must buy and sell Vanguard ETF Shares through a broker like Vanguard Brokerage Services (we offer them commission-free) or through another broker (you may incur commissions). See the Vanguard Brokerage Services commission and fee schedules for limits. Vanguard ETF Shares aren't redeemable directly with the issuing fund other than very large aggregations worth millions of dollars. Like stocks, ETFs are subject to market volatility. When buying or selling an ETF, you'll pay or receive the current market price, which may be more or less than net asset value.

Vanguard balanced funds


100% of our low-cost balanced funds performed better than their peer-group averages over the past 10 years.*




Get a mix of stocks and bonds in one fund
Combine the potential for income and growth



Balanced mutual funds invest in both bonds, which focus primarily on income, and stocks, which aim for investment growth.

Add stability to your portfolio



The bond portion of the fund helps offset the risks associated with the stock portion—providing you with a "balanced" investment.

Automatically maintain your asset mix



You never have to rebalance a balanced fund—it's done for you automatically. Some funds maintain a set asset mix, while others grow more conservative over time.

Spread out your exposure to risk



By potentially holding hundreds—sometimes thousands—of bonds and stocks in a single balanced fund, you get more diversification than you would buying individual bonds and stocks.

How to choose a balanced fund



Picking a Vanguard balanced fund generally depends on whether you're investing for a specific goal, like retirement, or you have another goal in mind.

Target Retirement Funds



If you're investing for retirement, you can get a complete portfolio in a single fund with a Vanguard Target Retirement Fund. Simply choose a fund based on the date you plan to retire or your current age, and the fund will gradually grow more conservative the closer you get to retirement.

LifeStrategy Funds



If you'd prefer a fund that maintains a set asset mix, a LifeStrategy® Fund can help you reach other financial goals.

Managed Payout Fund



If you're looking to generate income in retirement, Vanguard Managed Payout Fund** might be appropriate for you.

Traditional balanced funds

footnote**Vanguard Managed Payout Fund is protected by U.S. Patent Nos. 8,180,695 and 8,185,464.
	Investments in Target Retirement Funds are subject to the risks of their underlying funds. The year in the fund name refers to the approximate year (the target date) when an investor in the fund would retire and leave the workforce. The fund will gradually shift its emphasis from more aggressive investments to more conservative ones based on its target date. An investment in a Target Retirement Fund is not guaranteed at any time, including on or after the target date.
	Each LifeStrategy Fund invests in 4 broadly diversified Vanguard funds and is subject to the risks associated with those underlying funds.
	The Managed Payout Fund is not guaranteed to achieve its investment objectives, is subject to loss, and some of its distributions may be treated in part as a return of capital. The dollar amount of the fund's monthly cash distributions could go up or down substantially from one year to the next and over time. It is also possible for the fund to suffer substantial investment losses and simultaneously experience additional asset reductions as a result of its distributions to shareholders under its managed-distribution policy. An investment in the fund could lose money over short, intermediate, or even long periods of time because the fund allocates its assets worldwide across different asset classes and investments with specific risk and return characteristics. Diversification does not necessarily ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. The fund is proportionately subject to the risks associated with its underlying funds, which may invest in stocks (including stocks issued by REITs), bonds, cash, inflation-linked investments, commodity-linked investments, long/short market-neutral investments, and leveraged absolute return investments.
	The Managed Payout Fund may not be appropriate for all investors. For example, depending on the time horizon, retirement income needs, and tax bracket, an investment in the Managed Payout Fund might not be appropriate for younger investors not currently in retirement, in IRAs or other tax-advantaged accounts for those investors under 59½, or for participants in employer-sponsored plans. Investors who hold the Managed Payout Fund within a tax-advantaged retirement account should consult their tax advisors to discuss tax consequences that could result if payments are distributed from their core account prior to age 59½ or if they plan to use the Managed Payout Fund, in whole or in part, to meet their required minimum distribution (RMD) obligations. Distributions from the Managed Payout Fund are unlikely to precisely match an investor's IRA RMD obligations. In addition, use of the Managed Payout Fund may be restricted in employer-sponsored plans by the terms of the governing plan documents and/or at the discretion of the plan administrator. Review the information carefully with your financial advisor before deciding whether the Managed Payout Fund is right for you.
	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.

Fund Overview
The Grant Park Futures Fund has operated since 1989, a period that includes a wide variety of economic and market cycles. Our experience has taught us there are three concepts to appreciate when considering an investment in managed futures. Grant Park, LP is a multi-advisor commodity pool that invests across global financial and commodity markets.

Managed futures is a divergent asset class and does not operate in a manner that is similar to equity or fixed income funds.


The agnostic nature of price-driven investing allows programs to invest by going long (anticipating prices will rise) or short (anticipating prices will fall). This, in turn, allows for potentially profitable investing when markets are rising or falling.


Globally, managed futures markets are regulated, widely traded, and very liquid.

These factors provide the basis for the diversification and non-correlated performance profile that managed futures can contribute to an investor’s portfolio.
Diversification is the most frequent reason managed futures are added to a portfolio and this represents two different elements - the diversification of a portfolio’s overall returns and the diversification of a portfolio’s overall volatility.
The Grant Park Futures Fund track record since inception illustrates the periods during which managed futures have performed similar to or differently than equities.

​Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
 
The Fund has performed positively for the majority of the period since inception; an individual investor may experience different results depending on their investment holding period.
There have been three “crisis” periods during the Fund’s existence.
During the Tech Bubble (2002) and the Financial Crisis (2008), the Fund provided downside protection, positive returns and reduced overall portfolio volatility while equity markets violently corrected.
During the Liquidity Bubble (2010 - 2015), the implementation of quantitative easing fueled extraordinary growth in equities, created, in part, by the excessive liquidity central banks created with zero- and negative-interest rates. During this unprecedented period, managed futures have made limited positive contribution to a portfolio’s performance but did contribute to a reduction in overall portfolio volatility.

The normalization of market-driven interest rates began fitfully during 2015 and is likely to slowly continue for the immediate future. We believe this will enable managed futures performance to return to its historical performance profile.
The Grant Park Futures Fund invests on the same core beliefs the Fund has held since inception:
Markets move in cycles.
The preservation of investor capital through rigorous risk management is equally important as is the pursuit of potentially profitable trading opportunities.
Diversification of CTAs within the Fund provides the broadest manner to achieve performance results that are representative of the managed futures asset class.
Active risk management focused on monitoring all aspects of the Fund’s trading, execution, and financial reporting are essential to retaining the limited partners’ trust.

Commodity Trading Advisers
The CTAs who invest on the Fund’s behalf invest across the global managed futures markets and typically execute their investment strategies utilizing rigorous, systematic investment processes and disciplined or quantitative trading models.
