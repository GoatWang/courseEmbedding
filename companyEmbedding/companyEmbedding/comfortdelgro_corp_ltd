Corporate Profile



ComfortDelGro is one of the largest land transport companies in the world with a global workforce, a global shareholder base and a global outlook.
The Group was formed on 29 March 2003 through the merger of two land transport companies - Comfort Group and DelGro Corporation. Both had started out in the 1970s and had, by the time of the merger, grown to become successful listed land transport companies. Following the merger, ComfortDelGro has expanded significantly and now operates in seven countries and has a global fleet of over 44,700 vehicles.
ComfortDelGro’s businesses include bus, taxi, rail, car rental and leasing, automotive engineering services, inspection and testing services, driving centre, insurance broking services and outdoor advertising.
Apart from being the market leader in Singapore, ComfortDelGro has a significant overseas presence. The Group’s operations currently extend from the United Kingdom and Ireland to Australia, Vietnam, Malaysia, as well as across 11 cities in China, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenyang and Chengdu.
