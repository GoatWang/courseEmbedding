Investor Relations














	We are a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of first-in-class therapies for the treatment of patients with glaucoma and other diseases of the eye.

	Glaucoma is a progressive and highly individualized disease, in which elevated levels of intraocular pressure, or IOP, are associated with damage to the optic nerve, which results in irreversible vision loss and potentially blindness. Patients may suffer the adverse effects of glaucoma across a wide range of IOP levels. Our product candidates, Rhopressa™ (netarsudil ophthalmic solution) 0.02%, and Roclatan™ (netarsudil/latanoprost ophthalmic solution) 0.02%/0.005%, are once-daily eye drops that, if approved, will provide eye-care professionals with the first novel intraocular pressure-lowering mechanisms of action, or MOA, to treat glaucoma in nearly 20 years.

Aerie Pharmaceuticals Reports Positive Roclatan™ (netarsudil/latanoprost ophthalmic solution) 0.02%/0.005% Phase 3 12-month Topline Safety Results | Business Wire
























































Aerie Pharmaceuticals Reports Positive Roclatan™ 
      (netarsudil/latanoprost ophthalmic solution) 0.02%/0.005% Phase 3 
      12-month Topline Safety Results




Roclatan™ Successfully Demonstrates a Positive Safety Profile and 
      Efficacy Levels Consistent with Previously Reported Results


Conference Call and Webcast Today, July 19, at 5:00 p.m. ET






July 19, 2017 04:01 PM Eastern Daylight Time



IRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:AERI), a clinical-stage 
      pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development, and 
      commercialization of first-in-class therapies for the treatment of 
      patients with glaucoma and other diseases of the eye, today reported the 
      successful 12-month safety results of the Company’s “Mercury 1” Phase 3 
      registration trial for its fixed-dose combination product candidate, 
      Roclatan™. Mercury 1 is a 12-month safety and efficacy trial which 
      included a 90-day efficacy endpoint. As previously reported, both 
      Mercury 1 and Mercury 2, the Company’s second Phase 3 registration trial 
      of Roclatan™, achieved their 90-day primary efficacy endpoints of 
      demonstrating statistical superiority over each of its components at all 
      measured time points, including Aerie product candidate Rhopressa™ 
      (netarsudil ophthalmic solution) 0.02%, and market-leading prostaglandin 
      analogue (PGA) latanoprost, all of which were dosed once daily in the 
      evening.
    


      The purpose of the 12-month Mercury 1 study is to provide adequate 
      safety data for an expected NDA (new drug application) submission to the 
      FDA in the first half of 2018. While not primary endpoints, the study 
      also included measurements of intraocular pressure (IOP) at 8 a.m., 10 
      a.m. and 4 p.m. at months six, nine and twelve. The 12-month safety and 
      efficacy results of Mercury 1 were consistent with the 90-day results 
      from the Mercury 1 and Mercury 2 trials, each of which evaluated 
      patients with maximum baseline IOPs ranging from above 20 to below 36 
      mmHg (millimeters of mercury). Management will host a conference call 
      with accompanying slides to discuss these results at 5:00 p.m. Eastern 
      Time (ET) today. The accompanying slides will be available at Aerie’s 
      website, aeriepharma.com.
    

Roclatan™ 12-Month Safety and Efficacy Highlights for Mercury 1



        Safety results for Roclatan™ for the 12-month period were consistent 
        with those observed for the 90-day efficacy period in the trial. There 
        were no new adverse events that developed following the initial 90-day 
        period, and there were no drug-related serious or systemic adverse 
        events.
      

        As expected, the most common adverse event for Roclatan™ was 
        conjunctival hyperemia, or eye redness, which was observed in 
        approximately 60 percent of patients, of which approximately 70 
        percent was determined to be mild by biomicroscopy. As observed in 
        previous trials, hyperemia was sporadic, with only approximately 10 
        percent of patients with hyperemia across each physician visit during 
        the 12-month period.
      

        The other Roclatan™ adverse events observed during the 12-month trial 
        are consistent with those observed during the initial 90-day efficacy 
        period, including conjunctival hemorrhages (subconjunctival petechiae) 
        and cornea verticillata.
      

        In addition to the primary efficacy endpoint at 90 days, IOPs were 
        measured at 8 a.m., 10 a.m., and 4 p.m. at months six, nine and 
        twelve. Roclatan™ IOP lowering exceeded that of both latanoprost and 
        Rhopressa™ in a range from 1 to 3 mmHg. Levels of IOP 
        lowering were consistent with those observed in the Mercury 1 and 
        Mercury 2 90-day efficacy results for all arms of the study. Roclatan™ 
        also demonstrated consistent levels of IOP lowering across the 
        12-month study period.
      

        Roclatan™ reduced mean diurnal IOPs to 16 mmHg or lower in 60 percent 
        of patients, a significantly higher percentage than observed in the 
        two comparator arms.
      

        The Rhopressa™ arm of the study performed consistently with previous 
        Phase 3 trials from both a safety and efficacy perspective. Rhopressa™ 
        also demonstrated consistent levels of IOP lowering across the 
        12-month study period. At baseline IOPs below 25 mmHg, Rhopressa™ IOP 
        lowering was similar to latanoprost at month 12.
      


      “With these positive 12-month Mercury 1 data, we have again demonstrated 
      the consistent and well-understood performance of Roclatan™ and 
      Rhopressa™ from both a safety and efficacy perspective. Roclatan™ has 
      the potential to become the most efficacious IOP-lowering therapy to 
      enter the market, if approved, bolstered by an overall favorable safety 
      and tolerability profile. We continue to expect to submit our Roclatan™ 
      NDA (new drug application) in the first half of 2018,” said Vicente 
      Anido, Jr., Ph.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at Aerie.
    

      Dr. Anido continued, “This data readout represents the last in our 
      series of Phase 3 trials for both Roclatan™ and Rhopressa™ for approval 
      in the U.S., and we are now actively engaged in preparations for the 
      expected Rhopressa™ commercialization next year.”
    

      Richard A. Lewis, M.D., Aerie’s Chief Medical Officer, added, “As a 
      clinician, I am very excited about the responder analysis data for 
      Roclatan™ showing such a profound drop in IOP. We now have a robust 
      understanding of the Roclatan™ safety profile and expect that 
      clinicians will be highly satisfied with the 12-month safety and 
      efficacy data.”
    

About Roclatan™


      Roclatan™ is a once-daily eye drop that combines Rhopressa™, as 
      described below, with latanoprost, a widely prescribed PGA. Based on the 
      Company’s preclinical studies and clinical trials to date, Aerie 
      believes that Roclatan™, if approved, would be the first glaucoma 
      product to lower IOP through all known mechanisms: (i) increasing fluid 
      outflow through the trabecular meshwork, the eye’s primary drain, (ii) 
      increasing fluid outflow through the uveoscleral pathway, the eye’s 
      secondary drain, (iii) reducing fluid production in the eye, and (iv) 
      reducing episcleral venous pressure (EVP). By covering the full spectrum 
      of known IOP-lowering mechanisms, Roclatan™ has the potential to provide 
      a greater IOP-lowering effect than any currently approved glaucoma 
      product.
    

      The first Phase 3 registration trial for Roclatan™, named Mercury 1, is 
      a 12-month safety and efficacy trial, which was just completed and is 
      the subject of this press release. Mercury 1 had a successful 90-day 
      efficacy readout in September 2016. The second Phase 3 registration 
      trial, named Mercury 2, is a 90-day efficacy trial, which reported 
      successful primary efficacy results in May 2017. The topline 90-day 
      efficacy readouts for both Mercury 1 and Mercury 2 demonstrated that 
      Roclatan™ was statistically superior to each of its components, thus 
      achieving their primary clinical endpoints. Aerie expects to submit a 
      Roclatan™ NDA to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
      in the first half of 2018. A third Phase 3 registration trial, named 
      Mercury 3, is expected to commence in Europe in the third quarter of 
      2017. Mercury 3 is not necessary for approval in the U.S., but rather to 
      facilitate regulatory approval and commercialization in Europe.
    

About Rhopressa™


      Rhopressa™ (netarsudil ophthalmic solution) 0.02%, is a novel eye drop 
      that the Company believes, if approved, would become the only once-daily 
      product available that, based on Aerie’s preclinical and clinical 
      studies to date, specifically targets the trabecular meshwork, the eye’s 
      primary fluid drain and the diseased tissue responsible for elevated IOP 
      in glaucoma. Preclinical and clinical studies have also demonstrated 
      that Rhopressa™ lowers episcleral venous pressure, which contributes 
      approximately half of IOP in healthy subjects. Further, based on Aerie’s 
      preclinical studies, Rhopressa™ may provide an additional mechanism that 
      reduces fluid production in the eye and therefore lowers IOP. 
      Biochemically, the active ingredient in Rhopressa™, netarsudil, has been 
      shown in Aerie studies to inhibit both Rho kinase (ROCK) and 
      norepinephrine transporter (NET). Recent preclinical studies have also 
      shown that Rhopressa™ may have disease-modifying properties, including 
      an anti-fibrotic effect of netarsudil on trabecular meshwork cells and 
      the potential to increase perfusion of the trabecular meshwork.
    

      The results of two Phase 3 registration trials (Rocket 2 and Rocket 1) 
      for Rhopressa™ were included in the NDA submission to the FDA in 
      February 2017. There were two additional Phase 3 registration trials for 
      Rhopressa™, named Rocket 3 and Rocket 4. Rocket 3 was a small 12-month 
      safety-only study in Canada that was not necessary for the NDA 
      submission and for which enrollment has been discontinued. Rocket 4, 
      which was successfully completed in April 2017, was designed to provide 
      adequate six-month safety data for regulatory filing purposes in Europe, 
      and was also not necessary for the NDA submission. The 90-day efficacy 
      results from Rocket 4 and Mercury 1, the initial Phase 3 registration 
      trial for Aerie product candidate Roclatan™ (netarsudil/latanoprost 
      ophthalmic solution) 0.02%/0.005%, were also included in the Rhopressa™ 
      NDA submission as supportive. The FDA has set the Prescription Drug User 
      Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date for the completion of the FDA’s review of the 
      Rhopressa™ NDA for February 28, 2018.

U.S. benchmarks digest the July breakout, S&P 500 maintains first support
U.S. stocks are lower early Monday, pressured ahead of a full quarterly earnings calendar, and the Federal Reserve’s latest policy directive, due out Wednesday.  Against this backdrop, each major U.S. benchmark continues to digest the July rally to previously uncharted territory.

Aerie Pharma stock surges 32% on positive late-stage trial results for glaucoma eye drops
Aerie Pharmaceuticals Inc.  shares surged as much as 32% in after hours trade Wednesday after the company said its eye drops intended for glaucoma had positive results in a late-stage clinical trial. If Aerie Pharma sees positive safety results for the Roclatan eye drops in an ongoing 12-month clinical trial, it plans to submit for Food and Drug Administration review in the first half of 2018, it said. The company said it believes that Roclatan, if approved, would be the first glaucoma product to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) -- a condition that commonly can lead to and accompany the eye disease -- through all known mechanisms, having "the potential to provide a greater IOP-lowering effect than any currently approved glaucoma product." The Wednesday results, which were primary efficacy results from a 90-day phase 3 registration trial, included Roclatan having statistical superiority over the two products it combines, or the current leading glaucoma therapy latanoprost and Aerie Pharma's Rhopressa. The most common adverse event was sporadic eye redness, which was reported in about 55% of patients and which most patients said was mild, according to Aerie. Data from the 12-month safety trial is expected in the third quarter of this year. Aerie Pharma shares have dropped 9.1% over the last three months, compared with a 1.6% rise in the S&P 500 .

U.S. benchmarks digest the July breakout, S&P 500 maintains first support
U.S. stocks are lower early Monday, pressured ahead of a full quarterly earnings calendar, and the Federal Reserve’s latest policy directive, due out Wednesday.  Against this backdrop, each major U.S. benchmark continues to digest the July rally to previously uncharted territory.

Aerie Pharma stock surges 32% on positive late-stage trial results for glaucoma eye drops
Aerie Pharmaceuticals Inc.  shares surged as much as 32% in after hours trade Wednesday after the company said its eye drops intended for glaucoma had positive results in a late-stage clinical trial. If Aerie Pharma sees positive safety results for the Roclatan eye drops in an ongoing 12-month clinical trial, it plans to submit for Food and Drug Administration review in the first half of 2018, it said. The company said it believes that Roclatan, if approved, would be the first glaucoma product to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) -- a condition that commonly can lead to and accompany the eye disease -- through all known mechanisms, having "the potential to provide a greater IOP-lowering effect than any currently approved glaucoma product." The Wednesday results, which were primary efficacy results from a 90-day phase 3 registration trial, included Roclatan having statistical superiority over the two products it combines, or the current leading glaucoma therapy latanoprost and Aerie Pharma's Rhopressa. The most common adverse event was sporadic eye redness, which was reported in about 55% of patients and which most patients said was mild, according to Aerie. Data from the 12-month safety trial is expected in the third quarter of this year. Aerie Pharma shares have dropped 9.1% over the last three months, compared with a 1.6% rise in the S&P 500 .

Aerie Pharmaceuticals Reports Positive Roclatan™ (netarsudil/latanoprost ophthalmic solution) 0.02%/0.005% Phase 3 Topline Efficacy Results


RoclatanTM Successfully Achieves Primary

      Efficacy Endpoint in Mercury 1 Study


Conference Call and Webcast Today, September 14, at 5:00 p.m. ET

 IRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:AERI), a clinical-stage

      pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development, and

      commercialization of first-in-class therapies for the treatment of

      glaucoma and other diseases of the eye, today reported the successful

      90-day primary efficacy results of its 12-month Phase 3 "Mercury 1"

      clinical trial for its fixed-dose combination product candidate, RoclatanTM.

      The study achieved its primary efficacy endpoint demonstrating

      statistical superiority over each of its components, including Aerie

      product candidate RhopressaTM (netarsudil ophthalmic

      solution) 0.02%, and market leading prostaglandin analogue (PGA)

      latanoprost, all of which were dosed once daily in the evening. The

      study evaluated patients with maximum baseline intraocular pressures

      (IOPs) ranging from above 20 to below 36 mmHg (millimeters of mercury).

      The IOP-lowering effect of RoclatanTM was 1 to 3 mmHg greater

      than monotherapy with either latanoprost or RhopressaTM

      throughout the duration of the study. Management will host a conference

      call with accompanying slides to discuss these results at 5:00 p.m. ET

      today. The accompanying slides are available at Aerie's web site,

      aeriepharma.com.

    

RoclatanTM Phase 3 Highlights for Mercury 1




        RoclatanTM dosed once daily achieved the primary efficacy

        endpoint of demonstrating statistical superiority over both

        latanoprost and RhopressaTM at the primary endpoint range

        of baseline IOPs from above 20 to below 36 mmHg for each of the nine

        measured time points.

      


        IOPs were measured at 8 a.m., 10 a.m., and 4 p.m. at week 2, week 6,

        and day 90. RoclatanTM IOP lowering exceeded that of

        latanoprost in a range of 1.3 to 2.5 mmHg, and exceeded RhopressaTM

        IOP lowering in a range of 1.8 to 3.0 mmHg. Efficacy levels were

        consistent across the 90-day period for all arms in the study.

      


        RoclatanTM mean diurnal IOP-lowering exceeded that of

        latanoprost by an average across the study duration of 1.9 mmHg and

        exceeded RhopressaTM by 2.6 mmHg.

      


        RoclatanTM reduced mean diurnal IOPs to 16 mmHg or lower in

        61 percent of patients, a significantly higher percentage than

        observed in the comparator arms.

      


        The most common RoclatanTM adverse event was hyperemia, or

        eye redness, which was reported in approximately 50 percent of

        patients, or 30 percent above baseline, and was scored as mild for the

        large majority of these patients. There were no drug-related serious

        adverse events for any of the comparators in the trial.

      


        Aerie will hold an "Investor Day" in New York City on October 5, 2016

        to cover further details from the Mercury 1 trial and to provide a

        general business update.

      



      "We are very pleased by these RoclatanTM 90-day efficacy

      results from the Mercury 1 clinical trial. As expected, the topline

      efficacy demonstrated in this trial clearly reconfirms the potential for

      RoclatanTM to become the most efficacious IOP-lowering

      therapy to enter the market, if approved. If Mercury 1 and 2 are

      successful, we expect to file the NDA for RoclatanTM near

      year-end 2017," said Vicente Anido, Jr., Ph.D., Chairman and Chief

      Executive Officer at Aerie.

    

Dr. Anido continued, "We also noted that the RhopressaTM arm

      demonstrated high levels of efficacy across the full range of baseline

      IOPs studied, and the efficacy was maintained for the 90-day period.

      Importantly, RhopressaTM demonstrated comparable levels of

      IOP lowering to latanoprost at baseline IOPs ranging from 20 to 25 mmHg

      in Mercury 1. This performance for RhopressaTM is consistent

      with levels observed in the previous Phase 2b trials for RhopressaTM

      and RoclatanTM."

    

Richard A. Lewis, M.D., Aerie's Chief Medical Officer added, "Once-daily

      RoclatanTM has shown a degree of IOP lowering in Mercury 1

      that is quite impressive, especially when considering its ability to

      bring patient pressures down to levels as low as 8 to 14 mmHg. The

      safety profile of RoclatanTM observed thus far in Mercury 1

      points to a safe and tolerable product."

    

About RoclatanTM



      RoclatanTM is a once-daily eye drop that combines RhopressaTM,

      as described below, with latanoprost, a PGA that is the most widely

      prescribed glaucoma drug in the world. Based on our preclinical studies

      and clinical trials, we believe that RoclatanTM, if approved,

      would be the first glaucoma product to lower IOP through all known

      mechanisms: (i) increasing fluid outflow through the trabecular

      meshwork, the eye's primary drain, (ii) increasing fluid outflow through

      the uveoscleral pathway, the eye's secondary drain, (iii) reducing fluid

      production in the eye, and (iv) reducing episcleral venous pressure

      (EVP). By covering the full spectrum of known IOP-lowering mechanisms,

      RoclatanTM has the potential to provide a greater

      IOP-lowering effect than any currently approved glaucoma product.

    


      The first Phase 3 registration trial for RoclatanTM, named

      Mercury 1 is a 12-month safety trial in 718 patients with a 90-day

      efficacy readout, which is the subject of this press release. The

      topline efficacy readout demonstrated that RoclatanTM was

      statistically superior to each of its components. The second Phase 3

      registration trial, named Mercury 2, is a 90-day efficacy trial that

      commenced in March 2016, and a third Phase 3 registration trial, named

      Mercury 3, is expected to commence in Europe in the first half of 2017.

      Mercury 3 is not necessary for approval in the U.S., but rather to

      facilitate regulatory approval and commercialization in Europe.

    

About RhopressaTM



      RhopressaTM (netarsudil ophthalmic solution) 0.02%, is a

      novel eye drop that we believe, if approved, would become the only

      once-daily product available that, based on Aerie's preclinical studies,

      specifically targets the trabecular meshwork, the eye's primary fluid

      drain and the diseased tissue responsible for elevated IOP in glaucoma.

      Preclinical studies have also demonstrated that RhopressaTM

      lowers episcleral venous pressure, which contributes approximately half

      of IOP in healthy subjects. Further, based on Aerie's preclinical

      studies, RhopressaTM provides an additional mechanism that

      reduces fluid production in the eye and therefore lowers IOP.

      Biochemically, RhopressaTM has been shown in Aerie studies to

      inhibit both Rho Kinase (ROCK) and norepinephrine transporter (NET).

      Recent preclinical studies have also shown that RhopressaTM

      may have disease-modifying properties, including an anti-fibrotic effect

      on the trabecular meshwork and the potential to increase perfusion of

      the trabecular meshwork. Preclinical research is also currently underway

      to evaluate the potential neuroprotective benefits of RhopressaTM.

    


      The results of two Phase 3 registration trials (Rocket 2 and Rocket 1)

      for RhopressaTM were included in a NDA filing submitted to

      the FDA in the third quarter of 2016. Rocket 2 represents the pivotal

      trial, and Rocket 1 is supportive. There are two additional Phase 3

      trials currently underway for RhopressaTM, named Rocket 3 and

      Rocket 4. Rocket 3 is a 12-month safety-only study in Canada that is not

      needed for the NDA filing. Rocket 4 is designed to provide adequate

      six-month safety data for regulatory filing purposes in Europe, and is

      also not needed for the NDA filing.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

					Full Description



Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc., incorporated on June 22, 2005, is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company. The Company is engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of therapies for the treatment of patients with glaucoma and other diseases of the eye. The Company's product candidates include Rhopressa (netarsudil ophthalmic solution) 0.02% (Rhopressa), and Roclatan (netarsudil/latanoprost ophthalmic solution) 0.02%/0.005% (Roclatan). The Company's product candidates are designed to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension.RhopressaThe Company's product, Rhopressa, is a once-daily eye drop. Rhopressa inhibits Rho kinase (ROCK), and the norepinephrine transporter (NET), which are both biochemical targets for lowering IOP. By inhibiting these targets, Rhopressa reduces IOP through the mechanisms of action (MOAs), including through ROCK inhibition, it increases fluid outflow through the trabecular meshwork (TM), which accounts for approximately 80% of fluid drainage from the eye; also through ROCK inhibition, it reduces episcleral venous pressure (EVP), which represents the pressure of the blood in the episcleral veins of the eye where eye fluid drains into the bloodstream, and through NET inhibition, it may potentially reduce the production of eye fluid.RoclatanThe Company's second product candidate, Roclatan, is a once-daily, fixed-dose combination of Rhopressa and latanoprost, which is a prescribed drug for the treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma. The Company is engaged in conducting Phase III clinical trial for Roclatan.The Company competes with Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc., Novartis International AG, Allergan, Inc. and Santen Inc.
