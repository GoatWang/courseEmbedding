Linda brings to her work what I can only label as a deep "humanity". She knows what it takes to train leaders in the highly competetive and diverse 21st century workplace. She is insightful, always professional, empathetic, and humorous, not to mention that she does all this at a reasonable cost.
She is extremely creative and posseses an uncanny ability to arrive at the root of the challenge in any given situation.
Linda has been my mentor for many years now and has definitely made my life easier here with her knowledge and expertise. I serve as the Diversity Officer for Mission Health System here in Asheville, North Carolina.  You will not be disappointed!
