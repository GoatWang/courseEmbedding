Overview

After studying architecture and drafting, Michael Carpenter developed a true admiration of design while traveling throughout the remote villages of the Japanese countryside. Many of the private homes he stayed in were built in the traditional post and beam style. The openness of this type of construction creates a useful and certain sense of clarity, which today seems to be more of a modern day necessity.
Since opening his New York business, Michael Carpenter Building & Design, he has incorporated this sense of openness and minimalism with the intense need for maximum storage capacity. When combined with tranquil lines and spaces, these aspects help to ease the hard edges of city dwelling.From BuildZoom: Carpenter, Michael in New York, NY holds a Home Improvement Contractor  license (1222363-DCA) according to the New York license board. Their BuildZoom score of 95 ranks in the top 22% of 77,888 New York licensed contractors.BuildZoom has not verified this license since its expiration date.

December 16, 2015





bathroom remodel



$20,000



25 days













I had a lot of trouble working with Michael. He went way over the projected time frame and became uncommunicative the later the project ran. Since our renovation we've had problems with the grout in our bathroom and toilet installation. We've had to pay for a plumber to fix the toilet and will in the future have to re-grout the entire bathroom. Michael was a headache and his shoddy work will be costing us well into the future.

Great Work







I found Michael through a posting I placed in my Co-Op's intranet. He had renovated another apartment in my building. I was very lucky I was sent this contractor. After meeting with two other contractors, Michael was the most professional, patient, and resourceful person. Throughout his work for me (he did my kitchen, bathroom, and painted the entire apartment), he was clean, prompt, and reliable. He listened to me and worked with my style and budget. When making suggestions, he was tactful (compared to other contractors that were pushy and opinionated). He recommended places for me to shop for what I needed, and patiently answered all of my questions by email or text. He stuck to his timeframe, and completed the job by the date he told me. I highly recommend this guy. It's been a constant "WOW" from every guest I've had over. My place looks great.
