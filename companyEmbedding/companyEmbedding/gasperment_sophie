Sophie Gasperment
Managing director, L'Oreal U.K.


	By  

Emma Hall.
	

	
	
 Published on November 20, 2006. 







		        Sophie Gasperment faces perhaps her biggest challenge yet: The managing director of L'Oreal in the U.K. has to make the $1.2 billion acquisition of the Body Shop chain fit into L'Oreal's extensive portfolio.

Ms. Gasperment's track record since taking over the L'Oreal operation in the U.K. has been impressive. She oversaw the launch of the Men's Expert line in 2005 and watched the male skincare market grow by 50%. L'Oreal went from a 23% share of the market to a 32% share in 2006, making the U.K. L'Oreal's leading country for the Expert line.

She helped make Maybelline Dream Matte Foundation the U.K.'s best-selling foundation and extended it into blush and body shimmer. "When we first saw the product, we thought, 'What the hell is that?' " Ms. Gasperment recalls, calling the packaging "a bulky glass pot with light mousse inside." She says that "When we put it into test, people loved the fact that it was different. The results were outstanding."

She will now play a key role in making the Body Shop deal work. However, the retail chain is still a stand alone business of the L'Oreal Group, and as the acquisition was only completed last July, Ms. Gasperment says it's too early to go into detail about the company's plans.

Ms. Gasperment, 41, stumbled across L'Oreal 20 years ago when she arrived early for an interview with a management consultancy. With 2 hours to kill, she wandered into a L'Oreal presentation to graduates. She loved the speakers' "passion, energy and decisiveness"; interviewed; and had a job a few hours later.

After 13 years at L'Oreal's Paris headquarters, Ms. Gasperment moved to London with her banker husband and their son and daughter, now 13 and 15, when he was offered a job there. (The couple had another daughter, now 1 year old, in London.) Ms. Gasperment became general manager of the L'Oreal Paris brand and was promoted to her current role three years ago.

"Sophie is a great combination-she's smart as hell and demanding but utterly charming," says Rupert Howell, president of  McCann Erickson Europe, Middle East and Africa. "People will do anything for her. She has built up a fantastic team around her and is very good at delegating."

"I put together teams of people with different nationalities and different thinking," Ms. Gasperment says. "It generates the best creative thinking in all areas."

Article excerpt

  Sophie Gasperment Managing director, consumer and professional products division, L'Oreal UK & Ireland.    Sometimes life changes because you happen to be in a certain place at a certain time. That is certainly the case for L'Oreal UK's Sophie Gasperment. The 41-year-old got her first job at the company 20 years ago by chance.    'I had lots of interviews lined up during the university 'milk round' and I was very early for my first interview, for a management consultancy, and they were very late. I had two hours (to kill) and I didn't know what to do. I opened the next door and L'Oreal was doing presentations (to graduates),' Gasperment recalls.    'I just loved the way they were talking about the company - full of passion, energy and decisiveness,' she says. 'So, I listened to the presentation, got an interview at 2pm and by 5pm they had offered me a job.'    Her decisiveness is reflected in all areas of L'Oreal's business. 'You have to be really quick because this industry is very fast-paced,' she notes.    Paris-born and bred, Gasperment moved to London six years ago with her husband and children, then aged six and eight. Since then, the family has embraced the British way of life - even giving the most recent addition to the family, a seven month old daughter, the very English name of Emma - and Gasperment feels fully settled in London. 'I don't plan to move on,' she says.    In her spare time she enjoys taking the family to concerts and music festivals. 'Music in London is so much more accessible than in Paris,' she says. 'It's more relaxed and is of a fantastic quality. Here, you go to a concert because you like music and you are passionate about it.    It is not highbrow like it is in France, or some sort of social display.'    Gasperment also enjoys picking up English colloquialisms and has a small book in which she notes any she finds particularly amusing - favourite entries include 'a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush' and 'not counting your chickens before they are hatched'.    She cites her balance of work and family life as one of her biggest achievements.    'I have been able to thrive professionally and have my family and enjoy seeing them develop,' she says. Her secret may be her insistence that, whatever the day has in store, she sits down for 'a very early breakfast' with her children.    Her favourite part of her job is team-building. …
