House reveals prominent Swann family’s unknown history















A Swann Cigars sign was found underneath the exterior siding of the old Oliva factory building in Ybor City.



































By Paul Guzzo | Times Staff Writer 
Published: March 13, 2015
Updated: March 13, 2015 at 07:29 AM







YBOR CITY — The Swann name is probably most familiar to Tampa residents as the namesake of the 3-mile-long avenue that connects Bayshore and West Shore boulevards, a testament to the family’s work developing the city in its early years.

What hasn’t been so well known is the family’s connection to Ybor City’s role in the early to mid-1900s as the cigar-rolling capital of the world.

That could change now that a huge painted sign that reads “Home of Swann Cigars” was found underneath panels removed from an exterior wall of the former cigar factory on the corner of Palm Avenue and 19th Street. The former factory is being turned into apartments by Ybor City business partners Ariel Quintela and Darryl Shaw.

“Our family back then had their hands in almost every major Tampa industry,” said Mary Brown, the great-granddaughter of Alfred Reuben Swann, the first Swann to live in Tampa. “But they are mostly known for developing Bayshore. So it’s nice they will get recognized for cigars now, too.”









Quintela and Shaw, who are developing property throughout the historic district, said the discovery of the decades-old sign falls in line with their goal of having each of their projects to provide a history lesson.

Their buildings will be named in honor of individuals who played prominent roles in Ybor City’s history. Some developments will contain a small museum open to the public.

The wooden cigar factory will be home to 38 apartments when complete and be named “The Angel Oliva Sr. Building” after its longtime former owner and tobacco distribution giant.

Oliva supplied cigars to many of Tampa’s cigar companies during the prime years of the industry in the city and continues to do so today.

The developers say they will leave the Swann sign on the redeveloped building as homage to the Swann family’s role in Ybor City.

“If our aim is to use our developments as a history lesson; the Swann sign is a great opportunity,” said Quintela.

According to Swann descendant Hank Brown — son of Mary Brown — Swann Cigars were produced from 1926 until 1961.

“Mail-order cigars primarily,” he said. “And they had some pretty famous clients, like Bing Crosby.”

City archives, though, never list the Swann family as an owner of that wooden cigar factory building. That’s because Swann Cigars were not mass produced for retail sales throughout the country as other cigar brands from Tampa were, said Rodney Kite-Powell, the curator of the Tampa Bay History Center. Instead, the Swanns probably paid cigar factories to create their cigars.

At some point the family might have hired the Lopez, Alvarez & Co. cigar manufacturers, which owned the wooden building at 19th Street and Palm Avenue from 1947 to 1960, said Kite-Powell.

Providing further proof to that theory is that on the bottom of Swann cigar boxes in the possession of the history center is an inscription for “Cigar Factory #363,” which was at 1313 Eighth Ave. and also owned by the Lopez Alvarez company.

“Swann Cigars was probably given that space on the wall of what we know as the Oliva factory for a sign to advertise their cigars,” said Kite-Powell. “It was like a billboard. It makes sense — the better Swann Cigars does, the more business for Lopez Alvarez.”

That not even Swann ancestors know all the details of the cigar business is understandable, said Kite-Powell.

After all, the Swann family dates back to colonial times in the United States and operated numerous businesses.

“That family has done so much,” said Kite-Powell. “Even at the history center we were not aware they had a role in that cigar factory until the sign was accidentally unveiled.”

Another of Quintela and Shaw’s future developments — a mixed-use development that will include 45 apartments and 20,000 square feet of retail space at 1300 Seventh Ave. and the adjoining Eighth Avenue lot — will be named “The Jose Marti” in honor of the Cuban revolutionary and poet who made Ybor City his second home in the late 1800s.

Quintela is eager to find out what else they may learn about Ybor City’s history as both developments move further along.

“It’s becoming the best part of my job,” he said. “It’s always exciting make new discoveries.”

If Quintela and Shaw are in need of anything for a small museum in the wooden cigar factory’s future apartment complex, the Swann descendants have plenty they can provide to tell their family story.

Hank Brown said they have boxes of family archives with minute details of the Swanns’ history enclosed — old newspaper and magazine articles, letters and essays penned by ancestors, cigar boxes and labels, and other keepsakes.

Among Brown’s favorites and one he is not likely to share is a totem pole owned by his great-grandfather James T. Swann Sr. acquired during a hunting trip in Alaska in 1935.

The plane that was to pick him up in the wilderness was the one carrying actor Will Rogers that crashed in Alaska and killed the famous thespian, Brown said.

Without a way home and no phones with which to contact anyone, James Swann Sr. survived for weeks by living with native Alaskans until a search party was sent for him.

He later recounted the events in an essay the family still has.

“He wrote that his biggest concern was that he was running out of whiskey and tobacco,” said Hank Brown with a laugh. “Not food but whiskey.”

As a keepsake, the Alaskans carved him the totem pole.

“You never know what you’ll find out about our family,” said Hank Brown. “Our history goes back a long way.”

According to family archives, the Swanns came from England in the early 1600s and settled in Virginia, purchasing over 1,000 acres of land in the area that today is known as “Swann’s Point Plantation Site.”

Part of the Swann family later relocated to Tennessee, where Alfred Swann was born.

Alfred Swann began visiting Tampa in the late-1800s for fishing excursions.

“There wasn’t really much else to do here but fish,” said Hank Brown. “But at some point he saw potential in the area and realized he could buy up the land for real cheap.”

Along with business partner Eugene Holtsinger, the most prominent parcel of land the Swann family purchased was the area now known as Bayshore Boulevard.

Together, they developed it into one of Tampa’s premiere residential areas.

The next generations of Swanns went on to become successful developers and businessmen of their own, and diversified the family portfolio by investing in citrus and tobacco.

“Cigars were Tampa’s primary business,” said Swann descendant Mary Brown. “So it made sense to get on it. They were smart businessmen.”

Developer Quintela plans to have the Swann Cigars sign touched up.

“If it was a billboard for the cigars,” he said, “let it now be a billboard for Ybor history.”

Learn about upgrading this memorial...
[Add A Photo]James T. Swann, Jr. was born in Tampa on September 6, 1916. A member of the cigar industry, and also active in the real estate and citrus businesses, he had made a significant contribution to the development of his native city. Distinguished in school days, he was a decorated member of the United States Army Air Forces in World War II and in one of the civic promotions of Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla, the annual pirate festival, was King of Gasparilla. His popularity was widespread. Upon his return home after the war, Mr. Swann became closely identified with Swann Products, Inc., a cigar factory and mail order cigar company founded by his father. When his father died in 1953, James Swann, Jr., assumed the presidency of the company and he devoted himself to this firm, as well as to his citrus and real estate interests.     Ruth Binnicker Swann & husband James T. Swann, Jr. as the retiring Queen and King of Gasparilla, 1947.  There were no Gasparilla celebrations from 1942 through 1946.While reigning as King of Gasparilla in 1941, Mr. Swann married Ruth Binnicker, who was Queen of the festival at the same time. They had three children; Kathleen, Terrell, and James T. Swann, III. The family worshipped in the First Baptist Church of Tampa. When on January 11, 1955, a heart attack swept away the life of James T. Swann, Jr., at the age of thirty-eight, the entire city of Tampa was shocked. It had followed with approbation and eagerness the career of this young man, an illustrious member of an illustrious family, and had predicted that some day he would be one of the South's most noted citizens and one of the unforgettable builders of Southwestern Florida.James' widow, Ruth Binnicker Swann, would later marry Jack Eckerd of Eckerd Corporation fame.  Ruth Eckerd Hall in Clearwater is named for her.Added by: Bayart12/25/2013    Advertisement
