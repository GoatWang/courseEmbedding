Exeo Entertainment: E3 Review, Big Potential - Exeo Entertainment Inc (OTCMKTS:EXEO) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Exeo Entertainment: E3 Review, Big PotentialJun.22.14 | About: Exeo Entertainment (EXEO) John Dempsey Growth, IPOsSummaryEXEO is rated a strong long-term buy based on the quality of its product offerings in three distinct sectors: video gaming, audio, and Smart TVs.EXEO's current products include: Psyko 5.1 Gaming Headphones, Krankz Wireless Bluetooth On-Ear Headphones, and Zaaz Smart TV Keyboards.EXEO needs to effectively communicate its story to consumers and implement a solid marketing campaign to pull sales through established retail channels.If EXEO can execute its plan, there is the potential for $100 million in sales.Exeo Entertainment
Exeo Entertainment, Inc. (OTCQB: OTCQB:EXEO), formed in 2011 and based in Las Vegas, Nevada, designs, builds, markets, and sells Psyko™ 5.1 Gamer Headphones and Krankz™ Bluetooth® Headphones, and will soon release its Zaaz™ Keyboard for Smart TVs.
On June 10-12, 2014, Exeo displayed its products at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) 2014 held at the Los Angeles Convention Center. E3 is the largest international show for video gaming hardware and software products.
Exeo Entertainment's website can be viewed at exeoent.com.
Psyko™: Patented 5.1 Gaming Headphones
Psyko™ 5.1 Gaming Headphones are patented headphones for Xbox® and PlayStation® consoles and PCs using waveguide technology which no other vendor can copy. This makes them a unique product in the $93 billion dollar gaming marketplace.
Unlike other headphones which have their speakers located in the ear cups, Psyko has five speakers positioned along the bridge of the headphone with a subwoofer located in each ear cup. Sound from the five speakers travels down either the front or back waveguide tubes to each ear. Waveguides naturally send sound to both ears to produce 5.1 surround sound with zero latency and instant positional awareness.


Having listened to these headphones while playing a first shooter game at E3, I found the sound quality to be very realistic, very crisp, and the best sounding of all headsets I tried at the E3 show. I think the sound quality actually improves the video game by immersing the gamer with clear sound and better directional audio. The headphones seemed to make the game more alive. I also really liked how the ear cups can pivot open to keep your ears cooler but also to hear others speak while gaming. Each headphone comes with a Psyko Amplifier with bass and volume controls. The microphone is removable when not needed.
Psyko headphones compete primarily with Tritton (NYSEMKT:MCZ), Astro (NASDAQ:SKUL), and Turtle Beach (PAMT) headphones. All three of these competitors use processing and algorithms to deliver surround sound. In contrast, Psyko uses waveguide technology to deliver true 5.1 surround sound at the same price point as the competition.
Krankz™: Wireless Bluetooth® On-Ear Headphones
The Krankz™ Wireless Bluetooth® headphones provide high definition audio in a compact "on-ear" design. Krankz headphones can connect to any Bluetooth® device, such as most smart phones, tablets, and computers. Krankz are noticeably louder with more bass than competitors with "over-the-ear" designs. Krankz supports active noise cancellation, has an estimated 24 hour battery life, and a 20-20,000KHz frequency response range.
When I tried on the Krankz headphones at E3, I was impressed by the quality of the sound coming from such small speakers. The highs were high and the bass was booming. With a $129.00 MSRP I think users would be hard pressed to find better audio quality at this price. The controls are found on the outside of the right ear cup which allowed me to control the volume as well as to go forward or back to select songs from a playlist. I also liked how the headphones fold compactly to save space and come with a carrying case.
When an incoming call is received on a smart phone, the user can answer the phone while wearing Krankz by pressing the center button on the side of the headphone and talk using a built-in microphone. When the call ends, the music plays again.

Krankz headphones compete primarily with Skullcandy, Beats, Sennheiser, Monster, SMS Audio, and others. Exeo is currently working on a higher end Krankz Maxx "over-the-ear" design.

Zaaz™: A SmartKB™ for Smart TVs
Zaaz™ Smart TV Keyboards incorporates both IRDA and Bluetooth® for use with Smart TVs with a built in touch pad and "one touch" access keys. Zaaz uniquely provides access keys to go to commonly used websites, like Netflix, Amazon, and Facebook, which no other Smart TV keyboard provides to date. The back lit keyboard is ¾ the size of a regular keyboard.
In addition to the one touch keys, the F1-F12 keys are programmable which allow users to customize their keyboards. Realtors can customize their Zaaz keyboard for real estate websites, such as Zillow.com, Trulia.com, OpenHouseOn.com, and Realtor.com. Stock traders could customize their Zaaz keyboard for Yahoo Finance, eTrade.com, Fidelity.com, or program keys to bring up individual stock quotes on their Smart TV.
While a large number of vendors make Smart TVs, I believe Samsung is the only vendor that provides a Smart TV keyboard which works exclusively with Samsung TVs. In contrast, the Zaaz keyboard, which supports both IRDA and Bluetooth®, is expected to work with most, if not all, Smart TVs in the marketplace, including Samsung's Smart TVs. The Zaaz keyboard works with Smart TVs, cable boxes, media centers, PlayStation®, Xbox®, tablets, smart phones, and PCs.

I recently visited stores in my area such as Best Buy, Fry's Electronics, and Costco, and none of these stores currently sell keyboards for all Smart TVs today even though they offer a large variety of Smart TVs.

Marketplace
Exeo's main competitors in the gaming headphone marketplace are:
Tritton - Acquired by Mad Catz Interactive in 2010 with 53.4M sales.Astro Gaming - Acquired by Skullcandy in 2011.Turtle Beach Systems - Acquired by Parametric Sound Corporation with estimated sales of over $200 million.
The music headphone marketplace is estimated to be $2.3 billion dollars with an 11% growth rate in 2013. Exeo's main competitors in this market are:
Skullcandy Inc. - Does $250 million annually in headphone sales. Beats Electronics, LLC - Acquired by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) for $3.2 billion dollars in 2014. Sennheiser, Monster, and SMS Audio - Sell wireless, on-ear, and over-the-ear headphones.
Apple's purchase of Beats may benefit Exeo as some companies who currently offer Beats products may look for alternative products whose sales do not improve Apple's bottom line.
Smart TVs sales are estimated to exceed 100 million units in 2014 with roughly 42 million US households owning a Smart TV by the end of 2014. Sales are expected to hit $265 billion dollars by 2016.
Exeo: A Strong Long-term Buy
Exeo Entertainment, Inc. has great products to address large multi-billion dollar marketplaces. This gives Exeo a lot of upside potential.

Psyko headphones are based on patented technology that no other headphone vendor can copy. The PC Psyko is currently available for sale with a console model available within 2-3 months.
The Krankz headphones are available today with a higher end Krankz Maxx "over-the-ear" design under development.
The Zaaz keyboard is the only known smart keyboard designed to work with most, if not all, Smart TVs. If this product were released today, the Zaaz keyboard would represent a milestone in the Smart TV industry. Exeo wants to ramp up sales of the Zaaz keyboard to 250,000 units annually. With a $129 retail price, this would be $32.25 million dollars in retail sales. The company did not disclose wholesale pricing.
Recent Events
In 2011, Exeo raised $545,000 in round 1 of funding. In 2013, Exeo raised $1.25 million in round 2 funding. On January 10, 2014, Exeo's S1 went into effect. In February 2014, Exeo received its symbol EXEO from FINRA. And in May 2014, Exeo became DTC eligible.
On May 8, 2014, Exeo signed a distribution agreement with Global Marketing Partners that allows them to resell their products through Speed Commerce (formally Navarre). This new alliance makes Exeo products available through brick and mortar as well as online retailers throughout the United States.
Scott Amaral, CEO of Exeo Entertainment, Inc. said, "This agreement will allow us to reach our target demographic where they shop throughout the United States. We expect that this agreement could potentially add between $2,000,000 to $3,000,000 to our gross sales over the course of the next 12 months."
The Verdict
The challenge for Exeo will be generating enough capital to communicate their story with consumers and to finalize the development of future products.
The reason Exeo went public was to attract institutional money to market their products. If Exeo can attract institutional money, I think Exeo will be a long term winner.
While the company was very cautious to not disclose any non-public financial data, when I asked about margins at the E3 show, I was told they range between 35% to 42% depending on which product is being sold. These figures assume brick and mortar retail sales.

With the three products described in this article, combined with three additional products under development, I see the potential for $100 million in sales alone. With a margin at 35%, this would equate to $35 million in gross profits which is significantly more than what Exeo is currently generating today.
I rate Exeo as a strong long-term buy. My rating is based on the quality of their current products and the multi-billion dollar markets their products are sold to. If this company can execute their plan successfully, I would estimate their stock price currently at $1.10 (6/23/2014) to increase to $3.00 to $5.00 within the next several months.

Risk Disclosure
Investing in penny stocks involves substantial risk. Investors should be aware of these risks and should never invest funds that they are not willing to lose.
Exeo Entertainment, Inc. has incurred significant losses during the R&D phase and to date has not generated revenue.
The company is dependent on management and a loss of management could significantly impact the company.
Exeo needs to secure additional capital to fund a well executed marketing campaign. There can be no assurance that the company will realize these funds and operations could be scaled back substantially.
While the company has two products available for sale, and they've received overwhelmingly positive reviews, there can be no assurance that the company will generate sufficient sales to become profitable.
Exeo Entertainment, Inc. faces competition from well capitalized companies such as Astro , Tritton , and Turtle Beach .
Changing market conditions and consumer preferences could have a negative impact on the company.

CUSTOMER REVIEWS

"Perfect!"
 Web Review | July 09

I ordered your headset over the 4th of July and they just came in yesterday and all I can say is that I am super impressed with the quality and how easy it was to setup and start using.

"Love these..."
Web Review | April 24

I purchased several pairs of these headphones and sell them in Japan. Everyone likes them a lot plus I mark them up and make money. 


"Psyko Audio, The Unfair Advantage"
Amazon Certified Purchase | May 18

Hard to say anything but awesome things about this headset, its done me wonders in causing other players in games to quit in fits of rage. Profanities, curses, and accusations of hacking seem to occur quite often, especially when they think they are sneaking up on you from behind, only for you to hear them coming, turn around, and then knife then in the chest before they realize it. 






 Tom's Guide  "The Best Directional Audio We've Ever Tested" 

 PC GAMER 
An Audio Orgy in Your Ears - "The result is positional audio with astonishing clarity; it will be hard to go back to the relatively wooly, diffuse surround sound of any other 5.1 headset... You’ll kiss the glorious plastic arch of the Psyko 5.1 the first time you take down a Spy after hearing him slyly decloaking behind you and to your left."

Psykowave™ Technology
Engineered for gaming:



PsykoWave™ technology delivers the highest level of audio directionality and natural sound reproduction over any other 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound gaming headset. This is achieved through a radical design departure from traditional surround sound headsets. Instead of using signal processing to simulate surround effects:

 Five speakers are placed in the bridge of the headphone each in a precise

location to create the correct timing and level differences to both ears.

 Dual precision-tuned audio waveguides direct the sound from all speakers to flow past the front and rear of both ears, creating the same audio environment that exists with a 5.1 room speaker system.

 To complete the 5.1 surround sound experience, subwoofers are placed in each ear cup to deliver the most dynamic audio gaming experience.













What makes Psyko Better?




$149.99








Headphones are just not designed for surround sound. They are not even designed to accurately handle stereo since left sounds are only played in the left ear, and right sounds are only played in the right ear. In normal room stereo, both ears can hear every sound with a timing and volume difference between each ear.



Competitors use DSP (digital signal processing) technologies attempt to compensate for the inherent limitations of headphones. Their challenge is that everyone's ears are as unique as fingerprints and so are the sound signals each person uses to detect the direction of a sound. However, DSP solutions deliver the same signal to everyone. It is like selling the same prescription of glasses to everyone in the world even though we all need our own prescription. DSP methods are unable to accurately deliver all sound sources to both ears for proper directionality processing time, so they delay the sound to the headphones and that reduces your reaction time and game performance. Psyko is the only technology that delivers the vital timing and volume difference to each ear to reproduce "true" surround sound so they sound natural to everyone, with no latency.

Surround Effects
The combination of these three factors recreates, in miniature, the same things that happen with a room speaker system. There is no signal processing involved so there is no latency introduced, and because we simply recreate the natural conditions of a room in miniature the headphones will work for anyone, to the limits of their audio acuity.

LAS VEGAS, May 21, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Exeo Entertainment, Inc. (OTCQB: EXEO) announced it would be displaying its products at the 2014 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) which runs from June 10 – 12 at the Los Angeles Convention Center. Attendees are encouraged to stop by booth #5336 and test the Psyko™, Krankz™, and Zaaz™ products. 
Logo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20140521/90257 
"Last year we received great reviews of our Psyko headphones, but we weren't in a position to take orders. There was a lot of engineering work that needed to be done before we released the headphones to the public. Right now we have the PC version of the Psyko headphones ready to manufacture and the console version will be out in a couple of months," said CEO Scott Amaral.
Amaral continued, "We're excited about the prospects of meeting face to face with buyers from around the world and expanding our distribution network. This is the only time throughout the year that every manufacturer and every buyer is at the same place at the same time."
The Company's goal is to secure purchase orders on Krankz™ music headphones and the patented Psyko™ 5.1 surround-sound gaming headphones. The Zaaz™ keyboard tooling is still being finalized, but the Company is now taking pre-orders with a definitive delivery date in the near future. 
E3 is the industry's largest trade show devoted to video game hardware, software, and peripherals. In 2013, 48,200 people from 102 countries attended the event.   
Psyko™ Psyko Krypton™ is engineered for gaming: PsykoWave™ technology delivers the highest level of audio directionality and natural sound reproduction over any other 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound gaming headset.
This is achieved through a radical design departure from traditional surround sound headsets. Instead of using signal processing to simulate surround effects:

Five speakers are placed in the bridge of the headphone each in a precise location to create the correct timing and level differences to both ears. 
Dual precision-tuned audio waveguides direct the sound from all speakers to flow past the front and rear of both ears, creating the same audio environment that exists with a 5.1 room speaker system. 
To complete the 5.1 surround sound experience, subwoofers are placed in each ear cup to deliver the most dynamic audio gaming experience
Krankz™Krankz™, Wireless Bluetooth® On-Ear Headphones have a Retractable, Foldable Design with a Built-in Microphone and Noise Cancelling. The On-ear design combines superior sound quality with unparalleled comfort and style.
Features include active noise cancellation, built in call notification, intuitive controls, 24 hour battery life, and the ability to stream from any Bluetooth® enabled device from up to 30 feet away. 
Zaaz™ The Zaaz™ Keyboard is a Wireless Interactive Entertainment Keyboard designed to bring the ease of a full-size keyboard to your Smart TVs, Smart Devices and Home Theater Systems.  Features include "one touch access keys," seamless integration between Bluetooth® and IRDA, and a built in touch pad.
About Exeo Entertainment, Inc.   Headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada Exeo Entertainment, Inc. (OTCQB: EXEO) is public company that develops, acquires, manufactures, licenses and distributes unique products in the video gaming, music, and smart TV sectors.

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the common stock by the
selling stockholders pursuant to this prospectus. The selling stockholders named
herein will receive all proceeds from the sale of the shares of our common stock
in this offering.

We will pay all expenses (other than transfer taxes) of the selling stockholders
in connection with this offering.


Psyko ™ Headphones

While our Psyko™ headphone offering differs from the competition in the method
of 5.1-surround sound delivery, we will face competition from manufacturers with
established channels of distribution, mature capital structures, and
significantly larger marketing budgets. Well established gaming headphone
manufacturers include Turtle Beach; a private company, Tritton – a subsidiary of
Mad Catz Interactive (MCZ), and Astro Gaming which is a subsidiary of Skullcandy
(SKUL).

While other headphone manufacturers replicate 5.1 surround sound through Digital
Signal Processing (DSP), the Psyko™ headphones use a patented method of sound
delivery that doesn’t require the use of DSP. Management believes that the
difference in audio quality is a major differentiating factor between our
product offering and what is currently available on the market.

Zaaz™ Keyboard

The majority of the competition in the Bluetooth wireless keyboard arena is
concentrated amongst a few well-known companies such as Logitech (LOGI),
Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Samsung (SSNLF). While management believes
that only Samsung makes keyboards specifically designed to interact with smart
TVs, and that their keyboards only work with certain Samsung TVs, there can be
no assurance that other companies do not currently manufacture, or plan to
manufacture, such units in the future. Any such companies that manufacture
keyboards capable of connecting to a smart TV would further increase
competition.

Exeo Entertainment, Inc. intends on differentiating the Zaaz™ keyboard through a
set of features designed specifically for smart TV users. The Zaaz™ keyboard
features a customized set of “one touch access keys” that allows users to access
specific, user defined features of the consumers smart TV. Examples include one
touch access to the following: Netflix, Facebook, Hulu, and Amazon.
Additionally, the Zaaz™ keyboard will differentiate itself by including a full
size track pad – built into the keyboard – to navigate, point, click, and
select.

Extreme Gamer®

The Extreme Gamer® is a patent pending (patent application 12/543,296)
multi-disc video game changer that connects to current generation video game
consoles offered by Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony. `

Management believes from attending the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) January
11-13, 2013, having a booth and its products on display at the Electronic
Entertainment Expo (E3) June 11 – 13, 2013 (booth 4010), and from regularly
reading Video Gaming news from sources such as IGN.com, EGNnow.com, 1up.com, and
gamespot.com that no other company is currently manufacturing a multi-disc video
game changer. If such a unit is being made management is unaware of its
existence.

Management however acknowledges that while it cannot find any commercially
available products that our patents may never be awarded and that we could face
competition from any number of existing video game accessory manufacturers.


Company Description
We are in the business of designing, developing, licensing, manufacturing, and
marketing consumer electronics in the video gaming and smart TV sector. Products
under development include The Zaaz™ wireless keyboard, The Extreme Gamer®; a
multi-disc video game changer, and the Psyko Krypton™ surround


 sound gaming
headphones.
---

We are in process of completing the engineering on the three aforementioned
products and are working with contractors in China to establish manufacturing
capabilities. Once manufacturing is established we intend on utilizing existing
consumer electronics distributers, such as Synnex Corp. (SNX) to distribute our
products to big box retailers such as Best Buy, GameStop, and Fry’s Electronics.
---

We were incorporated in the state of Nevada on May 12, 2011. Our offices are
currently located at 4478 Wagon Trail Avenue, Las Vegas, NV 89118. Our telephone
number is 702-361-3188. Our registered agent in the State of Nevada is Business
Filings Incorporated, 311 S. Division Street, Carson City, Nevada 89703.
