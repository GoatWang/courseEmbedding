Our history
Fidelity's UK office was opened in 1973 and FIL Pensions Management was set up in 1986 to service the pensions market. We began managing money for European clients in 1979 and have had a presence in Continental Europe since 1990 and we opened our Luxembourg office in 1991. Over the next 15 years, we established offices throughout the rest of Europe.

In Asia, Fidelity was the first foreign asset management company to open an office in Japan in 1969 and we have also had an office in Hong Kong for over 20 years. We continued to extend our office network across Asia, where investment opportunities include both emerging markets as well as the rapid rate of change of well established markets. In 2004 we opened our Shanghai office and in 2006 we were delighted to celebrate the 10th Anniversary of Fidelity Australia.
