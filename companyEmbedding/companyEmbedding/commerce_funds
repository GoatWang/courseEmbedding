Innovation









Today, we are working at P&G to build a better company. Our goal is clear—meeting the needs of consumers better than the best competitors to deliver winning total shareholder return. We are doing this by focusing on a stronger portfolio, setting new standards of excellence, bringing a productivity mindset to everything we do, and empowering our people to keep the consumer at the center of everything we do.
Building a better company demands a streamlined, focused approach to our portfolio, and ensuring our brands continue to delight consumers.
A Strengthened Portfolio

Global leader in 10 categories with 65 brands that leverage P&G’s core strengths
Daily-use categories where purchase intent and choice are driven primarily by a specific job to do and the product's effectiveness
A focused portfolio for faster growth and higher profitability

We are also establishing a higher standard of excellence for all our brands. Success requires bringing these standards to every brand, and we are investing to fuel our growth by making these standards a reality.
New Standards of Excellence

Irresistibly Superior Products
Irresistibly Superior Packaging
Superior Brand Communications
Excellent Retail Execution
Winning Customer and Consumer Value Equation

Investing for growth requires bringing a productivity mindset to everything we do.  This approach has allowed us to deliver on our initial productivity commitment and to raise the bar with plans to save even more.

Productivity

$10 billion saved from fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2016.
Up to an additional $10 billion in savings from fiscal year 2017 through fiscal year 2021.
The objective: balanced top-and-bottom line growth that consistently delivers total shareholder return in the top-third of our peer group.

Our efforts are underpinned by an organization that is experienced, agile, accountable and committed to win. To further strengthen our performance, we’re also designing our structures to enable greater speed and agility, and we’re moving resources closer to consumers and customers, driving deeper mastery and accountability.
Empowering Our Organization and Culture

Today, 70% of our commercial function employees reside in local markets—executing innovation, advertising, and merchandising programs by leveraging their unique local knowledge.
In large markets, such as the US and China, we’re moving to end-to-end accountability. This model gives category business leaders full profit and loss responsibilities.
In smaller markets, we’re implementing a “freedom within a framework,”  empowering leaders to make real-time changes in strategy without engaging regional or global resources.
We’re also hiring from the outside—with the number of external hires quadrupling across five different levels of management including senior leadership.

Winning results happen when we earn them—every day, every week, every month, every quarter and every year—in every brand and in every country in which we compete.  And today, we are building a better company that is delivering on just that.

Company Strategy






Building a Better Company
This year, P&G will be 180 years old. A company does not last for that long if its management is not willing to change anything and everything, except for its purpose and core values, to serve consumers and create value for shareowners.













 

Operating Total Shareholder Return



 

Value Creation


 Value Creation is top priority. We are putting strategies and capabilities into place to transform P&G into a faster-growing, more profitable and far simpler company.  What's different, and how are we building a better P&G? 






 


Portfolio Transformation – Leading Brands


 P&G is focusing on 10 product categories with about 65 brands. P&G is a leader in all of these categories, with significant growth potential.









 




 

Innovation


 Innovation has always been - and continues to be - P&G's lifeblood. Each P&G product category provides a portfolio of innovation, including a mix of commercial programs, product improvements and game-changing innovations. 






 

Productivity Improvements

Cost of Goods Sold
Overhead Reductions
Marketing Efficiencies

 

 

Productivity


 Productivity is a core strength for P&G, which creates flexibility to fund our growth efforts, offset cost challenges and/or improve operating margins. We have taken significant steps to accelerate productivity and savings across all elements of costs, which are yielding significant benefits to our operating margin.

Home  About Commerce Funds  About Us

About Us
The power of professional commitment
To continue to provide high quality investment products for our customers, Commerce Bank initiated the development of proprietary mutual funds in late 1993. The Commerce Funds became effective on 12-12-1994 with approximately $251 million in assets. At that time there were six funds, Growth, Aggressive Growth, Balanced, Bond, Short-Term Government and International Equity. In February of 1995, the National and Missouri Tax-Free Funds were added.
Over the next 10 years the Funds saw the addition of four new funds, Value, Asset Allocation, Core Equity and Kansas Tax Free. The Aggressive Growth Fund's name was changed to the MidCap Growth Fund and the Balanced Fund was closed.
We currently offer a family of eight mutual funds with more than $2 billion in assets under management covering a range of investment objectives, from current income and capital preservation to aggressive growth.
The customer service focus we had then is repeated today as we constantly look for ways to improve our product. Shareholder satisfaction continues to be our primary goal. 
The Commerce Funds are distributed by Goldman, Sachs & Co.

A prospectus for the Commerce Funds containing more complete information may be obtained by calling 1-800-995-6365 or by downloading it from this website. Please consider a Fund's objectives, risks, and charges and expenses, and read the prospectus carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other information about the Fund.
		
		The mutual funds referred to in this Web site are offered and sold only to persons residing in the United States and are offered by prospectus only. The prospectus contains more complete information about the funds, including charges and expenses, and should be read carefully before investing.

Innovation









Today, we are working at P&G to build a better company. Our goal is clear—meeting the needs of consumers better than the best competitors to deliver winning total shareholder return. We are doing this by focusing on a stronger portfolio, setting new standards of excellence, bringing a productivity mindset to everything we do, and empowering our people to keep the consumer at the center of everything we do.
Building a better company demands a streamlined, focused approach to our portfolio, and ensuring our brands continue to delight consumers.
A Strengthened Portfolio

Global leader in 10 categories with 65 brands that leverage P&G’s core strengths
Daily-use categories where purchase intent and choice are driven primarily by a specific job to do and the product's effectiveness
A focused portfolio for faster growth and higher profitability

We are also establishing a higher standard of excellence for all our brands. Success requires bringing these standards to every brand, and we are investing to fuel our growth by making these standards a reality.
New Standards of Excellence

Irresistibly Superior Products
Irresistibly Superior Packaging
Superior Brand Communications
Excellent Retail Execution
Winning Customer and Consumer Value Equation

Investing for growth requires bringing a productivity mindset to everything we do.  This approach has allowed us to deliver on our initial productivity commitment and to raise the bar with plans to save even more.

Productivity

$10 billion saved from fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2016.
Up to an additional $10 billion in savings from fiscal year 2017 through fiscal year 2021.
The objective: balanced top-and-bottom line growth that consistently delivers total shareholder return in the top-third of our peer group.

Our efforts are underpinned by an organization that is experienced, agile, accountable and committed to win. To further strengthen our performance, we’re also designing our structures to enable greater speed and agility, and we’re moving resources closer to consumers and customers, driving deeper mastery and accountability.
Empowering Our Organization and Culture

Today, 70% of our commercial function employees reside in local markets—executing innovation, advertising, and merchandising programs by leveraging their unique local knowledge.
In large markets, such as the US and China, we’re moving to end-to-end accountability. This model gives category business leaders full profit and loss responsibilities.
In smaller markets, we’re implementing a “freedom within a framework,”  empowering leaders to make real-time changes in strategy without engaging regional or global resources.
We’re also hiring from the outside—with the number of external hires quadrupling across five different levels of management including senior leadership.

Winning results happen when we earn them—every day, every week, every month, every quarter and every year—in every brand and in every country in which we compete.  And today, we are building a better company that is delivering on just that.

Company Strategy






Building a Better Company
This year, P&G will be 180 years old. A company does not last for that long if its management is not willing to change anything and everything, except for its purpose and core values, to serve consumers and create value for shareowners.













 

Operating Total Shareholder Return



 

Value Creation


 Value Creation is top priority. We are putting strategies and capabilities into place to transform P&G into a faster-growing, more profitable and far simpler company.  What's different, and how are we building a better P&G? 






 


Portfolio Transformation – Leading Brands


 P&G is focusing on 10 product categories with about 65 brands. P&G is a leader in all of these categories, with significant growth potential.









 




 

Innovation


 Innovation has always been - and continues to be - P&G's lifeblood. Each P&G product category provides a portfolio of innovation, including a mix of commercial programs, product improvements and game-changing innovations.

 Productivity is a core strength for P&G, which creates flexibility to fund our growth efforts, offset cost challenges and/or improve operating margins.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
