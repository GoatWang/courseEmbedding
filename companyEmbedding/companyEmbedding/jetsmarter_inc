History[edit]
JetSmarter was founded in 2012 by entrepreneur Sergey Petrossov,[4][5] whose idea made him one of Forbes' "30 Under 30" business leaders of 2016.[6][7] In August 2012, the beta version was launched and tested among a closed group of private aviation users. After testing proved successful, Petrossov sought and received substantial venture funding to expand JetSmarter's scope.[8] In March 2013, the JetSmarter app was launched and made available to the general public on both iOS and Android devices.[9]
In June 2015, JetSmarter announced its new European Headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland. In early 2016, it launched flights within Europe.[10][11] JetSmarter has offices in Zurich, London, Moscow, Dubai, Riyadh, and Fort Lauderdale.[12]
Funding[edit]
According to Business Insider and TechCrunch JetSmarter has raised $20 million from the Saudi Royal Family, American rapper Jay-Z, American serial entrepreneur and investor Wayne Chang,[13] and investment bank Goldman Sachs Capital Partners.[14][15] In total, Jetsmarter raised $56 million since its inception.[12]
In December, 2016, JetSmarter announced it had raised an additional $105 million at a $1.6 billion valuation. The company said this will fuel international expansion and add at least 80 more routes to its existing 50 routes.[16][17][18]
Services[edit]
JetSmarter flight services include a mix of private and shared flight services:
PRIVATECHARTERS are much like a traditional charter booking.[19]
SHAREDCHARTERS let members book on-demand charter flights, specify how many seats they need, and then earn flight credit by allowing JetSmarter to sell empty seats to other members.[20]
CUSTOMSHUTTLES are custom shared flights that members create along existing posted routes.[21]
JETSHUTTLES are posted routes that members can fly on together all over the world.[22]
JETDEALS are a blend of complimentary empty-leg or repositioning flights, empty seats on shared charter flights, and opportunities to pool with other members to create on-demand flights.[23] The JetSmarter app allows passengers to search for and set up alerts for empty leg flights leaving their chosen cities.[24]
JetSmarter has 3,000 private jets and 2,000 free empty legs per month.[25] In January 2016, Chicago Tribune reported JetSmarter has launched app-based private charter service in Chicago, using Midway International Airport as its access point.[26] Adding to its services, the company offers helicopter rides from heliports in New York City, via BLADE, to the airport in White Plains, NY.[27]
The App[edit]
The JetSmarter application connects passengers and private air carriers. Upon selecting the flight, users are able to view a photo of the plane they chose as well as its safety and flight records. Depending on the flight and the number of passengers, chartering a private plane can be comparable in price or less expensive than conventional commercial air travel.[28][29][30][31][32]
Partnership[edit]
JetSmarter partners with various air carriers that span the range of the private charter industry.[33][34]
Corporate Affairs[edit]
In February 2017, Gennady Barsky, a former executive, was arrested on embezzlement charges. The arrest was unrelated to JetSmarter, but about a previous company he was affiliated with.[35] Barsky also served as CFO of JetSmarter before becoming President. He has since resigned the company.[36] The company was named as the subject of a Class Action lawsuit from a former employee for unpaid overtime filed on June 20.[37]
In 2017, The Verge reported that management of JetSmarter offered free flights to its reporters if an article was posted within five days of the flight.[38] According to the allegations, if the story did not appear within that timeline, the reporter's credit card would be charged $2,000.[39]

History[edit]
JetSmarter was founded in 2012 by entrepreneur Sergey Petrossov,[4][5] whose idea made him one of Forbes' "30 Under 30" business leaders of 2016.[6][7] In August 2012, the beta version was launched and tested among a closed group of private aviation users. After testing proved successful, Petrossov sought and received substantial venture funding to expand JetSmarter's scope.[8] In March 2013, the JetSmarter app was launched and made available to the general public on both iOS and Android devices.[9]
In June 2015, JetSmarter announced its new European Headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland. In early 2016, it launched flights within Europe.[10][11] JetSmarter has offices in Zurich, London, Moscow, Dubai, Riyadh, and Fort Lauderdale.[12]
Funding[edit]
According to Business Insider and TechCrunch JetSmarter has raised $20 million from the Saudi Royal Family, American rapper Jay-Z, American serial entrepreneur and investor Wayne Chang,[13] and investment bank Goldman Sachs Capital Partners.[14][15] In total, Jetsmarter raised $56 million since its inception.[12]
In December, 2016, JetSmarter announced it had raised an additional $105 million at a $1.6 billion valuation. The company said this will fuel international expansion and add at least 80 more routes to its existing 50 routes.[16][17][18]
Services[edit]
JetSmarter flight services include a mix of private and shared flight services:
PRIVATECHARTERS are much like a traditional charter booking.[19]
SHAREDCHARTERS let members book on-demand charter flights, specify how many seats they need, and then earn flight credit by allowing JetSmarter to sell empty seats to other members.[20]
CUSTOMSHUTTLES are custom shared flights that members create along existing posted routes.[21]
JETSHUTTLES are posted routes that members can fly on together all over the world.[22]
JETDEALS are a blend of complimentary empty-leg or repositioning flights, empty seats on shared charter flights, and opportunities to pool with other members to create on-demand flights.[23] The JetSmarter app allows passengers to search for and set up alerts for empty leg flights leaving their chosen cities.[24]
JetSmarter has 3,000 private jets and 2,000 free empty legs per month.[25] In January 2016, Chicago Tribune reported JetSmarter has launched app-based private charter service in Chicago, using Midway International Airport as its access point.[26] Adding to its services, the company offers helicopter rides from heliports in New York City, via BLADE, to the airport in White Plains, NY.[27]
The App[edit]
The JetSmarter application connects passengers and private air carriers. Upon selecting the flight, users are able to view a photo of the plane they chose as well as its safety and flight records. Depending on the flight and the number of passengers, chartering a private plane can be comparable in price or less expensive than conventional commercial air travel.[28][29][30][31][32]
Partnership[edit]
JetSmarter partners with various air carriers that span the range of the private charter industry.[33][34]
Corporate Affairs[edit]
In February 2017, Gennady Barsky, a former executive, was arrested on embezzlement charges. The arrest was unrelated to JetSmarter, but about a previous company he was affiliated with.[35] Barsky also served as CFO of JetSmarter before becoming President. He has since resigned the company.[36] The company was named as the subject of a Class Action lawsuit from a former employee for unpaid overtime filed on June 20.[37]
In 2017, The Verge reported that management of JetSmarter offered free flights to its reporters if an article was posted within five days of the flight.[38] According to the allegations, if the story did not appear within that timeline, the reporter's credit card would be charged $2,000.[39]

JetSmarter was founded in 2012 by entrepreneur Sergey Petrossov,[4][5] whose idea made him one of Forbes' "30 Under 30" business leaders of 2016.[6][7] In August 2012, the beta version was launched and tested among a closed group of private aviation users. After testing proved successful, Petrossov sought and received substantial venture funding to expand JetSmarter's scope.[8] In March 2013, the JetSmarter app was launched and made available to the general public on both iOS and Android devices.[9]
In June 2015, JetSmarter announced its new European Headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland. In early 2016, it launched flights within Europe.[10][11] JetSmarter has offices in Zurich, London, Moscow, Dubai, Riyadh, and Fort Lauderdale.[12]
Funding[edit]
According to Business Insider and TechCrunch JetSmarter has raised $20 million from the Saudi Royal Family, American rapper Jay-Z, American serial entrepreneur and investor Wayne Chang,[13] and investment bank Goldman Sachs Capital Partners.[14][15] In total, Jetsmarter raised $56 million since its inception.[12]
In December, 2016, JetSmarter announced it had raised an additional $105 million at a $1.6 billion valuation. The company said this will fuel international expansion and add at least 80 more routes to its existing 50 routes.[16][17][18]
Services[edit]
JetSmarter flight services include a mix of private and shared flight services:
PRIVATECHARTERS are much like a traditional charter booking.[19]
SHAREDCHARTERS let members book on-demand charter flights, specify how many seats they need, and then earn flight credit by allowing JetSmarter to sell empty seats to other members.[20]
CUSTOMSHUTTLES are custom shared flights that members create along existing posted routes.[21]
JETSHUTTLES are posted routes that members can fly on together all over the world.[22]
JETDEALS are a blend of complimentary empty-leg or repositioning flights, empty seats on shared charter flights, and opportunities to pool with other members to create on-demand flights.[23] The JetSmarter app allows passengers to search for and set up alerts for empty leg flights leaving their chosen cities.[24]
JetSmarter has 3,000 private jets and 2,000 free empty legs per month.[25] In January 2016, Chicago Tribune reported JetSmarter has launched app-based private charter service in Chicago, using Midway International Airport as its access point.[26] Adding to its services, the company offers helicopter rides from heliports in New York City, via BLADE, to the airport in White Plains, NY.[27]
The App[edit]
The JetSmarter application connects passengers and private air carriers. Upon selecting the flight, users are able to view a photo of the plane they chose as well as its safety and flight records. Depending on the flight and the number of passengers, chartering a private plane can be comparable in price or less expensive than conventional commercial air travel.[28][29][30][31][32]
Partnership[edit]
JetSmarter partners with various air carriers that span the range of the private charter industry.[33][34]
Corporate Affairs[edit]
In February 2017, Gennady Barsky, a former executive, was arrested on embezzlement charges. The arrest was unrelated to JetSmarter, but about a previous company he was affiliated with.[35] Barsky also served as CFO of JetSmarter before becoming President. He has since resigned the company.[36] The company was named as the subject of a Class Action lawsuit from a former employee for unpaid overtime filed on June 20.[37]
In 2017, The Verge reported that management of JetSmarter offered free flights to its reporters if an article was posted within five days of the flight.[38] According to the allegations, if the story did not appear within that timeline, the reporter's credit card would be charged $2,000.[39]

Earlier this month I spoke with JetSmarter's CMO, Ronn Torossian about brand creation, strategies to stay competitive in your industry, and how JetSmarter gets personal with it's customers. If you're not familiar with JetSmarter, it's a mobile-marketplace for private jet charter, frequently referred to as "Uber for Private Air Travel." Here's my conversation with Ronn:

Thanks for taking the time Ronn. For those that aren't familiar with JetSmarter, could you describe what problem the company is solving?We're the fastest growing private jet company right now, democratizing the private air industry. JetSmarter is making private airfare available for more than just the typical 1%, by either allowing customers to share a private plane, or have a seat on the plane. Rather than pay a full fee for a New York to Los Angeles private flight, you can just pay for the 3 seats you actually need. We certainly try to make the travel industry that much less painful for consumers, that's why we've seen so much growth. We're devoted to making travel fun again.

Consumers are increasingly expecting more personalized experiences -- how do you and the JetSmarter team think about incorporating this into your strategy?When I fly, I eat a lot of pretzels and I love diet coke. It makes such a difference to me when I get on board and they don't even ask me what I want, they just give it to me because they already know I want it. This personalization makes a huge difference. We create profiles for our members, allowing us to understand their likes and dislikes so we can better profile and understand them. We can sit them next to someone who doesn't want to talk, if they're the type to put headphones in and relax during their flights. If they love making small talk, we can sit them next to someone else like that, too. At JetSmarter everyone has different experiences on the same flight, because everything is tailored specifically to them. We customize in such a personal way that whether it's food or who you're sitting next to, we want to make your journey the best it can be for you.
As a tech company, everything and anything regarding how people interact with technology matters to us. We are one of the most expensive apps on the App Store, our passengers want a luxury, tailed experience. We are excited about everything that tech has to offer - whether its servicing, knowing how customers interact with our product, or anything else. Our customer is successful, wealthy, and wants this unique product.

What advice would you pass along to other CMOs of startups or growing ventures?Well... you have to move very quickly and you have to make decisions quickly. You cannot be afraid to make mistakes, because you will make mistakes. We're taking on companies who have been around much longer than us, so we have to understand the importance of local market, and adapting to markets - that's something to keep in mind whatever industry you're in. But my best advice? Don't sleep too much. We work hard to get where we are, it all comes down to that.

What's been the best way marketing has helped JetSmarter grow into the "unicorn" it is today?Doing everything from big data, to social keywords, to events is the standard, but the most effective method for us is our consumer's word of mouth. Our ideal consumer is someone who we can reach through our core members... a lot like a country club. People get to socialize and get to know each other through the flights, so whether they're inviting friends, having business meetings with colleagues, or getting to know strangers, they're networking. We've flown to the Super Bowl, World Series, and so many more - we fly with all types of industries, whether fortune 500 CEOs, professors, or authors, and we also do a lot of private events focused on entrepreneurs and tech.
