For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact your quality of care. Sometimes multiple states report the same claim. If a provider practices in a state where data is unavailable, please reach out to your local state legislature to help make this data publicly available.0SanctionsNo sanctions history found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What is a sanction or disciplinary actionWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?A sanction, also known as a disciplinary action, is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct. Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect non-disciplinary board actions?Healthgrades collects non-disciplinary board actions from all 50 U.S. states.Conditions TreatedDr. Iversen does not have any conditions listed.

Iversen
Robert J. Iversen, a third-year student in the School of Law at Washington University in St. Louis, died recently. Iversen was 39.
His family has advised the university that he took his own life at a location out of state.
An accomplished and involved law student, Iversen was expected to earn a juris doctoris in May 2016.
“We are deeply saddened by Robert’s death,” said Nancy Staudt, JD, PhD, dean of the School of Law and the Howard & Caroline Cayne Professor of Law. “He was a stellar student and an active student-leader in our law school community. Our thoughts are with his family and his many law school colleagues at this very difficult time.”
He was a staff editor of the Washington University Law Review last academic year and was named a senior executive editor of the Law Review this year.
A Scholar in Law Award recipient, Iversen was vice president of the Student Law Association of Metropolitan St. Louis in 2014-15.
“Rob was one of the most talented, intelligent and hard-working students that I have come across in my time at Washington University,” said Richard E. Finneran, JD (’08), an adjunct professor at the law school who was Iversen’s instructor in appellate advocacy and head coach of the school’s National Moot Court Team, of which Iversen was a member in 2014-15 and in this academic year.
Iversen won the championship in last year’s Wiley Rutledge Moot Court Competition, the law school’s oldest and largest moot court competition, and he and his teammates were quarterfinalists in the 2015 Evan A. Evans Constitutional Law Moot Court Competition at the University of Wisconsin Law School.
Iversen, who also won the Carmody MacDonald Legal Practice Excellence Award last year, applied for and was selected as one of the two co-chairs of the Wiley Rutledge Moot Court Competition Board members for this year.
“He put his heart and soul into everything he did, whether that was an academic course, winning a moot court competition, or helping to improve one,” said Finneran, who is also an assistant U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri. “No matter how successful he was, he always saw room for improvement. I am sad that I will not have the chance to work with him again.”
Bruce La Pierre, JD, professor of law and director of the law school’s Appellate Clinic, said Iversen was his student in a first-year constitutional law class in spring 2014.
“Because I was impressed with his performance and captured by his obvious delight in debating legal issues, I selected Rob to participate in the Appellate Clinic,” La Pierre said.
La Pierre noted that last spring and early this fall, Iversen took an active part in drafting a brief that was recently filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit.
“Never afraid to question authority — including my own — Rob challenged us all to think carefully and to explore all the alternatives. The brief reflects his many contributions. He was a very good colleague. I, among many, will miss the opportunity to continue working with him,” La Pierre said.
Iversen had worked in information technology before deciding he wanted to complete his undergraduate education so that he could pursue a law degree.
While working full time in various hospitality positions, he earned a bachelor’s degree in political science from the University of Central Florida in 2013, making the President’s List or the Dean’s List every semester and graduating with a 3.97 GPA.
Iversen is survived by his parents, Jeff and Debra Iversen, of Plano, Texas; and a stepsister, Rebecca Matthews of Ocala, Fla.
A memorial service will be held at 12:15 p.m. Monday, Oct. 19, at the Catholic Student Center at Washington University, 6352 Forsyth Blvd.
