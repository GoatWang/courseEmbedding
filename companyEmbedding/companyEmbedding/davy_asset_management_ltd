The Low Volatility Phenomenon
Volatility has fallen to the lowest levels witnessed in over two decades recently. In fact, since its inception in 1993, the VIX Index or 'fear gauge', has only closed lower than the recent reading of 9.77 on three occasions. In this insight, Fund Manager Davan Byrne outlines the factors that he believes are contributing to these historical low levels.

Dutch Kick Off Election Cycle
Do you know your PVV from your VVD? Of course you do! One is the Party for Freedom, while the other is the People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy. And, at the risk of turning this into a Monty Python sketch, it’s time to turn our attention to our European neighbours as the Dutch go to the polls on Wednesday, kicking off a European election cycle that has been a source of concern to investors and the powers that be on the continent in recent months.

What Will Equity Markets Make of Trump's Fiscal Policy?
Global equities have risen by 13.7% since the election of Donald Trump as the 45th president of the United States last November. Naturally, Trump couldn’t resist reminding the world of this fact as he addressed Congress.

Case for Media in the 'Trump Trade'
When one imagines the definitive “Trump Trade” one thinks of; cyclical businesses highly leveraged to the US domestic economy, high domestic tax rates which would benefit from reduced corporate tax and dollar earnings which will benefit from the rise in interest rates. Given that advertising spend is highly linked to GDP growth, Media companies make perfect candidates for the Trump Trade.

Global Equity Income





Global Equity Income - Dividend Focus
An investment strategy which focuses on dividends and more importantly dividend growth can lead to superior risk adjusted returns over time. The compounding effect of dividend reinvestment is a key component of total equity market returns. Historically, it has proven to be an effective way of reducing the destructive effect of inflation on investors’ future spending power.

QUALITY COMPANIES

The strategy invests in high quality global companies, firms with market capitalisations in excess of €10 billion, strong management and good financial discipline. Consequently, the volatility of earnings across this strategy tends to be lower than that of the market, potentially enabling the strategy to withstand adverse market or economic conditions.



STRUCTURED INVESTMENT PROCESS

A structured investment process allows the team to focus on companies which can deliver current income and provide sustainable dividend growth over time.









FUNDS IN THIS STRATEGY

The product suite includes a number of variations, each with their own unique risk and return characteristics based on a Quality investment philosophy and a structured investment process.
 
High Yield Equity Funds

The investment objective of these Funds is to achieve long term capital growth by predominantly investing in Quality global equities which are expected to provide a higher than average dividend yield coupled with an ability to grow these dividends. The Funds target a dividends yield of 1% greater than the market yield.

UCITS FUND

LIFE COMPANY FUND


  
Defensive Equity Funds

These Funds invest in quality global equities that are expected to provide a higher than average dividend yields. The Funds implement an unique risk management strategy that generates additional income from selling call options on its holdings. This additional income is then used to buy some ‘insurance’ with the aim of protecting the fund against significant market falls.

UCITS FUND

LIFE COMPANY FUND


  
Geared High Yield Fund

The Fund is an equity income fund which invests in quality global equities that are expected to provide a higher than average dividend yields. The Fund targets a dividend yield 1% above the market. Investor capital is supplemented with an actively managed loan within the fund to increase exposure to equity markets. The fund manager will typically look to change the gearing depending on valuation levels.

LIFE COMPANY FUND

Dutch Kick Off Election Cycle
Do you know your PVV from your VVD? Of course you do! One is the Party for Freedom, while the other is the People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy. And, at the risk of turning this into a Monty Python sketch, it’s time to turn our attention to our European neighbours as the Dutch go to the polls on Wednesday, kicking off a European election cycle that has been a source of concern to investors and the powers that be on the continent in recent months.

Q4 2016 Investment Outlook
"Long-run prosperity was never in the gift of monetary policy makers. Consensus is growing that escaping this low-growth low-inflation trap will require a re-balancing between monetary, fiscal and structural policies."

Investment Outlook: Keep Calm and Carry On
Equity markets continued their rollercoaster journey for investors in the second quarter of 2016 with the shock UK referendum result punctuating the quarter end.

In the first half of 2016, the MSCI World Index had been particularly volatile, falling 5.0% in the first quarter, before rebounding by 3.6% in the second. It is now only off -1.6% year-to-date, in euro terms. This masks a dramatic 15.3% fall between January and February, which was subsequently offset by a deep value rally of 17.3% from February to the end of May.

Investment Outlook: Are We Out of the Woods?
The first quarter of 2016 was a volatile start to the year, with January being one of the worst starts to a year on record.  While we view the low trajectory of global growth as a continued concern for markets going forward, we can draw some comfort from the fact that many of the risks which flared up in the first quarter are relatively discreet.

Global Brands - Cash Flow Focus
An investment strategy which focuses on the power of the compounding of cash flows through pricing power, high barriers to entry and brand durability. Historically, brands provide companies with an enduring competitive advantage and attractive growth opportunities which can result in strong returns over time.

QUALITY COMPANIES

The strategy invests in high quality global companies with strong management and good financial discipline. Consequently, the earnings growth of these companies tends to be higher and more durable than that of the market, potentially enabling the strategy to withstand adverse market or economic conditions.

STRUCTURED INVESTMENT PROCESS







A structured investment process allows the team to focus on companies which can deliver sustainable earnings growth as management is able to reinvest their cash flow efficiently over time.
 
Global Brands Funds

The Funds invest in companies which own some of the world’s strongest brand names together with companies which own brands that, in our opinion, may become the next great global brands. We believe that companies with strong brand characteristics can deliver strong risk-adjusted returns due to more sustainable growth profiles, global footprint, and high barriers to entry. Whatever the environment, we believe that investing in attractively valued, high quality brand characteristics that are financially sound and highly cash generative can form a key part of a successful investment strategy.
