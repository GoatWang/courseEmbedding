The Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company, known as the Wrigley Company, is an American chewing gum company founded on April 1, 1891, by William Wrigley Jr., based in the Global Innovation Center (GIC) in Goose Island, Chicago, Illinois.[1] It is wholly owned by Mars, Incorporated. It is currently the largest manufacturer and marketer of chewing gum in the world.[2][3][4]
In 1892, Wrigley Jr. began packaging chewing gum with each can of baking powder. The chewing gum eventually became more popular than the baking powder and Wrigley's reoriented the company to produce the gum. The company currently sells its products in more than 180 countries and districts, maintains operations in over 50 countries, and has 21 production facilities in 14 countries including the United States, Mexico, Spain, the United Kingdom, France, the Czech Republic, Poland, Russia, China, India, Japan, Kenya, Taiwan, and Australia.[5]
In 2005, Wrigley purchased Life Savers and Altoids from Kraft Foods for US$1.5 billion.[6] On January 23, 2007, Wrigley signed a purchase agreement to acquire an 80% initial interest in A. Korkunov for $300 million with the remaining 20% to be acquired over time. On April 28, 2008, Mars announced that it would acquire Wrigley for approximately $23 billion.[7] Financing for the transaction was provided by Berkshire Hathaway, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan; Berkshire Hathaway held a minority equity investment in Wrigley until October 2016.[8][9]
The Wrigley Building on Michigan Avenue, one of Chicago's best-known landmarks on the Magnificent Mile, was originally the company's global headquarters until 2011, when it was sold to an investor group that included Zeller Realty Group as well as Groupon co-founders Eric Lefkofsky and Brad Keywell.[10] The company headquartered in the GIC in 2012 since.

Corporate leadership[edit]
1891–1932: William Wrigley Jr.[edit]
In 1891, 29-year-old William Wrigley Jr. (1861–1932) came to Chicago from Philadelphia with $32 and the idea to start a business selling Wrigley's Scouring Soap. Wrigley offered premiums as an incentive to buy his soap, such as baking powder. Later in his career, he switched to the baking powder business, in which he began offering two packages of chewing gum for each purchase of a can of baking powder. The popular premium, chewing gum, began to seem more promising. Wrigley also became the majority owner of the Chicago Cubs in 1921.
1932–1961: Philip K. Wrigley[edit]
After the death of William Wrigley Jr., his son Philip K. Wrigley (1894–1977) assumed his father's position as CEO of the Wrigley Company. Wrigley is most well known for his unusual move to support US troops and protect the reputation of the Wrigley brand during World War II, in which he dedicated the entire output of Wrigley's Spearmint, Doublemint, and Juicy Fruit to the US Armed Forces. Wrigley launched the "Remember this Wrapper" ad campaign to keep the Wrigley brands on the minds of the customers during times of wartime rationing.[6]
1961–1999: William Wrigley III[edit]
In 1961, Philip K. Wrigley handed control to his son, William Wrigley III (1933–1999). Wrigley led a strategic global expansion through the establishment of Wrigley facilities in nine new countries.[6] On June 26, 1974, a Marsh Supermarket in Troy, Ohio installed the first bar code scanning equipment. The first product to be scanned using a Universal Product Code (UPC) bar code was a 10-pack of Wrigley's Juicy Fruit gum.[11] (This pack of gum is now on display at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History.) In 1984, Wrigley introduced a new gum, Extra, which followed the new trend of sugar-free gums in the US.[6] Wrigley also assumed control of the Chicago Cubs after his father's death in 1977, and sold the team to the Chicago Tribune in 1981.
1999–2006: William Wrigley IV[edit]
William "Bill" Wrigley IV (1963–), following the death of Wrigley III (his father), led the sugar-free gum campaign across Europe, Australia, Spain, India, and China.[6] In 2005, Kraft Foods sold the Life Savers and Altoids businesses to Wrigley in exchange for $1.5 billion as part of a reorganization plan.[12] Wrigley led the establishment of the Wrigley Science Institute (WSI) in 2006 to study the oral health benefits of gum chewing. The WSI investigates the effects of gum chewing on weight management, stress relief, concentration, and oral health.[6]
2006–2008: William Perez[edit]
On October 23, 2006, William D. Perez (1948–) succeeded Bill Wrigley as CEO. He was the first person outside the Wrigley family to head the company. In 2007, the company debuted 5 Gum in the US. The 5 Gum brand was marketed using cinematic TV commercials portraying "What it feels like to chew 5 Gum". Perez led the efforts of improving slimmer packaging (Slim Pack) with flavor improvements across both Extra and Wrigley brands.[6]
2008–2011: Dushan "Duke" Petrovich[edit]
Dushan Petrovich (1954–) succeeded Perez almost immediately after Mars, Incorporated's 2008 purchase of Wrigley. In 2009, Wrigley's Global Innovation Center received the LEED Gold Certification through Wrigley's commitment to global sustainability. In the 2010 Olympic Games in Vancouver, British Columbia, Wrigley was the Official Confectionery Supplier of the games, in which the company sported Olympic-themed packs and products.[6]
2011–present: Martin Radvan[edit]
Martin Radvan became the president of the Wrigley Company after Petrovich. He is responsible for the company’s worldwide strategy, operations and business performance.[13]

Changes in gum[edit]
In some countries, xylitol is used to sweeten gum instead of aspartame. By avoiding sugar, the chance of tooth decay is lowered, since the sugar otherwise used may turn into acid after chewing the gum. It is also claimed that in chewing, it may help to remove food residues. Xylitol-based products are allowed by the US Food and Drug Administration to make the medical claim that they do not promote dental cavities.[14]
New product[edit]
Wrigley temporarily halted production and sales of its new Alert energy gum as the Food and Drug Administration investigates the safety of caffeinated-food products.[15]

The Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company, known as the Wrigley Company, is an American chewing gum company founded on April 1, 1891, by William Wrigley Jr., based in the Global Innovation Center (GIC) in Goose Island, Chicago, Illinois.[1] It is wholly owned by Mars, Incorporated. It is currently the largest manufacturer and marketer of chewing gum in the world.[2][3][4]
In 1892, Wrigley Jr. began packaging chewing gum with each can of baking powder. The chewing gum eventually became more popular than the baking powder and Wrigley's reoriented the company to produce the gum. The company currently sells its products in more than 180 countries and districts, maintains operations in over 50 countries, and has 21 production facilities in 14 countries including the United States, Mexico, Spain, the United Kingdom, France, the Czech Republic, Poland, Russia, China, India, Japan, Kenya, Taiwan, and Australia.[5]
In 2005, Wrigley purchased Life Savers and Altoids from Kraft Foods for US$1.5 billion.[6] On January 23, 2007, Wrigley signed a purchase agreement to acquire an 80% initial interest in A. Korkunov for $300 million with the remaining 20% to be acquired over time. On April 28, 2008, Mars announced that it would acquire Wrigley for approximately $23 billion.[7] Financing for the transaction was provided by Berkshire Hathaway, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan; Berkshire Hathaway held a minority equity investment in Wrigley until October 2016.[8][9]
The Wrigley Building on Michigan Avenue, one of Chicago's best-known landmarks on the Magnificent Mile, was originally the company's global headquarters until 2011, when it was sold to an investor group that included Zeller Realty Group as well as Groupon co-founders Eric Lefkofsky and Brad Keywell.[10] The company headquartered in the GIC in 2012 since.

Corporate leadership[edit]
1891–1932: William Wrigley Jr.[edit]
In 1891, 29-year-old William Wrigley Jr. (1861–1932) came to Chicago from Philadelphia with $32 and the idea to start a business selling Wrigley's Scouring Soap. Wrigley offered premiums as an incentive to buy his soap, such as baking powder. Later in his career, he switched to the baking powder business, in which he began offering two packages of chewing gum for each purchase of a can of baking powder. The popular premium, chewing gum, began to seem more promising. Wrigley also became the majority owner of the Chicago Cubs in 1921.

After the death of William Wrigley Jr., his son Philip K. Wrigley (1894–1977) assumed his father's position as CEO of the Wrigley Company. Wrigley is most well known for his unusual move to support US troops and protect the reputation of the Wrigley brand during World War II, in which he dedicated the entire output of Wrigley's Spearmint, Doublemint, and Juicy Fruit to the US Armed Forces. Wrigley launched the "Remember this Wrapper" ad campaign to keep the Wrigley brands on the minds of the customers during times of wartime rationing.[6]
1961–1999: William Wrigley III[edit]
In 1961, Philip K. Wrigley handed control to his son, William Wrigley III (1933–1999). Wrigley led a strategic global expansion through the establishment of Wrigley facilities in nine new countries.[6] On June 26, 1974, a Marsh Supermarket in Troy, Ohio installed the first bar code scanning equipment. The first product to be scanned using a Universal Product Code (UPC) bar code was a 10-pack of Wrigley's Juicy Fruit gum.[11] (This pack of gum is now on display at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History.) In 1984, Wrigley introduced a new gum, Extra, which followed the new trend of sugar-free gums in the US.[6] Wrigley also assumed control of the Chicago Cubs after his father's death in 1977, and sold the team to the Chicago Tribune in 1981.
1999–2006: William Wrigley IV[edit]
William "Bill" Wrigley IV (1963–), following the death of Wrigley III (his father), led the sugar-free gum campaign across Europe, Australia, Spain, India, and China.[6] In 2005, Kraft Foods sold the Life Savers and Altoids businesses to Wrigley in exchange for $1.5 billion as part of a reorganization plan.[12] Wrigley led the establishment of the Wrigley Science Institute (WSI) in 2006 to study the oral health benefits of gum chewing. The WSI investigates the effects of gum chewing on weight management, stress relief, concentration, and oral health.[6]
2006–2008: William Perez[edit]
On October 23, 2006, William D. Perez (1948–) succeeded Bill Wrigley as CEO. He was the first person outside the Wrigley family to head the company. In 2007, the company debuted 5 Gum in the US. The 5 Gum brand was marketed using cinematic TV commercials portraying "What it feels like to chew 5 Gum". Perez led the efforts of improving slimmer packaging (Slim Pack) with flavor improvements across both Extra and Wrigley brands.[6]
2008–2011: Dushan "Duke" Petrovich[edit]
Dushan Petrovich (1954–) succeeded Perez almost immediately after Mars, Incorporated's 2008 purchase of Wrigley. In 2009, Wrigley's Global Innovation Center received the LEED Gold Certification through Wrigley's commitment to global sustainability. In the 2010 Olympic Games in Vancouver, British Columbia, Wrigley was the Official Confectionery Supplier of the games, in which the company sported Olympic-themed packs and products.[6]
2011–present: Martin Radvan[edit]
Martin Radvan became the president of the Wrigley Company after Petrovich. He is responsible for the company’s worldwide strategy, operations and business performance.[13]

Changes in gum[edit]
In some countries, xylitol is used to sweeten gum instead of aspartame. By avoiding sugar, the chance of tooth decay is lowered, since the sugar otherwise used may turn into acid after chewing the gum. It is also claimed that in chewing, it may help to remove food residues. Xylitol-based products are allowed by the US Food and Drug Administration to make the medical claim that they do not promote dental cavities.[14]
New product[edit]
Wrigley temporarily halted production and sales of its new Alert energy gum as the Food and Drug Administration investigates the safety of caffeinated-food products.[15]

The Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company, known as the Wrigley Company, is an American chewing gum company founded on April 1, 1891, by William Wrigley Jr., based in the Global Innovation Center (GIC) in Goose Island, Chicago, Illinois.[1] It is wholly owned by Mars, Incorporated. It is currently the largest manufacturer and marketer of chewing gum in the world.[2][3][4]
In 1892, Wrigley Jr. began packaging chewing gum with each can of baking powder. The chewing gum eventually became more popular than the baking powder and Wrigley's reoriented the company to produce the gum. The company currently sells its products in more than 180 countries and districts, maintains operations in over 50 countries, and has 21 production facilities in 14 countries including the United States, Mexico, Spain, the United Kingdom, France, the Czech Republic, Poland, Russia, China, India, Japan, Kenya, Taiwan, and Australia.[5]
In 2005, Wrigley purchased Life Savers and Altoids from Kraft Foods for US$1.5 billion.[6] On January 23, 2007, Wrigley signed a purchase agreement to acquire an 80% initial interest in A. Korkunov for $300 million with the remaining 20% to be acquired over time. On April 28, 2008, Mars announced that it would acquire Wrigley for approximately $23 billion.[7] Financing for the transaction was provided by Berkshire Hathaway, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan; Berkshire Hathaway held a minority equity investment in Wrigley until October 2016.[8][9]
The Wrigley Building on Michigan Avenue, one of Chicago's best-known landmarks on the Magnificent Mile, was originally the company's global headquarters until 2011, when it was sold to an investor group that included Zeller Realty Group as well as Groupon co-founders Eric Lefkofsky and Brad Keywell.[10] The company headquartered in the GIC in 2012 since.

Corporate leadership[edit]
1891–1932: William Wrigley Jr.[edit]
In 1891, 29-year-old William Wrigley Jr. (1861–1932) came to Chicago from Philadelphia with $32 and the idea to start a business selling Wrigley's Scouring Soap. Wrigley offered premiums as an incentive to buy his soap, such as baking powder. Later in his career, he switched to the baking powder business, in which he began offering two packages of chewing gum for each purchase of a can of baking powder. The popular premium, chewing gum, began to seem more promising. Wrigley also became the majority owner of the Chicago Cubs in 1921.
1932–1961: Philip K. Wrigley[edit]
After the death of William Wrigley Jr., his son Philip K. Wrigley (1894–1977) assumed his father's position as CEO of the Wrigley Company. Wrigley is most well known for his unusual move to support US troops and protect the reputation of the Wrigley brand during World War II, in which he dedicated the entire output of Wrigley's Spearmint, Doublemint, and Juicy Fruit to the US Armed Forces. Wrigley launched the "Remember this Wrapper" ad campaign to keep the Wrigley brands on the minds of the customers during times of wartime rationing.[6]
1961–1999: William Wrigley III[edit]
In 1961, Philip K. Wrigley handed control to his son, William Wrigley III (1933–1999). Wrigley led a strategic global expansion through the establishment of Wrigley facilities in nine new countries.[6] On June 26, 1974, a Marsh Supermarket in Troy, Ohio installed the first bar code scanning equipment. The first product to be scanned using a Universal Product Code (UPC) bar code was a 10-pack of Wrigley's Juicy Fruit gum.[11] (This pack of gum is now on display at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History.) In 1984, Wrigley introduced a new gum, Extra, which followed the new trend of sugar-free gums in the US.[6] Wrigley also assumed control of the Chicago Cubs after his father's death in 1977, and sold the team to the Chicago Tribune in 1981.
1999–2006: William Wrigley IV[edit]
William "Bill" Wrigley IV (1963–), following the death of Wrigley III (his father), led the sugar-free gum campaign across Europe, Australia, Spain, India, and China.[6] In 2005, Kraft Foods sold the Life Savers and Altoids businesses to Wrigley in exchange for $1.5 billion as part of a reorganization plan.[12] Wrigley led the establishment of the Wrigley Science Institute (WSI) in 2006 to study the oral health benefits of gum chewing. The WSI investigates the effects of gum chewing on weight management, stress relief, concentration, and oral health.[6]
2006–2008: William Perez[edit]
On October 23, 2006, William D. Perez (1948–) succeeded Bill Wrigley as CEO. He was the first person outside the Wrigley family to head the company. In 2007, the company debuted 5 Gum in the US. The 5 Gum brand was marketed using cinematic TV commercials portraying "What it feels like to chew 5 Gum". Perez led the efforts of improving slimmer packaging (Slim Pack) with flavor improvements across both Extra and Wrigley brands.[6]
2008–2011: Dushan "Duke" Petrovich[edit]
Dushan Petrovich (1954–) succeeded Perez almost immediately after Mars, Incorporated's 2008 purchase of Wrigley. In 2009, Wrigley's Global Innovation Center received the LEED Gold Certification through Wrigley's commitment to global sustainability. In the 2010 Olympic Games in Vancouver, British Columbia, Wrigley was the Official Confectionery Supplier of the games, in which the company sported Olympic-themed packs and products.[6]
2011–present: Martin Radvan[edit]
Martin Radvan became the president of the Wrigley Company after Petrovich. He is responsible for the company’s worldwide strategy, operations and business performance.[13]

Changes in gum[edit]
In some countries, xylitol is used to sweeten gum instead of aspartame. By avoiding sugar, the chance of tooth decay is lowered, since the sugar otherwise used may turn into acid after chewing the gum. It is also claimed that in chewing, it may help to remove food residues. Xylitol-based products are allowed by the US Food and Drug Administration to make the medical claim that they do not promote dental cavities.[14]
New product[edit]
Wrigley temporarily halted production and sales of its new Alert energy gum as the Food and Drug Administration investigates the safety of caffeinated-food products.[15]

The Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company, known as the Wrigley Company, is an American chewing gum company founded on April 1, 1891, by William Wrigley Jr., based in the Global Innovation Center (GIC) in Goose Island, Chicago, Illinois.[1] It is wholly owned by Mars, Incorporated. It is currently the largest manufacturer and marketer of chewing gum in the world.[2][3][4]
In 1892, Wrigley Jr. began packaging chewing gum with each can of baking powder. The chewing gum eventually became more popular than the baking powder and Wrigley's reoriented the company to produce the gum. The company currently sells its products in more than 180 countries and districts, maintains operations in over 50 countries, and has 21 production facilities in 14 countries including the United States, Mexico, Spain, the United Kingdom, France, the Czech Republic, Poland, Russia, China, India, Japan, Kenya, Taiwan, and Australia.[5]
In 2005, Wrigley purchased Life Savers and Altoids from Kraft Foods for US$1.5 billion.[6] On January 23, 2007, Wrigley signed a purchase agreement to acquire an 80% initial interest in A. Korkunov for $300 million with the remaining 20% to be acquired over time. On April 28, 2008, Mars announced that it would acquire Wrigley for approximately $23 billion.[7] Financing for the transaction was provided by Berkshire Hathaway, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan; Berkshire Hathaway held a minority equity investment in Wrigley until October 2016.[8][9]
The Wrigley Building on Michigan Avenue, one of Chicago's best-known landmarks on the Magnificent Mile, was originally the company's global headquarters until 2011, when it was sold to an investor group that included Zeller Realty Group as well as Groupon co-founders Eric Lefkofsky and Brad Keywell.[10] The company headquartered in the GIC in 2012 since.

Corporate leadership[edit]
1891–1932: William Wrigley Jr.[edit]
In 1891, 29-year-old William Wrigley Jr. (1861–1932) came to Chicago from Philadelphia with $32 and the idea to start a business selling Wrigley's Scouring Soap. Wrigley offered premiums as an incentive to buy his soap, such as baking powder. Later in his career, he switched to the baking powder business, in which he began offering two packages of chewing gum for each purchase of a can of baking powder. The popular premium, chewing gum, began to seem more promising. Wrigley also became the majority owner of the Chicago Cubs in 1921.
1932–1961: Philip K. Wrigley[edit]
After the death of William Wrigley Jr., his son Philip K. Wrigley (1894–1977) assumed his father's position as CEO of the Wrigley Company. Wrigley is most well known for his unusual move to support US troops and protect the reputation of the Wrigley brand during World War II, in which he dedicated the entire output of Wrigley's Spearmint, Doublemint, and Juicy Fruit to the US Armed Forces. Wrigley launched the "Remember this Wrapper" ad campaign to keep the Wrigley brands on the minds of the customers during times of wartime rationing.[6]
1961–1999: William Wrigley III[edit]
In 1961, Philip K. Wrigley handed control to his son, William Wrigley III (1933–1999). Wrigley led a strategic global expansion through the establishment of Wrigley facilities in nine new countries.[6] On June 26, 1974, a Marsh Supermarket in Troy, Ohio installed the first bar code scanning equipment. The first product to be scanned using a Universal Product Code (UPC) bar code was a 10-pack of Wrigley's Juicy Fruit gum.[11] (This pack of gum is now on display at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History.) In 1984, Wrigley introduced a new gum, Extra, which followed the new trend of sugar-free gums in the US.[6] Wrigley also assumed control of the Chicago Cubs after his father's death in 1977, and sold the team to the Chicago Tribune in 1981.
1999–2006: William Wrigley IV[edit]
William "Bill" Wrigley IV (1963–), following the death of Wrigley III (his father), led the sugar-free gum campaign across Europe, Australia, Spain, India, and China.[6] In 2005, Kraft Foods sold the Life Savers and Altoids businesses to Wrigley in exchange for $1.5 billion as part of a reorganization plan.[12] Wrigley led the establishment of the Wrigley Science Institute (WSI) in 2006 to study the oral health benefits of gum chewing. The WSI investigates the effects of gum chewing on weight management, stress relief, concentration, and oral health.[6]
2006–2008: William Perez[edit]
On October 23, 2006, William D. Perez (1948–) succeeded Bill Wrigley as CEO. He was the first person outside the Wrigley family to head the company. In 2007, the company debuted 5 Gum in the US. The 5 Gum brand was marketed using cinematic TV commercials portraying "What it feels like to chew 5 Gum". Perez led the efforts of improving slimmer packaging (Slim Pack) with flavor improvements across both Extra and Wrigley brands.[6]
2008–2011: Dushan "Duke" Petrovich[edit]
Dushan Petrovich (1954–) succeeded Perez almost immediately after Mars, Incorporated's 2008 purchase of Wrigley. In 2009, Wrigley's Global Innovation Center received the LEED Gold Certification through Wrigley's commitment to global sustainability. In the 2010 Olympic Games in Vancouver, British Columbia, Wrigley was the Official Confectionery Supplier of the games, in which the company sported Olympic-themed packs and products.[6]
2011–present: Martin Radvan[edit]
Martin Radvan became the president of the Wrigley Company after Petrovich. He is responsible for the company’s worldwide strategy, operations and business performance.[13]

Changes in gum[edit]
In some countries, xylitol is used to sweeten gum instead of aspartame. By avoiding sugar, the chance of tooth decay is lowered, since the sugar otherwise used may turn into acid after chewing the gum. It is also claimed that in chewing, it may help to remove food residues. Xylitol-based products are allowed by the US Food and Drug Administration to make the medical claim that they do not promote dental cavities.[14]
New product[edit]
Wrigley temporarily halted production and sales of its new Alert energy gum as the Food and Drug Administration investigates the safety of caffeinated-food products.[15]

The Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company, known as the Wrigley Company, is an American chewing gum company founded on April 1, 1891, by William Wrigley Jr., based in the Global Innovation Center (GIC) in Goose Island, Chicago, Illinois.[1] It is wholly owned by Mars, Incorporated. It is currently the largest manufacturer and marketer of chewing gum in the world.[2][3][4]
In 1892, Wrigley Jr. began packaging chewing gum with each can of baking powder. The chewing gum eventually became more popular than the baking powder and Wrigley's reoriented the company to produce the gum. The company currently sells its products in more than 180 countries and districts, maintains operations in over 50 countries, and has 21 production facilities in 14 countries including the United States, Mexico, Spain, the United Kingdom, France, the Czech Republic, Poland, Russia, China, India, Japan, Kenya, Taiwan, and Australia.[5]
In 2005, Wrigley purchased Life Savers and Altoids from Kraft Foods for US$1.5 billion.[6] On January 23, 2007, Wrigley signed a purchase agreement to acquire an 80% initial interest in A. Korkunov for $300 million with the remaining 20% to be acquired over time. On April 28, 2008, Mars announced that it would acquire Wrigley for approximately $23 billion.[7] Financing for the transaction was provided by Berkshire Hathaway, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan; Berkshire Hathaway held a minority equity investment in Wrigley until October 2016.[8][9]
The Wrigley Building on Michigan Avenue, one of Chicago's best-known landmarks on the Magnificent Mile, was originally the company's global headquarters until 2011, when it was sold to an investor group that included Zeller Realty Group as well as Groupon co-founders Eric Lefkofsky and Brad Keywell.[10] The company headquartered in the GIC in 2012 since.

Corporate leadership[edit]
1891–1932: William Wrigley Jr.[edit]
In 1891, 29-year-old William Wrigley Jr. (1861–1932) came to Chicago from Philadelphia with $32 and the idea to start a business selling Wrigley's Scouring Soap. Wrigley offered premiums as an incentive to buy his soap, such as baking powder. Later in his career, he switched to the baking powder business, in which he began offering two packages of chewing gum for each purchase of a can of baking powder. The popular premium, chewing gum, began to seem more promising. Wrigley also became the majority owner of the Chicago Cubs in 1921.
1932–1961: Philip K. Wrigley[edit]
After the death of William Wrigley Jr., his son Philip K. Wrigley (1894–1977) assumed his father's position as CEO of the Wrigley Company. Wrigley is most well known for his unusual move to support US troops and protect the reputation of the Wrigley brand during World War II, in which he dedicated the entire output of Wrigley's Spearmint, Doublemint, and Juicy Fruit to the US Armed Forces. Wrigley launched the "Remember this Wrapper" ad campaign to keep the Wrigley brands on the minds of the customers during times of wartime rationing.[6]
1961–1999: William Wrigley III[edit]
In 1961, Philip K. Wrigley handed control to his son, William Wrigley III (1933–1999). Wrigley led a strategic global expansion through the establishment of Wrigley facilities in nine new countries.[6] On June 26, 1974, a Marsh Supermarket in Troy, Ohio installed the first bar code scanning equipment. The first product to be scanned using a Universal Product Code (UPC) bar code was a 10-pack of Wrigley's Juicy Fruit gum.[11] (This pack of gum is now on display at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History.) In 1984, Wrigley introduced a new gum, Extra, which followed the new trend of sugar-free gums in the US.[6] Wrigley also assumed control of the Chicago Cubs after his father's death in 1977, and sold the team to the Chicago Tribune in 1981.
1999–2006: William Wrigley IV[edit]
William "Bill" Wrigley IV (1963–), following the death of Wrigley III (his father), led the sugar-free gum campaign across Europe, Australia, Spain, India, and China.[6] In 2005, Kraft Foods sold the Life Savers and Altoids businesses to Wrigley in exchange for $1.5 billion as part of a reorganization plan.[12] Wrigley led the establishment of the Wrigley Science Institute (WSI) in 2006 to study the oral health benefits of gum chewing. The WSI investigates the effects of gum chewing on weight management, stress relief, concentration, and oral health.[6]
2006–2008: William Perez[edit]
On October 23, 2006, William D. Perez (1948–) succeeded Bill Wrigley as CEO. He was the first person outside the Wrigley family to head the company. In 2007, the company debuted 5 Gum in the US. The 5 Gum brand was marketed using cinematic TV commercials portraying "What it feels like to chew 5 Gum". Perez led the efforts of improving slimmer packaging (Slim Pack) with flavor improvements across both Extra and Wrigley brands.[6]
2008–2011: Dushan "Duke" Petrovich[edit]
Dushan Petrovich (1954–) succeeded Perez almost immediately after Mars, Incorporated's 2008 purchase of Wrigley. In 2009, Wrigley's Global Innovation Center received the LEED Gold Certification through Wrigley's commitment to global sustainability. In the 2010 Olympic Games in Vancouver, British Columbia, Wrigley was the Official Confectionery Supplier of the games, in which the company sported Olympic-themed packs and products.[6]
2011–present: Martin Radvan[edit]
Martin Radvan became the president of the Wrigley Company after Petrovich. He is responsible for the company’s worldwide strategy, operations and business performance.[13]

Changes in gum[edit]
In some countries, xylitol is used to sweeten gum instead of aspartame. By avoiding sugar, the chance of tooth decay is lowered, since the sugar otherwise used may turn into acid after chewing the gum. It is also claimed that in chewing, it may help to remove food residues. Xylitol-based products are allowed by the US Food and Drug Administration to make the medical claim that they do not promote dental cavities.[14]
New product[edit]
Wrigley temporarily halted production and sales of its new Alert energy gum as the Food and Drug Administration investigates the safety of caffeinated-food products.[15]

Signature





William L. Wrigley Jr. (September 30, 1861 – January 26, 1932) was an American chewing gum industrialist. He was founder and eponym of the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company in 1891. He was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Wrigley Jr. is rumored to have co-founded his namesake company with a lesser-known Canadian named M. Bessemer, who was a close childhood friend of Wrigley Jr.[2]

Life[edit]
Wrigley was born on September 30, 1861, during the Civil War, in Philadelphia.
In 1891, at the age of 29, Wrigley moved from Philadelphia to Chicago. He had $32 to his name and with it he formed a business to sell Wrigley's Scouring Soap. He offered customers small premiums, particularly baking powder, as an incentive to buy his soap. Finding the baking powder was more popular than his soap, Wrigley switched to selling baking powder, and giving his customers two packages of chewing gum for each can of baking powder they purchased. Again, Wrigley found that the premium he offered was more popular than his base product, and his company began to concentrate on the manufacture and sale of chewing gum. In this business, Wrigley made his name and fortune.
Wrigley played an instrumental role in the development of Santa Catalina Island, California, off the shore of Los Angeles, California. He bought a controlling interest in the Santa Catalina Island Company in 1919 and with the company received the island. Wrigley improved the island with public utilities, new steamships, a hotel, the Casino building, and extensive plantings of trees, shrubs, and flowers. He also sought to create an enterprise that would help employ local residents. By making use of clay and minerals found on the island at a beach near Avalon, in 1927 William Wrigley Jr. created the Pebbly Beach quarry and tile plant. Along with creating jobs for Avalon residents, the plant also supplied material for Wrigley's numerous building projects on the island.[3] After the building of Avalon's Casino (see Avalon Theater (Catalina)) in 1929, the Catalina Clay Products Tile and Pottery Plant began producing glazed tiles, dinnerware and other household items such as bookends.[4]
Another of Wrigley's legacies was his plan for the future of Catalina Island—that it be protected for future generations to enjoy. In 1972, his son, Philip K. Wrigley, established the Catalina Island Conservancy for this purpose and transferred all family ownership to it. Wrigley is honored by the Wrigley Memorial in the Wrigley Botanical Gardens on the island.
In 1916, Wrigley bought a minority stake in the Chicago Cubs baseball team as part of a group headed by Charles Weeghman, former owner of the Federal League's Chicago Whales. Over the next four years, as Weeghman's lunch-counter business declined, he was forced to sell much of his stock in the ball club to Wrigley. By 1918, Weeghman had sold all of his stock to Wrigley, making Wrigley the largest shareholder and principal owner, and by 1921, Wrigley was majority owner. Wrigley Field, the Cubs' ballpark in Chicago, is named for him. The now-demolished former home of the Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast League, at that time the Cubs' top farm team, was also called Wrigley Field. Wrigley purchased the Chicago Cubs from Albert Lasker in 1925.[5]
The Arizona Biltmore Hotel in Phoenix, Arizona, was partially financed and wholly owned by Wrigley, who finished the nearby Wrigley Mansion as a winter cottage in 1931. At 16,000 square feet (1,500 m2), it was the smallest of his five residences.
Death[edit]
William Wrigley Jr. died on January 26, 1932, at his Phoenix, Arizona mansion, at age 70, and was interred in his custom-designed sarcophagus located in the tower of the Wrigley Memorial & Botanical Gardens near his beloved home on California's Catalina Island. In 1947, Wrigley's remains were moved to allow the gardens to be made public.[6] There is a rumor that the remains were moved during World War II due to "wartime security concerns". His original grave memorial marker still adorns the tower site. Wrigley was reinterred in the corridor alcove end of the Sanctuary of Gratitude, at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. He left his fortune to daughter Dorothy Wrigley Offield and son Philip K. Wrigley. The son continued to run the company until his death in 1977. His ashes were interred near his father, in the same Sanctuary of Gratitude alcove.
His great-grandson, William Wrigley Jr. II, is the executive chairman and former CEO of the Wrigley Company. Wrigley was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 2000.

The Arizona Biltmore Hotel in Phoenix, Arizona, was partially financed and wholly owned by Wrigley, who finished the nearby Wrigley Mansion as a winter cottage in 1931. At 16,000 square feet (1,500 m2), it was the smallest of his five residences.
Death[edit]
William Wrigley Jr. died on January 26, 1932, at his Phoenix, Arizona mansion, at age 70, and was interred in his custom-designed sarcophagus located in the tower of the Wrigley Memorial & Botanical Gardens near his beloved home on California's Catalina Island. In 1947, Wrigley's remains were moved to allow the gardens to be made public.[6] There is a rumor that the remains were moved during World War II due to "wartime security concerns". His original grave memorial marker still adorns the tower site. Wrigley was reinterred in the corridor alcove end of the Sanctuary of Gratitude, at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. He left his fortune to daughter Dorothy Wrigley Offield and son Philip K. Wrigley. The son continued to run the company until his death in 1977. His ashes were interred near his father, in the same Sanctuary of Gratitude alcove.
His great-grandson, William Wrigley Jr. II, is the executive chairman and former CEO of the Wrigley Company. Wrigley was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 2000.

Signature





William L. Wrigley Jr. (September 30, 1861 – January 26, 1932) was an American chewing gum industrialist. He was founder and eponym of the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company in 1891. He was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Wrigley Jr. is rumored to have co-founded his namesake company with a lesser-known Canadian named M. Bessemer, who was a close childhood friend of Wrigley Jr.[2]

Life[edit]
Wrigley was born on September 30, 1861, during the Civil War, in Philadelphia.
In 1891, at the age of 29, Wrigley moved from Philadelphia to Chicago. He had $32 to his name and with it he formed a business to sell Wrigley's Scouring Soap. He offered customers small premiums, particularly baking powder, as an incentive to buy his soap. Finding the baking powder was more popular than his soap, Wrigley switched to selling baking powder, and giving his customers two packages of chewing gum for each can of baking powder they purchased. Again, Wrigley found that the premium he offered was more popular than his base product, and his company began to concentrate on the manufacture and sale of chewing gum. In this business, Wrigley made his name and fortune.
Wrigley played an instrumental role in the development of Santa Catalina Island, California, off the shore of Los Angeles, California. He bought a controlling interest in the Santa Catalina Island Company in 1919 and with the company received the island. Wrigley improved the island with public utilities, new steamships, a hotel, the Casino building, and extensive plantings of trees, shrubs, and flowers. He also sought to create an enterprise that would help employ local residents. By making use of clay and minerals found on the island at a beach near Avalon, in 1927 William Wrigley Jr. created the Pebbly Beach quarry and tile plant. Along with creating jobs for Avalon residents, the plant also supplied material for Wrigley's numerous building projects on the island.[3] After the building of Avalon's Casino (see Avalon Theater (Catalina)) in 1929, the Catalina Clay Products Tile and Pottery Plant began producing glazed tiles, dinnerware and other household items such as bookends.[4]
Another of Wrigley's legacies was his plan for the future of Catalina Island—that it be protected for future generations to enjoy. In 1972, his son, Philip K. Wrigley, established the Catalina Island Conservancy for this purpose and transferred all family ownership to it. Wrigley is honored by the Wrigley Memorial in the Wrigley Botanical Gardens on the island.
In 1916, Wrigley bought a minority stake in the Chicago Cubs baseball team as part of a group headed by Charles Weeghman, former owner of the Federal League's Chicago Whales. Over the next four years, as Weeghman's lunch-counter business declined, he was forced to sell much of his stock in the ball club to Wrigley. By 1918, Weeghman had sold all of his stock to Wrigley, making Wrigley the largest shareholder and principal owner, and by 1921, Wrigley was majority owner. Wrigley Field, the Cubs' ballpark in Chicago, is named for him. The now-demolished former home of the Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast League, at that time the Cubs' top farm team, was also called Wrigley Field. Wrigley purchased the Chicago Cubs from Albert Lasker in 1925.[5]
The Arizona Biltmore Hotel in Phoenix, Arizona, was partially financed and wholly owned by Wrigley, who finished the nearby Wrigley Mansion as a winter cottage in 1931. At 16,000 square feet (1,500 m2), it was the smallest of his five residences.
Death[edit]
William Wrigley Jr. died on January 26, 1932, at his Phoenix, Arizona mansion, at age 70, and was interred in his custom-designed sarcophagus located in the tower of the Wrigley Memorial & Botanical Gardens near his beloved home on California's Catalina Island. In 1947, Wrigley's remains were moved to allow the gardens to be made public.[6] There is a rumor that the remains were moved during World War II due to "wartime security concerns". His original grave memorial marker still adorns the tower site. Wrigley was reinterred in the corridor alcove end of the Sanctuary of Gratitude, at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. He left his fortune to daughter Dorothy Wrigley Offield and son Philip K. Wrigley. The son continued to run the company until his death in 1977. His ashes were interred near his father, in the same Sanctuary of Gratitude alcove.
His great-grandson, William Wrigley Jr. II, is the executive chairman and former CEO of the Wrigley Company. Wrigley was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 2000.

William L. Wrigley Jr. (September 30, 1861 – January 26, 1932) was an American chewing gum industrialist. He was founder and eponym of the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company in 1891. He was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Wrigley Jr. is rumored to have co-founded his namesake company with a lesser-known Canadian named M. Bessemer, who was a close childhood friend of Wrigley Jr.[2]

Life[edit]
Wrigley was born on September 30, 1861, during the Civil War, in Philadelphia.
In 1891, at the age of 29, Wrigley moved from Philadelphia to Chicago. He had $32 to his name and with it he formed a business to sell Wrigley's Scouring Soap. He offered customers small premiums, particularly baking powder, as an incentive to buy his soap. Finding the baking powder was more popular than his soap, Wrigley switched to selling baking powder, and giving his customers two packages of chewing gum for each can of baking powder they purchased. Again, Wrigley found that the premium he offered was more popular than his base product, and his company began to concentrate on the manufacture and sale of chewing gum. In this business, Wrigley made his name and fortune.
Wrigley played an instrumental role in the development of Santa Catalina Island, California, off the shore of Los Angeles, California. He bought a controlling interest in the Santa Catalina Island Company in 1919 and with the company received the island. Wrigley improved the island with public utilities, new steamships, a hotel, the Casino building, and extensive plantings of trees, shrubs, and flowers. He also sought to create an enterprise that would help employ local residents. By making use of clay and minerals found on the island at a beach near Avalon, in 1927 William Wrigley Jr. created the Pebbly Beach quarry and tile plant. Along with creating jobs for Avalon residents, the plant also supplied material for Wrigley's numerous building projects on the island.[3] After the building of Avalon's Casino (see Avalon Theater (Catalina)) in 1929, the Catalina Clay Products Tile and Pottery Plant began producing glazed tiles, dinnerware and other household items such as bookends.[4]
Another of Wrigley's legacies was his plan for the future of Catalina Island—that it be protected for future generations to enjoy. In 1972, his son, Philip K. Wrigley, established the Catalina Island Conservancy for this purpose and transferred all family ownership to it. Wrigley is honored by the Wrigley Memorial in the Wrigley Botanical Gardens on the island.
In 1916, Wrigley bought a minority stake in the Chicago Cubs baseball team as part of a group headed by Charles Weeghman, former owner of the Federal League's Chicago Whales. Over the next four years, as Weeghman's lunch-counter business declined, he was forced to sell much of his stock in the ball club to Wrigley. By 1918, Weeghman had sold all of his stock to Wrigley, making Wrigley the largest shareholder and principal owner, and by 1921, Wrigley was majority owner. Wrigley Field, the Cubs' ballpark in Chicago, is named for him. The now-demolished former home of the Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast League, at that time the Cubs' top farm team, was also called Wrigley Field. Wrigley purchased the Chicago Cubs from Albert Lasker in 1925.[5]
The Arizona Biltmore Hotel in Phoenix, Arizona, was partially financed and wholly owned by Wrigley, who finished the nearby Wrigley Mansion as a winter cottage in 1931. At 16,000 square feet (1,500 m2), it was the smallest of his five residences.
Death[edit]
William Wrigley Jr. died on January 26, 1932, at his Phoenix, Arizona mansion, at age 70, and was interred in his custom-designed sarcophagus located in the tower of the Wrigley Memorial & Botanical Gardens near his beloved home on California's Catalina Island. In 1947, Wrigley's remains were moved to allow the gardens to be made public.[6] There is a rumor that the remains were moved during World War II due to "wartime security concerns". His original grave memorial marker still adorns the tower site. Wrigley was reinterred in the corridor alcove end of the Sanctuary of Gratitude, at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. He left his fortune to daughter Dorothy Wrigley Offield and son Philip K. Wrigley. The son continued to run the company until his death in 1977. His ashes were interred near his father, in the same Sanctuary of Gratitude alcove.
His great-grandson, William Wrigley Jr. II, is the executive chairman and former CEO of the Wrigley Company. Wrigley was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 2000.

The Story of Wrigley


Leadership, Innovation & Integrity 
Today, the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company is a global organization with operations in more than 50 nations, distributing products to more than 180 countries. Its heritage is filled with stories of leadership, innovation, and integrity, but its origins begin over a century ago when a Chicago businessman decided to offer his customers a little “something for nothing.” 
 
 In 1891, William Wrigley Jr. came to Chicago with $32 in his pocket and a check from his uncle for $5,000 to start a new business.   
A Bold Entrepreneur 
The year was 1891, and the businessman was William Wrigley Jr. Born in Philadelphia, Wrigley Jr. had moved to Chicago and was selling necessities like soap and baking powder, when he noticed a rather curious trend: The sticks of gum he was giving away for free as incentives were proving more popular than the merchandise itself. 
A born entrepreneur with a knack for identifying opportunities where others only saw risk, Wrigley Jr. quickly directed his prodigious energies toward producing his own line of gums. One of his first aims was to combat the lingering stereotype that only women should chew gum. Two of the company’s earliest products — Sweet Sixteen Orange and Lotta Gum —revolutionized chewing gum’s appeal, spreading interest to the youth market and then to the public at large. 
In 1893, during an economic depression, he introduced two brands that would become company icons: Wrigley’s Spearmint® and Juicy Fruit®. And when an even more debilitating economic downturn arrived in 1907, Wrigley did the unthinkable, mortgaging everything he owned to launch a massive advertising campaign, a move that skyrocketed the company into national prominence and set the stage for the company’s future groundbreaking advertising strategies. 
A Legacy of Business Leadership 
During his company’s meteoric rise, Wrigley Jr. established himself as one of the nation’s leading champions of employee rights and benefits, creating a health and welfare department in Wrigley’s Chicago factory in 1916 and granting his employees both Saturdays and Sundays off in 1924. During the Great Depression, the company went one step further, boldly setting minimum wage levels so its workers could have financial security during one of the nation’s darkest hours. 
 Wrigley employees during the early 20th century enjoyed benefits available to few other contemporary factory workers. 
Wrigley Jr. is also remembered as the father of modern advertising, coining the familiar maxim “Tell ’em quick and tell ’em often.” In 1915, he organized the first-ever nationwide direct marketing campaign, shipping sticks of gum to every address listed in U.S. phone books. But it was Wrigley Jr.’s son Philip, named company president in 1925, who artfully expanded the company’s reach even further by sponsoring radio programs and pioneering the placement of ads in the “funny pages” of newspapers. 
 
From 1932 to 1962, the company would harness the clean air-brushed style of artist Otis Shepard to illustrate the iconic Doublemint Twins and immortal “Remember This Wrapper” World War II ads, influencing the look and feel of product advertisements for generations to come. 
 
Seeking New Opportunities 
During World War II, when Wrigley was cut off from its supply of ingredients, it halted production of its flagship brands rather than compromise on their quality, reserving its established products for soldiers fighting overseas while introducing a wartime substitute named Orbit® at home. 
 
After World War II, as Wrigley botanists scoured the Amazon for new ingredients, the company introduced new brands, including Big Red® and Freedent®, while pursuing the opportunity for international expansion. The company opened new production facilities in nine countries between 1960 and 2000, including China, which now ranks second only to the U.S. in product sales. And in 1989, Wrigley was one of the first companies to begin marketing products in the former Eastern Bloc. 
Principles in Action 
In 2008, two companies that share a commitment to producing high-quality goods joined forces when Mars, Incorporated acquired Wrigley. Today, their approach to business is guided by the Mars Five Principles of Quality, Responsibility, Mutuality, Efficiency, and Freedom. By putting these principles into action every day, Wrigley is able to make a difference for people and the planet through its performance. 
Making A Difference For People 
Wrigley continues to expand its efforts to make a difference for people through programs that benefit both the company and the communities it serves. Since 1987, the Wrigley Company Foundation has provided more than $70 million to non-profit organizations and communities worldwide. The Wrigley Oral Healthcare Program offers health and hygiene education in key markets around the globe. As part of the Mars Volunteer Program, Wrigley associates around the world donate thousands of volunteer hours to their communities every year. Through the Mars Ambassador Program, associates become immersed in community service projects around the world, volunteering their time and expertise for days and weeks at a time.  
Making A Difference For The Planet 
As Wrigley runs its day-to-day business, it does so with an honest commitment to the planet. Across the world, Wrigley is seeking to use fewer resources to run its factories and is becoming more efficient each year. The company’s commitment to ecological stewardship was magnified in 2005 with the construction of its Global Innovation Center (GIC), which became Wrigley’s global headquarters in 2012. Wrigley is also mindful of the impact its products have on the environment by selecting ingredients and packaging materials with a lower footprint and working with communities to encourage more responsible disposal. Wrigley supports community education and litter-prevention campaigns in Australia, China, Germany, Ireland, the U.K. and the U.S. Wrigley associates are doing their part as well. Through participation in the company’s “Go Green” projects, associates are making sustainable behavior a way of life at Wrigley. 
Wrigley. Creating Simple Pleasures to Brighten Everyone's Day 
With operations in more than 40 countries and distribution in more than 180 countries, Wrigley’s brands continuously bring smiles to faces around the globe.

Our Founder
William Wrigley Jr. circa 1921.
William Wrigley Jr.
William Wrigley Jr. was born in Philadelphia in 1861, at the height of the Civil War. His father, William, Sr., was a soap manufacturer, and as a little boy, young William carried a basket through the streets of Philadelphia, selling Wrigley's Scouring Soap.
When he became a teenager, William took a full-time job as a soap salesman for his father. He had a talent for salesmanship, and he drove a horse and wagon from town to town, trying to convince stores to stock Wrigley's soap.
William Wrigley Jr. struck out on his own in the spring of 1891 when he was 30 years old. He left Philadelphia for Chicago with just $32 in his pocket and a dream of running his own business. He also had boundless energy and a gift for seeing things from his customers' point of view.
At the start of his new business in Chicago, William sold his father's Scouring Soap. As an extra incentive to merchants to stock the soap on their shelves, he offered "premiums" - free gifts, such as cans of baking powder.
Trouble was, baking powder turned out to be more popular than soap!
Rather than give up, William switched to the baking powder business.
One day in 1892, William got the idea of offering two free packages of chewing gum with each can of baking powder. The offer was a big success. Once again the premium - chewing gum - seemed to be more popular than the product it was designed to promote.
A year later, in 1893, William Wrigley Jr. introduced a new gum he called Juicy Fruit. And so began the world's most popular and successful chewing gum business!

William Wrigley

Perhaps one of the most famous names in the gum industry is William Wrigley.  Wrigley was the son of a soap salesman from Philadelphia, and at the age of thirteen, he was also selling soap.  At the age of 30, he moved to Chicago to open a new branch of his father’s company and came up with an idea to provide “premiums” to vendors who purchased a certain amount of soap.  These premiums included baking powder, cookbooks, and umbrellas. 14.  The baking powder sales surpassed the popularity of the soap, so Wrigley made that his primary product and offered gum as a premium, the very same development from John Curtis.  Once again, the premium’s popularity surpassed that of the product, and Wrigley entered the gum industry.  Wrigley hired the Zero Gum Company to manufacture gum for him, and it was here that the Wrigley’s industry started.  He introduced a series of branded gums in 1983, including Juicy Fruit and Spearmint.  In 1898, he founded William Wrigley Jr. Company. 15.  

William Wrigley Jr.
While this type of industry-making is nothing new or special, what set Wrigley apart from his competitors, including the Adams company, was his marketing and advertising.  Wrigley is famously quoted as saying, “Anyone can make gum. The trick is to sell it.”16.  And sell it he did.  Wrigley began by doing a modest advertising campaign in 1906 in Buffalo, Rochester, and Syracuse, with successful results.  The campaign then evolved to massive billboards, placards in streetcars and subways, and one of the first electric signs, including a massive one in Times Square (the electricity bill of which was an annual $100,000).  The billboards then evolved to a linked line of 117 signs along the railroad between Atlantic City and Trenton, New Jersey advertising Wrigley’s Spearmint.  Between 1915 and 1917, Wrigley sent free samples of gum to everyone with a telephone book, a total of more than 8.5 million, and in another campaign, every child received two sticks of gum when they turned two, reaching 750,000 children. 17.  A brand-recognition study in the 1920s found that 65% of people listed Wrigley as their “top-of-mind” choice for chewing gum, while the nearest competitor scored only 10%. 18.  Wrigley’s advertising campaigns were what truly made gum popular throughout the country and a billion dollar industry.

Make a Good Product for a Fair Price–
Then Tell the World
This Is William Wrigley, Jr.’s, Formula for Success
By S. J. DUNCAN CLARK
from Illustrated World  (1922)
 � Ray Huff, ChicagoWilliam Wrigley, Jr., Came to Chicago in 1891 with $32. After Various Ventures, He Concentrated on Gum, Then Kept Telling the World About His Product, Which Brought Him Unbounded
Success. (Terms of Use)

[p.44] Telling the world has been the master strode in the Wrigley enterprise. Where others spent thousands, he spent millions; when others felt it the course of wisdom to retrench and cut down their advertising appropriations, he considered it to be the very time and opportunity to increase them. The bigger his business grew the more necessary he believed it to be to talk to the public about his product. He is still talking about it. Wherever there are newspapers and billboards you will find the familiar symbol of the Wrigley product. The small coins of a score of different currencies flow into the Wrigley coffers, and dimes grow to dollars and dollars to millions; but William Wrigley, Jr., is convinced the flow would dwindle and soon dry up if the spearhead and the slogan failed to appear daily as a reminder to old patrons and a persuader for new.
THE name of William Wrigley, Jr., is a household word in America. In Europe and the Orient and in the remote islands of the Seven Seas they have heard it. Everywhere it is linked in the public mind with the spear-head emblem of his product. “The Flavor Lasts” is a slogan which h as been translated into many tongues and tested by millions of people.
It is not mere idle curiosity which makes people interested in the personality behind a great commercial success, or in the methods by which the success was achieved. Any man who finds his way by enterprise, courage, and hard work to the goal of affluence will command the observation of his fellows, and they want to know how he did it.
The secret of William Wrigley, Jr.’s, success is symbolized by the white tower which stands at the very gateway to Chicago’s throbbing, teeming commercial center. It soars above the murky city— a thing of utility and loveliness. When the evening darkness falls upon the busy streets it can be seen against the sky—a pinnacle of almost ethereal beauty bathed in the soft radiance of electric light.
This is the tower which Wrigley built when success had come to him. It is an extraordinary combination of the practical and the idealistic, of actuality and imagination. This combination is the secret of the Wrigley achievement.
There are two things William Wrigley, Jr., said when interviewed which sustain this interpretation:
“I believe in the other fellow’s right to live. I cannot expect to do well in my business unless he is able to do well in his business.”
That is the substance of the practical idealism which has ruled the commercial methods of William Wrigley,
“Did you find my name anywhere on this building? Did you find any mention of Spearmint on its outside walls?” he asked. “People thought when I began to put this up that I would plaster my name all over it in letters big enough to be seen miles away. If you look when you go out you will find it in small letters over the front door—but you may have to look twice.”
He chuckled.
“As a matter of fact it was better advertising not to plaster my name on the building. People talk more about it. It is the unusual thing—the thing they didn’t expect me to do.”
And there you have the combination of actuality and imagination. The building is the substantial actuality, commanding attention everywhere, but it was imagination approaching genius which saw there was more to be gained by allowing it to tell its own story than by turning it into a billboard.

© Underwood & Underwood
The Wrigley Building, Which Symbolizes the Owner’s Secret of Success

The practical idealism of the man created a building in which it is a joy to work, not for himself alone, but for all [p.45] those associated with him in his business, from heads of departments to the elevator starter. In the methods which found their permanent monument in the Wrigley tower his practical idealism won the co-operation and good will of those with whom he dealt. He gave his customers good reason to be interested in the success of William Wrigley, Jr., and so they helped to make it.
An imagination which never lost touch with actuality carried him into boldly conceived plans for storming the world with publicity. Condensed, the secret of his achievement in gaining the patronage of multi-millions may be put in the following formula: “Make a good product for a fair price—then tell the world.”
But let him tell his own story. At a guess you would put him on the under side of fifty—and you would guess wrong. He suggests energy, tenacity, persistence. He is utterly without affectation. There is humor in his eye, and a short, crisp directness in his speech.
“I was a city boy,” he said, “born in Philadelphia fifty-eight years ago. I earned my first money taking care of a horse, and I got fifty cents a month. I was only nine years old, and too small to clean it, but I could feed it. I went to the public school, and every few weeks I was fired for getting into mischief. The principal said he liked me, but he just couldn’t keep school while I was in it. I ran away when 1 was eleven, and went to New York—sold newspapers, worked on a sailing vessel, two of ‘em, and then went back home and to school again. I might have stayed in school—I was in the senior grammar class—if I had not thought one day that an over-ripe pie was a fitting decoration for the nameplate on the school building. While one of my companions held my heels, I leaned over and did an artistic job of [p.46] plastering it. That was too much for the principal.
“My father was a manufacturer of scouring soap. He put me to work in his factory. I had to stir the soap in a big pot. It was not an interesting job, so, when I was thirteen, I asked father to make me a salesman. With some persuasion he agreed to try me out. I guess I made good, and that was the beginning of my interest in salesmanship. I learned a lot in the next few years. When I was nineteen I lit out with a chum for the West. We were headed for Colorado, but I lost my hat and our tickets out of the window of the train and we were stranded in Kansas City. I got a job in a restaurant, and later took to selling rubber stamps. Then, with a new outfit of clothes and presents for the folks, I headed home again, and went once more to selling soap.
“In the spring of 1891 I came to Chicago with thirty-two dollars and my experience. I rented desk room in an office on East Kinzie Street, and tried to sell more soap to Chicago. It was hard going for a while. Then I hit on the notion of offering the merchant the premium of an umbrella with every box of soap, raising the retail price to ten cents a cake and giving him at the same time a bigger margin of profit. It worked.
“Since then I have had varied experiences with premiums. I have both made and lost many thousands of dollars through their use. A fellow can’t always guess right, but the balance in the end is on the right side.
“I got into my present business through using chewing gum as a premium with baking powder. The gum became more popular than the baking powder, so I dropped the latter and concentrated my attention on the gum. Then I used premiums with the gum. I gave scales to every grocer who ordered fifteen dollars’ worth of gum. It was a good guess this time. I added other articles that would appeal to a grocer. I kept looking for opportunities to advertise my gum and get it before the people. Other manufacturers were advertising gum as a help to digestion. I saw that mine was displayed on the cash desks of restaurants, where patrons would see it when paying their checks after they had eaten.
“Then I began advertising. I tried out billboards in the South. In 1902 I decided to storm New York with publicity. I spent $100,000 and hardly made a ripple. It was money dropped into a hole, so far as anyone could see. I waited until I had another $100,000 and tried it again with the same result. I tried a third time, after recuperating, and this time with a quarter of a million. I wanted to get the dropped $200,000 back. I did— plus.
“In 1907, when everything was flat on its back and everybody was retrenching, particularly on advertising, I thought it was the ripe hour for a big national campaign. I put $3,000,000 into advertising contracts and covered the country. Men have called it plunging, but I thought I knew what I was doing. Since then we have spent more than $20,000,000 to tell the world about our product. I believe in advertising and I believe in advertising all the time. There is no such thing as getting a business so established that it does not need to advertise. Babies who never heard about you are being born every day, and people who once knew you forget you if you don’t keep them reminded constantly. Dull times are the very times when you need advertising most.
“Today our advertisements are printed [p.47] in a score of languages. We have factories in Chicago, Brooklyn, Toronto and Sydney, Australia. We are turning out nearly ten billion sticks of gum a year. They tell me our four plants turn out enough gum every day to reach from New York to Galveston and pretty nearly bridge the Gulf of Mexico if the sticks were laid end to end.
“There you have the story. There is no rule in this game except to use the best judgment you have, think hard, act quickly, and remember the other fellow has as good a right to live as you.”
Adjoining the office of William Wrigley, Jr., is that of Philip K. Wrigley, vice-president of the organization. It is a father and son concern, and there is no concealing the fact that the president is prouder of the vice-president than he is of the business or the building.
“Any man with the money can put up a building,” he says.
Money is often a handicap to bringing up a son, but as the world knows, Philip K. Wrigley—college man, aviator in the great war and now man of business—proves how well his father overcame this handicap. There are those who say this is his greatest achievement.

Nature bears long with those who wrong her. She is patient under abuse. But when abuse has gone too far, when the time of reckoning finally comes, she is equally slow to be appeased and to turn away her wrath. (1882)
-- Nathaniel Egleston, who was writing then about deforestation, but speaks equally well about the danger of climate change today.



Carl Sagan:
In science it often happens that scientists say, 'You know that's a really good argument; my position is mistaken,' and then they would actually change their minds and you never hear that old view from them again. They really do it. It doesn't happen as often as it should, because scientists are human and change is sometimes painful. But it happens every day. I cannot recall the last time something like that happened in politics or religion.

William Wrigley, Jr
Encyclopedia of World Biography 
COPYRIGHT 2004 The Gale Group Inc.




William Wrigley, Jr.By all accounts, William Wrigley (1861-1932) is the "father of chewing gum." He transformed a small business selling soap into the top chewing gum manufacturer in the world. Although he did not invent chewing gum, it was his company that brought it to the world. William Wrigley Jr. was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on September 30, 1861. His parents, William and Mary A. Ladley were second generation Americans. The Wrigley family traced its roots back to Saddleworth, a manufacturing town north of Yorkshire in England. The boy's great-grandfather, Edmund, was a woolen manufacturer in the "City of Brotherly Love," while his father went on to greater success as a soapmaker. In 1870, William Sr. founded and served as president of the Wrigley Manufacturing Company. The main product was Wrigley's Scouring Soap.The younger Wrigley took an immediate interest in his father's soap business, which opened as the public began viewing soap as a consumer good. A year after the plant opened, the boy went out into the streets of Philadelphia and sold soap from a basket. Catching the sales bug, Wrigley and a friend ran away to New York a year later. Wrigley supported himself by doing a number of odd jobs and selling newspapers.In the late 19th century rough and tumble New York City was no place for small little boys. The two returned home a few weeks later. Constantly in trouble at school, Wrigley left permanently (by some reports he was expelled) and went to work in his father's factory. He stirred a vat of liquid soap for $1.50 a week. As he learned the business, he moved into a regional sales job, either traveling by train throughout the Eastern states or selling soap from a bright red wagon with four horses and bells.Go West Young ManWrigley again tried to establish himself away from his father's business at the age of 18. He went West, but lost his railroad ticket in Kansas City. Eventually, he made it back to Philadelphia and William Sr.'s factory. He continued in the business for more than a decade before leaving again.In 1891, after working in the soap business for 20 years, Wrigley moved to Chicago at the age of 29 with his wife, Ada, and young daughter, Dorothy, to go into business for himself. He planned to sell soap in Chicago for his father's company and offer baking powder as a premium. For the rest of his business life, Wrigley advocated giving a bonus with each purchase. "Everybody likes something extra, for nothing," he often said.Although Wrigley arrived in Chicago with only $32 dollars in his pocket, he secured a $5,000 loan from an uncle on the condition that his cousin become Wrigley's business partner. When he realized that customers were more interested in getting the baking powder than soap, Wrigley and his partner quickly switched to the baking powder business. Looking for another premium to offer, Wrigley turned to chewing gum. This product had become popular in the 1860s after New York inventor, Thomas Adams, introduced chicle to the United States after a visit with the former Mexican dictator Santa Anna, who chewed the stuff while they spoke.Chewing Gum for the WorldWrigley gave away two packages of chewing gum with each baking soda purchase until he once again grasped that the premium was more popular than the product. In 1892, Wrigley Chewing Gum offered its first two brands: Lotta Gum and Vassar. Gradually, he phased out baking powder and soap and concentrated on chewing gum.The chewing gum business was highly competitive in the late 1800s. There were at least a dozen companies pushing their wares. In 1899, the six largest companies merged to form "the chewing gum trust." Although a newcomer to the industry, Wrigley was offered a place in the trust, but he refused. Under relentless competition, Wrigley teetered on the verge of bankruptcy several times, but plowed ahead nonetheless.

A natural promoter, Wrigley realized the power of advertising. Much of his company's budget focused on selling the product through advertisements and gimmicks. Wrigley himself did much of the selling in the early days and had a knack for understanding the customers' needs. He expanded his premium offers, giving away items ranging from lamps and razors to cookbooks and fishing tackle. The premium system worked so well that Wrigley even published premium catalogs to help customers choose what they wanted.Wrigley used every form of advertising at his disposal. In his company's ads, Wrigley repeatedly told people about the benefits of the product. He bought space in newspapers, magazines, and even outdoor posters. His motto was "tell em quick and tell em often."In 1893 and 1894, Wrigley introduced the flavors that would make the company eternal: Juicy Fruit and Wrigley's Spearmint. The enterprising Wrigley even designed the logo on the Spearmint package. He decided the company would concentrate on popularizing Spearmint, which no company had been able to achieve. The general public did not accept Spearmint at first. However, Wrigley believed in it and pushed it relentlessly. In 1907, a depression year, Wrigley spent $284,000 in advertising, mostly on Spearmint and with that much was able to buy over $1.5 million worth of advertising in cash-strapped New York. The gamble paid off when sales jumped dramatically. Company revenue topped $1.3 million in 1909 and a year later, Wrigley's Spearmint was the top selling gum in the United States. He introduced Doublemint gum in 1914.In short order, Wrigley became the biggest gum manufacturer in the world. He bought Zero Company in 1911, which had been making Wrigley's gum since 1892. From that point forward, the newly named William Wrigley Jr. Company manufactured its own products. Even as the company grew into a major corporation, Wrigley emphasized quality. He often recited his basic philosophy: "Even in a little thing like a stick of gum, quality is important."Wrigley also moved quickly into foreign nations. He established gum companies in Canada in 1910, then followed that factory with ones in Australia (1915), Great Britain (1927), and New Zealand (1939). Still relying heavily on advertising, Wrigley sold gum in nations around the world in 30 separate languages. By the time of his death in 1932, the global sales pushed company revenues to $75 million with a profit of $12 million. Countries abroad had different tastes than in the United States, so Wrigley introduced flavors

that would appeal to local customers. The most successful product outside America was a pellet-shaped gum sold under the "P.K." brand name.Bought the Chicago CubsA lifelong baseball fan, Wrigley loved to watch the hometown Chicago Cubs play. He spent many afternoons at the ballpark, joking with friends, drinking beer, and even handing out cigars to Cub players. Wrigley began buying stock in the team in 1916. Five years later, he had gained a controlling interest. In 1921, he also bought the Los Angeles Baseball Club and a team in Reading, Pennsylvania.After Wrigley bought the Cubs, the famous ballpark became known as Cubs Park. It was officially renamed Wrigley Field in 1926, in honor of its owner. Over the years, Wrigley invested more than $5 million in the team. He started renovations at "The Friendly Confines" (the ballpark's unofficial name since Wrigley took over), which permitted installation of permanent bleacher seating and expanded box seats. Wrigley also supervised the building of an upper deck.Wrigley's money did not stop at rebuilding Wrigley Field. He brought in quality ballplayers like Hack Wilson and Rogers Hornsby. By 1929, the team won its first pennant since 1918 and the first of four they would win over the next decade. Sadly, the team did not win a World Series in those trips to the championship. The team continued its success into the 1930s. Wrigley, however, passed away in 1932 and full control of the team passed to his son Philip Knight "P.K." Wrigley.Final YearsIn 1919, Wrigley bought Catalina Island, off the coast of California. He turned it into a family retreat and one of the most famous resorts in the country. Wrigley imported birds from all over the world to the island and kept them in a huge flying cage. He also mined on Catalina, finding rich reserves of silver, copper, and zinc.

Wrigley played a key role in the development of the island. With great enthusiasm and determination, he brought many improvements, including public utilities, steamships, a hotel and casino. He was also responsible for the planting of numerous trees, shrubs, and flowers. A Wrigley Memorial was built in 1933 and 1934 as a tribute to Wrigley's love for the island. His wife, Ada, came up with the idea for a massive garden on the island showcasing plants from around the world. The garden stretches for over 37 acres and is a tribute to the Wrigley's concern for conservation.In Chicago, he built the Wrigley Building in 1924, now on the National Register of Historic Places as part of a historic district. The Wrigley Building was an instant hit in Chicago, featuring a 27-story clock tower modeled on the Giralda Tower in Seville. It is actually two buildings, connected by a sky-bridge, where Michigan Avenue intersects with the Chicago River. Wrigley's wish was to create an impressive headquarters for his company. The building symbolizes Chicago for many people and has been seen in countless movies and television shows.In 1930, Wrigley bought the Arizona Biltmore, a winter resort outside Phoenix, inspired by the work of Frank Lloyd Wright. The Wrigley family owned the resort for over four decades before selling it in May 1973.When Wrigley died on January 26, 1932, The New York Times reported it was "of acute indigestion, complicated by apoplexy and heart disease." He passed away in a home he built near the Arizona resort. His simple philosophy was summed up, "To be always pleasant, always patient, always on time, and never to argue." He set the tone for the company by constantly telling his son, "We are a five-cent business, and nobody in this company can ever afford to forget it."Further ReadingCleary, David Powers, Great American Brands: The Success Formulas that Made Them Famous, Fairchild Publications, 1981.Hambleton, Ronald, The Branding of America: From Levi Strauss to Chrysler, from Westinghouse to Gillette, the Forgotten Fathers of America's Best-Known Brand Names, Yankee Books, 1987.New York Times, January 27, 1932; April 13, 1977; March 12, 1999."William Wrigley Jr. Company, Hoover's Database, 1999."The Story of Chewing Gum," William Wrigley Jr. Company, http://www.wrigley.com (November 1, 1999).

Wrigley, William, Jr.
Gale Encyclopedia of U.S. Economic History 
COPYRIGHT 2000 The Gale Group Inc.





WRIGLEY, WILLIAM, JR. 
William Wrigley, Jr. (1861–1932) was a salesman and industrialist. He started his career as a soap salesman and ended it as the owner of the largest chewing gum company in the United States. Wrigley was also the owner of the Chicago Cubs baseball team and had a baseball stadium in Chicago, Illinois, named after him.
William Wrigley, Jr. was born on September 30, 1861 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His father, William Wrigley, Sr., was a soap maker who had founded his own company, the Wrigley Manufacturing Company, in 1870. Wrigley worked for his father's company as a child, selling soap from a basket on the streets of Philadelphia. At the age of 11, Wrigley went to work in the soap factory. He stirred vats of liquid soap and earned $1.50 a week. When Wrigley was 13, he returned to sales. He traveled by train or wagon from town to town selling his father's soap. This early sales experience would prove to be useful for his later career as a businessman in his own right.
In 1891 Wrigley left his father's company with hopes of starting his own business. He left Philadelphia for Chicago with only $32 to his name, but an abundance of ambition and enthusiasm. In Chicago his uncle, William Scotchard, loaned him $5,000 to start his own business on the condition that his cousin become his partner. In April 1891, at the age of 29, Wrigley started his business selling Wrigley's scouring soap. He offered premiums to merchants as an incentive to buy his product. Wrigley gave merchants baking powder as a premium, but baking powder soon became a more popular product than soap, so Wrigley switched his main product. In 1892 he began to offer two packages of chewing gum as a premium in place of the baking powder. When demand for the chewing gum surpassed that for the baking powder, Wrigley once again switched products.
At that time there were about a dozen other companies selling chewing gum, but the industry was not developed. In 1892 Wrigley hired the Zero Manufacturing Company to produce chewing gum for him. That same year he introduced his first two brands of gum called Lotta and Vassar. In 1893 he introduced Juicy Fruit and Spearmint gums.
Initially Wrigley had to work hard to break into the chewing gum business because established companies offered products already popular with the public. Wrigley relied on his sales and advertising skills to promote his products and distinguish them from other brands of chewing gum. He continued to offer retailers premiums for carrying his product. The premiums included a variety of products, such as lamps, razors, and scales. In addition, he saw the advantage of familiarizing the public with his products through newspaper, magazine, and poster advertising.
In 1899 six of the largest gum manufacturers merged to form a "chewing gum trust." Wrigley was offered the opportunity to join the merger, but he refused. As he explained, "We propose to keep our identity . . . and if we cannot do business by fair and square methods, we prefer not to do business at all." The Wrigley Company still prides itself on this legacy of independence and integrity.
Though the company struggled during its early years, Wrigley's persistence and dedication paid off. In 1906 he put his advertising philosophy to the test. Wrigley had introduced Spearmint gum to the public several years earlier, but it was not initially very popular. In 1906 Wrigley began a limited advertising campaign in Buffalo, Rochester, and Syracuse, New York, to specifically promote Spearmint. The campaign was so successful that in 1907 Wrigley spent $284,000 to continue to promote this product across the country. As a result of this effort, Spearmint sales rose dramatically and reached over $1.3 million in 1909. By 1910 Wrigley's Spearmint was the most popular gum in the country.
The success of Spearmint made Wrigley the world's largest chewing gum maker. In 1911 Wrigley bought the Zero Manufacturing Company and established the William Wrigley, Jr. Company. He also began to expand his interests abroad. In 1910 he opened a factory in Canada, followed by factories in Australia in 1915, and Great Britain in 1927. Before Wrigley's death, his company had factories in Chicago, Manhattan, Brooklyn, Toronto, London, Berlin, Frankfurt, and Sydney. The company's expansion into international markets led to the creation of new products and flavors as well as new marketing techniques. Wrigley advertised in more than 30 languages and taught the world how to chew gum.
Wrigley retired as company president in 1915, though he continued to serve as chairman of the board. His son, Philip Knight Wrigley, took over the family business and Wrigley explored his other business and leisure interests. By 1921 Wrigley became principal owner of the Chicago Cubs and later acquired two other baseball teams. He also purchased Santa Catalina Island off the coast of California and turned it into a popular resort. When William Wrigley, Jr. died on January 26, 1932, his family business had already become one of the most popular brand names in the United States.
