The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions.







The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.  If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.







The 30-day dividend yield represents the average daily dividends for the 30-day period, annualized and divided by the net asset values per share at the end of the period; it is available the first quarter after the fund's inception. The SEC standardized yield is computed under an SEC standardized formula and reflects an estimated yield to maturity (assuming all portfolio securities are held to maturity); it is available the first month after the fund's inception.

	Fund(s): (1) if only one votes, that vote will bind all; (2) if more than one votes, the vote of the
	majority will bind all; and (3) if more than one votes and the vote is evenly divided, the vote will

	), currently organized as a sub-trust of a Massachusetts
	business trust, into a series of a newly formed Maryland corporation (each, a 

	* All share
	classes of a particular Fund would also be authorized under the new Corporation.


	By voting FOR the Reorganization
	with respect to your Fund, you will be agreeing to become a shareholder of a series of a Maryland Corporation.
	The names of the new Maryland Corporations and their series will differ slightly from the names of the
	existing Trusts and Funds due to their new structure (for example, the term Inc. will be
	added to the names of the Maryland Corporations and T. Rowe Price will be officially
	added to the beginning of certain Funds names). In addition, the sub-trusts of the T. Rowe
	Price California Tax-Free Income Trust and the T. Rowe Price State Tax-Free Income Trust will be
	organized as series of one Maryland Corporation to be called T. Rowe Price State Tax-Free Funds,
	Inc. The Reorganizations will not result in any changes to the investment objectives, principal investment
	strategies, investment adviser, portfolio managers, 12b-1 or 18f-3 plans, operations, or service providers
	of any of the Funds. In addition, the fees and expenses, including the management fee, will also remain
	the same. Shareholder account values immediately after a Reorganization will be the same as immediately
	before the Reorganization. Each Reorganization is expected to occur on or around the close of business
	on September 1, 2017 (the 

	Closing Date

	),
	although this date may be adjusted if deemed appropriate in accordance with the terms of the Plan.



	Has the Board approved the Reorganizations?



	At
	its meeting on October 24, 2016, the Board approved the Plan and determined that each Reorganization
	should be submitted to shareholders of the relevant Fund. If shareholders of a Fund approve the proposal,
	the Trust officers will implement the Reorganization transactions in accordance with the Plan on behalf
	of the Fund.


	What does the Board recommend?


	The Board unanimously recommends that shareholders of each Fund
	vote FOR the proposal with respect to their Fund.


	PAGE 8








	What
	is the reason for the proposal?


	The Trusts were organized as Massachusetts business trusts in 1985
	and 1986, a popular form of organization for mutual funds at the time. Over the last few decades, the
	percentage of mutual funds organized as Massachusetts business trusts has declined as an increasing number
	of funds have organized as Maryland corporations. The increasing use of the Maryland corporation structure
	for mutual funds is generally thought to be the result of certain advantages offered by Maryland law
	to mutual funds.


	In unanimously approving each Reorganization, the Board evaluated the information reasonably
	necessary to determine that the Reorganization would be in the best interests of the relevant Fund and
	its shareholders, and that the interests of the Funds shareholders would not be diluted as a result
	of the Reorganization.


	T. Rowe Price and the Board believe that the Funds will benefit in several ways
	by reorganizing from Massachusetts business trusts to Maryland corporations:



	o



	 



	More Efficient Proxy Process


	.

	Maryland and Massachusetts have different proxy requirements, which create
	significant redundancies and inefficiencies during a proxy campaign involving multiple funds domiciled
	in the two different jurisdictions. For example, each Trusts trust agreement, the current organizational
	document for the Trust, requires a record date of not more than 60 days prior to a shareholder meeting,
	whereas Maryland corporate law requires a record date of not more than 90 days, nor less than 10 days,
	prior to a shareholder meeting. The longer solicitation period available in Maryland would provide shareholders
	with more time to consider and vote on proposals, and it could also result in fewer adjournments and
	lower proxy solicitation expenses. In addition, the current trust agreements of the Trusts require more
	shareholder votes than would be required under Maryland law to constitute a quorum (the trust agreements
	require a majority of votes entitled to be cast at the meeting compared to Marylands minimum requirement
	of one-third of the shares entitled to vote). Because of these differences, it has been difficult for
	the T. Rowe Price Funds organized as Maryland corporations to share the same proxy statement with
	the T. Rowe Price Funds organized as Massachusetts business trusts and be part of the same proxy
	campaign even though all of the funds are holding a shareholder meeting at the same location on the same
	date. Generally, all of the Maryland Corporations have been included in a single proxy statement and
	all of the Massachusetts business trusts have been included in a separate proxy statement, which mails
	approximately 30 days after the proxy statement for the Maryland Corporations. This has fostered confusion
	for shareholders who own shares of T. Rowe Price Funds organized under both Massachusetts


	PAGE
	9








	and Maryland law and led to questions regarding the inability to vote all of their shares
	at the same time. Each Reorganization will benefit shareholders by making future complex-wide proxy campaigns
	for proposals impacting all of the T. Rowe Price Funds, such as the election of directors, less
	confusing to shareholders and more efficient and less costly to administer.



	o



	 



	Operational Streamlining


	.

	The Reorganizations will serve to standardize and conform the corporate
	governance of the Funds with the other funds in the T. Rowe Price family of funds. This standardization
	is expected to streamline the administration of the Funds, which may potentially result in cost savings
	to T. Rowe Price and the Funds and their shareholders, and more effective administration by eliminating
	differences in governing documents and controlling law. T. Rowe Price is headquartered in Maryland,
	the majority of its staff is located in Maryland, and the overwhelming majority of the T. Rowe Price
	Funds are already domiciled in Maryland. Because T. Rowe Price staff is in Maryland and not Massachusetts,
	all organizational documents may be hand delivered to the appropriate state regulatory agencies (which
	allows T. Rowe Price to determine immediately whether the state had any issues accepting the documents)
	rather than mailing documents to Massachusetts regulatory agencies or relying upon outside vendors to
	do so, which takes far more time and expense. Over the longer term, T. Rowe Price believes that
	the Reorganizations will also result in potential cost savings for T. Rowe Price, the T. Rowe
	Price Funds, and their shareholders. For example, issues arising under state law could be vetted with
	one outside law firm specializing in Maryland law rather than two separate outside experts currently
	needed to vet issues under both Maryland and Massachusetts law. Since there are a smaller number of T. Rowe
	Price Funds domiciled in Massachusetts splitting those costs, the Funds could potentially bear a larger
	cost than if they were domiciled in Maryland and splitting those costs with the rest of the T. Rowe
	Price Funds. In addition, if the Reorganizations are approved, it would no longer be necessary to pay
	fees to an outside vendor to file documents with state regulators on behalf of the Funds.



	o



	 



	More Legal Certainty

	. The comprehensive body of law in Maryland may
	reduce legal uncertainty and risk and provide the Funds directors and management with greater certainty
	and predictability in managing fund affairs. For example, Maryland law provides comparatively greater
	certainty with regard to limiting the liability of shareholders for obligations of a fund or its directors.



	o



	 



	Opportunity
	to Modernize Governing Instruments


	.

	The Trusts organizational documents were all written more than 30 years ago and, as a result, their
	governing instruments do not reflect the current governing framework available to mutual funds registered
	under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940


	PAGE 10








	Act). The Reorganizations will have the benefit of eliminating any outdated provisions,
	and adding more modern provisions that could benefit Fund shareholders by increasing flexibility of operations
	and governance. For example: (1) the form of Maryland charters that would apply if the Reorganizations
	are approved (attached hereto in Appendix C) provide more flexibility in how a shareholder vote may be
	obtained because they permit multiple funds organized under one corporation to vote together in certain
	instances, whereas the current trust agreements of the Trusts only allow the Funds to vote together if
	required by law; (2) the Trusts organizational documents have more stringent shareholder voting
	requirements for reorganizations and mergers than the current governing framework available to mutual
	funds; (3) the form of Maryland charters contain more modern provisions relating to the requirements
	for closing a fund that is a series of a corporation; and (4) Maryland law provides more flexibility
	to funds in litigation, as a Maryland corporation can be a named litigant; in Massachusetts, on the other
	hand, a lawsuit must be brought by the trustees, as a business trust cannot bring a lawsuit directly.


	In
	approving each Reorganization, the Board also considered that the Reorganization will not result in any
	changes to the investment objective, principal investment strategies, investment adviser, portfolio managers,
	12b-1 or 18f-3 plans, operations, or service providers of the relevant Fund. Each series of a Maryland
	Corporation (each, a

	


	New Fund


	,



	and collectively, the

	New Funds

	)


	and its classes (if applicable) will maintain the same
	investment portfolio and offer the same shareholder services, rights, and privileges as its corresponding
	Massachusetts-domiciled Fund and its classes. The fees and expenses, including the management fee, will
	also remain the same. Thus, on the effective date of the Reorganization, a Fund shareholder would hold
	an interest in the applicable New Fund that is equivalent to the previous interest in the existing Fund.
	Lastly, the Board considered that there are no anticipated direct or indirect federal income tax consequences
	of a Reorganization to any of a Funds shareholders.



	How would each Reorganization be accomplished?



	By approving the proposal,
	you will be authorizing the Reorganization of your Trust and Fund from a Massachusetts business trust
	and sub-trust to a Maryland corporation and series thereunder on the Closing Date, in accordance with
	the terms of the Plan. The following discussion about the Plan is only a summary. It is qualified in
	its entirety by reference to the Plan, a form of which is attached hereto as Appendix A.


	PAGE 11









	Summary of the Plan



	The Plan is subject to the
	approval of a Funds shareholders and certain other conditions. A form of the Plan, which is summarized
	below, is attached as Appendix A to this Proxy Statement.


	Under the Plan, the Reorganization of a Fund
	will be accomplished by the transfer by the Fund of all of its assets to its corresponding New Fund in
	exchange solely for (as applicable) Investor Class, Advisor Class, I Class, and R Class shares of beneficial
	interest of the New Fund (

	


	New Fund Shares


	

	),
	the assumption by the New Fund of all liabilities of the Fund, and the distribution of New Fund Shares
	to the shareholders of the corresponding Fund in complete liquidation of the Fund.



	o



	 


	Subject to the conditions described in the Plan, on the
	Closing Date, a Fund will distribute, in complete liquidation, New Fund Shares to each Fund shareholder,
	determined as of the close of business on the


	business day immediately preceding the Closing Date (

	Valuation Date

	), of the Fund pro rata in proportion
	to such shareholders beneficial interest and in exchange for that shareholders Fund shares.



	o



	 


	The
	number of full and fractional shares of the relevant New Fund that you will receive in the Reorganization
	of your Fund will be equal to the number of full and fractional shares of the Fund you own on the Closing
	Date and will be of the same share class as the shares you own on the Closing Date.



	o



	 


	Subsequent to the Reorganization, the Trusts and their
	sub-trusts will be terminated under Massachusetts law.


	The Plan may be terminated
	and a Reorganization may be abandoned by the Board at any time prior to the Closing Date, before or after
	approval by the shareholders of the relevant Fund, if circumstances should develop that, in the Boards
	opinion, make proceeding with the Reorganization inadvisable. The Plan provides that either the Trusts
	or the new Maryland Corporations may waive compliance with any of the representations or conditions made
	by the Plan, except that the Trusts cannot waive the requirement to receive the opinion of counsel to
	the Trusts, on behalf of the Funds, substantially to the effect that, each Reorganization will constitute
	a tax-free reorganization for federal income tax purposes. The Plan also provides


	PAGE 12








	that either the Trusts or the new Maryland Corporations may amend the Plan for the benefit
	of either the Trusts or the new Maryland Corporations, provided, however, that following the approval
	of the Plan by each Funds shareholders, no such amendment may have the effect of changing the provisions
	for determining the number of New Fund shares to be distributed to the corresponding Funds shareholders
	under the Plan to the detriment of Fund shareholders without their further approval.



	Matters on which the New Funds Will Vote



	Pursuant
	to the 1940 Act, certain matters must be approved by shareholders of a new mutual fund. Each New Fund
	is technically a newly organized fund under state and federal law. To accomplish these approvals, the
	Plan provides that T. Rowe Price, as sole initial shareholder of each New Fund, will approve each of
	the following matters prior to the closing of the relevant Reorganization. Thus, by approving the proposal,
	shareholders of each Fund will be authorizing the approval of these matters.



	o



	 


	Elect the Board of Directors of each new Maryland Corporation,
	which will consist of the same members of each Trusts Board on the Closing Date;



	o



	 


	Ratify the selection of the new Maryland Corporations
	independent auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, on behalf of each series thereunder, which is currently
	the Trusts independent auditor on the Closing Date;



	o



	 


	Approve the investment advisory agreements for each New
	Fund, which will be in substantially the same form as the investment advisory agreements in effect with
	respect to the Funds immediately prior to the Closing Date;



	o



	 


	For T. Rowe Price Capital Appreciation Fund, T. Rowe
	Price Equity Income Fund and T. Rowe Price New America Growth Fund, approve the 12b-1 plan for each
	corresponding New Fund, which will be in substantially the same form as the 12b-1 plan in effect with
	respect to each Fund immediately prior to the Closing Date; and



	o



	 


	Approve any other matter for which shareholder approval
	is required.


	PAGE 13








	The
	main operating agreements of the Maryland Corporations and New Funds will be in substantially the same
	form as those of the Trusts and Funds immediately prior to the Closing Date.



	What effect will a Reorganization have on shareholders?



	As
	a result of a Reorganization, shareholders of a Fund will become shareholders of the corresponding New
	Fund. Immediately after the Reorganization, shareholders of the Fund will own shares of the corresponding
	New Fund (and class, if applicable) that are equal in number and in value to the shares of the Fund that
	were held by those shareholders immediately prior to the Closing Date.


	Each Reorganization will not
	result in any change in the principal investment strategies, investment adviser, portfolio managers,
	or service providers of the relevant Fund. Each New Fund will have the same investment objective and
	fundamental investment policies as its corresponding Fund, and will operate pursuant to a substantially
	similar investment advisory agreement. Each New Fund will offer the same shareholder services as its
	corresponding Fund. The 18f-3 plan for each corresponding New Fund that is offered in multiple share
	classes will be in substantially the same form as the 18f-3 plan in effect with respect to each Fund
	immediately prior to the Closing Date. The fees and expenses of the New Fund will also be the same.



	As the successors to a Trusts
	operations, a Maryland Corporation will adopt and succeed to the registration statements of each corresponding
	Trust(s) under the federal securities laws, and amend the registration statements as necessary to reflect
	the effect of the Reorganization(s) and any additional information necessary to comply with Rule 414
	under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the


	


	1933 Act


	


	).




	Tax Consequences



	Prior to the closing of the
	Reorganizations, the Trusts and the Maryland Corporations must have received the opinion of counsel to
	the Trusts, on behalf of the Funds, substantially to the effect that, the transactions contemplated by
	the Plan with respect to each Reorganization will constitute a tax-free reorganization for federal income
	tax purposes. For purposes of rendering its opinion, counsel may rely exclusively, as to factual matters,
	on the statements made in the Plan, this Proxy Statement, and on other written representations from the
	Trusts. Because it is


	PAGE 14








	anticipated
	that each Reorganization will constitute a tax-free reorganization, it is also anticipated that shareholders
	will not recognize any gain or loss in connection with the Reorganization.


	The foregoing is a general
	discussion and relates only to federal income tax consequences. Shareholders should consult their tax
	advisers regarding the effect of a Reorganization that may result from their individual circumstances,
	as well as to the foreign, state, local, and other tax consequences of the Reorganization. Because the
	Reorganizations will not affect any Funds name, investment objective or strategies, a Fund currently
	investing at least 80% of assets in securities whose income is exempt from a particular states
	income taxes will continue to invest in such securities in accordance with the same investment policy.


	Who
	is bearing the expenses related to the Reorganizations?


	Each Fund, and its respective classes, will bear
	its proportionate share of the overall cost of the Reorganizations, based on each class relative
	net assets.


	How do the governing documents and the laws governing the Funds and the New Funds compare?


	After
	the applicable Reorganization, each Fund will be a series of a Maryland Corporation governed by the Maryland
	General Corporation Law ("

	MGCL

	")
	and such Maryland Corporations charter and by-laws. The MGCL is similar in some respects to the
	laws governing each Funds current structure, a Massachusetts business trust, but they differ in
	certain respects. A Massachusetts business trust, and the rights and obligations of its officers, trustees,
	and shareholders, are governed by the contractual provisions included in its declaration of trust. Chapter
	182 of the Massachusetts General Laws applies to business trusts; however, this statute merely sets forth
	the procedural or filing obligations of such trusts, not the substantive requirements to which business
	trusts must conform. Both the Massachusetts business trust law and the MGCL permit a funds governing
	documents to contain provisions relating to shareholder rights and removal of trustees/directors, and
	provide a fund with the ability to amend or restate the funds governing documents. However, Massachusetts
	law is silent on many of the salient features of a Massachusetts business trust whereas the MGCL provides
	guidance and offers a significant amount of operational flexibility to Maryland corporations. The MGCL
	provides that the stockholders of a Maryland


	PAGE 15








	corporation
	generally are not personally liable for obligations of the corporation. Under Massachusetts law, shareholders
	are potentially liable for business trust obligations. Although the Trusts declarations of trust
	contain an express disclaimer of liability of shareholders, certain Massachusetts judicial decisions
	have determined that shareholders of a Massachusetts business trust may, in certain circumstances, be
	assessed or held personally liable as partners for the obligations of a Massachusetts business trust.
	Therefore, the Funds believe that shareholders may benefit from the express statutory protections for
	stockholders of a Maryland corporation. The Funds believe that the guidance and flexibility afforded
	by the MGCL will benefit the Funds and their shareholders.


	The governing documents of the Funds after the
	Reorganizations will be similar in most respects to their current governing documents, but will contain
	certain differences. A comparison between the Massachusetts business trust law and the MGCL, and the
	current and proposed governing documents of the Funds, is attached hereto as Appendix B. In general,
	these changes to a Funds governing documents are intended to benefit shareholders by streamlining
	the administration and operation of the Fund. Please note that Appendix B contains only a summary of
	the characteristics of the Trusts and the Maryland Corporations, their relevant governance documents
	and applicable state law, and is not a complete description of the documents and laws cited. Shareholders
	should refer to the provisions of those documents and the applicable law for more details. A form of
	the Articles of Incorporation and by-laws for the Maryland Corporations are included in Appendices C
	and D, respectively. The Articles of Incorporation and by-laws have already been filed with the Maryland
	Department of Assessments and Taxation to establish each New Corporation. However, for convenience the
	Appendices include only the standard Articles of Incorporation and by-laws applicable to T. Rowe Price
	Funds organized as Maryland corporations. The actual Articles of Incorporation and by-laws specific to
	each New Corporation differ from these Appendices only with respect to the corporation and fund names.


	FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT VOTING AND THE SHAREHOLDER MEETING



	What is the required vote and when is the change effective?



	Each
	Reorganization must be approved by the shareholders of the applicable Fund, with each Fund voting separately
	on its Reorganization.


	PAGE 16








	Approval
	of the proposal for each Fund requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities
	(as defined in the 1940 Act) of that Fund, which means the lesser of: (a) 67% or more of the voting securities
	present at the Meeting, if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund
	are present or represented by proxy; or (b) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the
	Fund.


	If
	the proposed Reorganization for a particular Fund is approved by shareholders, it is expected that the
	Fund will change its domicile from Massachusetts to Maryland on or about September 1, 2017. This change
	in domicile will apply to all share classes of a Fund. If any of the Funds introduce a new share class
	after the record date and mailing of this Proxy Statement, but prior to the Shareholder Meeting, those
	share classes will automatically be included as part of the Reorganization.


	In the event that the shareholders
	of one or more Funds ultimately do not approve the proposal with respect to their Fund, those Fund(s)
	will not be reorganized and will remain sub-trusts of the existing Massachusetts business trust; only
	the Funds whose shareholders approve the Reorganization of their Fund will be reorganized.


	What is the required quorum and
	under what circumstances will the Meeting be adjourned?


	A quorum of shareholders is necessary to hold
	a valid shareholder meeting of each of the Funds. Under the governing documents of the Trusts, the holders
	of a majority of outstanding shares of each Fund entitled to vote at the Meeting, present in person or
	by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at the Meeting. If a quorum is not present at the Meeting, it may
	be adjourned with the vote of the majority of the votes present or represented by proxy, to allow additional
	solicitations of proxies in order to attain a quorum. The shareholders present in person or represented
	by proxy and entitled to vote at the Meeting will also have the power to adjourn the Meeting from time
	to time if a quorum is present but the vote required to approve or reject the proposal is not obtained.
	Proxies in favor of the proposal and abstentions and broker nonvotes (as defined below) will
	be voted for adjournment, provided the persons named as proxies determine that such an adjournment and
	additional solicitation is reasonable and in the interest of shareholders.


	PAGE 17









	How are the votes counted?



	The
	individuals named as proxies (or their substitutes) on the enclosed proxy card will vote according to
	your directions if your proxy is received properly executed, or in accordance with your instructions
	given when voting by telephone or Internet. You may direct the proxy holders to vote your shares on the
	proposal by choosing FOR or AGAINST or ABSTAIN. Alternatively, you may simply sign, date, and return
	your proxy card(s) with no specific instructions as to the proposal. If you properly execute your proxy
	card, or submit your vote via the telephone or Internet, and give no voting instructions, your shares
	will be voted FOR the proposal. Abstentions and broker nonvotes are counted for purposes of determining
	whether a quorum is present for purposes of convening the Meeting, although we do not anticipate any
	broker nonvotes. 

	Broker nonvotes

	
	are shares held by a broker or nominee for which an executed proxy is received by a Fund but are not
	voted as to one or more proposals because instructions have not been received from the beneficial owners
	or persons entitled to vote, and the broker or nominee does not have discretionary voting power. Because
	the proposal must be approved by a majority of a Funds outstanding shares (as defined in the 1940
	Act), abstentions and broker nonvotes will be considered to be voting securities that are present and
	will have the effect of being counted as votes against the proposal. For shares of a Fund held in an
	Individual Retirement Account or Education Savings Account that is sponsored by T. Rowe Price Trust
	Company and for which T. Rowe Price Trust Company serves as custodian, T. Rowe Price Trust
	Company shall, without written direction from the investor, vote shares for which no voting instructions
	are timely received in the same proportion as shares for which voting instructions from other shareholders
	are timely received. Shares of the Funds that are held by another T. Rowe Price Fund will be voted
	by the investing T. Rowe Price Fund in the same proportion as shares for which voting instructions
	from other shareholders are timely received.



	Can additional matters be acted upon at the Meeting?



	T. Rowe Price and the
	Board know of no other business that may come before the Meeting. However, if any additional matters
	are properly presented at the Meeting, it is intended that the persons named in the enclosed proxy, or
	their substitutes, will vote on such matters in accordance with their judgment.


	PAGE 18









	Are the Trusts required to hold annual
	meetings?



	Under Massachusetts law and the Trusts governing documents, the Trusts are not
	required to hold an annual meeting of shareholders. The Board has determined that the Trusts will take
	advantage of this provision to avoid the significant expenses associated with holding an annual meeting
	of shareholders, including legal, accounting, printing, and mailing fees incurred in preparing proxy
	materials. Accordingly, no annual meeting of shareholders shall be held in any year in which a meeting
	is not otherwise required to be held under the 1940 Act or Massachusetts law, unless the Board determines
	otherwise. However, special meetings of shareholders will be held in accordance with applicable law or
	when otherwise determined by the Board. If a shareholder wishes to present a proposal to be included
	in a proxy statement for a subsequent shareholder meeting, the proposal must be submitted in writing
	and received by Darrell Braman, Secretary of the T. Rowe Price Funds, 100 East Pratt Street, Baltimore,
	Maryland 21202, within a reasonable time before a Fund begins to print and mail its proxy materials.
	The timely submission of a proposal does not guarantee its consideration at the meeting.



	How are proxies delivered and votes recorded?



	This Proxy Statement was mailed
	along with a proxy voting card and prepaid envelope. You may record your votes on the enclosed proxy
	card and mail it in the accompanying prepaid envelope to Proxy Tabulator, P.O. Box 43130, Providence,
	RI 02940-9915. Any mailed proxies sent to this address will be delivered to Computershare Limited (

	Computershare

	),
	which T. Rowe Price has retained to tabulate the votes. In addition, the Funds have arranged through
	Computershare to have votes recorded through the Internet or by telephone. The telephone and Internet
	voting procedures are reasonably designed to authenticate shareholders identities, to allow shareholders
	to authorize the voting of their shares in accordance with their instructions, and to confirm that their
	instructions have been properly recorded. Computershare is also responsible for assisting T. Rowe Price
	in determining whether quorum is achieved for a particular Fund and whether sufficient votes are received
	to approve a proposal.


	Some shareholders will not automatically receive a copy of this entire Proxy Statement
	in the mail, but will instead receive a notice that informs them of how to access all of the proxy materials
	on a publicly available website (commonly referred to as notice and access). Shareholders
	who


	PAGE
	19








	receive
	such a notice will not be able to return the notice to have their vote recorded. However, they can access
	the proxy materials at

	www.proxy-direct.com/trp-28475

	to vote eligible shares or may use the instructions on the notice to request a paper or email copy of
	the proxy materials at no charge.


	The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted rules that
	permit investment companies, such as the Funds, and intermediaries to satisfy the delivery requirements
	for proxy statements with respect to two or more shareholders sharing the same address by delivering
	a single proxy statement addressed to those shareholders. This process, which is commonly referred to
	as householding, could result in extra convenience and cost savings for a Fund and its shareholders.
	Unless a Fund has received contrary instructions, only one copy of this Proxy Statement will be mailed
	to two or more shareholders who share an address. If you need additional copies, do not want your mailings
	to be householded, or would like to request a single copy if multiple copies are being received,
	please call 1-800-225-5132 or write us at P.O. Box 17630, Baltimore, Maryland 21297-1630.


	How can proxies be solicited?


	Trustees
	and officers of the Funds, and employees of T. Rowe Price (and its affiliates), may solicit proxies.
	Proxies may be solicited by mail, in person, or by telephone. In the event that votes are solicited by
	telephone, shareholders will be called at the telephone number T. Rowe Price and its affiliates have
	in their records for their accounts, and asked for their Social Security number or other identifying
	information. The shareholders would then be given an opportunity to authorize proxies to vote their shares
	at the meeting in accordance with their instructions. To ensure that shareholders instructions
	have been recorded correctly, confirmation of the instructions is also mailed and a toll-free number
	provided in case the information contained in the confirmation is incorrect.


	To help ensure that sufficient
	shares of common stock are represented at the Meeting to permit approval of the proposal outlined in
	the Proxy Statement, the Funds will also use the solicitation services of Computershare to assist them
	in soliciting proxies.


	PAGE 20








	Who
	pays for the costs involved with the proxy?


	For managing the Funds overall proxy campaign, Computershare
	will receive a fee plus reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses. Computershare will also receive fees
	in connection with the printing, preparing, assembling, mailing, and transmitting of proxy materials
	on behalf of the Funds, tabulating those votes that are received, and any solicitation of additional
	votes. While the fees received by Computershare will vary based on the level of additional solicitation
	necessary to achieve quorum and shareholder approval, the costs paid to Computershare on behalf of the
	Funds are estimated to be approximately $2.9 million. In addition to the fees paid to Computershare,
	securities brokers, custodians, fiduciaries, and other persons holding shares as nominees will be reimbursed,
	upon request, for their reasonable expenses in sending solicitation materials to the principals of the
	accounts. All costs of the shareholder meetings and the proxy campaign, including the use of Computershare
	and the reimbursement to brokers for solicitation and the preparation of proxy materials, will be paid
	for by each Fund in proportion to its relative asset size at the Closing Date. However, any of these
	expenses that would result in a Funds total expense ratio exceeding its contractual expense limitation
	will be borne by T. Rowe Price.


	Can I change my vote after I mail my proxy?


	Any proxy, including those
	given via the Internet or by telephone, may be revoked at any time before the votes have been submitted
	for tabulation at the Meeting by filing a written notice of revocation with the Fund(s), by delivering
	a properly executed proxy bearing a later date, or by attending the Meeting and voting in person. If
	you vote via telephone or Internet, you can change your vote until 7:59 a.m. on July 26, 2017.

	Appendix
	A


	Form of Agreement and Plan of Reorganization for a Change of Domicile


	THIS AGREEMENT
	AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION FOR A CHANGE OF DOMICILE (the Plan or the Agreement)
	is made this __ day of ________, 2017, by and between the T. Rowe Price State Tax-Free Funds, Inc., T.
	Rowe Price Capital Appreciation Fund, Inc., T. Rowe Price Equity Income Fund, Inc., T. Rowe Price GNMA
	Fund, Inc., and T. Rowe Price New America Growth Fund, Inc. (each, a Corporation and together,
	the Corporations), each, a newly formed corporation organized under the laws of Maryland
	and the T. Rowe Price California Tax-Free Income Trust, T. Rowe Price State Tax-Free Income Trust, T.
	Rowe Price Capital Appreciation Fund, T. Rowe Price Equity Income Fund, T. Rowe Price GNMA Fund, and
	T. Rowe Price New America Growth Fund (each, a Trust and together, the Trusts),
	each, an existing Massachusetts business trust. The Boards of Directors of the Corporations and Boards
	of Trustees of the Trusts (collectively, the Board) deem it advisable that each series of
	the Corporations (each, a New Fund), and the sub-trusts of the Trusts (each, an Acquired
	Fund) listed in Exhibit 1 attached hereto, and their respective classes, engage in the reorganization
	described below.


	This Agreement is intended to be, and is adopted as, a plan of
	reorganization and liquidation within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1) of the United States Internal
	Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). The reorganization and liquidation will consist
	of the transfer of all of the assets of the Acquired Funds to the corresponding New Funds, as described
	in Exhibit 1 attached hereto, in exchange solely for (as applicable) Investor Class, Advisor Class, I
	Class, and R Class shares of beneficial interest of each New Fund (New Fund Shares), the
	assumption by each New Fund of all liabilities of the respective Acquired Fund, and the distribution
	of New Fund Shares to the shareholders of the corresponding Acquired Fund in complete liquidation of
	the Acquired Fund, as provided herein (Reorganization), all upon the terms and conditions
	hereinafter set forth in this Plan.


	 WHEREAS, each New Fund has been organized
	for the sole purpose of continuing the business and operations of the corresponding Acquired Fund as
	a series of Maryland Corporation;


	WHEREAS, each New Fund currently has no assets
	and has carried on no business activities prior to the date first shown above and will have had no assets
	and will have carried on no business activities prior to the consummation of the transaction described
	herein; and


	PAGE 31








	WHEREAS, the Acquired Funds and the New Funds are authorized to issue their shares
	of beneficial interest and common stock, respectively; and


	WHEREAS, the Board has determined,
	with respect to the New Funds and the Acquired Funds, that the exchange of all of the assets of each
	Acquired Fund for corresponding New Fund Shares and the assumption of all liabilities of the respective
	Acquired Fund by the corresponding New Fund is in the best interests of such Acquired and New Funds
	shareholders and that the interests of the existing shareholders of the Acquired Funds and New Funds
	would not be diluted as a result of this transaction;


	NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration
	of the premises and of the covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto covenant
	and agree as follows:



	1.

	Transfer of Assets of the Acquired Funds to the New Funds in Exchange for
	New Fund Shares, the Assumption of all of the Acquired Funds Respective Liabilities, and the Liquidation
	of the Acquired Funds


	1.1 Subject to the requisite approval of each Acquired Funds
	shareholders and the other terms and conditions herein set forth and on the basis of the representations
	and warranties contained herein, each Acquired Fund agrees to transfer all of its assets, as set forth
	in paragraph 1.2, to the corresponding New Fund, as set forth in Exhibit 1 attached hereto, and each
	New Fund, which was organized solely for the purpose of acquiring all of the assets and assuming all
	of the liabilities of the corresponding Acquired Fund, agrees in exchange therefor: (i) to deliver to
	the Acquired Fund the number of full and fractional Investor Class, Advisor Class, I Class, and R Class
	New Fund Shares (as applicable), determined by dividing the value of the Acquired Funds net assets,
	computed in the manner and as of the time and date set forth in paragraph 2.1, by the net asset value
	of one New Fund Share of the corresponding class, computed in the manner and as of the time and date
	set forth in paragraph 2.2; and (ii) to assume all liabilities of the corresponding Acquired Fund, as
	set forth in paragraph 1.3. Such transactions shall take place on the date of the closing provided for
	in paragraph 3.1 (Closing Date).


	1.2 The assets of the Acquired Fund to be acquired
	by the New Fund shall consist of all assets, including, without limitation, all portfolio holdings, cash,
	cash equivalents, commodities, interests in futures and other financial instruments, claims (whether
	absolute or contingent, known or unknown), receivables (including dividends or interest and


	PAGE 32








	other
	receivables) and other assets belonging to the Acquired Fund, and any deferred or prepaid expenses, shown
	as an asset on the books of the Acquired Fund, as of the Valuation Date (as defined in paragraph 2.1),
	in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) consistently applied
	from the Funds prior audited period (the Assets).


	1.3 The corresponding New
	Fund shall assume all of the Acquired Funds liabilities, expenses, costs, charges and reserves,
	whether accrued or contingent, known or unknown, existing at the Valuation Date, as defined in paragraph
	2.1 (collectively, Liabilities).


	1.4 On the Closing Date, each Acquired Fund
	will distribute, in complete liquidation, New Fund Shares to each Acquired Fund shareholder, determined
	as of the close of business on the Valuation Date, of the Acquired Fund pro rata in proportion to such
	shareholders beneficial interest and in exchange for that shareholders Acquired Fund shares.
	Such distribution will be accomplished by recording on the books of the New Fund, in the name of each
	Acquired Fund shareholder, the number of New Fund Shares representing the pro rata number of New Fund
	Shares received from the New Fund which is due to such Acquired Fund shareholder. Fractional New Fund
	Shares shall be rounded to the third place after the decimal point.


	1.5 On
	the Closing Date, any outstanding certificates representing Acquired Fund shares will be cancelled. The
	New Funds shall not issue certificates representing New Fund Shares in connection with such exchange,
	irrespective of whether Acquired Fund shareholders hold their Acquired Fund shares in certificated form.
	Ownership of New Fund Shares shall be recorded separately on the books of each New Funds transfer
	agent.


	1.6 The legal existence of the Acquired Funds shall be terminated as promptly as
	reasonably practicable after the Closing Date. After the Closing Date, the Acquired Funds shall not conduct
	any business except in connection with their liquidation and termination.




	1.7
	Immediately prior to delivery to each Acquired Fund of corresponding New Fund Shares, T. Rowe Price Associates,
	Inc. (T. Rowe Price), as the sole stockholder of the New Funds, shall (i) elect the
	Directors of each New Fund; (ii) ratify the selection of the New Funds independent auditors;
	(iii) approve the investment advisory agreements for each New Fund, which will be in substantially
	the same form as the investment advisory agreements in effect with respect to the corresponding Acquired
	Fund immediately prior to the Closing Date; (iv) approve the 12b-1 plan for the New Funds (if applicable),
	which will be in substantially the same form as the 12b-1 plan in effect with respect to the


	PAGE 33








	Acquired
	Fund immediately prior to the Closing Date; and (v) approve any other matter for which shareholder approval
	is required.



	2.

	Valuation


	2.1 The value of each Acquired Funds Assets shall be the
	value of such Assets computed as of immediately after the close of regular trading on the New York Stock
	Exchange ("NYSE") on the business day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the "Valuation Date"),
	using the Acquired Funds valuation procedures established by the Board.


	2.2 The
	net asset value per share of New Fund Shares issued in exchange for the Assets of each Acquired Fund,
	shall be equal to the net asset value per share of New Fund Shares on the Closing Date, using the New
	Funds valuation procedures established by the Board, and the number of such New Fund Shares shall
	equal the number of full and fractional Acquired Fund shares outstanding on the Closing Date.


	2.3
	All computations of value shall be made in accordance with the regular practices of T. Rowe Price and
	the Bank of New York Mellon (BNY) as fund accountants for the Acquired Fund and the New Fund.


	3.

	Closing and Closing
	Date



	3.1 The Closing Date shall be September 1, 2017, or such other
	date as the parties, through their duly authorized officers, may mutually agree. All acts taking place
	at the Closing shall be deemed to take place simultaneously on the Closing Date unless otherwise provided.
	The Closing shall be held at the close of the NYSE (normally 4 p.m. Eastern Time).




	3.2
	If, on the Closing Date, a discretionary liquidity fee or temporary suspension of fund redemptions pursuant
	to Rule 2a-7(c)(2) under the Investment Company Act of 1940 Act, as amended (the 1940 Act)
	is currently in place for a money market fund, either party shall have the right to postpone the Closing
	Date until such time as the discretionary liquidity fee or temporary suspension of fund redemptions is
	lifted, or terminate this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.


	3.3 At
	the Closing, each party shall deliver to the other such bills of sale, checks, assignments, receipts,
	or other documents as such other party or its counsel may reasonably request.

	Representations and Warranties


	PAGE
	34








	4.1 Each Acquired Fund represents and warrants to the corresponding New Fund as
	follows:



	4.1.1 At the Closing Date, the Acquired Fund
	will have good and marketable title to the Assets to be transferred to the New Fund pursuant to paragraph 1.1,
	and will have full right, power and authority to sell, assign, transfer and deliver such Assets hereunder.
	Upon delivery and in payment for such Assets, the New Fund will acquire good and marketable title thereto
	subject to no restrictions on the full transfer thereof, including, without limitation, such restrictions
	as might arise under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), provided that the New Fund
	will acquire Assets that are segregated as collateral for the Acquired Funds derivative positions,
	including, without limitation, as collateral for swap positions and as margin for futures positions,
	subject to such segregation and liens that apply to such Assets;


	4.1.2
	The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement will have been duly authorized prior to the
	Closing Date by all necessary action on the part of the Acquired Fund and, subject to the approval of
	the Acquired Funds shareholders and the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement
	by the New Fund, this Agreement will constitute a valid and binding obligation of the Acquired Fund enforceable
	in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy laws
	and any other similar laws affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally and by equitable
	principles;


	4.1.3 No consent, approval, authorization,
	or order of any court, governmental authority, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA")
	or any stock exchange on which shares of the Acquired Fund are listed is required for the consummation
	by the Acquired Fund of the transactions contemplated herein, except such as have been or will be obtained
	(at or prior to the Closing Date); and


	4.1.4 The Acquired Fund
	will have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") proxy materials, complying in all
	material respects with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the 1940
	Act, and applicable rules and regulations thereunder, relating to a meeting of its shareholders to be
	called to consider and act upon the Reorganization contemplated herein.

	4.2 Each New Fund represents and warrants to the corresponding Acquired Fund as
	follows:



	4.2.1 At the Closing Date, the New Fund will
	be duly formed as a corporation, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of the State of
	Maryland;


	4.2.2 New Fund Shares to be issued and delivered to the Acquired
	Fund pursuant to the terms of this Agreement will, at the Closing Date, have been duly authorized and,
	when so issued and delivered, will be duly and validly issued and outstanding and fully paid and non-assessable
	by the New Fund;


	4.2.3 At the Closing Date, the New Fund or
	the corporation of which the New Fund is a series, as the case may be, shall succeed to the registration
	statement of the Acquired Fund or Trust of which the Acquired Fund is a sub-trust, as the case may be,
	filed under the 1940 Act with the SEC and thus will become duly registered under the 1940 Act as an open-end
	management investment company;


	4.2.4 The New Fund was
	newly formed for the purpose of consummating the Reorganization and continuing the business and operations
	of the Acquired Fund. As of the Closing Date, and immediately prior to the Reorganization, the New Fund
	has not held any assets or engaged in any activity or business, other than such as required to consummate
	the Reorganization. Immediately prior to the Closing Date, there will be no issued or outstanding stock
	of the New Fund or any other securities issued by the New Fund;


	4.2.5
	The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement will have been duly authorized prior to the
	Closing Date by all necessary action on the part of the New Fund, and, subject to the approval of the
	Acquired Funds shareholders and the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement
	by the Acquired Fund, this Agreement will constitute a valid and binding obligation of the New Fund enforceable
	in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy laws
	and any other similar laws affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally and by equitable
	principles;


	PAGE 36








	4.2.6 No consent, approval, authorization, or order of any court,
	governmental authority, FINRA, or stock exchange on which shares of the New Fund are listed is required
	for the consummation by the New Fund of the transactions contemplated herein, except such as have been
	or will be obtained (at or prior to the Closing Date); and


	4.2.7
	The New Fund shall use all reasonable efforts to obtain the approvals and authorizations required by
	the 1933 Act, the 1940 Act and such state or District of Columbia securities laws as it may deem appropriate
	in order to operate after the Closing Date.



	5.

	Conditions Precedent to Obligations of the Acquired Funds and the New Funds


	If
	any of the conditions set out below have not been satisfied on or before the Closing Date with respect
	to any of the Acquired Funds or the New Funds, the other parties to this Agreement shall, at their option,
	not be required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement:


	5.1 This
	Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein shall have been approved by the Board of the Acquired
	Funds and New Funds and by the requisite vote of each Acquired Funds shareholders, voting separately;


	5.2 All consents of other parties and all other consents, orders, and permits of
	federal, state, and local regulatory authorities (including those of the SEC and of state, District of
	Columbia, or U.S. territory securities authorities) deemed necessary by any of the Acquired Funds or
	the New Funds to permit consummation, in all material respects, of the transactions contemplated hereby
	shall have been obtained, except where failure to obtain any such consent, order, or permit would not
	involve a risk of a material adverse effect on the assets or properties of the Acquired Funds or New
	Funds, provided that either party hereto may waive any of such conditions for itself;


	5.3 Prior
	to or at the Closing, the New Funds shall enter into or adopt such agreements as are necessary for each
	New Funds operation as an open-end investment company and such agreements shall be substantially
	similar to any corresponding agreement of the respective Acquired Fund; and


	5.4 The
	parties shall have received the opinion of counsel to the Trusts, on behalf of the Acquired Funds, substantially
	to the effect that,


	PAGE 37








	based
	upon certain facts, assumptions, and representations, the transactions contemplated by this Plan shall
	constitute a tax-free reorganization for federal income tax purposes. The delivery of such opinion is
	conditioned upon receipt by counsel to the Trusts of representations it shall request of the Trusts.
	Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Trusts and the Corporations, on behalf of either
	the Acquired Funds or the New Funds, respectively, may not waive the condition set forth in this paragraph
	5.4.



	6.

	Fees and Expenses


	The
	New Funds will bear the expenses relating to the Reorganization, regardless of whether the Assets are
	held on the books of the Acquired Fund or the New Fund. The New Funds will bear these expenses regardless
	of whether the Reorganization is consummated. Each New Fund, and its respective classes, will bear its
	proportionate share of the Reorganization, based on each class relative net assets on the Closing
	Day.



	7.

	Termination
	of the Agreement


	7.1 This Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby may
	be terminated and abandoned by resolution of the Board of the Trust or the Corporation, as the case may
	be, at any time prior to the Closing Date (and notwithstanding any vote of the Acquired Funds shareholders)
	if circumstances should develop that, in the opinion of the Board, make proceeding with the Reorganization
	inadvisable.


	7.2 If this Agreement is terminated and the transactions contemplated
	hereby are abandoned pursuant to the provisions of this Section 7, this Agreement shall become void and
	have no effect, without any liability on the part of any party hereto or the Board members or officers
	of the Corporations or the Trusts, or shareholders of the New Funds or Acquired Funds, as the case may
	be, in respect of this Agreement.



	8.

	All notices, requests, instructions, and demands
	in the course of the transactions herein contemplated shall be in writing addressed to the respective
	parties as follows and shall be deemed given: (i) on the next day if sent by prepaid overnight courier
	and (ii) on the same day if given by hand delivery or telecopy.

	Funds shareholders under this Agreement to the detriment of such Acquired Fund shareholders without
	their further approval.

	parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof, and merges and supersedes all prior discussions,
	agreements and understandings of every kind and nature between them relating to the subject matter hereof.
	No party shall be bound by any condition, definition, warranty, or representation, other than as set
	forth or provided in this Agreement or as may be, on or subsequent to the date hereof, set forth in a
	writing signed by the party to be bound thereby.


	11.3 This Agreement shall be governed and construed
	in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland without giving effect to principles of conflict
	of laws; provided, however, that the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
	Trusts and the Corporations and their sub-trusts and series, respectively, as set forth in Exhibit 1
	attached hereto, shall be governed and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the Commonwealth
	of Massachusetts, without giving effect to principles of conflict of laws; provided that, in the case
	of any conflict between those laws and the federal securities laws, the latter shall govern.


	11.4 This
	Agreement may be amended only by a signed writing between the parties.


	11.5 This
	Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which, when executed and delivered, shall be deemed
	to be an original.


	11.6 This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the
	parties hereto and their respective New Funds and assigns, but no assignment or transfer hereof or of
	any rights or obligations hereunder shall be made by any party without the written consent of the other
	party. Nothing herein expressed or implied is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give any
	person, firm, or corporation, other than the parties hereto and assigns, any rights or remedies under
	or by reason of this Agreement.


	11.7 It is expressly agreed that the obligations
	of the parties hereunder shall not be binding upon any of the Board members or officers of the Trust
	or the Corporation, or shareholders, nominees, agents, or employees of the Acquired Funds or the New
	Funds personally, but shall bind only the property of the Acquired Funds or the New Funds, as the case
	may be, as provided in each trust agreement, a copy of which is on file at the office of the Secretary
	of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and at the Acquired Funds principal offices, or each Corporations
	Charter. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by such officers shall not be deemed to have been
	made by any of them individually or to impose any liability on any of them personally, but shall bind
	only the property of the Acquired Funds or New Funds, as the case may be.


	PAGE 40








	11.8 It is understood and agreed that the reorganization contemplated in this Agreement
	relates to the reorganization of each Acquired Fund to its corresponding New Fund, as set forth in Exhibit
	1 hereto, as a separate reorganization, and that the reorganization of any Acquired Fund to its corresponding
	New Fund, as contemplated herein, is not contingent on the approval or consummation of the reorganization
	of any other sub-trust of any of the Trusts contained in Exhibit 1 attached hereto.

	IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Trusts, on behalf of the Acquired Funds, and the Corporations,

	the Trusts shareholders. If the domicile change is approved by the shareholders, shareholders of
	each Trust will become shareholders of the corresponding Maryland Corporation listed in the Proxy Statement,
	and the rights of the shareholders of each Maryland Corporation will be governed by Maryland law and
	each Maryland Corporations charter and by-laws. The following chart compares some of the existing
	rights of shareholders of each Trust with those of shareholders of each newly created Maryland Corporation,
	as well as the form, governance, and other material considerations of such entities. All capitalized

	Summary
	of Significant Differences




	Existing Massachusetts Business Trusts




	New
	Maryland Corporations






	Form of Organization, Purpose




	No significant differences




	Each Trust is a Massachusetts business trust. Each Trust is registered
	under the 1940 Act, as a diversified, open-end management investment company, and each Fund has its own
	investment objective.


	The principal purpose of each Trust is to operate as an investment company
	and to offer shareholders of each Trust (and sub-trust, if applicable) one or more investment programs
	primarily in securities and debt instruments.




	Each Corporation is a Maryland corporation. Each Corporation is registered under the
	1940 Act, as a diversified, open-end management investment company, and each Fund has its own investment
	objective.


	The purposes for which each Corporation is formed and the business and objects to be
	carried on and promoted by it are primarily to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading
	in securities as an investment company classified under the 1940 Act as an open-end, management investment
	company, and in connection therewith to hold part or all of its assets in cash.






	Management




	No significant differences




	The business and affairs of
	each Trust are managed under the direction of the board of trustees. The board of trustees approves all
	significant agreements between the Trust and the companies that furnish the Trust with




	The business and affairs of each Corporation are managed under the
	direction of the board of directors. The board of directors approves all significant agreements between
	the Corporation and the companies that furnish the

	services, including, but not limited to, agreements with the investment adviser, the
	Trusts custodian, the administrator, and the transfer agent. The day-to-day operations of the Trust
	are delegated to the investment adviser, subject to the supervision of the board of trustees.





	Corporation with
	services, including, but not limited to, agreements with the investment adviser, the Corporations
	custodian, the Corporations administrator, and the Corporations transfer agent. Under the
	agreements with the investment adviser, the day-to-day operations of the Corporation are delegated to
	the investment adviser, subject to the supervision of the board of directors.







	Authorized Shares




	In Massachusetts, each Trust can issue an unlimited number of shares, and in Maryland,
	each Corporation must issue a specific number of shares. However, the board

	of a Corporation registered under the 1940 Act



	can increase or decrease the authorized shares without shareholder approval.




	Each Trust is authorized to
	issue an unlimited number of transferable shares of beneficial interest of full and fractional transferable
	shares without par value, in the trustees discretion and without a shareholder vote. The trustees
	may classify or reclassify any unissued shares or any shares previously issued and reacquired of any
	sub-trust into one or more sub-trust that may be established and re-designated. The trustees may from
	time to time divide or combine the outstanding shares of the Trust or of any class into a greater or
	lesser number without thereby changing the proportionate beneficial interest of the shares in the Trust
	so divided or combined or in the assets belonging to such class.




	Each Corporation has authority to issue a specific number of shares
	of capital stock, at a specific par value per share (as specified in each Corporations charter),
	and all shares will initially be classified and designated as shares of common stock. Under the Corporations
	charter, the board of directors is authorized to classify and reclassify any unissued shares of capital
	stock in other classes or series of stock and authorize the issuance of such shares without obtaining
	stockholder approval. As permitted by the Maryland General Corporation Law (the "MGCL"), the Corporations
	charter provides that a majority of the entire board of directors, without any action by the stockholders,
	may amend the charter from time to time to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock
	or the number of shares of any class or series of stock that the Corporation has authority to issue.






	Number and Election of Trustees/ Directors; Structure of the Board




	No significant differences





	Each Trusts board of trustees currently has 10 members (8 of whom are independent).
	Each Trusts trust agreement provides that the number of trustees will be set by the board of trustees.
	However, the number of trustees may not be less than three.






	Each Corporations board of directors has 10 members (8 of
	whom are independent). Each Corporations charter provides that the number of directors will be
	set by the board of directors, provided that the number of directors may not be less than three nor more
	than 15.

	Trustees are elected by a majority
	shareholder vote at a meeting of shareholders at which a quorum is present.









	Each Corporations
	charter and by-laws provide that directors will be elected by the affirmative vote of a majority of the
	votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors. Pursuant to each Corporations charter and
	by-laws, the board of directors may amend the by-laws from time to time to alter the vote required to
	elect a director.







	Removal of Trustees / Directors;
	Vacancies




	In Massachusetts, a trustee
	can be removed without a shareholder vote; in Maryland, shareholder vote is required to remove a director.




	Each Trusts trust agreement
	provides that a trustee may be removed with or without cause at any time (i) by written instrument, signed
	by at least two-thirds of the trustees prior to such removal, specifying the date upon which such removal
	shall become effective; (ii) by vote of shareholders holding not less than two-thirds of the capital
	shares then outstanding, cast in person or by proxy at any meeting called for the purpose; or (iii) by
	a written declaration signed by shareholders holding not less than two-thirds of the Shares then outstanding.


	Each Trusts trust agreement provides that a vacancy on the board of trustees for any reason
	may be filled by the written consent of a majority of the trustees remaining in office (so long as there
	at least 3 remaining trustees), subject to certain requirements of the 1940 Act.



	The by-laws require the trustees to promptly call and give notice
	of a meeting of shareholders for the purpose of voting to remove any trustee when requested to do so
	in writing by shareholders holding not less than 10% of the shares then outstanding of the Trust pertaining
	to any sub-trust.





	Each Corporations charter
	provides that, by the affirmative vote of the holders of the majority of the votes entitled to be cast
	in the election of directors at a meeting at which a quorum is present, the shareholders may remove any
	director or directors from office either with or without cause and may elect a successor or successors
	to fill any resulting vacancies.




	Each Corporations charter provides that, if not previously
	filled by the stockholders, vacancies may be filled by a majority of directors then in office, provided
	that, immediately after filling such office, at least two-thirds of the directors were elected by the
	stockholders of the Corporation.

	Limitation
	on Liability




	Maryland law limits shareholder liability by statute. In Massachusetts,
	on the other hand, shareholder liability is not limited by statute but can be limited in the trust agreement.


	In
	both states, director/trustee liability may be limited by the charter/trust agreement to the extent permitted
	by the 1940 Act.




	Each trust agreement provides that all persons having any claim
	against the trust are required to look only to that sub-trust to settle that claim, and no shareholders,
	trustees, officers, employees or agents will be personally liable, and any act entered into on behalf
	of the Trust or the trustees will be deemed to have been executed for the Trust, sub-trust, or the trustees
	and not personally. As required under the 1940 Act, nothing in the trust agreements protects any trustee
	or officer if the trustee or officer acts with willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless
	disregard. The trust agreements further state that the trustees are not liable for errors of judgment
	or mistakes of fact of law and the trustees are not liable for any action of any agent or officer of
	the Trust, nor is any trustee responsible for the act or omission of any other trustee.


	Under Massachusetts law, shareholders
	could, under certain circumstances, be held personally liable for the obligations of a Massachusetts
	business trust. Accordingly, each Trusts trust agreement expressly disclaims shareholder liability
	for the acts and obligations of the Trust and provides that (i) no shareholder will be subject to any
	personal liability whatsoever to any person in connection with the Trusts property or the acts,
	obligations or affairs of the Trust and (ii) the trustees have no power to bind any shareholder personally
	or to call upon any shareholder for the payment of any money or assessment other than that which the
	shareholder personally agrees to pay in connection with share subscriptions or otherwise.

	Each trust agreement provides
	that all persons having any claim against the trust are required to look only to that sub-trust to settle
	that claim, and no shareholders, trustees, officers, employees or agents will be personally liable, and
	any act entered into on behalf of the Trust or the trustees will be deemed to have been executed for
	the Trust, sub-trust, or the trustees and not personally. As required under the 1940 Act, nothing in
	the trust agreements protects any trustee or officer if the trustee or officer acts with willful misfeasance,
	bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard. The trust agreements further state that the trustees
	are not liable for errors of judgment or mistakes of fact of law and the trustees are not liable for
	any action of any agent or officer of the Trust, nor is any trustee responsible for the act or omission
	of any other trustee.


	Under Massachusetts law, shareholders could, under certain circumstances, be held personally
	liable for the obligations of a Massachusetts business trust. Accordingly, each Trusts trust agreement
	expressly disclaims shareholder liability for the acts and obligations of the Trust and provides that
	(i) no shareholder will be subject to any personal liability whatsoever to any person in connection with
	the Trusts property or the acts, obligations or affairs of the Trust and (ii) the trustees have
	no power to bind any shareholder personally or to call upon any shareholder for the payment of any money
	or assessment other than that which the shareholder personally agrees to pay in connection with share
	subscriptions or otherwise.




	Each Corporations charter contains an exculpation provision
	that eliminates liability of its present and former directors and officers to the maximum extent permitted
	by Maryland law, subject to the limitations of the 1940 Act. Under Maryland law, the only exceptions
	to the liability limitation permitted in the charter are: (i) actual receipt of an improper benefit or
	profit in money, property or services, and (ii) active and deliberate dishonesty established by a final
	judgment as material to the cause of action. Under the 1940 Act, each Corporation is prohibited from
	protecting any of its directors or officers for any liability to the Corporation or its stockholders
	arising from such persons willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard
	of the duties involved in the conduct of such persons office.


	Under Maryland law, each Corporations
	stockholders generally are not personally liable for the Corporations debts or obligations.






	Each master trust agreement and by-laws provide that the Trust will indemnify each shareholder
	for any personal liability he or she incurs, as described under "Indemnification" below.



	 








	Each Trusts trust agreement requires the Trust (on behalf of each sub-trust) to
	provide for indemnification of each of its trustees or officers (including persons who serve at the Trusts
	request as directors, officers, or trustees of another organization in which the Trust has any interest
	as a shareholder, creditor or otherwise) (a Covered Person) against all liabilities, including
	but not limited to amounts paid in satisfaction of judgements, in compromise or as fines and penalties,
	and expenses, including reasonable accountants and counsels fees, incurred by any Covered
	Person in connection with the defense or disposition of any action, suit or other proceeding, whether
	civil or criminal, before any court or administrative or legislative body, in which such Covered Person
	may be or may have been involved as a party or otherwise or with which such person may be or may have
	been threatened, while in office or thereafter, by reason of being or having been such a trustee or officer,
	except with respect to any matter as to which it has been determined that such Covered Person (i) did
	not act in good faith in the reasonable belief that such Covered Persons action was in or not opposed
	to the best interests of the Trust or (ii) had acted with willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence
	or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such Covered Persons office




	The MGCL requires each Corporation
	(unless its charter provides otherwise, which the Corporations charters do not) to indemnify a
	director or officer who has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any proceeding
	to which he or she is made or threatened to be made a party by reason of his or her service in that capacity.
	The MGCL (and each Corporations by-laws) permits a Corporation to indemnify its present and former
	directors and officers, among others, against judgments, penalties, fines, settlements and reasonable
	expenses actually incurred by them in connection with any proceeding to which they may be made or threatened
	to be made a party by reason of their service in those or other capacities to which such person is or
	was serving at the request of the Corporation unless it is established that: (i) the act or omission
	of the director or officer was material to the matter giving rise to the proceeding and (a) was
	committed in bad faith or (b) was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty; (ii) the
	director or officer actually received an improper personal benefit in money, property or services; or
	(iii) in the case of any criminal proceeding, the director or officer had reasonable cause to believe
	that the act or omission was unlawful. Under the MGCL, however, a Maryland corporation may not indemnify
	a director or officer for an adverse judgment in a






	PAGE 49












	 


	 


	 


	 




	 


	 



	(Disabling Conduct). A determination that the Covered Person is entitled
	to indemnification may be made by (i) a final decision on the merits by a court or other body before
	whom the proceeding was brought that the person to be indemnified was not liable by reason of Disabling
	Conduct, (ii) dismissal of a court action or any administrative proceeding against a Covered Person for
	insufficiency of evidence of Disabling Conduct, or (iii) a reasonable determination, based upon a review
	of the facts, that the indemnitee was not liable by reason of Disabling Conduct by (a) a vote of the
	majority of a quorum of trustees who are neither interested trustees (as defined in the 1940
	Act) nor parties to the proceeding, or (b) an independent legal counsel in a written opinion.


	Expenses,
	including accountants and counsel fees so incurred by any such Covered Person (excluding amounts
	paid in satisfaction of judgments, in compromise or as fines or penalties), may be paid from time to
	time by the sub-trust in question in advance of the final disposition of any such action, suit or proceeding,
	provided that the Covered Person shall have undertaken to repay the amounts so paid to the sub-trust
	in question if it is ultimately determined that indemnification of such expenses is not authorized under
	each trust agreement and (i) the Covered Person shall have provided security for such undertaking, (ii)
	the Trust shall be insured against losses arising by reason of any lawful advances, or (iii) a majority
	of a quorum of the disinterested trustees who are not a party to the proceeding, or an independent legal
	counsel in a written opinion, have determined, based on a




	suit by or in the right of the
	Corporation or for a judgment of liability on the basis that personal benefit was improperly received,
	unless in either case a court orders indemnification and then only for expenses.


	The MGCL permits
	(and each Corporations charter requires) each Corporation to advance reasonable expenses to a director
	or officer upon the Corporations receipt of: (i) a written affirmation by the director or
	officer of his or her good faith belief that he or she has met the standard of conduct necessary for
	indemnification by the corporation; and (ii) a written undertaking by the director or officer or
	on the directors or officers behalf to repay the amount paid or reimbursed by the corporation
	if it is ultimately determined that the director or officer did not meet the standard of conduct.


	Subject
	to the limitations of the 1940 Act, each Corporations charter authorizes the Corporation to obligate
	itself, and its by-laws obligate it, to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law in effect from time
	to time, to indemnify and, without requiring a preliminary determination of the ultimate entitlement
	to indemnification, pay or reimburse reasonable expenses in advance of final disposition of a proceeding
	to: (i) any present or former director or officer who is made or threatened to be made a party to
	the proceeding by reason of his or her service in that capacity; or (ii) any individual who, while
	a director or officer of the Corporation and at the Corporation's request, serves or has served another
	corporation, real estate investment trust, partnership, joint venture, limited liability company, trust,
	employee

	review of readily available facts (as opposed to a full trial-type inquiry), that there
	is reason to believe that the Covered Person ultimately will be found entitled to indemnification.


	In
	cases where a shareholder (or former shareholder) of any sub-trust shall be charged or held to be personally
	liable for any obligation or liability of the Trust solely by reason of being or having been a shareholder
	and not because of such shareholders acts or omissions or for some other reason, the sub-trust
	(upon proper and timely request by the shareholder) shall assume the defense against such charge and
	satisfy any judgment thereon, and the shareholder or former shareholder (or his heirs or other representatives
	or in the case of a corporation or other entity, its corporate or other general successor) shall be entitled
	out of the assets of said sub-trust estate to be held harmless from and indemnified against all loss
	and expense arising from such liability.




	benefit plan or any other enterprise
	as a director, officer, partner, manager, managing member or trustee and who is made or threatened to
	be made a party to the proceeding by reason of his or her service in that capacity. Under the 1940 Act,
	each Corporation may not indemnify any director or officer for any liability to which such person would
	be subject by reason of such persons willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless
	disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his or her office.



	Each Corporations charter
	and by-laws also permit the Corporation to indemnify and advance expenses to any person who served a
	predecessor of the Corporation in any of the capacities described above and to any employee or agent
	of the Corporation or a predecessor of the Corporation.









	Shareholder
	Voting Rights




	The language included in the
	Maryland charters provides more flexibility in how a shareholder vote may be obtained because it permits
	multiple series to vote together while the Massachusetts trust agreements only allow series to vote together
	if required by law.




	On each matter submitted to
	a vote of the shareholders, each holder of a share of each sub-trust is entitled to one vote for each
	whole share and to a proportionate fractional vote for each fractional share in his or her name, and
	all shares of each sub-trust shall vote as separate class except as to voting for trustees and as otherwise
	required by the 1940 Act. As to any matter which does not affect the interest of a particular sub-trust,
	only the holders of shares of the one or more affected sub-trusts are entitled to vote.


	Shareholders have the right
	to vote only on certain matters set forth in each Trusts trust




	Each charter provides that on each matter submitted to a vote of
	the shareholders, each holder of shares shall be entitled to one vote for each whole share standing in
	his name on the books of the Corporation, irrespective of the Series thereof, and the exclusive voting
	power for all purposes shall be vested in the holders of Common Stock.


	In general, all shares of all
	Series shall vote as a single class as to any matters in which such share of stock is entitled to vote
	and each fractional share of stock shall be entitled to a proportionate fractional vote (unless, among
	other things, the 1940 Act or the MGCL requires each

	agreement, including, among other things, the election and removal of trustees, with
	respect to any contract that requires shareholder approval under the 1940 Act, with respect to any termination
	or reorganization of a Trust or any sub-trust (as described in each trust agreement), and with respect
	to certain amendments to the trust agreement, and with respect to any additional matters as may be required
	by the 1940 Act, the by-laws, or the trust agreement.




	series or class to vote separately).






	Action by Written Consent




	In Massachusetts, shareholders can take action by written consents if approved by a
	majority of shareholders; In Maryland, shareholders can take action by written consents if approved by
	all shareholders




	Each Trusts trust agreement
	provides that, except as otherwise provided by law, any action required or permitted to be taken at any
	meeting of shareholders may be taken without a meeting if a majority of the shareholders entitled to
	vote upon the action consent to the action in writing and such consent is filed with the records of the
	Trust. Such consent will be treated for all purposes as a vote taken at a meeting of shareholders.




	Under the MGCL and each Corporations
	by-laws, a consent to any action in lieu of a meeting of stockholders requires the written or electronically
	transmitted consent of the holders of all outstanding shares entitled to vote on the matter.






	Record Date




	The Massachusetts trust agreements
	require the record date to be not more than 60 days prior to the date of any shareholder meeting, while
	Maryland requires the record date to be not more than 90 days (nor less than 10 days) prior to the shareholder
	meeting.




	Each trust agreement provides
	that, for the purpose of determining the shareholders who are entitled to vote at a shareholder meeting,
	or who are entitled to participate in any dividend or distribution, the record may not exceed 30 days,
	if the trustees have closed the transfer books for such period; or, without closing the transfer books,
	the record date must not be more than 60 days prior to the date of any shareholder meeting.




	Each charter provides that,
	in general, the record date shall be a date not more than 90 days nor, in the case of a meeting of shareholders,
	less than 10 days prior to the date on which the particular action, requiring such determination of shareholders,
	is to be taken.






	Quorum and Required Vote; Adjournment Period




	The Maryland charters require
	a shareholder meeting to be adjourned to a date not more than 120 days after the




	Each trust agreement provides that, in general, a majority of the
	shares entitled to vote constitutes a quorum at a shareholders meeting, but any lesser number is
	sufficient




	Each charter provides that,
	in general, one-third of the votes entitled to be cast at the shareholder meeting constitutes a quorum.






	PAGE
	52










	 





	Each charter provides that, in general, one-third of the votes entitled to be cast at
	the shareholder meeting constitutes a quorum.






	In general, a majority of all
	the votes cast at a meeting at which a quorum is present is sufficient to approve any matter which properly
	comes before the meeting (or a plurality in the case of the election of directors), unless a different
	vote is required or permitted by any provision of the 1940 Act, other applicable laws, or the charter.


	Notice
	of adjournment of a shareholders meeting to another time or place need not be given if such time
	and place are announced at the meeting, unless the adjournment is for more than 120 days after the original
	record date.


	Each by-laws provides that, in the absence of a quorum, the holders of a majority of
	shares entitled to vote at the meeting and present thereat in person or by proxy, or, if no shareholder
	entitled to vote is present in person or by proxy, any officer present who is entitled to preside at
	or act as Secretary of such meeting, may adjourn the meeting sine die or from time to time. Any business
	that might have been transacted at the meeting originally called may be transacted at any such adjourned
	meeting at which a quorum is present.






	Under the MGCL, a Maryland corporation
	generally may not dissolve, amend its charter, merge, consolidate, sell all or substantially all of its
	assets or engage in a statutory share exchange unless declared advisable by the board of directors and
	approved by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter,
	unless a greater or lesser percentage (but not less than a majority of the votes

	53












	 


	 


	 


	 




	 


	 



	and the trustees may sell, convey, and transfer the assets of the Trust, or the assets
	belonging to any one or more sub-trusts, to another organization, provided that no assets belonging to
	any particular sub-trust are transferred unless the terms of such transfer shall have first been approved
	at a meeting called for the purpose by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
	voting shares, as defined in the 1940 Act, of that sub-trust.


	Under the 1940 Act, the vote of a majority of
	the outstanding voting securities of a company means the vote, at the annual or a special meeting of
	the security holders of such company duly called, (i) of 67% or more of the voting securities present
	at such meeting, if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company
	are present or represented by proxy; or (ii) of more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of
	such company, whichever is the less.




	entitled to be cast on the matter)
	is set forth in the Corporations charter. Each Corporations charter generally provides for
	the approval of these matters by a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter (unless a
	different vote is required under the 1940 Act or other applicable law).


	The MGCL provides an exception
	to the stockholder approval requirements (and requirement to file articles of transfer) for transfers
	of all or substantially all of the assets of a corporation registered as an open-end investment company
	under the 1940 Act.






	Amendment of Trust Agreement / Charter and By-Laws




	In general, the Massachusetts trust


	agreements can be amended by
	approval of a majority of the trustees whereas the Maryland Corporations charters can only be amended
	with a shareholder vote.




	In general, the trust agreement
	and by-laws can be amended by approval of a majority of the trustees. All rights granted under each trust
	agreement are subject to the reservation of the right to amend the trust agreement, provided that no
	amendment can repeal the limitations on personal liability of any shareholder or trustee or repeal the
	prohibition of assessment upon shareholders without the express consent of each shareholder or trustee
	involved.


	Any
	amendment to a trust agreement that adversely affects the rights of shareholders may be adopted at any
	time when authorized




	Under the MGCL, a Maryland corporation
	may amend its charter by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all outstanding stock entitled to vote
	or of each class if more than one class is entitled to vote on such amendment. The charter provides the
	Corporation the right to make any amendments to the charter (as authorized by the 1940 Act and relevant
	MGCL provisions), including any amendment altering the terms or contract rights, of any shares of its
	outstanding stock by classification, reclassification, or otherwise.




	Pursuant to the Corporations

	to do so by the vote of a majority of the shares entitled to vote.




	charter,
	a majority of the board of directors has the power, without stockholder approval, to amend the Corporations
	charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock, or the number of shares of any
	class or series of stock, that the Corporation is authorized to issue.




	In general, any amendment or
	repeal of the by-laws must be approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of either: (i) the holders
	of record of the outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote; or (ii) the directors
	present at any meeting at which a quorum is present.


	No amendment of the charter of any Corporation
	or repeal of any of its provisions shall limit or eliminate the indemnification rights provided in the
	charter with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to such amendment or repeal. In addition, no
	amendment of the charter of any Corporation or repeal of any of its provisions shall limit or eliminate
	the limitation on liability provided to directors and officers in the charter with respect to any act
	or omission occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.






	Meeting
	of Holders; Right to Call Special Meetings; Advance Notice of Stockholder Nominations for Director and
	Other Stockholder Proposals




	Maryland law and the Maryland
	charters are more restrictive in terms of when and how shareholders can call a special meeting.




	None of the Trusts are required
	to hold annual meetings of its shareholders.


	Each Trusts by-laws provide that special meetings
	of shareholders will be held whenever called by the board of trustees and whenever election of a trustee
	or trustees by shareholders is required by the provisions of Section 16(a) of the 1940 Act for that purpose.
	Each Trusts by-laws also provide that a meeting of shareholders for any purpose




	None of the Corporations are required to hold annual meetings of
	their stockholders unless the 1940 Act requires an election of directors by shareholders.




	Each
	Corporations by-laws provide that special meetings of the Corporations stockholders may be
	called by the board of directors and certain of the Corporations officers. Each Corporations





	PAGE
	55











	 


	 


	 


	 




	 


	 



	shall be called by the trustees when requested in writing by shareholders holding at
	least 10% of the shares then outstanding of the Trust pertaining to any sub-trust.


	Notices of any meeting of the
	shareholders shall be given by delivering or mailing, postage prepaid, to each shareholder entitled to
	vote at said meeting, a written or printed notification of such meeting, at least 15 days before the
	meeting, to such address as may be registered with the Trust by the shareholder.




	by-laws
	also provide that, special meetings of the shareholders shall be called by the Secretary on the written
	request of shareholders entitled to cast (i) in the case of a meeting for the purpose of removing a director,
	at least 10% and (ii) in the case of a meeting for any other purpose, at least 25%, in each case of all
	the votes entitled to be cast at such meeting, provided that any such request satisfies certain procedural
	and informational requirements by the stockholders requesting the meeting. Unless requested by shareholders
	entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting, a special meeting need
	not be called to consider any matter which is substantially the same as a matter voted upon at any special
	meeting of the shareholders held during the preceding 12 months.


	The charter provides that for any shareholder
	proposal to be presented in connection with an annual meeting of shareholders of the Corporation, including
	any proposal relating to the nomination of a director to be elected to the board of directors, the shareholders
	must, among other things, have given timely notice. Shareholder proposals to be presented in connection
	with a special meeting of shareholders will be presented by the Corporation only to the extent required
	by the MGCL.


	Under the MGCL, the board of directors has the sole power to fix the record date for
	determining stockholders entitled to request a special meeting, the record date for determining stockholders
	entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting and the date, time and place, if any, and the
	means of remote communication, if any, by

	which stockholders and proxy
	holders may be considered present in person and may vote at the special meeting.


	Pursuant to the Corporations
	charters, notice of a shareholder meeting must be given not less than 10 days, nor more than 90 days
	before each shareholders meeting.









	Distributions and Dividends




	No significant differences




	Each trust agreement provides
	that dividends and distributions on shares of a particular sub-trust may be paid with such frequency
	as the trustees may determine, to the holders of shares of that sub-trust, from the income, capital gains,
	accrued or realized, from the assets belonging to that sub-trust, as the trustees may determine, after
	providing for actual and accrued liabilities belonging to that sub-trust. All dividends and distributions
	on shares of a particular sub-trust shall be distributed pro-rata to the holders of shares of that sub-trust
	in proportion to the number of shares of that sub-trust held by such holders at the date and time of
	record established for the payment of such dividends or distributions. Any such dividend or distribution
	paid in shares shall be paid at the current net asset value of the sub-trust.




	Each Corporations charter provides that dividends and capital
	gains distributions on shares of a particular Series may be paid with such frequency, in such form, and
	in such amount as the board of directors may determine, after providing for actual and accrued liabilities
	of that Series. All dividends on shares of a particular Series shall be paid only out of the income belonging
	to that Series and all capital gains distributions on shares of a particular Series shall be paid only
	out of the capital gains belonging to that Series. All dividends and distributions on shares of a particular
	Series shall be distributed pro rata to the holders of that Series in proportion to the number of shares
	of that Series held by such holders at the date and time of record established for the payment of such
	dividends or distributions. Any such dividend or distribution paid in shares shall be paid at the current
	net asset value of the Series.









	Rights Upon Liquidation and Dissolution/
	Termination




	The Massachusetts trust agreements
	require that the liquidation of a Trust or any sub-trust be approved by a 1940 Act majority of shareholders.
	Maryland law has a less stringent requirement and




	In the event of the liquidation or dissolution of a Trust, the shareholders of each
	sub-trust that has been established and designated shall be entitled to receive, when and as declared
	by the trustees, the excess of the assets belonging to that sub-trust over the liabilities belonging
	to that sub-trust. The assets so distributable to




	Under the MGCL and each Corporations charter, the board of directors of a Maryland
	corporation may dissolve the corporation by resolution of a majority of the board of directors that declares
	that the dissolution is advisable. A vote of a majority of all votes entitled to be cast on the proposed
	dissolution is

	requires that a majority of
	all votes entitled to be cast at a meeting in which a quorum is present approve the liquidation of a
	Corporation. In addition, pursuant to our charters, if the Corporation has multiple Series, our Charters
	allow a Series of a Corporation to be liquidated and terminated without a shareholder vote.




	the shareholders of any particular sub-trust shall be distributed among such shareholders
	in proportion to the number of shares of that sub-trust held by them and recorded on the books of the
	Trust.


	The termination of a Trust, or the liquidation of any particular sub-trust, may be authorized
	by the vote of a majority of the trustees then in office subject to the approval of a majority of the
	outstanding voting shares of that sub-trust, as defined in the 1940 Act.




	required
	to approve the dissolution. In addition, the MGCL provides that shareholders of a corporation entitled
	to cast at least 25% of all the votes that may be cast in the election of directors may petition a court
	of equity for an involuntary dissolution of the corporation on certain enumerated grounds set forth in
	the MGCL (including, among other things, failure of the shareholders to elect directors).


	Each Corporations charter
	provides that in the event of the liquidation of a particular Series, the shareholders of the Series
	that is being liquidated shall be entitled to receive, as a class, when and as declared by the board
	of directors, the excess of the assets belonging to that Series over the liabilities of that Series.
	The holders of shares of any particular Series shall not be entitled thereby to any distribution upon
	liquidation of any other Series. The assets so distributable to the shareholders of any particular Series
	shall be distributed among such shareholders in proportion to the number of shares of that Series held
	by them and recorded on the books of the Corporation. The liquidation of any particular Series in which
	there are shares then outstanding may be authorized by vote of a majority of the board of directors then
	in office, and, if required by the 1940 Act, subject to the approval of a majority of the outstanding
	voting securities of that Series, as defined in the 1940 Act, and without the vote of the holders of
	shares of any other Series. The liquidation of a particular Series may be accomplished, in whole or in
	part, by the transfer of assets of such Series to another Series or to a series of another corporation,
	trust or other entity registered as an open-

	Series or shares of a series of another corporation, trust or other entity registered as an open-end
	management investment company under the Investment Company Act, or by any other means permitted under
	applicable law.






	Appraisal Rights




	No significant differences




	Each Trusts shareholders have no appraisal rights.




	Based on an exception in the MGCL for open-end investment companies
	registered under the 1940 Act, holders of each Corporations common stock have no appraisal rights.

	SIXTH


	:

	(a) The total number of shares of stock of all classes and series which the
	Corporation initially has authority to issue is Number of Shares shares of capital stock (par value $Par
	Value per Share per share), amounting in aggregate par value to Par Value. All of such shares are initially
	classified and designated as 

	Common Stock

	.
	The Board of Directors may classify and reclassify any unissued shares of capital stock (whether or not
	such shares have been previously classified or reclassified) from time to time by setting or changing
	in any one or more respects the class or series designations or setting or changing in any one or more
	respects the preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to
	dividends, qualifications, or terms or conditions of redemption of such shares of capital stock. A majority
	of the entire Board of Directors, without action by the stockholders, may amend the Charter of the Corporation
	to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any
	class or series that the Corporation has authority to issue.



	 

	(b)
	The shares of Common Stock of the Corporation may be divided and classified into separate series. The
	shares of Common Stock of the Corporation, or of any series of Common Stock of the Corporation to the
	extent such Common Stock is divided into series, may be further subdivided into classes. Unless otherwise
	provided herein or in Articles Supplementary establishing such classes, all such shares, or all shares
	of a series of Common Stock in a series, shall have identical voting, dividend, and liquidation rights.
	Shares of the classes may also be subject to such front-end sales loads, contingent deferred sales charges,
	expenses (including, without limitation, distribution expenses under a Rule 12b-1 plan and administrative
	expenses under an administration or service agreement, plan or other arrangement, however designated),
	conversion rights, and class voting rights as shall be consistent with Maryland law, the Investment Company
	Act and the rules and regulations of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (

	FINRA

	)


	PAGE 62








	and
	shall be contained herein or in Articles Supplementary establishing such classes.



	 

	(c)
	All of the authorized shares of Common Stock are initially classified as a series of Common Stock designated
	as the 

	[Series Name]

	 and separate
	classes of that series of Common Stock designated as the 

	[Class
	Name]

	. Any series of Common Stock shall be referred to herein individually and collectively,
	together with any further series from time to time established, as 

	Series

	. References to 

	Series

	
	may, for convenience also include any classes of a series of Common Stock notwithstanding that, if powers,
	rights, preferences or limitations of a class differ from those of the other shares of the Series, such
	class shall be referred to herein individually as 

	Class

	
	and collectively, together with any further classes from time to time established, as 

	Classes

	.



	 

	(d) Each such
	Series and/or Class shall consist, until further changed, of the lesser of (x) Number of Shares
	shares or (y) the number of shares that could be issued by issuing all of the shares of any Series and/or
	Class currently or hereafter classified less the total number of shares then issued and outstanding in
	all of such Series and/or Classes.



	 

	(e) The following
	is a description of the preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations
	as to dividends, qualifications, and terms and conditions of redemption of the Common Stock classified
	as the [Series Name] and/or [Class Name] and any additional Series or Classes of Common Stock (unless
	provided otherwise by the Board of Directors in classifying or reclassifying the shares of any such additional
	Series):



	 


	 

	(1)

	Assets Belonging to Series


	.

	Except to the extent otherwise required under the Investment Company Act,
	all consideration received by the Corporation from the issue or sale of shares of a particular Series,
	together with all assets in which such consideration is invested or


	PAGE 63








	reinvested,
	all income, earnings, profits, and proceeds thereof, including any proceeds derived from the sale, exchange,
	or liquidation of such assets, and any funds or payments derived from any investment or reinvestment
	of such proceeds in whatever form the same may be, shall irrevocably belong to that Series for all purposes,
	subject to the rights of creditors, and shall be so recorded upon the books of account of the Corporation.
	Such consideration, assets, income, earnings, profits, and proceeds, together with any items allocated
	as provided in the following sentence, are hereinafter referred to collectively as the assets belonging
	to that Series. In the event that there are any assets, income, earnings, profits, or proceeds
	which are not readily identifiable as belonging to any particular Series, such items shall be allocated
	by or under the supervision of the Board of Directors to and among any one or more of the Series from
	time to time classified or reclassified, in such manner and on such basis as the Board of Directors,
	in its sole discretion, deems fair and equitable and subject to the applicable provisions of the Investment
	Company Act; and any general items so allocated to a particular Series shall belong to that Series. Each
	such allocation by the Board of Directors shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes.



	 


	 

	(2)

	Liabilities
	of Series.

	Except to the extent otherwise required under the Investment Company Act, the assets
	belonging to each Series shall be charged with the liabilities of the Corporation in respect of that
	Series and all expenses, costs, charges, and reserves attributable to that Series. Any liabilities, expenses,
	costs, charges, or reserves of the Corporation which are attributable to more than one Series, or are
	not readily identifiable as pertaining to any particular Series, shall be allocated and charged by or
	under the supervision of the Board of Directors to and among one or more of the Series established and
	designated from time to time in such manner and on such basis as the Board of Directors, in its sole
	discretion, deems fair and equitable, and subject to the applicable provisions of the Investment Company
	Act. The liabilities, expenses, costs, charges, and reserves so charged to a Series are herein referred
	to collectively as the 

	liabilities of

	
	that Series. Each


	PAGE 64








	allocation
	of liabilities, expenses, costs, charges, and reserves by or under the supervision of the Board of Directors
	shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes.




	 




	 

	(3)


	Dividends and Distributions.




	 


	 


	 

	(A)
	Dividends and capital gains distributions on shares of a particular Series may be paid with such frequency,
	in such form, and in such amount as the Board of Directors may determine by resolution adopted from time
	to time, or pursuant to a standing resolution or resolutions adopted only once or with such frequency
	as the Board of Directors may determine, after providing for actual and accrued liabilities of that Series.
	All dividends on shares of a particular Series shall be paid only out of the income belonging to that
	Series and all capital gains distributions on shares of a particular Series shall be paid only out of
	the capital gains belonging to that Series. All dividends and distributions on shares of a particular
	Series shall be distributed pro rata to the holders of that Series in proportion to the number of shares
	of that Series held by such holders at the date and time of record established for the payment of such
	dividends or distributions, except that, in connection with any dividend or distribution program or procedure,
	the Board of Directors may determine that no dividend or distribution shall be payable on shares as to
	which the stockholders purchase order and/or payment have not been received by the time or times
	established by the Board of Directors under such program or procedure.



	 


	 


	 

	(B) Dividends
	and distributions on shares of any Series, whether payable in cash, property, or additional shares of
	the same or another Series, or a combination thereof, shall be paid only out of earnings, surplus, or
	other assets belonging to such Series and may vary among the Classes of a Series, all as determined by
	the Board of Directors or pursuant to any program that the Board of Directors may have in effect at the
	time for the election by stockholders of the form in which dividends or distributions are to


	PAGE 65








	be
	paid. Any such dividend or distribution paid in shares shall be paid at the current net asset value thereof.



	 


	 

	(4)

	Voting.

	On each matter submitted to a vote of the stockholders,
	each holder of shares shall be entitled to one vote for each whole share standing in his name on the
	books of the Corporation, irrespective of the Series thereof, and the exclusive voting power for all
	purposes shall be vested in the holders of Common Stock. All shares of all Series shall vote as a single
	class (

	Single Class Voting

	) as to
	any matters in which such share of stock is entitled to vote and each fractional share of stock shall
	be entitled to a proportionate fractional vote; provided, however, that (i) as to any matter with respect
	to which a separate vote of any Series is required by the Investment Company Act or by the Maryland General
	Corporation Law, such requirement as to a separate vote by that Series shall apply in lieu of Single
	Class Voting in addition to any other vote that may be required by law; (ii) in the event that the separate
	vote requirement referred to in clause (i) above applies with respect to more than one Series and the
	interests of those Series are the same, then, subject to clause (iv) below, the shares of all such Series
	shall vote as a single class in addition to any other vote that may be required by law, (iii) in
	the event that the separate vote requirement referred to in clause (i) above applies with respect to
	one or more Series, then, subject to clause (iv) below, the shares of all other Series shall vote as
	a single class in addition to any other vote that may be required by law; and (iv) as to any matter which
	does not affect the interest of a particular Series, including liquidation of another Series as described
	in paragraph (7) below, only the holders of shares of the one or more affected Series shall be entitled
	to vote in addition to any other vote that may be required by law.



	 


	 

	(5)

	Redemption.

	The shares of any Series shall be subject to redemption as follows:



	 


	 


	 

	(A) Each holder
	of shares of any Series shall have the right to require the Corporation, to the extent it has funds or
	other


	PAGE
	66








	property
	legally available therefor and subject to such reasonable terms and conditions as the Board of Directors
	may determine, including, without limitation, such terms and conditions as may be required or permitted
	under the Investment Company Act, to redeem all or any part of his shares of such Series at a redemption
	price equal to the current net asset value per share of that Series which is next computed after receipt
	of a tender of such shares for redemption, less such redemption fee or other fee or charge, if any, as
	the Board of Directors may from time to time establish in accordance with the Investment Company Act,
	rules adopted by FINRA, and any other applicable securities law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation
	may suspend the right of holders of shares of any Series to require the Corporation to redeem their shares,
	or postpone the date of payment or satisfaction upon such redemption for more than seven days after tender
	of such shares for redemption, during any period or at any time when and to the extent required or permitted
	under the Investment Company Act.



	 


	 


	 

	(B) To the extent and in the manner permitted by the Investment
	Company Act and the Maryland General Corporation Law, and if authorized by the Board of Directors in
	its sole discretion, the Corporation may redeem at any time and from time to time, in whole or in part,
	at their current net asset value, less such redemption fee or other fee or charge, if any, as the Board
	of Directors may from time to time establish in accordance with the Investment Company Act, rules adopted
	by FINRA, and any other applicable securities law, shares of any Series from any stockholder, upon the
	sending of written, telegraphic, or electronic notice of redemption to each holder whose shares are so
	redeemed and upon such terms and conditions as the Board of Directors shall deem advisable. A redemption
	under this paragraph (5)(B), even if it is for all the shares of a Series shall not be considered a liquidation
	under paragraph (7) requiring a vote of stockholders.


	PAGE 67









	 


	 

	(6)

	Redemption Payments.

	Except to the extent otherwise required
	or permitted under the Investment Company Act, all redemptions shall be at a redemption price equal to
	the current net asset value per share of shares of that Series to be redeemed as determined by the Board
	of Directors from time to time in accordance with the provisions of applicable law, less such redemption
	fee or other charge, if any, as may be fixed by resolution of the Board of Directors. Payment of the
	redemption price shall be made by the Corporation only from the assets belonging to the Series whose
	shares are being redeemed. The redemption price shall be paid in cash and/or, if authorized by the Board
	of Directors in its sole discretion, (a) securities at the value of such securities used in such determination
	of current net asset value or (b) shares of another Series of the Corporation or shares of a series of
	another corporation, trust or other entity registered as an open-end management investment company under
	the Investment Company Act received by the Corporation in exchange for the assets of a Series; provided,
	however, that if the Board of Directors determines, which determination shall be conclusive, that conditions
	exist which make payment wholly in cash and/or securities unwise or undesirable, the Corporation may,
	to the extent and in the manner permitted by law, make payment wholly or partly in other assets, at the
	value of such other assets used in such determination of current net asset value. Any certificates for
	shares of capital stock of the Corporation to be redeemed or repurchased shall be surrendered in proper
	form for transfer, together with any proof of the authenticity of signatures required by the Board of
	Directors or transfer agent of the Corporation.



	 


	 

	(7)

	Liquidation.

	In the event
	of the liquidation of a particular Series, the stockholders of the Series that is being liquidated shall
	be entitled to receive, as a class, when and as declared by the Board of Directors, the excess of the
	assets belonging to that Series over the liabilities of that Series. The holders of shares of any particular
	Series shall not be entitled thereby to any distribution upon liquidation of any other Series. The assets
	so distributable to the stockholders of any particular Series shall be distributed


	PAGE 68








	among
	such stockholders in proportion to the number of shares of that Series held by them and recorded on the
	books of the Corporation. The liquidation of any particular Series in which there are shares then outstanding
	may be authorized by vote of a majority of the Board of Directors then in office, and, if required by
	the Investment Company Act, subject to the approval of a majority of the outstanding voting securities
	of that Series, as defined in the Investment Company Act, and without the vote of the holders of shares
	of any other Series. The liquidation of a particular Series may be accomplished, in whole or in part,
	by the transfer of assets of such Series to another Series or to a series of another corporation, trust
	or other entity registered as an open-end management investment company under the Investment Company
	Act, by the exchange of shares of such Series for the shares of another Series or shares of a series
	of another corporation, trust or other entity registered as an open-end management investment company
	under the Investment Company Act, or by any other means permitted under applicable law.



	 


	 

	(8)

	Net
	Asset Value.

	The net asset value per share of any Series shall be the quotient obtained by dividing
	the value of the net assets of that Series (being the value of the assets belonging to that Series less
	the liabilities of that Series) by the total number of shares of that Series outstanding, all as determined
	by or under the direction of the Board of Directors in accordance with generally accepted accounting
	principles and the Investment Company Act. Subject to the applicable provisions of the Investment Company
	Act, the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may prescribe and shall set forth in the By-Laws
	of the Corporation, or in a duly adopted resolution of the Board of Directors, such bases and times for
	determining the value of the assets belonging to, and the net asset value per share of outstanding shares
	of, each Series or Class, or the net income attributable to such shares, as the Board of Directors deems
	necessary or desirable. The Board of Directors shall have full discretion, to the extent not inconsistent
	with the Maryland General Corporation Law and the Investment Company Act, to determine which items shall
	be treated as income and which


	PAGE 69








	items
	as capital and whether any item of expense shall be charged to income or capital. Each such determination
	and allocation shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes.



	 


	 

	(9)

	Conversion
	or Exchange Rights.

	Subject to compliance with the Investment Company Act, the Board of Directors
	shall have authority to provide that holders of shares of any Series or Classes shall have the right
	to convert or exchange their shares for shares of one or more other Series or Classes in accordance with
	such requirements and procedures as may be established by the Board of Directors.



	 


	 

	(10)

	Equality.

	All shares of each particular Series shall represent an equal proportionate interest in the assets belonging
	to that Series (subject to the liabilities of that Series), and each share of any particular Series shall
	be equal to each other share of that Series, except to the extent provided otherwise by the Charter of
	the Corporation or the Investment Company Act. The Board of Directors may from time to time divide or
	combine the shares of any particular Series into a greater or lesser number of shares of that Series
	without thereby changing the proportionate interest in the assets belonging to that Series or in any
	way affecting the rights of holders of shares of any other Series.



	 


	 

	(11)

	Conditions
	on Classes.

	Expenses uniquely related to the and/or [Class Name] and any further Classes hereafter
	established (including, without limitation, distribution expenses under a Rule 12b-1 plan and administrative
	expenses under an administration or service agreement, plan or other arrangement, however designated
	or as otherwise determined in accordance with the Investment Company Act) shall be borne by the particular
	Class, and shall be appropriately reflected (in the manner prescribed by the Board of Directors) in the
	net asset value, dividends, distribution and liquidation rights of the shares of that Class, all as the
	Board of Directors may determine by resolution from time to time, and shall be


	PAGE 70








	described
	in the prospectus or statement of additional information for such Class as and to the extent required
	by the Investment Company Act. As to any matter with respect to which a separate vote of any Class is
	required by the Investment Company Act, such requirement as to a separate vote by that Class shall apply
	in addition to any voting requirements established by the Maryland General Corporation Law. As to any
	matter which does not affect the interest of the all Classes of a Series, only the holders of shares
	of the affected Classes (or the holders of the particular Class or Classes) shall be entitled to vote.



	 

	(f) For the purposes hereof and of any articles supplementary
	to the Charter providing for the classification or reclassification of any shares of capital stock or
	of any other Charter document of the Corporation (unless otherwise provided in any such articles or document),
	any Class or Series of stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to rank:



	 


	 

	(1) prior to another Class or Series either as to dividends
	or upon liquidation, if the holders of such class or series shall be entitled to the receipt of dividends
	or of amounts distributable on liquidation, dissolution or winding up, as the case may be, in preference
	or priority to holders of such other Class or Series;



	 


	 

	(2) on a parity with another Class or Series either as to dividends
	or upon liquidation, whether or not the dividend rates, dividend payment dates or redemption or liquidation
	price per share thereof be different from those of such others, if the holders of such Class or Series
	of stock shall be entitled to receipt of dividends or amounts distributable upon liquidation, dissolution
	or winding up, as the case may be, in proportion to their respective dividend rates or redemption or
	liquidation prices, without preference or priority over the holders of such other Class or Series; and


	PAGE
	71









	 


	 

	(3) junior to
	another Class or Series either as to dividends or upon liquidation, if the rights of the holders of such
	Class or Series shall be subject or subordinate to the rights of the holders of such other class or series
	in respect of the receipt of dividends or the amounts distributable upon liquidation, dissolution or
	winding up, as the case may be.



	 

	(g) The Corporation
	may (but is not obligated to) issue and sell fractions of shares of capital stock having pro rata all
	the rights of full shares, including, without limitation, the right to vote and to receive dividends,
	and wherever the words share or shares are used in the Charter or By-Laws of
	the Corporation, they shall be deemed to include fractions of shares where the context does not clearly
	indicate that only full shares are intended.



	 

	(h) The Corporation
	shall not be obligated to issue certificates representing shares of capital stock. At the time of issue
	or transfer of shares without certificates, the Corporation shall provide the stockholder with such information
	as may be required under the Maryland General Corporation Law and the Maryland Uniform Commercial Code
	- Investment Securities.




	 


	(i)
	All of the preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends,
	qualifications, or terms or conditions of redemption of such shares of capital stock set forth in these
	Articles or in any Articles Supplementary establishing a Class or Series of Common Stock shall be subject
	to, and construed in accordance with, the requirements of the Investment Company Act. The determination
	by the Board of Directors, with the advice of counsel, that any of the preferences, conversion or other
	rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends, qualifications, or terms or conditions
	of redemption of such shares of capital stock set forth in these Articles or in any Articles Supplementary
	establishing a Series or Class of Common Stock is in conflict with the Investment Company Act, the regulated
	investment company provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or with other applicable laws and regulations
	shall be final and conclusive and shall be


	PAGE 72








	binding
	upon the Corporation and the stockholders. If and to the extent that the Board of Directors makes a determination
	pursuant to the foregoing sentence, then (a) the provisions of such applicable law or regulations shall
	control, and (b) such conflicting provisions of these Articles or any such Articles of Amendments or
	Articles Supplementary shall be deemed severable from the other provisions contained in these Articles
	or such Articles Supplementary.



	SEVENTH


	:


	 

	(a)
	The number of directors of the Corporation shall initially be one (1), which number may be increased
	or decreased pursuant to the By-Laws of the Corporation, but shall never be less than the minimum number
	permitted by the Maryland General Corporation Law. The name of the director who will serve until the
	first annual meeting and until his successors are elected and qualified is Edward C. Bernard.



	 

	(b) A director of the Corporation who with respect to the Corporation

	the issuance from time to time of shares of its stock of any Series (or Class thereof), whether now or

	Directors (or without consideration in the case of a stock split or stock dividend) and without any action
	by the stockholders.


	PAGE 73









	 

	(2) Except as may otherwise be provided by contract or the Investment
	Company Act, no holder of any stock or any other securities of the Corporation, whether now or hereafter
	authorized, shall have any preemptive right to subscribe for or purchase any stock or any other securities
	of the Corporation other than such, if any, as the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may determine
	and at such price or prices and upon such other terms as the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion,
	may fix; and any stock or other securities which the Board of Directors may determine to offer for subscription
	may, as the Board of Directors in its sole discretion shall determine, be offered to the holders of any

	of any or all other classes, series, or types of stock or other securities at the time outstanding.



	 

	(3) The Board of Directors of the Corporation shall, consistent
	with applicable law (including, without limitation, the Investment Company Act), have the power in its
	sole discretion (A) to determine from time to time in accordance with sound accounting practice or other
	reasonable valuation methods what constitutes annual or other net profits, earnings, surplus, net assets
	in excess of capital, net asset value, or net asset value per share; (B) to determine that retained earnings
	or surplus shall remain in the hands of the Corporation; (C) to set apart out of any funds of the Corporation
	such reserve or reserves in such amount or amounts and for such proper purpose or purposes as it shall
	determine and to abolish any such reserve or any part thereof; (D) to distribute and pay distributions
	or dividends in stock, cash, or other securities or property out of surplus or any other funds or amounts
	legally available therefor, at such times and to the stockholders of record on such dates as it may,
	from time to time, determine; (E) to determine whether and to what extent and at what times and places
	and under what conditions and regulations the books, accounts, and documents of the Corporation, or any
	of them, shall be open to the inspection of stockholders, except as


	PAGE 74








	otherwise
	provided by statute or the By-Laws of the Corporation, and, except as so provided, no stockholder shall
	have any right to inspect any book, account, or document of the Corporation unless authorized to do so
	by resolution of the Board of Directors; (F) to determine any matter relating to the sale, purchase,
	and/or other acquisition or disposition of securities or other assets of the Corporation; and (G) to
	determine any other matter relating to the business and affairs of the Corporation.



	 

	(4)
	Notwithstanding any provision of law requiring the authorization of any action by a greater proportion
	than a majority of the total number of shares of all Classes and Series of capital stock of the Corporation
	or of the total number of shares of any Class or Series of capital stock of the Corporation entitled
	to vote as a separate Class, such action shall be valid and effective if authorized by the affirmative
	vote of the holders of a majority of the total number of shares of all Classes and Series outstanding
	and entitled to vote thereon, or of the Class or Series entitled to vote thereon as a separate Class,
	as the case may be, except as otherwise provided in the Charter of the Corporation.



	 

	(5)
	The Corporation shall indemnify (A) its present and former directors and officers, whether serving or
	having served the Corporation or at its request any other entity, to the fullest extent required or permitted
	by Maryland law in effect from time to time (as limited by the Investment Company Act), including the
	advance of expenses under the procedures and to the fullest extent permitted by law, and (B) other employees
	and agents to such extent as shall be authorized by the Board of Directors or the By-Laws of the Corporation
	and as shall be permitted by law. The foregoing rights of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any
	other rights to which those seeking indemnification may be entitled. The Board of Directors may take
	such action as is necessary to carry out these indemnification provisions and is expressly empowered
	to adopt, approve, and amend from time to time such by-laws, resolutions, or contracts implementing such
	provisions or such


	PAGE 75








	further
	indemnification arrangements as may be permitted by law. No amendment of the Charter of the Corporation
	or repeal of any of its provisions shall limit or eliminate the right of indemnification provided hereunder
	with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.



	 

	(6)
	To the fullest extent permitted by Maryland law in effect from time to time (as limited by the Investment
	Company Act), no director or officer of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the Corporation
	or its stockholders for money damages. No amendment of the Charter of the Corporation or repeal of any
	of its provisions shall limit or eliminate the limitation on liability provided to directors and officers
	hereunder with respect to any act or omission occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.



	 

	(7)
	The Corporation reserves the right from time to time to make any amendments to the Charter of the Corporation
	which may now or hereafter be authorized by law, including any amendment altering the terms or contract
	rights, as expressly set forth in the Charter of the Corporation, of any shares of its outstanding stock
	by classification, reclassification, or otherwise.



	 

	(8)
	For any stockholder proposal to be presented in connection with an annual meeting of stockholders of
	the Corporation, including any proposal relating to the nomination of a director to be elected to the
	Board of Directors of the Corporation, the stockholders must have given timely notice thereof in writing
	to the Secretary of the Corporation in the manner and containing the information required by the By-Laws
	of the Corporation. Stockholder proposals to be presented in connection with a special meeting of stockholders
	will be presented by the Corporation only to the extent required by Section 2-502 of the Maryland General
	Corporation Law and the By-Laws of the Corporation.



	 

	(9)
	Except to the extent otherwise prohibited by applicable law, the Corporation may enter into any management
	or investment advisory contract


	PAGE 76








	or
	underwriting contract or any other type of contract with, and may otherwise engage in any transaction
	or do business with, any person, firm, or corporation or any subsidiary or other affiliate of any such
	person, firm, or corporation, and may authorize such person, firm, or corporation or such subsidiary
	or other affiliate to enter into any other contracts or arrangements with any other person, firm, or
	corporation which relate to the Corporation or the conduct of its business, notwithstanding that any
	directors or officers of the Corporation are or may subsequently become partners, directors, officers,
	stockholders, or employees of such person, firm, or corporation or of such subsidiary or other affiliate
	or may have a material financial interest in any such contract, transaction, or business; and except
	to the extent otherwise provided by applicable law, no such contract, transaction, or business shall
	be invalidated or voidable, or in any way affected thereby, nor shall any of such directors or officers
	of the Corporation be liable to the Corporation or to any stockholder or creditor thereof or to any other
	person for any loss incurred solely because of the entering into and performance of such contract or
	the engaging in such transaction or business or the existence of such material financial interest therein,
	provided that such relationship to such person, firm, or corporation or such subsidiary or affiliate
	or such material financial interest was disclosed or otherwise known to the Board of Directors prior
	to the Corporations entering into such contract or engaging in such transaction or business, and
	in the case of directors of the Corporation, that Section 2-419 of the Maryland General Corporation Law
	has been satisfied.



	 

	(10) Each provision of the Charter
	of the Corporation shall be severable from the other provisions contained in the Charter of the Corporation.
	If any provisions of the Charter of the Corporation shall be held invalid or unenforceable in any manner
	by any court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity or unenforceability shall pertain only to such
	provision in the Charter of the Corporation and shall not in any manner affect any other provision of
	the Charter of the Corporation.

	(b) The enumeration and definition of particular powers of the
	Board of Directors included in the foregoing shall in no way be limited or restricted by reference to
	or inference from the terms of any other clause of this or any other Article of the Charter of the Corporation,
	or construed as or deemed by inference or otherwise in any manner to exclude or limit any powers conferred
	upon the Board of Directors under Maryland law in effect from time to time.

	Bracketed
	citations are to the General Corporation Law of the State of Maryland (MGCL) or to the United
	States Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act), or to Rules
	of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder (SEC Rules). The citations

	facsimile to be impressed or affixed or printed or otherwise reproduced. In lieu of affixing the corporate
	seal to any document it shall be sufficient to meet the requirements of any law, rule, or regulation

	Section 2.01.

	 


	Annual
	Meetings

	: The Corporation shall not be required to hold an annual meeting of its shareholders
	in any year unless the Investment Company Act of 1940 requires an election of directors by shareholders.
	In the event that the Corporation shall be so required to hold an annual meeting, such meeting shall
	be held at a date and time set by the Board of Directors, which date shall be no later than 120 days
	after the occurrence of the event requiring the meeting.



	 


	 

	Any shareholders meeting held in accordance with the preceding
	sentence shall for all purposes constitute the annual meeting of shareholders for the fiscal year of
	the corporation in which the meeting is held. At any such meeting, the shareholders shall elect directors
	to hold the offices of any directors who have held office for more than one year or who have been elected
	by the Board of Directors to fill vacancies which result from any cause. Except as the Articles of Incorporation
	or statute provides otherwise, Directors may transact any business within the powers of the Corporation
	as may properly come before the meeting. Any business of the Corporation may be transacted at the annual
	meeting without being specially designated in the notice, except such business as is specifically required
	by statute to be stated in the notice. [ MGCL, Section 2-501 ]



	 

	Section 2.02.

	 


	Special

	the records of shareholders meetings, or to any shareholder who is present at the meeting in person
	or by proxy. Notice of adjournment of a shareholders meeting to another time or place need not

	Section
	10.01.

	 


	Indemnification and Payment of Expenses in Advance

	:
	The Corporation shall indemnify any individual (Indemnitee) who is a present or former director,
	officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation, or who is or has been serving at the request of the Corporation
	as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
	other enterprise, who, by reason of his position was, is, or is threatened to be made a party to any
	threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative,
	or investigative (hereinafter collectively referred to as a Proceeding) against any judgments,
	penalties, fines, settlements, and reasonable expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by such
	Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding, to the fullest extent that such indemnification may be
	lawful under Maryland law. The Corporation shall pay any reasonable expenses so incurred by such Indemnitee
	in defending a Proceeding in advance of the final disposition thereof to the fullest extent that such
	advance payment may be lawful under Maryland law. Subject to any applicable limitations and requirements
	set forth in the Corporations Articles of Incorporation and in these By-Laws, any payment of indemnification
	or advance of expenses shall be made in accordance with the procedures set forth in Maryland law.



	 

	Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall protect
	or purport to protect any Indemnitee against any liability to which he would otherwise be subject by
	reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of the duties involved
	in the conduct of his


	PAGE 19








	office (Disabling Conduct).



	 

	Anything
	in this Article X to the contrary notwithstanding, no indemnification shall be made by the Corporation
	to any Indemnitee unless:



	 


	 

	(a)

	 

	there is a final decision on the merits by a court or other
	body before whom the Proceeding was brought that the Indemnitee was not liable by reason of Disabling
	Conduct; or



	 


	 

	(b)

	 

	in the absence of such a decision, there is a reasonable determination,
	based upon a review of the facts, that the Indemnitee was not liable by reason of Disabling Conduct,
	which determination shall be made by:



	 


	 


	 

	(i)

	 

	the
	vote of a majority of a quorum of directors who are neither interested persons of the Corporation
	as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act, nor parties to the Proceeding; or



	 


	 


	 

	(ii)

	 

	an independent legal counsel in a written opinion.



	 

	Anything in this Article X to the contrary notwithstanding,
	any advance of expenses by the Corporation to any Indemnitee shall be made only upon the undertaking
	by such Indemnitee to repay the advance unless it is ultimately determined that such Indemnitee is entitled
	to indemnification as above provided, and only if one of the following conditions is met:



	 


	 

	(a)

	 

	the
	Indemnitee provides a security for his undertaking; or



	 


	 

	(b)

	 

	the Corporation
	shall be insured against losses arising by reason of any lawful advances; or



	 


	 

	(c)

	 

	there
	is a determination, based on a review of readily available facts, that there is reason to believe that
	the Indemnitee will ultimately be found entitled to indemnification, which determination shall be made
	by:



	 


	 


	 

	(i)

	 

	a majority
	of a quorum of directors who are neither interested persons of the Corporation as defined
	in Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act, nor parties to the Proceeding; or

	Privacy
	Policy



	Computershare
	wants to make your on-line experience satisfying and safe. Our aim is to safeguard the privacy and security
	of your personal information whilst providing a personalised service that meets your individual preference
	and needs. At all times we will comply with the prevailing laws and regulations governing the confidentiality
	and security of information.


	What information do we obtain about you and what do we use it for?



	Computershare collects
	information on-line primarily to make it easier for you to use our services. Depending on the services
	which you are accessing, you may be requested to provide personal information such as your name,








	address,
	e-mail address, bank account details, proxy voting preferences and information on your current shareholdings.
	We will use this information to maintain your account, process any requests and to provide you with the
	best possible service. We will not use your information for any purpose for which you would not reasonably
	expect us to use it.


	Security precautions



	We employ appropriate technical security measures to protect
	your personal information and to ensure that it is not accessed by unauthorised persons. Information
	is held on secure servers and is encrypted wherever this is possible. This is the same encryption used
	to transmit credit card details over the Internet when buying merchandise online. Our security procedures
	also provide that, in addition to any password, which you may require to gain access to the service,
	you may have to provide proof of identification before we will release personal information to you. Multiple
	incorrect attempts or invalidation, result in a lockout from the information. We undergo periodic reviews
	of our security policies and procedures to ensure that our systems are secure and protected.


	You
	should never divulge your identification numbers, username, or password to anyone else. You should also
	never write your password down or store it on your computer and you should make sure you change it regularly.


	Accessing
	and updating your information



	You may request a copy of the information, which we hold about you by writing to
	us at our nearest office. There may be a small charge for this service. We also try to ensure that all
	information, which we hold for you, is accurate. If you find any inaccuracies we will delete these or
	correct them promptly. Communication with you may be impeded if the information we hold is inadequate
	or inaccurate.


	This Statement only applies to this website and does not apply to any websites
	from which you may have linked to this website or to any website to which you may link from this website.

	Error While Printing Vote Submission
	Confirmation




	Signing
	on to PROXY DIRECT online proxy voting site




	You must sign on to PROXY DIRECT before continuing
	with your online proxy voting or notice session. In order to do so you need to enter your Control Number
	and Security Code located on the voting instruction card which you should have received together with
	other proxy or notice materials through regular mail. Below is a sample proxy card and a sample notice
	which displays a 14-digit Control Number and 8-digit Security Code. Your card might differ slightly:





	 





	Proxy Card




	Notice






Click to enlarge




Click to enlarge








	If
	your proxy or notice materials were delivered electronically the Control Number and Security Code should
	be located within your personal campaign information or online voting or notice instructions.


	A
	Control Number and Security Code are being supplied only for campaigns which utilize Internet proxy voting
	or notice.



	How do I provide my voting
	instructions online?




	Online voting is really simple and submitting your voting instructions takes only
	few minutes. Depending on the campaign setup, after login you might see a Legal page. This legal page
	has important information for you to review before continuing to vote. Once you have reviewed the information,
	click the button labeled "Click Here To Acknowledge".


	If you had a Legal page and clicked the
	"Click Here To Acknowledge" button or if you did not have a Legal page, you will be brought to the Voting
	page. The Voting page lists the items that you can vote on. To vote, simply select an option for each
	item. Some campaigns will ask if you will attend a special meeting they will be holding. You can choose
	to attend by checking off the box labeled "Yes, I plan to attend the meeting...". If you would like to
	receive an email containing confirmation of what you have voted, you can enter your email address in
	the box below the voting instructions.



	IMPORTANT
	NOTE

	: We do not validate your supplied e-mail address in any way so make sure that you have













	 





	entered it correctly. Also,
	e-Mail is not 100% reliable therefore we cannot guarantee that such confirmation will reach the specified
	destination.


	Once you are satisfied with the way you have voted, click the button labeled "Submit
	Vote". This will submit your vote to our tabulation system.


	After placing your vote you will
	be brought to the Vote Confirmation page. This page displays how you have voted for the campaign. At
	this point you can exit the website by either closing the browser window or clicking the button labeled
	"Vote Another Card or Exit". Clicking that button will bring you back to the Home page.



	My proxy campaign is participating in Notice
	& Access, how do I request paper copies of the shareholder meeting materials?




	Requesting paper copies
	of the shareholder meeting materials is simple. It takes only a few minutes. After login, you will be
	brought to the Setup page. Here you have several options, you can Request Materials for the current proxy
	campaign by mail or email and/or setup future proxy delivery preferences.



	Request Materials:

	Selecting this option will allow you to
	specify how you would like to receive the proxy materials. You can choose electronic delivery which allows
	you to enter in the email address you would like the materials sent to or you can choose regular mail
	and the materials will be sent by regular mail to the address we have on file for you.



	Set Future Preferences:

	Selecting
	this option will allow you to specify how you want to receive proxy material for future campaigns. You
	have the same options as in the Request Materials section: electronic delivery or regular mail.



	Page layout looks a bit
	(or completely) off




	The Internet Voting site has been built for and tested on Microsoft

	®

	Internet Explorer 6.0 and newer versions and everything should look and work properly when using this
	browser. If you are using any other browser you may experience layout distortions and/or improper operation.


	Layout
	may be incorrect or plain ugly if your system is using Large System fonts. Some users with very large
	monitors tend to utilize this setting while working in very high resolutions. This will cause images
	and text to disalign and therefore distort the design. The only solution to this problem is either to
	change your system font settings or, if the browser allows (i.e. Internet Explorer) lower the size of
	the font for the browser only - this is a very quick and recommended solution.



	I have already sent my paper voting instructions,
	what now?




	All of the instructions submitted via any supported means are processed in the order
	in which they were received. You can still provide your voting instructions on-line but be advised that
	if we have not yet received your mailed in ballot it will overwrite your online instructions once it
	is received. If you have previously submitted your vote via mail, telephone etc. you can check whether
	it has been received and processed by going into the Detailed Information section for any item. The top
	portion of that section will contain your current voting status and if a previous vote has been received,
	indicate when and how. Until you confirm that your previous vote has been processed we suggest you put
	off your online vote until later.


	Mailed votes are usually processed within 5 business days from
	the date of mailing. Telephone and Internet votes are usually processed within 12-24 hours.



	Can I change my previous voting instructions
	submitted online?




	You can re-submit your instructions online as many times as you wish before the
	actual meeting date. A newer vote will always overwrite the old one. The Detailed Information section
	contains an indicator when and how your previous vote, if any, has been received and processed.


	If
	your new (mailed, online, etc.) vote is the same as the vote already received it will be disregarded
	and the date and













	 





	source will stay unchanged.



	I am unable to sign on




	Your
	browser must be able to process JavaScript scripts in order to proceed with the online proxy voting.
	If any of these requirements is not satisfied, clicking on the Continue button next to the Control Number
	entry area will either produce no result or result in a Runtime or Script Error.


	Some corporations
	do not allow their users to process active content (scripts). In this case you would not be able to vote
	electronically from your office.


	If your browser either does not support JavaScript or has this
	feature turned off, you will not be able to sign on. You may also encounter several Script Errors.



	Error While Printing
	Vote Submission Confirmation




	Some shareholders have reported that after submitting their
	voting instructions the browser has returned an error "Page expired" after trying to print the confirmation
	page. This problem has been only apparent to Netscape Navigator/Communicator users. There is no fix for
	this error at this time. Please note that this "Error While Printing Vote Submission Confirmation" does
	not affect the vote you cast.

	YOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT NO MATTER
	HOW MANY SHARES YOU OWN



	Common Questions about Notice and Access



	Why am I receiving a Notice of Internet Availability instead of
	a Proxy Card and Proxy Statement?




	Your Fund(s) has elected to utilize a distribution model authorized
	by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2007. This model, known as Notice and
	Access, allows mutual funds and public companies to send you a Notice instead of a full set of printed
	proxy materials. As a shareholder, you can select the means by which you access those proxy materials.
	You can view the materials electronically via the Internet, or request a full set of printed materials
	for this Shareholder Meeting and all future shareholder meetings, or you can make that choice on a case
	by case basis.


	How do I access the materials, set my preference for future shareholder meeting materials
	and record my vote?


	On the front side of this Notice are easy to follow instructions on how to access
	proxy materials electronically or request a full set of printed materials. Once you are on the website
	or ordering on the phone, you can also make your selection for future meetings.


	When you are ready to vote,
	electronic voting is available by Internet or Touch Tone Phone by using the Control Number and Security
	Code on the front of this Notice. The Touch Tone voting phone number is different from the ordering phone
	number and is displayed on the website. If you want to vote via Mail, you will need to request a paper
	copy of the materials to receive a Proxy Card and Return Envelope.



	If I request printed proxy materials, how long will it take for
	me to receive them?




	The SEC rule requires that the materials be sent via first class
	mail within three business days of receipt of your request.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions.







The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.  If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.







The 30-day dividend yield represents the average daily dividends for the 30-day period, annualized and divided by the net asset values per share at the end of the period; it is available the first quarter after the fund's inception. The SEC standardized yield is computed under an SEC standardized formula and reflects an estimated yield to maturity (assuming all portfolio securities are held to maturity); it is available the first month after the fund's inception.

Sources: Moody's Investors Service; if Moody's does not rate a security, then Standard & Poor's (S&P) is used as a secondary source. When available, T. Rowe Price will use Fitch for securities that are not rated by Moodys or S&P. T. Rowe Price does not evaluate these ratings, but simply assigns them to the appropriate credit quality category as determined by the rating agency.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions.







The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.  If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.







The 30-day dividend yield represents the average daily dividends for the 30-day period, annualized and divided by the net asset values per share at the end of the period; it is available the first quarter after the fund's inception. The SEC standardized yield is computed under an SEC standardized formula and reflects an estimated yield to maturity (assuming all portfolio securities are held to maturity); it is available the first month after the fund's inception.

Sources: Moody's Investors Service; if Moody's does not rate a security, then Standard & Poor's (S&P) is used as a secondary source. When available, T. Rowe Price will use Fitch for securities that are not rated by Moodys or S&P. T. Rowe Price does not evaluate these ratings, but simply assigns them to the appropriate credit quality category as determined by the rating agency.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions.







The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.  If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.







The 30-day dividend yield represents the average daily dividends for the 30-day period, annualized and divided by the net asset values per share at the end of the period; it is available the first quarter after the fund's inception. The SEC standardized yield is computed under an SEC standardized formula and reflects an estimated yield to maturity (assuming all portfolio securities are held to maturity); it is available the first month after the fund's inception.

Sources: Moody's Investors Service; if Moody's does not rate a security, then Standard & Poor's (S&P) is used as a secondary source. When available, T. Rowe Price will use Fitch for securities that are not rated by Moodys or S&P. T. Rowe Price does not evaluate these ratings, but simply assigns them to the appropriate credit quality category as determined by the rating agency.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions.







The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.  If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.







The 30-day dividend yield represents the average daily dividends for the 30-day period, annualized and divided by the net asset values per share at the end of the period; it is available the first quarter after the fund's inception. The SEC standardized yield is computed under an SEC standardized formula and reflects an estimated yield to maturity (assuming all portfolio securities are held to maturity); it is available the first month after the fund's inception.

Sources: Moody's Investors Service; if Moody's does not rate a security, then Standard & Poor's (S&P) is used as a secondary source. When available, T. Rowe Price will use Fitch for securities that are not rated by Moodys or S&P. T. Rowe Price does not evaluate these ratings, but simply assigns them to the appropriate credit quality category as determined by the rating agency.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions.







The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.  If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.







The 30-day dividend yield represents the average daily dividends for the 30-day period, annualized and divided by the net asset values per share at the end of the period; it is available the first quarter after the fund's inception. The SEC standardized yield is computed under an SEC standardized formula and reflects an estimated yield to maturity (assuming all portfolio securities are held to maturity); it is available the first month after the fund's inception.

Sources: Moody's Investors Service; if Moody's does not rate a security, then Standard & Poor's (S&P) is used as a secondary source. When available, T. Rowe Price will use Fitch for securities that are not rated by Moodys or S&P. T. Rowe Price does not evaluate these ratings, but simply assigns them to the appropriate credit quality category as determined by the rating agency.

T. Rowe Price mutual funds are subject to ongoing management fees and may be subject to redemption fees. An IRA may be subject to an annual fee, and a fee may be assessed when an IRA is closed. See prospectus for details.

The mutual funds referred to in this website are offered and sold only to persons residing in the United States and are offered by prospectus only. The prospectuses include investment objectives, risks, fees, expenses, and other information that you should read and consider carefully before investing.
Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 6/30/17, 72 of 108 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance.

The principal value of the Retirement Funds is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The funds’ allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term postretirement withdrawal horizon. The funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The funds maintain a substantial allocation to equities both prior to and after the target date, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.

T. Rowe Price mutual funds are subject to ongoing management fees and may be subject to redemption fees. An IRA may be subject to an annual fee, and a fee may be assessed when an IRA is closed. See prospectus for details.

The mutual funds referred to in this website are offered and sold only to persons residing in the United States and are offered by prospectus only. The prospectuses include investment objectives, risks, fees, expenses, and other information that you should read and consider carefully before investing.
Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 6/30/17, 72 of 108 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

T. Rowe Price mutual funds are subject to ongoing management fees and may be subject to redemption fees. An IRA may be subject to an annual fee, and a fee may be assessed when an IRA is closed. See prospectus for details. 
Past performance cannot guarantee future results. All mutual funds are subject to market risk, including possible loss of principal. Diversification cannot assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market.
Based on cumulative total return, 174 of 232 (75%), 142 of 160 (89%), 115 of 127 (91%), and 105 of 114 (92%) T. Rowe Price stock funds (including all share classes and excluding funds used in insurance products) outperformed their Lipper averages for the 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)

1Source: Lipper Inc. 162 of 213 funds (excluding institutional and bank institutional funds as defined by Lipper) more than 6 months old had expense ratios below their Lipper averages based on fiscal year-end data available as of 6/30/17.
*The principal value of the Retirement Funds and Target Funds (collectively, the "target date funds") is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The target date funds' allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The Retirement Funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term retirement withdrawal horizon. The Target Funds emphasize asset accumulation prior to retirement, balance the need for reduced market risk and income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a moderate postretirement withdrawal horizon. The target date funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The key difference between the Retirement Funds and the Target Funds is the overall allocation to equity; although they each maintain significant allocations to equities both prior to and after the target date, the Retirement Funds maintain a higher equity allocation, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.

			Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, yield, and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. 
For up-to-date standardized total returns, please click here.

 
			The performance information shown does not reflect the deduction of redemption fees, if it did, the performance would be lower.
		

^ The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's 
prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. 
The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.
If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net
expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.
		
 
			*Morningstar Ratings are based on risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. 
		

			Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions. 
For funds less than one year old, the Since Inception return figure is not annualized and represents an aggregate total return.
		

1 The yield quotation more closely reflects the current earnings of the money market fund than the total return.
		

2 The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, 
variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at 
least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for 
comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation 
in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent 
performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 
35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating 
for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, 
and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of 
total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% 
five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating 
formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest 
impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

		

3 The T. Rowe Price Funds-I Class share the portfolio of an existing 
fund (the original share class of the fund is referred to as the "investor class"). 
The total return figures for I Class shares have been calculated using the performance 
data of the investor class up to the inception date of the I Class (shown above) 
and the actual performance results of the I Class since that date.  Because the 
I Classes are expected to have lower expenses than the Investor Classes, the I 
Class performance, had it existed over the periods shown, would have been higher.  

				The since inception performance returns are calculated from the investor class inception date indicated above.
				 
			

			    Morningstar rated the Tax-Free Income Fund among 
142,
142,
132
and 
106
Muni National Long 

funds for the overall rating and the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods (as applicable)
ending 06/30/2017, respectively. 

The Tax-Free Income Fund received 
3,
3 
and
4
stars for the 3, 5, and 10 year periods (as applicable) respectively.

Morningstar Ratings1


as of 06/30/2017



Overall





3 Year





5 Year





10 Year







				Morningstar rated the Tax-Free Income Fund among 
142,
142,
132
and 
106
Muni National Long
funds for the overall rating and the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods (as applicable) 
ending 06/30/2017, respectively.


The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance 
figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The 
weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year 
rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating 
for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most 
weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is 
included in all three rating periods.
			

Performance Comparison
as of 
					
						06/30/2017
					
				







							This chart shows the value of a hypothetical $10,000 investment in the fund over the past 10 years or since its inception (for funds lacking 10-year records). The result is compared with benchmarks, which may include a broad-based market index and a peer group average or index. Market indexes do not include expenses, which are deducted from fund returns as well as mutual fund averages and indexes.
						
Benchmark Definitions



1 The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, 
variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at 
least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for 
comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation 
in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent 
performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 
35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating 
for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, 
and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of 
total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% 
five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating 
formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest 
impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

Share price, principal value, yield and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.   
			



2 The 30-day dividend yield represents the average daily dividends for the 
30-day period, annualized and divided by the net asset values per share 
at the end of the period; it is available the first quarter after the 
fund's inception.  The SEC standardized yield is computed under an SEC 
standardized formula and reflects an estimated yield to maturity 
(assuming all portfolio securities are held to maturity); it is 
available the first month after the fund's inception.  
			

3
					
					Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions. 
For funds less than one year old, the Since Inception return figure is not annualized and represents an aggregate total return.
				

^ The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's 
prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. 
The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.
If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net
expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.

T. Rowe Price mutual funds are subject to ongoing management fees and may be subject to redemption fees. An IRA may be subject to an annual fee, and a fee may be assessed when an IRA is closed. See prospectus for details. 
Past performance cannot guarantee future results. All mutual funds are subject to market risk, including possible loss of principal. Diversification cannot assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market.
Based on cumulative total return, 174 of 232 (75%), 142 of 160 (89%), 115 of 127 (91%), and 105 of 114 (92%) T. Rowe Price stock funds (including all share classes and excluding funds used in insurance products) outperformed their Lipper averages for the 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)

1Source: Lipper Inc. 162 of 213 funds (excluding institutional and bank institutional funds as defined by Lipper) more than 6 months old had expense ratios below their Lipper averages based on fiscal year-end data available as of 6/30/17.
*The principal value of the Retirement Funds and Target Funds (collectively, the "target date funds") is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The target date funds' allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The Retirement Funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term retirement withdrawal horizon. The Target Funds emphasize asset accumulation prior to retirement, balance the need for reduced market risk and income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a moderate postretirement withdrawal horizon. The target date funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The key difference between the Retirement Funds and the Target Funds is the overall allocation to equity; although they each maintain significant allocations to equities both prior to and after the target date, the Retirement Funds maintain a higher equity allocation, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.
Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 6/30/17, 72 of 108 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
