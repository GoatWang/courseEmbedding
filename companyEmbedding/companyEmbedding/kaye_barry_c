Barry C Kaye's Experience
Title: Cfo
               Company: Coates International Ltd
Job Details
               Coates has completed development of its patented spherical rotary valve CSRV Industrial Internal Combustion Engine, developed over a period of more than 6 years and other CSRV applications over 10 years. The underlying CSRV technology was invented by George J. Coates and his son Gregory. The CSRV system is adaptable to combustion engines of many types. This technology is currently adapted to a number of practical applications including industrial generators powered by engines incorporating the CSRV technology and designed to run on flare-off gas from oil wells, landfill gas and raw natural gas. The Company is actively engaged in planning for production and rollout of these engines, and expects to have completed engines ready for pickup by Well to Wire, Energy, Inc. before the end of the year. The Company has recently completed the technological development of a diesel truck engine, which incorporates our CSRV system suitable for the trucking industry. We continue to make considerable progress with other important aspects of now retrofitting the diesel truck engine, including integration with the transmission and braking systems. After that, the engine will be fired up and tested with and without loads. The diesel truck engine is expected to achieve improved fuel efficiency and reduce harmful emissions.

TESTIMONIALS


“Over the past nine years, I’ve tried just about every protocol offered to relieve the symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia. NeuroIntegration Therapy has been by far the most effective. Not only did it reduce my pain by 95%, but it restored my sunny disposition so that I could actually enjoy life once again. For the first time in nine years, I was being pulled out of the darkness and into wellness.”
Lorna Riley, CSP

“NeuroIntegration training has been a powerful tool for helping my patients transform their lives. It has been exciting to watch symptoms of anxiety, Depression, fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue disappear. This program offers a holistic approach and is cost effective. Decades of research show results are often permanent, offering healthy productive futures to my patients.”
Dr. Mikell Parsons DC

 Educational Background



Bachelor of Science in Accounting Degree, cum laude 


City University of New York - Brooklyn College

                  Brooklyn College is a senior college of the City University of New York, located in Brooklyn, New York, United States.

Established in 1930 by the New York City Board of Higher Education, the College had its beginnings as the Downtown Brooklyn branches of Hunter College (then a women's college) and the City College of New York (then a men's college). With the merger of these branches, Brooklyn College became the first public coeducational liberal arts college in New York City. The 26-acre (110,000 m2) campus is known for its great beauty, and is often regarded as "the poor man's Harvard" because of its low tuition and reputation for academic excellence (former President, Robert Hess, responded to the moniker by saying "I like to think of Harvard as the rich man's Brooklyn College").

What Is Brain Mapping?
The brain is a highly complex organ made up of billions of cells called neurons. Neurons send and receive messages to and from all parts of your body. These messages are electrical impulses that create brain waves. The brain map (also called a neuro map) is an important tool we use to evaluate your brainwaves and identify opportunities to improve communication between various regions of the brain. The brain map is able to capture a window of brain activity, analyze the data, and create a visual representation for each lobe of the brain and each specific brain wave (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta).
How Does Brain Mapping Work?
Using a cap placed on the scalp, our software captures the electrical impulses in the brain. This method is known as an electroencephalogram (EEG). The results show brain wave patterns in different parts of the brain. The process takes about 15 minutes, and the data is then converted into a visual brain map report. We analyze the brain map report and identify any problem areas. The report will display the results in a clear and concise format that can be easily understood.
The Brain Map Report
Here is an example of 2 pages from the the brain map report:

Page 1 shows an analysis of each lobe of the brain (frontal, parietal, central, temporal and occipital) for each type of brain wave: Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta. Green indicates a normal level, red is elevated and yellow is extreme.
Page 2 gives the results in an easy to read format, and indicates the presence of a particular symptom. The Discriminants Analysis below shows the emotional levels of your brain, as well as it’s ability to handle tasks and learning comprehension.

The Emotional and Cognitive Analysis compares the results of your self-assessment against the results of the brain map and helps identify problem areas within the brain. Red indicates a strong potential match, green indicates no match.

Based on the results of your brain map, the report will generate suggested protocols for training your brain back into normal ranges, as well as suggested supplements.


The brain map is a revolutionary new tool in accurately identifying the problem areas of the brain. It takes the guesswork out of the assessment process and provides an accurate road map for improving your health and well being.

WHAT IS NEUROFEEDBACK?
Neurofeedback (also called Neuro Therapy) is a non-invasive process where brain waves are monitored in real time by a computer, which can then use that information to produce changes in brainwave activity. The process of adjusting brainwave activity is known as operant conditioning, which is a method where rewards for positive behavior increase learning capabilities.
The Neurofeedback Process
The computer monitors your brainwaves while you watch a movie or listen to music. When deviations from normal brainwave activity occur, the computer triggers an audio or visual cue that alerts the patient that they are outside normal ranges. These cues are received by the brain, which subconsciously adjusts itself back to a normal pattern to make the cue stop. With enough repetition of this process, the brain eventually learns to stay in the normal ranges on its own without the computer. With the brain functioning normally on its own, symptoms of irregular brain activity will decline.
It has been well documented that people who suffer neurological problems have abnormal brain waves in certain areas of the brain. For instance, case studies using QEEG “brain maps” have shown that people with Attention-Deficit-Disorder (ADD) have elevated delta brainwaves, while those who suffer from depression have elevated alpha brainwaves. Those with anxiety will have elevated Beta brainwaves, while those suffering from memory loss usually have decreased theta brainwaves.
Training the brain using neurofeedback can change these brainwaves over time, adjusting them into normal, healthy ranges. It can improve alertness, attention, emotional regulation, behavior, cognitive function, and mental flexibility. When the brain moves back into normal ranges, users will often see a reduction in symptoms.
The best part of neurofeedback is that results are often permanent, allowing a person to reduce or even eliminate medications altogether. Where medications only manage the symptoms, the goal of neurofeedback is to address the underlying cause and restore normal brainwave functions.

HOW DOES NEUROFEEDBACK WORK?
Neurofeedback utilizes a non-invasive technique for monitoring brain activity. Small electrodes are attached to specific areas of the head using paste. Our Neurointegration software records the brain waves and displays the data in real time. During this time the patient is watching a movie or listening to music. The software compares the incoming brainwaves to that of an optimal brainwave in the target range. If the brainwaves deviate from normal ranges, it triggers the audio or video to fade. The brain automatically detects this and refocuses itself back into the proper range. This process is repeated hundreds of times per session. Sessions usually last 30 minutes.
The Brain Is A Learning Machine
Through operant conditioning, the brain is rewarded when the audio or video returns to normal. Eventually the brain learns to stay in the healthy ranges without the reward stimulus, and is able to sustain normal activity independent of the computer. This is achieved by reconnecting functional pathways in the brain.
Neurofeedback does not target any particular disorder. Its purpose is to change timing and activation patterns in the brain. This improves brain regulation, which can impact a variety of symptoms. Different symptoms will require triggering different areas of the brain. The software is designed to target specific areas of the brain according to a patient’s symptoms.
How Many Sessions Are Needed?
There is no magic number. Just as every person is unique, the number of sessions will vary according to each person. Noticeable results typically occur between the first and tenth session. In general 20 – 40 sessions are needed for the results to become permanent. Symptoms in some patients will resolve in a shorter time. Some require more training, some less. The goal is to complete enough sessions to ensure consistent and lasting benefits. A brain map can be generated at any time between sessions, so that you can visually see the progress your brain is making.
