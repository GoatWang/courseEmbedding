Advanced Search

                There are 3 types of search. Please only use one option at a time.
                
1) Build a boolean search string.
Ensure that document matches include...

...all of these word(s):



...and optionally include these word(s):



...but do not have these word(s):




2) Search for a phrase:

Enter your phrase:




3) Search on part of a word:

Enter the first few characters of a word:




Submit



Information on how to use Search

                    There are 2 types of basic queries: Terms and Phrases.
                    A Term is a single word search.
                    A Phrase would wrap a string of words in quotes and find matches on the extact string.
                

Boolean Operators
You can combine basic queries with Boolean operators to form a more complex query. Boolean operators define the relationships between Terms or Phrases. Our search supports the following Boolean operators: AND, "+", OR, NOT and "-". Please note that Boolean operators must be all uppercase.
                

AND
example search: default AND document
                    This is the default operator. It will be used if there is no Boolean operator between two terms. For example:
                    default document is the same as default AND document. In this case both terms need to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.The + character is synonymous with using AND.
                

OR
example search: default OR document
                    In this case just one of the terms needs to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.
                

NOT
example search: default NOT "document type"
                    The NOT operator excludes documents that contain the term (or phrase) after NOT. So a listing match would have to include the word default but not the phrase "document type". The - character is synonymous with using NOT.
                

Wildcard/Prefix queries
You can perform "wildcard" or "prefix" queries using the '*' operator. Whereas all of the previous search found exact matches on the whole term or phrase, a wildcard search will find partial matches.
                    example search: ehr*
                    This query will match all documents containing words beginning with the prefix 'ehr' like the word Ehrlichia.

Management is flexible on pay, schedule, and remote work provided deadlines are met. However, management doesn't set unrealistic deadlines, and if they do, they understand when presented with a good schedule and project timeline.It's amazing the difference it can make when management actually listens, even if ultimately they can't do everything you want. Been VERY happy this last year at Awarepoint. Low performers have departed, and exciting new talent has come onboard. A solid Cloud Architect was hired and a DevOps team has begun the automation of what historically has been tedious work. There have also been a number of internal promotions showing that hardwork and dedication pays off.ConsLike all IT, emergencies tend to happen at unexpected hours. Old product is a bit... old... but management team has hired/dedicated a team to keep it stable while Awarepoint focuses on the new flagship product called AwareHealth. Also, being a small company, when one person is performing low or leaves, everyone feels it.Advice to ManagementContinue to focus on the new product, bringing onboard new talent to fill positions for low performers, and make sure current talent remains heard and respected.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Awarepoint Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Awarepoint 2016-09-02 16:44 PDT May 28, 2015 Helpful (2)"Purchasing Manager"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Purchasing in San Diego, CAFormer Employee - Purchasing in San Diego, CARecommendsPositive OutlookNo opinion of CEOI worked at Awarepoint full-time (More than a year)ProsExcellent benefits, pay and people.ConsTurnover was high my last year there, however they have an excellent product and a great team of people that I am certain they will continue to grow to be a successful profitable company.Advice to ManagementExcellent New CEO ManagementShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (2) Awarepoint Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Awarepoint 2015-05-28 15:16 PDT Jan 28, 2015 Helpful (3)"Could be finally heading in a positive direction"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeProsSome fun people to work with. New CEO (was CFO) seems to listen and care about employee feedback. Having a new CEO and the changes in other leaders is a big step in right direction.. Big changes in executive team over last 3 months are a huge step in right direction.ConsNew CEO seems to listen most closely to a small group that dont have industry or much professional experience. Understaffed. A number of disgruntled or underachievers still with company.Advice to ManagementListen most closely to experienced and use the energy from less experienced to set direction.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (3) Awarepoint Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Awarepoint 2015-01-28 16:06 PST Dec 11, 2014"Going downhill without much hope."StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous in San Diego, CACurrent Employee - Anonymous in San Diego, CADoesn't RecommendNegative OutlookDisapproves of CEOProsCompensation slightly better than average, although it has to be to retain people in a discouraging environment.Good health benefits.ConsOur market and customer base were declining when we were adequately staffed. Numerous layoffs and an exodus of disgruntled employees have left us without the capacity to execute.Advice to ManagementIt's too late for much advice. The CEO, CTO and EVP of sales and marketing have left with the last four months. i wish they had done so before mismanaging the company to the brink of extinction.Previous comments about clique mentality are true. There are employees that would love more opportunity to contribute. The remaining management just needs to open their eyes and ears and tap the resources that are right in front of them.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Awarepoint Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Awarepoint 2014-12-11 12:38 PST Sep 6, 2014"Good but not Great"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Anonymous EmployeeFormer Employee - Anonymous EmployeeDoesn't RecommendNeutral OutlookApproves of CEOI worked at Awarepoint full-time (More than 3 years)ProsHas been said before but to reiterate; co-workers, benefits and comp. Location in San Diego is great, not sure about Charlotte. When I was leaving the CEO took me to lunch, wanted to know all the issues I had, and did his best other than firing my incompetent manager soon enough to try to keep me.ConsLeft over management from days of old are just about gone but the short cuts in development and client installations remain and are still killing the company. The CTO never ran or built anything before, he was a technology lab guy.Advice to ManagementContinue to fix the crappy old technology, focus on the software, and upgrade the technology to a better performing platform.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Awarepoint Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Awarepoint 2014-09-06 21:00 PDT Showing 24 of 24 reviewsReset FiltersPrevious123NextReviews > Awarepoint RSS Feed</>EmbedCloseOutline of two peoples' headsWork in HR or Marketing?Grow your employer brandGet a free employer accountCloseOutline of two peoples' headsWork in HR or Marketing?Grow your employer brandGet a free employer accountCompanies to Explore Company BenefitsDoctor's valiseThere are currently no benefit reviews for this company.Add Benefits Review Job Seekers Also ViewedGoPro ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 211 ReviewsSierra Wireless ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 69 ReviewsIntelligent InSites ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 13 ReviewsFireEye ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 404 ReviewsSmartRecruiters ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 62 ReviewsNetApp ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 2,596 ReviewsSAIC ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 1,851 Reviews Related Job SearchEngineer jobsEngineer salaries ($76k)Software Engineer jobsSoftware Engineer salaries ($84k)Senior Software Engineer jobsSenior Software Engineer salaries ($110k)Sales Representative jobsSales Representative salaries ($39k)Account Manager jobsAccount Manager salaries ($52k)Inside Sales Representative jobsInside Sales Representative salaries ($37k)Intern jobsIntern salaries ($33k)Software Developer jobsSoftware Developer salaries ($79k)Account Executive jobsAccount Executive salaries ($47k)Business Analyst jobsBusiness Analyst salaries ($66k)Director jobsDirector salaries ($137k)Technical Support Engineer jobsTechnical Support Engineer salaries ($70k)Interested in a New Job?Upload a resume to mobile apply.
