 BTHC X Inc. (OTCBB:BTXI) Files An 8-K Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement

ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT


On December 31, 2016, BTHC X, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
Company) entered into a contribution agreement (the Contribution
Agreement) by and among the Company, iOra Software Limited, a
company formed under the laws of England and Wales (iOra),
Stocksfield Limited (Stocksfield), a company formed under the
laws of England and Wales, Lexalytics, Inc., a Massachusetts
corporation (Lexalytics) (Stocksfield and Lexalytics are
collectively referred to as the Contributors), Mark Thompson in
his capacity as representative for the Contributors (the
Contributor Representative), Ramada Holdings, Inc., a company
formed under the Laws of the Marshall Islands (Ramada), and
George Syllantavos, in his capacity as representative for the
Company (the Company Representative) and individually. The
transactions contemplated by the Contribution Agreement are
expected to close in the coming weeks


to the Contribution Agreement, the Contributors will contribute
$75,000 and all of the outstanding equity securities in iOra to
the Company in exchange for 6,323,530 shares of the Companys
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (for which the Company will
file a Certificate of Designation prior to the closing), which
will be convertible into approximately 260 million shares of the
Companys common stock once the Companys certificate of
incorporation is amended to increase its authorized shares. In
addition, the Company will issue 2,966,531 shares of the Companys
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the Earnout Shares), which
will be convertible into approximately 122 million shares of the
Companys common stock once the Companys certificate of
incorporation is amended to increase its authorized shares, in
the name of a trustee to a voting trust agreement. If certain
earn-out targets specified in the Contribution Agreement are met,
the Earnout Shares will be issued to the Contributors. If the
earn-out targets are not met, the Earnout Shares will be issued
to the stockholders of the Company. The Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock will have the right to vote with the Companys
common stock on an as-converted basis. While the Earn-Out Shares
are held by the trustee, the Contributor Representative has all
voting rights related to those shares.


Upon the closing, the Company will issue 709,939 shares of its

Contribution Agreement which were made by the parties to each
other as of specific dates. The assertions embodied in these
representations and warranties were made solely for purposes of
the Contribution Agreement and may be subject to important
qualifications and limitations agreed to by the parties in
connection with negotiating their terms. Moreover, certain
representations and warranties may not be accurate or complete as
of any specified date because they are subject to a contractual
standard of materiality that is different from certain standards
generally applicable to shareholders or were used for the purpose
of allocating risk between the parties rather than establishing
matters as facts. Based on the foregoing reasons, investors
should not rely on the representations and warranties as
statements of factual information.
