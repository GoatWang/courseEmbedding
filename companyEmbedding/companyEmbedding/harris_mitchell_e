Mitchell Harris is Chief Executive Officer of Investment Management for BNY Mellon, which includes the company’s asset management and wealth management businesses. He is also a member of the company’s Executive Committee, the senior-most governing body of the corporation, and is the Executive Committee sponsor for Prism, a BNY Mellon Employee Resource Group that fosters an open and supportive environment for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees and their allies. Prism is one of six ERGs that reflect BNY Mellon's commitment to diversity and workplace excellence by supporting employees with shared interests.
Mitchell was appointed CEO of Investment Management in February, 2016, having previously served as President. He also acted as interim head of BNY Mellon Asset Management from May through October 2010.
Mitchell was Chief Executive Officer of Standish from 2004 to 2009 and has been Chairman from 2004. He joined from Pareto Partners, where he served as Chief Executive Officer from 2000 to 2004 and as Chairman from 2001.
Before joining BNY Mellon, Mitchell was with London-based Pareto Partners. He joined that firm in 1993 as Managing Partner, later becoming a fixed income and currency overlay manager. Previous to that, Mitchell managed Citibank’s Private Bank business in Frankfurt, Germany. His other responsibilities during his 14-year tenure at Citibank included managing the offshore banking, investment trust and treasury business for Citibank’s European Private Bank in the Channel Islands, and managing the European Mutual Fund distribution and European Marketing for the London Private Bank of Citibank. Mitchell began his career as a strategic planner for the City of New York.
BNY Mellon Asset Management is a leading global asset manager and in the top 10 in the U.S., with $1.7 trillion in assets under management. It is the umbrella organization for BNY Mellon's affiliated investment management firms and global distribution companies. Each investment management firm has its own proprietary investment processes, and focused investment approaches for specific markets and/or asset classes. Collectively, BNY Mellon Asset Management's boutiques represent a great breadth and depth of expertise in virtually every major asset class and sector.
BNY Mellon Wealth Management is a leading wealth manager. In 2016 it was named by Family Wealth Report as the top U.S. Private Bank and rated the Top Private Bank for Family Offices by Professional Wealth Management magazine. Barron’s ranked it the 8th largest U.S. wealth manager in 2016. The firm has more than two centuries of experience in providing services to clients who today include financially successful individuals and families, their family offices and business enterprises, planned giving programs, and endowments and foundations. It has nearly $202 billion in total private client assets, as of September, 30, 2016, and an extensive network of offices in the U.S. and internationally. BNY Mellon Wealth Management, which provides investment management, custody, wealth and estate planning and private banking services, conducts business through various operating subsidiaries of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation.
