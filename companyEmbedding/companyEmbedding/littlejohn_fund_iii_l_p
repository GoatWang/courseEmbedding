Littlejohn & Co. Announces Final Close of $650 million Fund III
May 4, 2005

GREENWICH, CT, May 4, 2005 --
Littlejohn & Co., a private investment firm that applies an
operational approach to building middle market companies, today
announced that it has completed the final closing of Littlejohn
Fund III, L.P. with capital commitments of $650 million. The firm
was targeting $600 million in limited partner commitments, but
placed a hard cap of $650 million on Fund III after finding itself
significantly oversubscribed.
Littlejohn Fund III is the firm's
largest fund to date, and together with two other funds raised
since inception in 1996, aggregates a total of approximately $1.4
billion of capital under management. Littlejohn will continue to
implement its operationally oriented investment approach as with
its two predecessor funds and target companies that are
underperforming their potential due to the lack of management
resources, capital or experiencing market changes.
"We are extremely pleased with the
overwhelming success of our fundraising effort to have exceeded our
expectations," said Angus Littlejohn, Chairman and CEO of
Littlejohn & Co. "We are gratified by the market's response and
to have completed a very quick fund raising process largely based
on the strength of our existing associations. Our Fund has the
representation of investors from around the world who see value in
our ability to develop businesses through operational enhancements
and our team remains focused on the opportunities where we can add
value."
Investors in existing and past
Littlejohn funds have included some of the leading public and
corporate pension funds, endowments, and domestic and foreign
insurance companies and fund of funds. The firm's marketing of Fund
III was limited to existing Fund II investors as well as investors
with which it had longstanding communications. Littlejohn did not
use a placement agent in the marketing of Fund III. Littlejohn
closed on its inaugural fund, the Littlejohn Direct Investment
Program, in 1997 with $205 million in commitments. The second,
Littlejohn Fund II, LP was closed in 2000 with committed capital of
$530 million from limited partners.
"We made tremendous progress last
year in enhancing the operations of our portfolio investments,"
said Michael Klein, President of Littlejohn. "We have been
successful at building stand alone companies from corporate spin
offs and believe that there are additional investment opportunities
for us as restructuring continues both in the U.S. and Europe."
In addition to Angus Littlejohn and
Michael Klein, the Littlejohn team includes two other partners;
Edmund Feeley and Brian Ramsay, as well as eight additional
investment professionals. Among the firm's more recent investments
is the acquisition of the Aeronautics business of General dynamics
by Littlejohn's portfolio company Wyle Laboratories.
About Littlejohn & Co LLC
Founded in 1996, Littlejohn &
Co., LLC is a private equity firm that makes control equity
investments in mid-sized companies that can benefit from its
operational and strategic approach. The firm is based in Greenwich,
Connecticut. Littlejohn can be reached at 203-552-3500.

Littlejohn Completes CTI Foods Purchase


April 6, 2010
By PEHub Administrator






Littlejohn & Co. has completed its acquisition of CTI Foods Inc. from CIC Partners. No financial terms were disclosed.
CIC Partners formed CTI Foods in 2003, via the acqusition and merger of SSI Food Services and S&S Foods LLC from J.R. Simplot Company. The Wilder, Idaho-based company already had a processing facility in California, and later would add a couple in Texas, in order to provide frozen, fresh and precooked food products to restaurant chains like Wendy’s and Taco Bell.
PRESS RELEASE

“The quality of our food products and keen understanding of product development, along with a successful culture within our team of employees, makes CTI a key partner in delivering high customer satisfaction to leading national food chains,” said CTI Foods CEO Kirk Smith. “This is an ideal alliance between our experienced management composed of foodservice industry veterans and a highly successful investment team who have prior success investing in our industry.  Littlejohn will bring additional resources to the table enabling us to continue in helping drive the business of our very valued customers.”
Littlejohn Managing Director Steven Raich, said, “CTI has a track record of strong performance.  We are extremely pleased to be participating in the recapitalization of the company and supporting its first class management team and employees.  We will work with this creative team to enhance their customer relationships by broadening CTI’s product capabilities and geographic reach.”
