A Maryland hotel trust paid $127 million for The Nines hotel in downtown Portland, it announced Thursday, several months after the Portland Development Commission took a buyout on the loans it made toward the hotel's development.
Pebblebrook Hotel Trust said it had acquired the 331-room hotel from Sage Hospitality, which will stay on as operator. It will continue to operate on the Starwood's Luxury Collection brand.
The acquisition is no surprise; the trust earlier applied for a liquor license to take over the hotel's restaurants.
The trust said it would put $6 to $8 million into a refresh of the hotel that will begin this year.
And an acquisition was said to be in the offing in March when the PDC accepted an offer to buy out its $18.2 million in loans for $11.5 million — writing down $6.7 million of the loans' face value, but getting a premium over selling the debt on the open market, according to an appraisal. 
The Nines opened in 2008 after a $133 million renovation of the former Meier & Frank Building backed in part by the PDC. The PDC board voted to make the loans cash-flow dependent in the economic downturn, and the hotel never started making regular payments.
While considering the buyout, PDC officials said the agency was unlikely to realize the full face value of the loans, based on an a December 2012 appraisal that valued the hotel at $100 million. The hotel owed $98.3 in debt senior to the PDC loans.
With the $127 million price tag announced Thursday, it appears the PDC might have been in a position to recover more of the loan's face value than it recognized.
"It's easy to judge now knowing all this additional information," PDC spokesman Shawn Uhlman said Thursday. "We didn't have all this information in March. I think it absolutely was the right decision ... to get the funds we were able to get."
Sage, the equity partner in the project, also didn't receive the full amount it put into the project, Uhlman said, though it retains the management contract for the hotel.
Uhlman added the $11.5 million from the deal would be sent to the PDC shortly now that the transaction is final. The money will be reinvested in the River District urban renewal area.
That the purchase price had risen dramatically from the earlier appraisal speaks to improvements in the Portland hotel market, said Tracy Marks, the general manager of the downtown Hilton Portland & Executive Tower.
"Demand continues to improve in the market and rates are improving, and values of assets are improving because of that," Marks said.
The Nines' sale price comes out to nearly $384,000 a room. Some other recent downtown hotel sales:

The 782-room Hilton sold in November 2012 for $101.5 million, or about $130,000 a room.
Pebblebrook bought the 174-room Hotel Modera in 2013 for $47.5 million, or $273,000 a room.
In May, the 256-room Courtyard Marriott Portland City Center was sold for $64.9 million, or $254,000 a room.

A number of hotels have are also proposed or recently completed in the downtown area, including the recently opened Residence Inn by Marriott in the Pearl District, a proposed RiverPlace Hyatt House hotel and a proposed (as yet unnamed) downtown luxury Hilton hotel.
On the east side, the Red Lion Hotel near the Oregon Convention Center will close in September and reopen next year as a luxury boutique hotel.
And the Metro regional government has agreed to subsidize a $212 million 600-room Hyatt Regency through $60 million in revenue bonds, along with $18 million in state and local loans and grants.

“DO NOT TRUST THIS HOTEL”


Reviewed July 11, 2014




After booking a room for a four day weekend in Portland, I arrived and they had canceled my reservation. Trying to say that I canceled the reservation (which I definitely did not) they were extremely rude. Probably for the best as the lobby had a stench and was certainly not clean. Never ever.

“Only stay if you have to...previous reviews are right”


Reviewed June 22, 2014




The staff is rude here. They are just unhappy people. The Indian male in his 30's who is at the front desk most of the time better be glad his parents or grandparents own the place (I"m just assuming this) because he would have a hard time keeping a job at starbucks or anywhere there are customers. The location is really good. About a block away is an econolodge that I didn't stay but walked by and said to myself, 'I'd stay here at this econolodge when I come back'. I don't even know the prices of the econolodge but it's probably similar. Back to the Downtown Value Inn, the rooms on the 3rd floor are renovated and the corner room I stayed was actually nice. There are other rooms on the 2nd floor and one (room 29) in the basement that is deplorable. So beware when booking here and the safe thing to do is just find a place nearby so you can avoid the harsh personalities behind the desk of this hotel.


Room Tip: Get a room on the 3rd floor or stay somewhere else. Take a deep breath when dealing with the hotel...

“Does exactly what you ask!”


Reviewed May 26, 2014




This is the second time I have stayed here and it is exactly what I expected-It allowed me somewhere to sleep and take breaks in between exploring Portland. The negative reviews are pretty absurd. It's an incredibly cheap hotel. If you go in expecting anything more than a solid bed and a base camp for your vacation, you're sorely mistaken and should not have stayed here!I am 23 and went to Portland for a fun weekend with friends and this hotel was perfect for it!

“The only thing this place has going for it is the location.”


Reviewed February 18, 2014




I just stayed here for a night because I was visiting a friend the next day, so I was looking for a place to get a few hours of sleep and a shower before she got in from the airport (I wasn't even there 8 hours). I have traveled a lot, and am usually not too picky about where I stay. The biggest concern I had was if the location was okay, because I had never been to Portland before. The location was great! Everything around the hotel looks brand new, so as I was walking there I thought it wouldn't be so bad. When I got to the outside it was definitely older and more run down than the rest of the area. When I first got there no one was at the desk. I literally sat there for 20 minutes until finally someone came. They got all my info and then said I needed $5 cash to get a room key (luckily I had time to get caah before leaving Seattle). I got the key and went to my room. It was old, everything pretty run down, but the bed was clean so I didn't care too much. The light above the bed flickered non-stop, so I had to turn it off and use the bathroom light and my phone for a light when I needed it. I got a few hours of sleep and then got up to take a shower. When I turned the shower on water sprayed everywhere. I did my best to cover ut with the shower curtain, but the shower head leak was so bad water was everywhere. I then kept the shower on for about 10 minutes and it never got hot, it never even got warm. The bathroom was soaked, so I decided the shower wasn't worth it and did my best to clean up the water.This is my first time writing a bad review, and I would have been okay with this place if I could have at least taken a shower! It sucks because it has so much potential and the location is amazing (the only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1), but it has no upkeep whatsoever. If you're looking for a place for the rest, and don't care about a shower then this place would be okay, but I'm definitely staying somewhere different next time I visit Portland.

July 27, 2014


Thank you for posting your review here on TripAdvisor. The opinions of our guests are very important to us. We were disappointed to hear about the troubles you encountered during your stay with us. We apologize that you had such a long wait to check in, and that the facilities did not meet your expectations. Especially things as fundamental as the shower and the hot water. Was the front desk staff unable to provide a different room when asked? Of course if the property was fully booked that day it might not have been possible. We try to respond to issues with the rooms as soon as possible in order to ensure our patrons are comfortable. We would like very much to hear more from you about your time with us at the Downtown Value Inn. We can be reached at guestrelations@downtownvalueinn.com.

“A dump, but ok if you get over it”


Reviewed December 30, 2013




e wanted to stay for cheap in downtown Portland, and this place fit the price tag. I would recommend something else if you can afford it. The water in the shower had no pressure. We got a room that stunk of smoke on arrival (asked for non smoking), the heater in the room was so loud we could not sleep, so instead we shivered through the night. The blinds in the windows need dusting. If you drive a mini van or SUV or are not very good at parking in tight spaces you may have problems parking at the limited availability parking. Forget it if you have a truck. Overall the place is kind of yucky. For instance I was a bit grossed out to go barefoot and wore my socks the entire time. The covers on the bed seem really old and it just doesn't seem hygienic. They have definitely not invested a penny to even put new bed throws/covers in. My husband and I slept in some warm clothes we brought with us, and I also slept in my pants - due to the cold. The pillows were comfy - that's the only plus. There is no breakfast or anything, but I can't imagine that it would be any good. The guy at the reception was OK, but did not really go out of his way to be nice, helpful, or give an extra sense of welcoming. The place is also not accessible for those who need wheelchair accessibility or have strollers to carry around.

“Rude & unprofessional!!!”


Reviewed December 22, 2013




WORST motel I have ever stayed at!!!!! Please do not stay here! The staff is beyond RUDE and extremely UNPROFESSIONAL. They do not understand the concept of customer service. We were visiting Portland for the holidays and a good friend picked us up from the airport and brought us to the motel. The hotel desk clerk basically freaked out and said no visitors were allowed after 10pm (it was only a little after 10). Btw, this policy is NOT in writing and was NOT mentioned at check in...It was just sprung on us at the last minute. I explained the situation and said our friend would only be staying a little while. He reluctantly agreed. After our friend had left (he only stayed 30-40 mins), the clerk called the room asking suspiciously if "our guest had left the premises." I said yes and he said he didn't see him leave and that he was coming up to our room. Next thing I know, he is knocking on the door and basically BARGED into our room at 11:00 at night, "searching the premises" for our guest who he thought I was hiding in the room somewhere. After I repeated that our friend had left, he stormed out of the room saying, "Well if you don't like it, you can leave tomorrow! We will give you your money back!" I felt unsafe from his unwarranted entry and confused about his mistrust. It appears that the motel has had some "problems" with visitors in the past (IDK but am assuming maybe prostitutes or hookers bringing clients?). But regardless of their past history, we were good, paying customers, weren't doing anything illegal, and still were treated like criminals.We tried staying another night or two, but we just kept feeling really uncomfortable there, and so ended up leaving there early and getting a refund for the rest of the days. They didn't even really seemed to care about losing our business. We went to EconoLodge down the street instead and had a much better experience.

“Worst motel EVER!”


Reviewed December 22, 2013




I have travelled to over 20 countries and have had a variety of lodging options from couch surfing and hostels to very exclusive hotels. This motel is the worst place I've have ever stayed. To say the staff is rude is an understatement. When our friend dropped us off at the motel, he hung out in our room for 30-40 minutes before leaving. The desk clerk then called up my partner and screamed at her about some policy of no visitors after 10:00. (This policy is NOT in writing and was not mentioned at check in). Then he came up to the room, knocked on the door, and barged into the room looking for our friend who had already left. We were not using drugs or involved in any illegal activities and he just stormed into the room. The next day the same desk clerk called up my 65 year old mother who rented the room and screamed at her. I don't normally write reviews about motels/hotels, but I feel I should give other potential travelers fair warning before staying here. The management and desk clerks are very aggressive.

Pebblebrook Hotel Trust Acquires the Hotel Modera in Portland, OR

Industry Update




Press Release29 August 2013Pebblebrook Hotel Trust Acquires the Hotel Modera in Portland, OR

Pebblebrook Hotel Trust (NYSE: PEB) (the "Company") today announced that it has 
acquired the Hotel Modera for $47.5 million. The 174-room, urban, boutique, upper 
upscale, full service hotel is located in downtown Portland, Oregon. The property will be 
managed by OLS Hotels and Resorts ("OLS"). As a part of this transaction, the 
Company is assuming a $23.7 million secured, non-recourse loan, with the balance of 
the purchase price being funded by the Company with available cash.

"We're thrilled to acquire the Hotel Modera in the west coast gateway city of Portland
and expand our presence in the highly desirable downtown Portland market," said Jon Bortz, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Pebblebrook Hotel Trust. "This distinctive hotel benefits from its central downtown location, consistently high occupancy levels and strong positive cash flows. The hotel is located within one block of Portland Plaza, five blocks from both the Portland Art Museum and the Tom McCall Waterfront Park, and a half mile from Pebblebrook's Hotel Vintage Plaza Portland. The already healthy operating performance of the property, coupled with a strong rebound in demand fundamentals and the implementation of Pebblebrook's best practice and asset management initiatives, makes the Hotel Modera a great investment opportunity for our company."

The 174-room Hotel Modera is well-located between 5th Avenue and
6th Avenue on Clay Street, just steps from fine restaurants, art galleries, museums and nightlife venues. The hotel is also proximate to major area tenants, including US Bank, Deloitte, NRC, Wells Fargo, Intel, Nike, Providence Health Systems, Portland State University and other top-tier institutions. Downtown Portland is one of the most successfully integrated downtown districts in the country, with more than 10 million square feet of Class "A" office space, over 3,500 condominium and residential units, accessible parks and outdoor venues, over 800 retail shops, two large urban malls and one of the best multimodal transportation networks in the nation. Portland is also home to the Oregon Convention Center, the largest convention center in the Pacific Northwest, which hosts over 650 events and more than 700,000 visitors annually.
Originally built in 1962, the hotel underwent a comprehensive $13.0 million renovation
and repositioning that was completed in 2008. The hotel boasts luxury and comfort, balanced with a chic atmosphere that includes numerous pieces of local art, elegant Italian Carrera marble, black walnut floors and modern architecture. The hotel's guest rooms include iPod docking stations, 32-inch LCD flat screen TVs, pillow-top mattresses and plush microfiber robes. The hotel offers 2,000 square feet of meeting space in three meeting rooms and an additional 600 square feet of space in two private dining rooms. The hotel also features Nel Centro (leased), a modern Italian restaurant open daily, serving classic Italian cuisine for breakfast, lunch and dinner. In addition, the hotel's inner courtyard projects a tranquil, elegant symmetry that is home to Portland's first "Living Wall," a fully sustainable 63-by-15 foot living work of art. The hotel also provides a business center and sundry shop, as well as valet parking in the hotel's 72 underground parking spaces.
In 2012, the Hotel Modera operated at 79 percent occupancy, with an average daily rate
("ADR") of $135, room revenue per available room ("RevPAR") of $106, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") of $3.8 million and net operating income after capital reserves ("NOI) of $3.5 million. During the next 12 months, the Company currently forecasts that the hotel will generate earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") of $3.8 to $4.3 million and net operating income after capital reserves ("NOI") of $3.4 to $3.9 million.
In connection with the acquisition, the Company is assuming a $23.7 million secured,
non-recourse loan, which is subject to a fixed interest rate of 5.257%. The loan matures in July 2016.
In conjunction with the Company's acquisition of the Hotel Modera, the Company has
selected OLS as manager for the hotel.
"OLS has an extensive amount of industry experience, particularly with high-quality
boutique hotels, and we believe their approach to managing the property will maximize its long term value while also taking advantage of the strength of the Portland market," continued Mr. Bortz. "We're delighted to be developing a strategic relationship with OLS and we look forward to working with them at the Hotel Modera."
"We are excited to be renewing a long and prior relationship with the senior executives
of Pebblebrook Hotel Trust and to bring our extensive experience with boutique hotels to the Hotel Modera," said OLS's Chief Executive Officer, John Fitts. "The Hotel Modera offers strong growth potential and we are enthusiastic about unlocking additional value in the hotel."
The Company expects to incur approximately $0.4 million of costs related to the
acquisition of the hotel and $0.4 million of costs related to the transition of a new management team that will be expensed as incurred.
The acquisition of the Hotel Modera brings the total number of properties in the
Company's portfolio to 28, comprising $2.2 billion of invested capital. This acquisition marks the Company's third investment in the Portland area, including the 117-room Hotel Vintage Plaza in downtown Portland, Oregon and the 254-room Skamania Lodge in Stevenson, Washington.


About Pebblebrook Hotel Trust

News


















Chances are good that a hotel room will cost you more this year. The Hotels.com Hotel Price Index reports that global hotel prices rose 3 percent in 2014, the fifth straight annual increase.Fortunately, we know a few tricks to help you slash rates. Here are 10 ways to make your next vacation a bit more affordable.1. Go in the off-seasonThe top way to save on your hotel room is to travel during off-peak times. Money Talks News finance expert Stacy Johnson says traveling in the off-season can cut your hotel costs by up to two-thirds.Traveling at off-peak times helped me save more than a $100 a night at Cedar Point. With fewer people traveling, hotels drop their rates in the off-season to pull in as much business as they can.2. Stay midweekIf off-season travel doesn’t work for you, try to hit your destination during the week rather than on the weekend. Unless the hotel you’re staying at caters to business travelers, you’ll probably find cheaper rates on weekdays.

3. Search online for promo codesBefore booking a hotel, try searching online for coupon codes or promo offers. If you’re booking through a third-party website, don’t forget to search for codes associated with the booking site as well as the hotel.In addition, follow your favorite brands on Facebook and Twitter. Companies occasionally distribute codes or announce flash sales on social media. You might even send a message to the company and ask if they have a coupon for loyal customers like you.4. Shop aroundHotels are a bit like cars: Each one offers roughly the same thing for a different price. Find the best rate by searching for hotel prices on a couple of different sites or use an aggregator site like Trivago.com. Be sure to clear the cookies from your computer between searches to ensure your search history isn’t influencing your results.Also, don’t neglect calling the hotel directly. In my experience, some of the best rates are offered by the hotel itself.5. Think outside the hotelSometimes the best deal isn’t a hotel at all. If you have a large family or are traveling with a group, you may find it’s cheaper to rent a vacation home.For a different experience, you could try a bed and breakfast, Airbnb or a hostel. Really adventurous souls can try couch surfing.6. Bundle your vacationIf you’re using a third-party site, try bundling your vacation. Some sites will provide discounts if you buy airfare or rent a car at the same time you book a hotel room. However, you should also price out your airfare and room separately to ensure you’re getting a bargain.7. Rethink the entertainment packageMany hotels offer entertainment packages that add meals and attraction tickets to your room. On the face of it, many of these packages seem a good deal. But do some research before making your reservation.Learn what is in the package so you don’t spend on perks you don’t want. Also, it may be just as cheap to buy the included items separately. And by waiting to make those ticket and meal purchases after you arrive, you’ll likely have greater flexibility in your schedule.8. Sign up for a loyalty programFrom Choice Hotels to Hyatt, hotel chains fitting every budget offer loyalty programs. They often work like frequent-flier miles, earning you free nights after a certain number of stays.They may also entitle you to discounts and other perks, like evening receptions or room upgrades. Best of all, most are free to join.9. Join a clubMembership has its privileges, and some organizations have negotiated discounts with hotel chains. AARP and AAA are two groups known for helping members get rate cuts. If you’re a member, be sure to ask about special rates before booking your stay.10. Ask for a dealFinally, the best way to cut your hotel rate may be to simply ask. Don’t bother using a third-party booking site or even the hotel chain’s 800-number for this strategy. Just call the front desk of the hotel and ask for the lowest nonrefundable rate they offer.Another option is to make a refundable reservation and then continue to shop around. If you find a lower price, go back to your preferred hotel and ask if it can match the competition’s price. At the very least, the hotel may offer you an upgrade.What’s your secret way to save on lodging? Share with us in comments below or on our Facebook page.

Pebblebrook Hotel Trust Acquires the Hotel Modera in Portland, ORBETHESDA, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pebblebrook Hotel Trust  (NYS: PEB)  (the "Company") today announced that it has acquired the Hotel Modera for $47.5 million. The 174-room, urban, boutique, upper upscale, full service hotel is located in downtown Portland, Oregon. The property will be managed by OLS Hotels and Resorts ("OLS"). As a part of this transaction, the Company is assuming a $23.7 million secured, non-recourse loan, with the balance of the purchase price being funded by the Company with available cash."We're thrilled to acquire the Hotel Modera in the west coast gateway city of Portland and expand our presence in the highly desirable downtown Portland market," said Jon Bortz, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Pebblebrook Hotel Trust. "This distinctive hotel benefits from its central downtown location, consistently high occupancy levels and strong positive cash flows. The hotel is located within one block of Portland Plaza, five blocks from both the Portland Art Museum and the Tom McCall Waterfront Park, and a half mile from Pebblebrook's Hotel Vintage Plaza Portland. The already healthy operating performance of the property, coupled with a strong rebound in demand fundamentals and the implementation of Pebblebrook's best practice and asset management initiatives, makes the Hotel Modera a great investment opportunity for our company."The 174-room Hotel Modera is well-located between 5th Avenue and 6th Avenue on Clay Street, just steps from fine restaurants, art galleries, museums and nightlife venues. The hotel is also proximate to major area tenants, including US Bank, Deloitte, NRC, Wells Fargo, Intel, Nike, Providence Health Systems, Portland State University and other top-tier institutions. Downtown Portland is one of the most successfully integrated downtown districts in the country, with more than 10 million square feet of Class "A" office space, over 3,500 condominium and residential units, accessible parks and outdoor venues, over 800 retail shops, two large urban malls and one of the best multimodal transportation networks in the nation. Portland is also home to the Oregon Convention Center, the largest convention center in the Pacific Northwest, which hosts over 650 events and more than 700,000 visitors annually.Originally built in 1962, the hotel underwent a comprehensive $13.0 million renovation and repositioning that was completed in 2008. The hotel boasts luxury and comfort, balanced with a chic atmosphere that includes numerous pieces of local art, elegant Italian Carrera marble, black walnut floors and modern architecture. The hotel's guest rooms include iPod docking stations, 32-inch LCD flat screen TVs, pillow-top mattresses and plush microfiber robes. The hotel offers 2,000 square feet of meeting space in three meeting rooms and an additional 600 square feet of space in two private dining rooms. The hotel also features Nel Centro (leased), a modern Italian restaurant open daily, serving classic Italian cuisine for breakfast, lunch and dinner. In addition, the hotel's inner courtyard projects a tranquil, elegant symmetry that is home to Portland's first "Living Wall," a fully sustainable 63-by-15 foot living work of art. The hotel also provides a business center and sundry shop, as well as valet parking in the hotel's 72 underground parking spaces.In 2012, the Hotel Modera operated at 79 percent occupancy, with an average daily rate ("ADR") of $135, room revenue per available room ("RevPAR") of $106, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") of $3.8 million and net operating income after capital reserves ("NOI) of $3.5 million. During the next 12 months, the Company currently forecasts that the hotel will generate earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") of $3.8 to $4.3 million and net operating income after capital reserves ("NOI") of $3.4 to $3.9 million.In connection with the acquisition, the Company is assuming a $23.7 million secured, non-recourse loan, which is subject to a fixed interest rate of 5.257%. The loan matures in July 2016.In conjunction with the Company's acquisition of the Hotel Modera, the Company has selected OLS as manager for the hotel."OLS has an extensive amount of industry experience, particularly with high-quality boutique hotels, and we believe their approach to managing the property will maximize its long term value while also taking advantage of the strength of the Portland market," continued Mr. Bortz. "We're delighted to be developing a strategic relationship with OLS and we look forward to working with them at the Hotel Modera.""We are excited to be renewing a long and prior relationship with the senior executives of Pebblebrook Hotel Trust and to bring our extensive experience with boutique hotels to the Hotel Modera," said OLS's Chief Executive Officer, John Fitts. "The Hotel Modera offers strong growth potential and we are enthusiastic about unlocking additional value in the hotel."The Company expects to incur approximately $0.4 million of costs related to the acquisition of the hotel and $0.4 million of costs related to the transition of a new management team that will be expensed as incurred.The acquisition of the Hotel Modera brings the total number of properties in the Company's portfolio to 28, comprising $2.2 billion of invested capital. This acquisition marks the Company's third investment in the Portland area, including the 117-room Hotel Vintage Plaza in downtown Portland, Oregon and the 254-room Skamania Lodge in Stevenson, Washington.About Pebblebrook Hotel TrustPebblebrook Hotel Trust is a publicly traded real estate investment trust ("REIT") organized to opportunistically acquire and invest primarily in upper upscale, full-service hotels located in urban markets in major gateway cities.

A change, if any, in the allocation will affect the amount of depreciation and amortization and the resulting change may be material.This press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rules. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the hotel's results of operations determined in accordance with GAAP.The Company has presented forecasted hotel EBITDA and forecasted hotel net operating income after capital reserves, because it believes these measures provide investors and analysts with an understanding of the hotel-level operating performance. These non-GAAP measures do not represent amounts available for management's discretionary use, because of needed capital replacement or expansion, debt service obligations or other commitments and uncertainties, nor are they indicative of funds available to fund the Company's cash needs, including its ability to make distributions.The Company's presentation of the hotel's forecasted EBITDA and forecasted net operating income after capital reserves should not be considered as an alternative to net income (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of the hotel's financial performance. The table above is a reconciliation of the hotel's forecasted EBITDA and net operating income after capital reserves calculations to net income in accordance with GAAP. Pebblebrook Hotel TrustHistorical Operating Data - Entire Portfolio($ in millions, except ADR and RevPAR)(Unaudited)  Historical Operating Data:          First QuarterSecond QuarterThird QuarterFourth QuarterFull Year20122012201220122012 Pro forma Occupancy75%85%87%79%82%Pro forma ADR$194$216$217$220$212Pro forma RevPAR$146$183$189$174$173 Pro forma Hotel Revenues$119.8$145.6$148.0$142.4$555.8Pro forma Hotel EBITDA$23.7$44.1$46.4$39.6$153.7 First QuarterSecond Quarter20132013 Pro forma Occupancy79%86%Pro forma ADR$200$225Pro forma RevPAR$158$194 Pro forma Hotel Revenues$127.5$153.8Pro forma Hotel EBITDA$27.1$48.0 These historical hotel operating results include information for all of the hotels the Company owned as of August 28, 2013, except for the operating results of Hotel Zetta (formerly Hotel Milano) for the first quarter of 2012.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
