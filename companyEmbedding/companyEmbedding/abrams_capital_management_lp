Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Chase (NYSEMKT:CCF) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A

1. Maxim Group analysts commented, "Summary Conclusion: We see little to no effect from this news on the commercial outlook for Auryxia." (7/20/2017)
2. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Keryx intends to focus on the growth of Auryxia in the U.S. dialysis market. Meanwhile, the company’s label expansion efforts on Auryxia in the iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) indication seem to be encouraging, given that the IDA market holds great potential. The FDA accepted for review the supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for Auryxia tablets for the same indication and has set the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date as Nov 6, 2017.  A potential approval should boost sales.. Moreover, shares of the company have outperformed the Medical-Biomed/Genetic Market  in year to date. However, considering that the company is heavily dependent on Auryxia for growth, any further interruption in the supply of Auryxia will hamper its growth trajectory, going forward." (7/17/2017)
3. JMP Securities analysts commented, "Hogan Reward"The expert cited Keryx Biopharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: KERX)'s sulodexide as an example of a development-stage asset that failed such a confirmation in another kidney disease called diabetic nephropathy.The DUET study has rolled over onto the open-label portion, although the active control irbesartan will not be carried forward, thus it may be difficult to detect a treatment benefit."We believe that we will need to wait until year end to determine if the company can convince the FDA that an accelerated approval pathway can meet the agency's needs," analyst Liisa Bayko wrote in a note."Our sensitivity analysis shows that the stock currently reflects the sentiment that accelerated approval is unlikely," (9/8/2016)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Keryx Biopharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:KERX) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 5 Hold Ratings, 4 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.44)Consensus Price Target: $8.60 (17.97% upside)

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
