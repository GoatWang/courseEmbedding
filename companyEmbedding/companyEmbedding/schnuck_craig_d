Careers 









Grow With Us!
Since 1939, growth and change have been the two constants at Schnucks. As our customers change, we change to meet their needs. As the neighborhoods we serve grow, we grow with them. Schnucks is a progressive, family-owned supermarket retailer with 100 stores in Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa and Wisconsin – all managed from our corporate headquarters in St. Louis.
We employ nearly 15,000 teammates in our office, stores, warehouses and production facilities, generating annual sales in excess of $2.1 billion. We are committed, with the help of our teammates, to serving our customers and meeting their needs in existing and new markets.
 

Friendliest Stores In Town!
We pride ourselves on service excellence. Being friendly and courteous to all customers is our primary responsibility. It’s the best way we can differentiate ourselves from our competition, especially in this age of the big box stores.
We’ve been serving customers for more than 75 years, growing from a single, small confectionery to a leading regional supermarket chain. Here are the values we’ve followed since 1939:

Friendliness
Service
Quality
Variety
Value
Integrity
Innovation

Giving Back To The Community
From the beginning, we’ve believed that a responsible business is also a good corporate citizen and a friend to the community. That’s why we work to enhance and enrich the lives of those living in the neighborhoods served by our stores.
We believe in these communities and are proud to invest in organizations that foster health and wellness, civic progress, education and quality of life.
“In our family and in our company, we try to treat the other fellow as we want to be treated. It’s not just a philosophy. It’s the way of life.”
-Edward J. Schnuck

Ordering Information
Use our online store directory to give your neighborhood store a call today. The majority of our stores have full-time Cake Decorators on staff; however, to ensure your order will be available on time, please give as much advanced notice as possible.
Wedding Cakes
Order your wedding cake with Schnucks! Choose from a large variety of colors, styles, tiers and more. Our Bakery teammates will be happy to answer any questions and help you place your order. Here is some helpful information when selecting a wedding cake: 

Order your cake at least four days in advance. 
We can use white, yellow, chocolate or marble dough for your cake, or we can make each tier in a different dough (example: one tier white dough, one tier marble dough). We cannot make the bottom tier in chocolate dough due to the consistency of the dough. 
If you want a specific color for the flowers or trim (example: to match your bridesmaids’ dresses), please furnish a fabric swatch and we will match it as closely as possible.
You may pick up your cake at your Schnucks store or have it delivered to your reception for a nominal fee. We strongly recommend having your cake delivered directly to your reception location if it is three tiers or more. 
All of our cake designs are available in all sizes. We will be happy to decorate the smaller cake in the design you select. There is no additional charge for this service. 
Chocolate icing is not available on multi-tier wedding cakes.

Ordering Information
Use our online store directory to give your store a call today. To ensure your order will be available on time, please remember to give at least four days notice for wedding cakes!

First Family of Food Six Schnuck Siblings Run a Billion-Dollar Business, but They Put Harmony First 
By Jerri Stroud Of The Post-Dispatch

Article excerpt

As youngsters, Doris Schnuck's boys fought so much that she
wondered if they'd survive childhood.
"It was just rough-housing," protested Todd Schnuck, the
youngest son. But it was rough enough to punch a hole in the wall
after one boy threw a hip-check at another one day as they were
running up the stairs at the Schnuck family home, he admitted.
Doris Schnuck needn't have worried.
Family harmony is almost a mantra with the six Schnucks
siblings - five brothers and a sister.
"We put as much time into family harmony as into the business,"
Mark Schnuck said.
All of the siblings have found places at Schnuck Markets Inc.,
the area's top grocery chain. They are:
*  Craig D. Schnuck, 48, chairman and chief executive.
*  Scott C. Schnuck, 46, president and chief operating officer.
*  Terry E. Schnuck, 44, general counsel and secretary.
*  Mark J. Schnuck, 40, vice president of shopping center
development and operations and president of Desco Group.
*  Todd R. Schnuck, 37, chief financial officer.
*  Nancy A. Diemer, 31, community affairs director.
Building on foundations laid by their father, the late Donald
O. Schnuck, and their uncle, the late Edward J. Schnuck, the
third-generation Schnucks have led the company to prominence in the
St. Louis market and beyond.
Even before it bought National Super Markets last year,
Schnucks was "one of a couple places you'd stop in the country to
look at new developments" in the supermarket industry, said Larry
DelSanto, a longtime family friend who is chairman and chief
executive of Vons Cos., a supermarket chain in Arcadia, Calif.
Schnucks has been a pioneer in category management - the art of
managing merchandise assortments to maximize profit and sales. The
Schnuck family and other managers are active on industry committees
to speed the movement of products from manufacturers to market and
to ease the flow of information between stores and suppliers.
The National merger was a bold stroke that thrust Schnucks and
the family into the spotlight - a position the family viewed with a
mixture of pride and apprehension.
For Schnucks, the buyout was the best opportunity to boost its
growth beyond the piecemeal pace of building new stores one or two
at a time, Craig Schnuck said.
For the rest of St. Louis, the deal came as a shock - and a
threat to the competitive balance among food stores here. National
employees worried about their jobs. City shoppers wondered how
Schnucks would serve inner-city areas where it had limited
experience.
The Federal Trade Commission reviewed the deal for six months
before it was convinced that competition from discount stores,
drugstores and convenience stores would keep Schnucks from
dominating the market. In the end, the government allowed Schnucks
to buy the 57 National stores, but only if it sold 18 of them and
six Schnucks stores.
Schnucks closed five stores when it completed the deal in June
1995. Former National managers bought 23 stores and reopened them
as "the new National." Wild Oats Markets, a natural foods
supermarket chain from Boulder, Colo., bought the last store the
government had ordered Schnucks to sell.
The Schnucks say they think the St. Louis market is as
competitive as ever. Competition from Wal-Mart and other types of
stores remains keen and restaurants are cutting into supermarkets'
sales.
Schnucks now has 70 stores in St. Louis and 21 in seven other
cities. The company won't give specific numbers, but doesn't
dispute published sales estimates of $1.8 billion a year.
Schnucks hasn't put the brakes on growth since the National
buyout. Three new stores will open by February, and two more are in
the works.
Schnucks has proposed new stores at the old Mercy High School
site in University City and at a shopping center to be built at
Union Boulevard and Natural Bridge Avenue in St. Louis.
But Schnucks is looking outside St. Louis for most of its
future growth. The company is expanding its clusters of stores in
Kansas City and in central and southern Illinois, and it will
consider acquisitions in other cities, Scott and Craig Schnuck said. …

Plaintiff, Federal Trade Commission, having commenced
        this civil action by filing its Complaint herein for
        alleged violations of an Order issued by the Federal
        Trade Commission on June 8, 1995, in FTC Docket No.
        C-3585, and Defendant, Schnuck Markets, Inc.
        ("Schnucks"), having agreed to the entry of
        this Consent Judgment in settlement of disputed claims
        without trial or adjudication of any issue of fact or of
        law herein and without this Consent Judgment constituting
        any evidence against or an admission by any party with
        respect to any such issue:
NOW, THEREFORE, prior to the taking of any testimony,
        civil discovery and without trial or adjudication of any
        issue of fact or of law herein, and upon the consent of
        the parties hereto, it is hereby 
ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED as follows:
I. 
This Court has jurisdiction of the subject matter
        herein and of each of the parties consenting hereto. The

        against Schnucks under Sections 5(l) and
        16(a)(1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C.
        � � 45(l) and 56(a)(1).
II. 
Judgment is hereby entered in favor of the Plaintiff,
        Federal Trade Commission, and against the Defendant,
        Schnucks, and Schnucks shall comply with the provisions
        of this Consent Judgment.
III. 
For purposes of this Consent Judgment, the following
        definitions shall apply:
A. "Assets To Be Divested" means all of
        Schnucks' rights, titles and interests in the properties
        located at (1) 6155 S. Grand Avenue, St. Louis, Missouri
        63111 ("Grand & Iron location"); and (2)

        Ferguson, Missouri 63135 ("Ferguson location"),
        formerly operated as supermarkets, both of which are now
        closed (collectively, "the Locations").
        "Assets To Be Divested" includes all assets,
        tangible and intangible, located at such properties as of
        June 1, 1997, including but not limited to equipment,
        fixtures, leases, and improvements to leases; provided
        however that "Assets To Be Divested" shall not
        include those assets consisting of or pertaining to
        "Schnucks" or "National" trade names,
        trade dress, trade marks, service marks, and such other
        intangible assets that Schnucks also utilizes in its
        business at locations other than those listed above.
B. "Supermarket" means a full-line retail
        grocery store that carries a wide variety of food and
        grocery items in particular product categories, including
        bread and dairy products; refrigerated and frozen food
        and beverage products; fresh and prepared meats and

        nonfood items such as soaps, detergents, paper goods,
        other household products, and health and beauty aids.
C. "Commission" means the Federal Trade
        Commission.
D. "Order" means the Decision and Order of
        the Federal Trade Commission in Docket No. C-3585, issued
        by the Commission on June 8, 1995, and which became final
        on June 13, 1995.
IV. 
Schnucks shall pay to the United States, pursuant to
        Section 5(l) of the Federal Trade Commission
        Act, 15 U.S.C. � 45(l), a civil penalty in
        the amount of three million United States dollars
        ($3,000,000), which shall be paid and delivered in the
        following manner:
A. Payment shall be made within thirty (30) days after
        entry of this Consent Judgment;
B. Payment shall be made by wire transfer of funds to
        the United States Treasury through the Treasury Financial
        Communications System;
C. In the event of a default in payment, interest at
        the rate of eighteen (18) percent per annum shall accrue
        thereon from the date of the default to the date of
        payment.
V. 
A. Schnucks shall divest, absolutely and in good
        faith, the Assets To Be Divested within six months of the
        entry of this Consent Judgment or such further period as
        the Commission may determine. Provided, however, that
        Schnucks may accomplish divestiture of the leases of the
        Locations by means of subleases. Provided further, that
        Schnucks shall not be required to divest any of the
        Assets To Be Divested which the acquirer or acquirers of
        the Grand & Iron location and the Ferguson location
        does not want to acquire, if the Commission approves such
        acquirer or acquirers. 
B. Schnucks shall divest the Assets To Be Divested
        only to an acquirer or acquirers that receive the prior
        approval of the Commission and only in a manner that
        receives the prior approval of the Commission. The
        purpose of the divestiture is to allow the Locations to
        be reopened as Supermarkets by the acquirer or acquirers
        and to remedy the violations of the Order as pleaded in
        the Commission's complaint in this matter. Schnucks shall
        submit an application or applications to the Commission
        for approval of the divestiture or divestitures complying
        with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of
        Practice concerning divestiture applications, including,
        but not limited to, Rule 2.41(f), 16 C.F.R.
        � 2.41(f). If the Commission determines not to
        approve any application for divestiture, it shall state
        its reasons for such action. The Commission's decision to
        approve or not to approve any application shall be
        binding unless such decision is determined to be
        arbitrary or capricious within the meaning of Section
        706(2)(A) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.
        � 706(2)(A).
C. Pending divestiture of the Assets To Be Divested,
        Schnucks shall take such actions as are necessary to
        maintain and preserve the status quo of the Assets To Be
        Divested and to prevent the destruction, removal,
        wasting, deterioration, or impairment of any of the
        Assets To Be Divested except for ordinary wear and tear. 
D. Within sixty (60) days after the entry of the
        Consent Judgment and every sixty (60) days thereafter
        until Schnucks has fully complied with the provisions of
        Paragraph V. hereof, Schnucks shall submit to the
        Commission verified written reports setting forth in
        detail the manner and form in which it intends to comply,
        is complying, and has complied with Paragraph V. hereof.
        Schnucks shall include in its compliance reports, among
        other things that are required from time to time, a full
        description of the efforts being made to comply with
        Paragraph V. hereof, including a description of all
        substantive contacts or negotiations for the divestiture
        and the identity of all parties contacted. Schnucks shall
        include in its compliance reports copies of all written
        communications to and from such parties, all internal
        memoranda, and all reports and recommendations concerning
        divestiture.
VI. 
A. If Schnucks has not divested, as required by
        Paragraph V. hereof, the Assets To Be Divested within six
        months of the date of entry of this Consent Judgment, as
        may be extended by the Commission, the Commission may
        appoint a trustee to divest the Assets To Be Divested.
        Neither the appointment of a trustee nor a decision not
        to appoint a trustee under this Paragraph shall preclude
        the Commission from seeking fines or any other relief
        available to it, including a court-appointed trustee, for
        any failure by the Schnucks to comply with this Consent
        Judgment.
B. If a trustee is appointed by the Commission or a
        court pursuant to Paragraph VI. A. hereof, Schnucks shall
        consent to the following terms and conditions regarding
        the trustee's powers, duties, authority, and
        responsibilities:

1. The Commission shall select the trustee,
                subject to the consent of Schnucks, which consent
                shall not be unreasonably withheld. The trustee
                shall be a person with experience and expertise
                in acquisitions and divestitures. If Schnucks has
                not opposed, in writing, including the reasons
                for opposing, the selection of any proposed
                trustee within ten (10) business days after
                notice by the staff of the Commission to Schnucks
                of the identity of any proposed trustee, Schnucks
                shall be deemed to have consented to the
                selection of the proposed trustee.
 
2. Subject to the prior approval of the
                Commission, the trustee shall have the exclusive
                power and authority to divest the Assets To Be
                Divested, including, but not limited to,
                negotiating and binding Schnucks to modifications
                of, or reasonably necessary extensions to, any
                leases pertaining to or included within the
                Assets To Be Divested. 
 
3. Within ten (10) days after appointment of the
                trustee, Schnucks shall execute a trust agreement
                that, subject to the prior approval of the
                Commission and, in the case of a court-appointed
                trustee, of the court, transfers to the trustee
                all rights and powers necessary to permit the
                trustee to effect the divestiture required by
                this Consent Judgment.
 
4. The trustee shall have twelve (12) months from
                the date the Commission approves the trust
                agreement described in Paragraph VI.B. 3. to
                accomplish the divestiture, which shall be
                subject to the prior approval of the Commission.
                If, however, at the end of the twelve-month
                period, the trustee has submitted a plan of
                divestiture or believes that divestiture can be
                achieved within a reasonable time, the
                divestiture period may be extended by the
                Commission, or, in the case of a court-appointed
                trustee, by the court; provided, however, the
                Commission may extend this period only two (2)
                times.
 
5. The trustee shall have full and complete
                access to the personnel, books, records and
                facilities related to the Assets To Be Divested
                or to any other relevant information, as the
                trustee may request. Schnucks shall develop such
                financial or other information as such trustee
                may request and shall cooperate with the trustee.
                Schnucks shall take no action to interfere with
                or impede the trustee's accomplishment of the
                divestitures. Any delays in divestiture caused by
                Schnucks shall extend the time for divestiture
                under this Paragraph in an amount equal to the
                delay, as determined by the Commission or, for a
                court-appointed trustee, by the court.
 
6. The trustee shall use his or her best efforts
                to negotiate the most favorable price and terms
                available in each contract that is submitted to
                the Commission, subject to Schnucks' absolute and
                unconditional obligation to divest at no minimum
                price. The divestiture shall be made in the
                manner and to the acquirer or acquirers as set
                out in Paragraph V. hereof; provided, however, if
                the trustee receives bona fide offers from more
                than one acquiring entity, and if the Commission
                determines to approve more than one such
                acquiring entity, the trustee shall divest to the
                acquiring entity or entities selected by Schnucks
                from among those approved by the Commission.
 
7. The trustee shall serve, without bond or other
                security, at the cost and expense of Schnucks, on
                such reasonable and customary terms and
                conditions as the Commission or a court may set.
                The trustee shall have the authority to employ,
                at the cost and expense of Schnucks, such
                consultants, accountants, attorneys, investment
                bankers, business brokers, appraisers, and other
                representatives and assistants as are reasonably
                necessary to carry out the trustee's duties and
                responsibilities. The trustee shall account for
                all monies derived from the divestiture and all
                expenses incurred. After approval by the
                Commission and, in the case of a court-appointed
                trustee, by the court, of the account of the
                trustee, including fees for his or her services,
                all remaining monies shall be paid at the
                direction of Schnucks, and the trustee's power
                shall be terminated. The trustee's compensation
                shall be based at least in significant part on a
                commission arrangement contingent on the
                trustee's divesting the Assets To Be Divested.
 
8. Schnucks shall indemnify the trustee and hold
                the trustee harmless against any losses, claims,
                damages, liabilities, or expenses arising out of,
                or in connection with, the performance of the
                trustee's duties, including all reasonable fees
                of counsel and other reasonable expenses incurred
                in connection with the preparation for, or
                defense of any claim, whether or not resulting in
                any liability, except to the extent that such
                liabilities, losses, damages, claims, or expenses
                result from misfeasance, gross negligence,
                willful or wanton acts, or bad faith by the
                trustee.
 
9. If the trustee ceases to act or fails to act
                diligently, a substitute trustee shall be
                appointed in the same manner as provided in
                Paragraph VI. A. hereof.
 
10. The Commission or, in the case of a
                court-appointed trustee, the court, may on its
                own initiative or at the request of the trustee
                issue such additional orders or directions as may
                be necessary or appropriate to accomplish the
                divestiture required by this Consent Judgment.
 
11. The trustee shall have no obligation or
                authority to operate or maintain the Assets To Be
                Divested.
 
12. The trustee shall report in writing to
                Schnucks and the Commission every sixty (60) days
                concerning the trustee's efforts to accomplish
                divestiture.

C. If the trustee appointed pursuant to Paragraph VI.
        hereof has not divested all of the Assets To Be Divested
        within the time provided, including any extensions; or
        the Commission notifies Schnucks in writing that it has
        determined not to appoint a trustee and not to seek a
        court appointed trustee; then Schnucks' obligation to
        divest any remaining Assets To Be Divested pursuant to
        this Consent Judgment shall terminate. The termination of
        Schnucks' obligation to divest pursuant to this Paragraph
        VI shall not preclude the Commission from seeking fines
        or any other relief available to it for any failure by
        Schnucks to comply with this Consent Judgment, including
        failure to divest within the time required in Paragraph
        V.
VII. 
Each party shall bear its own costs of the within
        action.

At its fall meeting Oct. 5, the Board of Trustees elected trustee Craig D. Schnuck, chair of the executive committee of St. Louis-based Schnuck Markets, to a newly created additional vice chair role and heard a report on the Washington University endowment by Kimberly G. Walker, chief investment officer.
Schnuck
The trustees also held a moment of silence and presented a memorial resolution for Lee Liberman, PhD, a life trustee and former chair of the Board of Trustees, who died Aug. 31, 2012, in St. Louis. An outstanding university and St. Louis community leader, Liberman had served on the Board of Trustees since 1975.
In his report to the Board of Trustees, Chancellor Mark S. Wrighton reported that 1,640 members of the fall 2012 freshman class moved in Aug. 23 and already have made a smooth transition to campus life, thanks to the dedication of the staff and student members of the orientation team. He noted that, although this year’s 14th annual Service First event Sept. 1 was cancelled due to inclement weather, student volunteers have been hard at work on subsequent weekends, providing much-needed service at a number of St. Louis-area schools.
This year’s class, selected from more than 27,000 applicants, came from across the U.S. and from 26 countries. He added that, once again, nearly 40 percent are multicultural or international students, and that the class is evenly made up of male and female students. Recruitment for next year’s class is already under way and both campus visits and applications are up over last year at this time.
Wrighton gave updates on construction projects on both campuses. On the Danforth Campus, he reported on planning for development of facilities for the Brown School of Social Work and the Institute of Public Health, the Delmar Loop student living initiative, the mid-August reopening of the Forsyth Boulevard underpass, and the Olin Business School expansion, which includes two new buildings — Bauer and Knight halls. He also noted that McMillan Hall is being renovated on the west side and new teaching facilities for the Department of Anthropology are being added on the north side.
He gave special mention to the newly renovated Umrath Hall, which recently opened for the fall semester. Originally built in 1902 as a men’s dormitory, Umrath’s intensive yearlong renovation began in June 2011 and retained the building’s historic exterior but included a complete reconstruction of the building’s interior and a new roof, giving the century-old building a new life. It is now home to the Danforth Center for Religion and Politics, the Center for the Humanities, the Department of Classics and other programs.
Among the construction projects occurring for the School of Medicine, the South County Cancer Center is targeted for completion in mid-November, Wrighton said, with move-in and occupancy planned for early 2013. This expansion of the Siteman Cancer Center is a collaborative undertaking with BJC HealthCare and Barnes Jewish Hospital.  Construction of facilities for the Center for the Study of Itch on the sixth floor of the Clinical Sciences Research Building is now complete, and renovation is under way on an “open lab” concept for the departments of Anatomy and Neurobiology and of Medicine.
Four important leadership transitions recently have been announced, Wrighton said, including the decision of Edward S. Macias to step down from his position as provost and executive vice chancellor next June following 25 years as the university’s chief academic officer. 
Additionally, Barbara Schaal, PhD, the Mary-Dell Chilton Professor of Biology, will become the next dean of Arts & Sciences on Jan. 1, succeeding Gary S. Wihl, PhD, the Hortense & Tobias Lewin Distinguished Professor in the Humanities in Arts & Sciences, who will be on leave beginning Jan. 1, 2013. Finally, Wrighton reported that, effective Oct. 1, James V. Wertsch, PhD, was named vice chancellor for international relations and John A. Berg was promoted to vice chancellor for admissions.
Wrighton reported that the McDonnell International Scholars Academy welcomed 16 new graduate and professional students from 11 partner institutions worldwide for the 2012-13 academic year, including, for the first time, two scholars from the United States. 
Last week, Chelsea Clinton announced at the annual Clinton Global Initiative meeting in New York that WUSTL will serve as the host of the Clinton Global Initiative University (CGI U), April 5-7, 2013, on the Danforth Campus. President Bill Clinton, who will be present at the event, launched CGI U in 2007 to engage the next generation of leaders on college campuses around the world. Each year, CGI U hosts a meeting where students, youth organizations, topic experts and celebrities discuss solutions to pressing global issues. About 1,000 students will be invited to attend, including about 200 WUSTL students. 
Wrighton made special note of the 25th anniversary of the university’s Ervin Scholars Program, held Sept. 15 at the St. Louis Union Station Marriott. The late Vice Chancellor for Students James E. McLeod founded the program in 1987 to pay tribute to WUSTL’s first African-American dean, John B. Ervin, PhD. More than 1,000 alumni, family and friends of the program participated. On the same weekend, McLeod’s Way was dedicated, celebrating McLeod’s remarkably effective leadership. The dedication included opening a new landscaped gathering place on the South 40.
The university finished the fiscal year June 30 with good financial results, Wrighton told the trustees. Top-line revenue was about $2.3 billion, an increase of  $62 million from the year before. The total operating surplus was $105 million, compared to $123 million in the prior year. Endowment return was approximately 1.7 percent and, after spending 4.3 percent of current market value, the value of the endowment was $5.3 billion on June 30, 2011, representing a decline of  $46 million from fiscal 2011.
Wrighton recognized the extraordinary accomplishments and national rankings of several of the university’s athletic teams early in the fall season, including the No. 1-ranked volleyball team and the No. 5-ranked women’s golf team. He noted especially senior tennis player Adam Putterman, who recently won the USTA/ITA central regional singles championship for the second straight year; and 2012 graduate and track athlete Liz Phillips, who is among the top nine student athletes selected as finalists for the 2012 NCAA Woman of the Year award.  She is the third finalist in WUSTL history.
In addition, the board heard reports from the following standing committees: development, educational policy, university finance, global engagement, medical finance, audit and the alumni board of governors.
Craig D. Schnuck 
Craig D. Schnuck is the former chairman and chief executive officer of Schnuck Markets Inc., one of the largest privately held supermarket chains in the United States. Based in suburban St. Louis, the family-owned company was started in 1939 and now operates 100 stores in five states throughout the Midwest. Schnuck was elected president of Schnuck Markets in 1984, served as its chief executive officer from 1989 to 2006 and chairman from 1991 to 2006. He currently serves as chair of the company’s executive committee. Schnuck served for nine years on the board of governors of the Uniform Code Council, the agency that oversees the retail food industry’s most fundamental technologies, serving as its chairman for two terms.
Schnuck serves as a trustee of Washington University. He is vice chair of the board of directors of Barnes-Jewish Hospital and serves on the board of BJC Healthcare, where he is chair of the finance and planning committee. Schnuck also has served as chairman of Civic Progress and a member of its executive committee. He has been a director of U.S. Bancorp since 2002 and director for several of U.S. Bank’s predecessor banks and bank holding companies from 1979 to 2001. He served from 1990 to 2002 as a director of General American Life Insurance Co., an independent insurance company that became a subsidiary of MetLife. Schnuck is a longtime member of the executive board of the Greater St. Louis Council of the Boy Scouts of America. He has served as chairman and currently serves as vice-president.
