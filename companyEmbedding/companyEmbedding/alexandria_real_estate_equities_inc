Joel S. Marcus
                            Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Founder





Joel S. Marcus is the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and Founder of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (NYSE:ARE), an urban office REIT uniquely focused on collaborative life science and technology campuses in AAA innovation cluster locations. Mr. Marcus co-founded Alexandria in 1994 as a garage startup with $19 million in seed capital and has led its growth into an S&P 500 company with an approximately $16 billion total market capitalization and a total shareholder return of more than 1,200% since the company’s IPO in 1997. Today, Alexandria, which celebrated its 20th anniversary as an NYSE listed REIT in May 2017, is the only publicly traded pure-play office/laboratory REIT.

                    Mr. Marcus has built Alexandria’s unique business model around four business verticals — real estate, venture investments, thought leadership, and corporate social responsibility. With its core focus on real estate, Alexandria has a proven track record of developing Class A buildings clustered in urban life science and technology campuses in AAA innovation cluster locations, including Greater Boston, San Francisco, New York City, San Diego, Seattle, Maryland, and Research Triangle Park. In 1996, Mr. Marcus founded the company’s venture investments arm, Alexandria Venture Investments, to provide strategic investment capital to innovative life science and technology entities developing breakthrough therapies and technologies. Mr. Marcus introduced the company’s renowned, highly unique, and interactive thought leadership platform in 2011, when he co-founded the renowned Alexandria Summit®. The Alexandria Summit convenes a diverse group of visionary partners and key stakeholders — from the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, agribusiness, technology, medical, academic, venture capital, private equity, philanthropic, patient advocacy, and government communities — to address the most critical challenges in global healthcare, agriculture, and the environment. Focusing on philanthropy and sustainability, Alexandria’s fourth business vertical, corporate social responsibility, affirms the company’s commitment to make a positive impact on the world. Mr. Marcus is also personally engaged in numerous mission-critical philanthropic efforts, including his service as Chair of the Navy SEAL Foundation’s 2017 New York City Benefit, which raised $12.8 million to help support the Naval Special Warfare community and their families.

                    Mr. Marcus was one of the original architects and co-founders of Accelerator Corporation, for which he serves on the board of directors, and AgTech Accelerator Corporation, for which he serves as Chairman of the board. He also serves on the boards of Applied Therapeutics Inc., Atara Biotherapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATRA), Boragen Inc., Intra-Cellular Therapies, Inc. (NASDAQ:ITCI), MeiraGTx Limited, and Yumanity Therapeutics; Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO), Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH), Friends of Cancer Research, NewYorkBIO, and The Scripps Research Institute; the 9/11 Memorial & Museum, the Partnership for New York City, and Robin Hood Foundation; as well as on NAREIT’s 2017 Executive Board.

                    Prior to co-founding Alexandria, Mr. Marcus had an extensive legal career specializing in corporate finance and capital markets, venture capital, and mergers and acquisitions. During that time, he acquired an expertise in the biopharmaceutical industry and was one of the principal architects of the Kirin-Amgen EPO joint venture in 1984. He was also a practicing certified public accountant and tax manager with Arthur Young & Co., where he focused on the financing and taxation of REITs. Mr. Marcus earned his undergraduate and Juris Doctor degrees from the University of California, Los Angeles. He was named one of Real Estate Forum’s 2017 Best Bosses in commercial real estate and was previously a recipient of the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur Of the Year Award (Los Angeles — Real Estate).

Focusing on philanthropy and sustainability, Alexandria’s fourth business vertical, corporate social responsibility, affirms the company’s commitment to make a positive impact on the world. Mr. Marcus is also personally engaged in numerous mission-critical philanthropic efforts, including his service as Chair of the Navy SEAL Foundation’s 2017 New York City Benefit, which raised $12.8 million to help support the Naval Special Warfare community and their families.

                    Mr. Marcus was one of the original architects and co-founders of Accelerator Corporation, for which he serves on the board of directors, and AgTech Accelerator Corporation, for which he serves as Chairman of the board.

                    Prior to co-founding Alexandria, Mr. Marcus had an extensive legal career specializing in corporate finance and capital markets, venture capital, and mergers and acquisitions. During that time, he acquired an expertise in the biopharmaceutical industry and was one of the principal architects of the Kirin-Amgen EPO joint venture in 1984.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Equity Research reports, or ZER for short, are our in-house, independently produced research reports.
The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

About Alexandria
Alexandria: Best-in-Class, Unique Urban Office REIT

 


Joel S. Marcus, Chairman, CEO & Founder of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.


Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (NYSE:ARE), an S&P 500® company, is an urban office REIT uniquely focused on collaborative life science and technology campuses in AAA innovation cluster locations, with a total market capitalization of $14.5 billion and an asset base in North America of 28.2 million square feet as of March 31, 2017. The asset base in North America includes 20.1 million RSF of operating properties, including 1.6 million RSF of development and redevelopment of new Class A properties currently undergoing construction. Additionally, the asset base in North America includes 8.1 million SF of future development projects, including 1.5 million SF of near-term projects undergoing marketing for lease and pre-construction activities and 2.0 million SF of other near-term development projects. Founded in 1994, Alexandria pioneered this niche and has since established a significant market presence in key locations, including Greater Boston, San Francisco, New York City, San Diego, Seattle, Maryland, and Research Triangle Park. Alexandria has a longstanding and proven track record of developing Class A properties clustered in urban life science and technology campuses that provide its innovative tenants with highly dynamic and collaborative environments that enhance their ability to successfully recruit and retain world-class talent and inspire productivity, efficiency, creativity, and success. We believe these advantages result in higher occupancy levels, longer lease terms, higher rental income, higher returns, and greater long-term asset value.  







Investment-Grade Balance Sheet
Alexandria holds investment-grade ratings from Moody's (Baa2/Stable) and S&P Global (BBB/Stable).
 
First-Mover Advantage
As the first REIT focused on the life science real estate niche, Alexandria has assembled a First in Class® portfolio of the highest quality assets in the world's top urban innovation clusters.

 
Best-in-Class Management and Regional Teams
With seasoned real estate and life science experts located in each submarket, Alexandria has an unparalleled team of professionals dedicated to serving our tenants.

 
More than a Landlord: Unique and Value-Added Real Estate Partner
At Alexandria, we have redefined the meaning of landlord by viewing each and every tenant as a partner, where Alexandria plays a key role in the success of our partners' businesses by providing office/laboratory space, design assistance, investment capital, construction management, technical expertise, a continuum of product offering to meet our tenants' needs, and a deep network of industry relationships.

 
Unique Industry and Tenant Underwriting Capability
Alexandria has a best-in-class life science and technology team that enables Alexandria to prudently underwrite innovative life science and technology tenants and strategically capitalize on industry trends.

NEW YORK, May 22, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (NYSE:   ARE), an urban office REIT uniquely focused on collaborative life science and technology campuses in AAA innovation cluster locations, will ring The Opening Bell® at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) today. The honor marks Alexandria's celebration of its 20th anniversary on the NYSE. Joel S. Marcus, Alexandria's chairman, chief executive officer and founder, will ring The Opening Bell alongside members of the company's board of directors and long-tenured executive management team. 


"In reaching its 20th anniversary as an NYSE company, Alexandria has achieved the three outputs that define a great company: Superior Results, Distinctive Impact and Lasting Endurance," said Jim Collins, renowned author and business strategist. "Alexandria's success flows from disciplined focus on what it can be the best in the world at, disciplined insight into what drives its economic engine and people passionate about the company's purpose."
Alexandria, which joined the S&P 500® index in March 2017, is the only publicly traded pure-play office REIT focused on life science and technology campuses in the top urban innovation clusters in the United States. The company continues to pursue its primary business objectives of maximizing long-term asset value and total shareholder return (TSR), while operating as a mission-driven organization. Alexandria achieved a TSR of 1,098% – from the completion of its successful IPO on May 27, 1997, through December 31, 2016 – outperforming various indices, including the FTSE NAREIT Equity Office, the MSCI US REIT, the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500. 
"Since our IPO, Alexandria's unique vision and business model has sustained a competitive advantage that sets us apart from all other office REITs," said Mr. Marcus. "It is with great pride, humility and appreciation that we celebrate our tremendous achievements, reflect on our journey and look to the future with confidence. From 12 employees at our IPO to nearly 300 nationwide today, we are incredibly thankful for our dedicated team, which directly impacts our success and upholds our critical mission to enable our innovative tenants to cure disease, end hunger and improve the quality of people's lives."
A live feed of Alexandria ringing the NYSE Opening Bell (9:29 a.m. ET) will be available at https://livestream.com/NYSE. 
About Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (NYSE:   ARE), an S&P 500® company, is an urban office REIT uniquely focused on collaborative life science and technology campuses in AAA innovation cluster locations, with a total market capitalization of $14.5 billion and an asset base in North America of 28.2 million square feet as of March 31, 2017. The asset base in North America includes 20.1 million RSF of operating properties, including 1.6 million RSF of development and redevelopment of new Class A properties currently undergoing construction. Additionally, the asset base in North America includes 8.1 million SF of future development projects, including 1.5 million SF of near-term projects undergoing marketing for lease and pre-construction activities and 2.0 million SF of other near-term development projects. Founded in 1994, Alexandria pioneered this niche and has since established a significant market presence in key locations, including Greater Boston, San Francisco, New York City, San Diego, Seattle, Maryland and Research Triangle Park. Alexandria has a longstanding and proven track record of developing Class A properties clustered in urban life science and technology campuses that provide its innovative tenants with highly dynamic and collaborative environments that enhance their ability to successfully recruit and retain world-class talent and inspire productivity, efficiency, creativity and success. We believe these advantages result in higher occupancy levels, longer lease terms, higher rental income, higher returns and greater long-term asset value.

Scroll to TopThe ExchangeBuilding for the Biotech Revolution





An Interview with Alexandria Real Estate Equities founder, CEO and Chairman, Joel Marcus.













As a corporate securities lawyer in the biotechnology sector in the 1980s and early 1990s, Joel Marcus had a lot to learn about the business. But one aspect of the fast-growing industry made itself abundantly clear—there were not enough specialized facilities. 

The need for buildings in which to experiment, test and develop new treatments, and Marcus’ belief that life science companies are most successful when located in centers of innovation led him to found Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (NYSE: ARE). Alexandria is a real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on collaborative science and technology campuses that enable life science companies to develop new medicines and treatments.

And after 22 years in business, Alexandria boasts more than 24 million square feet of office/and laboratory space in seven urban clusters in North America — from San Francisco to North Carolina’s Research Triangle Park to the greater Boston area — that are home to companies tackling some of the world’s most nettlesome diseases. NYSE recently spoke with Marcus about Alexandria’s cluster approach to development, as well as the unique needs of life science companies in the 21st century. 



When you identified the real estate bottleneck that was slowing the growth of the biotech industry, did investors get the concept right off the bat, or did it take some convincing?
It definitely took some convincing. We met with 30 investors, and 29 kicked us out. They didn’t think it was the best idea. They said, “There’s no credit in this tenancy and the buildings are dangerous because they have chemicals and people are working on different experiments.”

What led you to persevere through that negative feedback? 
The human genome was sequenced for the first time in 2000. And we believed that the revolution of genetic engineering in biotech would create a whole slate of new medicines to prevent, treat and cure disease. We banked on that belief, but everybody told us that these companies burn cash, that they don’t have products, they don’t make money, and that they’re going to go bankrupt. That was the lay of the land at the time, but our thesis turned out to be true.
 

Can you describe Alexandria’s “cluster model” of campuses in a handful of urban centers? 
That was one of our most important insights. We believed that, for these companies to thrive, they needed to be located in a key urban location in a dense area of a large city. But more than that, a successful cluster needed some connection to top-notch scientific minds on the research and clinical sides. They also had to be in places where you could find management talent and have access to an abundance of risk capital. This formula was our secret sauce, and when you visit some of our properties, you’ll see a medallion that highlights those elements: Location, Science, Talent and Capital.


When you started Alexandria, most biotech companies were located in suburban areas. Why did you focus on urban centers? 
We believed that as the industry grew and accelerated, people would cluster around major scientific institutions. MIT is a great example. The financial value of the output of its technology researchers is equal to that of the eighth largest national GDP in the world. And the scientific innovation it continues to foster makes the Boston/Cambridge area a very important cluster for us. We are also in Maryland because we thought people would cluster around the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and National Institutes of Health (NIH). In the San Francisco cluster, UCSF, UC-Berkeley and Stanford all serve as the anchor institutions. 
 

How do these factors work together for biotech companies? 
Interaction is happening – the collaborative and innovative nature of these clusters allows commercial, academic and clinical parties to interact and to develop treatments. That close proximity is key to innovative and collaborative environments. Within those campuses, we try to provide great amenities to keep people on campus and to improve productivity. In New York City, for example, we have a fitness center and the city’s largest urban farm on site, so the food at our on-campus restaurant is farm-to-table. We also have a state-of-the-art conference center that allows us to host thought-leadership events. 
 
"The collaborative and innovative nature of these clusters allows commercial, academic and clinical parties to interact and to develop treatments. That close proximity is key to innovative and collaborative environments."

How has Alexandria’s perspective led it to evolve into more than just a landlord?

Being so closely entwined with the biotech industry, our platform has developed beyond real estate to include a large venture capital arm. Our connections with so many of the best and brightest in the industry have also led Alexandria into the thought leadership programming arena, where we host biotech summits that convene the top thinkers in the field. It’s a Davos-like event for biotech. And that role as a forum for big-picture thinking has helped lead us into a wide range of socially responsible initiatives. 


Are there any new urban centers that meet your cluster criteria?

The answer to that is a little bit sad. The established clusters are winners, and they continue their winning ways. Companies are moving to Cambridge, but they’re not moving to New Haven or Philadelphia. The winners are winners because universities like MIT, UCSF or Columbia and the access to high-quality talent and capital that the cluster locations offer. Over the years, there have been attempts to cultivate new clusters in Memphis, Chicago, Denver and Baltimore. Places like Miami and St. Louis also have one-off buildings. But the industry has been very slow to move away from its established centers. 


What does that mean for Alexandria?

It has helped to keep our competitors at bay. If I gave you a billion dollars and said “Go buy life science assets in Cambridge,” you would actually have a hard time doing it. The players there are not really sellers, and there are no large expanses of land you can buy to build on. The barriers to entry have become huge in these clusters. That’s why market rents have done well and why values have done well.


What trends do you think will shape the future of the biotech industry?

I think that the products produced in our labs will continue to amaze not just me, but also the entire medical community. A product to help cure hepatitis C was developed in one of our labs, as was the medicine that has helped many people live long lives with AIDS. And those successes only point to labs becoming more open and collaborative. The lab of the future includes a lot more space for meetings and creative collisions.
