15 Year Transferable Structural Warranty
We back our homes with a 15 Year Transferable Structural Warranty. What kind of company would offer that kind of coverage? One that's confident it builds a better home. That means you can buy with confidence. And it's transferable, so your home will have added value when you decide to sell.

A Safe & Secure Home
We want you to feel safe in your new home!  That’s why every new home in Columbus comes with a Schlage Keypad Lock .  You can control the locks on your home directly from your phone.  This safety device allows you to see what time the door is locked and unlocked using specific user codes. *Not included in Smart Series homes.
Where We Build
We are building new homes in premier locations across Columbus and Central Ohio.  From the white fences of New Albany to the old world architecture of Dublin, our neighborhoods are a step above.  We offer new community and new home opportunities in: Blacklick,  Delaware, Gahanna, Galena, Grove City, Hilliard, Lewis Center, Licking Heights, Marysville, Olentangy, Pickerington, Powell, and Westerville.

Our Company
From our very beginnings in 1976, M/I Homes has been deeply committed to quality, value, integrity and above all, treating the customer right. Today, our commitment to our customers is evident in all of our new homes in Indianapolis. Choose from one of our beautiful move-in ready homes or build your own home to fit the way you live in one of our convenient new home communities.
Industry Leading 15-Year Transferable Structural Warranty
We back our homes with an Industry Leading 15-Year Structural Warranty. What kind of company would offer that kind of coverage? One that's confident it builds a better home. That means you can buy with confidence. And it's transferable, so your home will have added value when you decide to sell.

Quality Construction
At M/I Homes, quality construction has always been a part of our backbone. This means we go above the industry standards to ensure our homes are well built. We use 2”x6” lumber to create stronger, more stable exterior walls.  This also allows for R19, a thicker insulation than the standard (R13).  We also build our homes' walls with the ZIP System®, a one-of-a-kind structural system with a built-in, energy efficient barrier that keeps the elements out while keeping you comfortable and helping you save on your energy bills!
Where We Build
We are building new homes in premier locations across Indianapolis and Central Indiana. Whether it's neighboring the Carmel Arts District, Monon Trail, inches from Grand Park, or historic Cumberland Trail, we build where you want to live.  We offer new community and new home opportunities in leading school districts, Avon, Brownsburg, Carmel, Center Grove, Clark Pleasant, Franklin Township, Franklin, Hamilton Southeastern, Lawrence, Noblesville, Pike, Mt. Vernon, Washington, Westfield-Washington and Zionsville.

Leading New Homebuilder in Tampa
From our very beginnings in 1976, M/I Homes has been deeply committed to quality, value, integrity and above all, treating the customer right. Our new homes in Tampa are no exception.  M/I Homes in Tampa offers a wide variety of award winning floor plans to choose from whether you are a first-time home buyer or looking to move up to a new home. Choose from one of our beautiful move-in ready homes or build your own to fit your lifestyle in one of our beautiful communities and see for yourself why we are the new home leader.
Cleaner, Greener and More Cost Efficient Living
Every home we build is built to our stringent Whole Home guidelines. What does this mean to you? Not only do you get one of the most energy efficient homes on the market today, but we also care about the environment and use procedures to lessen the carbon footprint. Each home is tested and provided with a HERS score showing just how energy efficient your home is.
15 Year Transferable Structural Warranty
We back our homes with an Industry-Leading 15 Year Structural Warranty. What kind of company would offer that kind of coverage? One that's confident it builds a better home. That means you can buy with confidence. And it's transferable, so your home will have added value when you decide to sell.
Where We Build
We build new homes in premier locations across the Tampa Bay Area. You can find your perfect home in locations such as The Westchase area, Citrus Park, Odessa, Lutz, New Tampa, Lakeland, Land O'Lakes, and Riverview.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 05/16/2012
            

                BBB has determined that M/I Homes, Inc. meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

Advertise Honestly

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards.

5. the business' return/refund policy

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
