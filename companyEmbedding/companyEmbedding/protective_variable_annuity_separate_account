Participation and Protection: With No Annual Fees




When planning for retirement, you can’t risk everything and you can’t protect everything.
But there is a way to have some of both.










A Shield Annuity from Brighthouse Financial can help you use a portion of your assets to take advantage of market
            growth with a level of downside protection that other options may not provide. Shield is designed to provide
            some protection in an unpredictable endeavor — investing.





Protect your retirement assets
A Brighthouse Shield Annuity is designed to provide a level of protection that, when markets inevitably turn volatile,
            ensures your losses are limited.



Participate in growth opportunities
With a Shield Annuity, balance is built-in. This means that even with the protection you enjoy, you can still take
            advantage of growth opportunities in the market up to a certain percentage.



Pay no annual fees
Unlike many financial products, you pay no annual fees with a Shield Annuity.

                                            Your Retirement Big Picture: Where Do Annuities Fit?

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

A.M. Best’s Financial Strength Rating is an independent opinion of an insurer’s financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. A Financial Strength Rating is not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and does not address any other risk, including, but not limited to, an insurer’s claims-payment policies or procedures; the ability of the insurer to dispute or deny claims payment on grounds of misrepresentation or fraud; or any specific liability contractually borne by the policy or contract holder. A Financial Strength Rating is not a recommendation to purchase, hold, or terminate any insurance policy, contract or any other financial obligation issued by an insurer, nor does it address the suitability of any particular policy or contract, for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.ambest.com.
Fitch’s Insurer Financial Strength Rating provides an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization. The Insurer Financial Strength Rating is assigned to the insurance company’s policyholder obligations, including assumed reinsurance obligations and contract holder obligations, such as guaranteed investment contracts.

Moody’s Insurance Financial Strength Rating is an opinion of the ability of an insurance company to pay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations and also reflect the expected financial loss suffered in the event of default. Specific obligations are considered unrated unless they are individually rated because the standing of a particular insurance obligation would depend on an assessment of its relative standing under those laws governing both the obligation and the insurance company. Ratings explanations can be found at www.moodys.com.
S&P Global Insurer Financial Strength Rating is a forward-looking opinion about the financial security characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms.

      How Legacy Protection Plus Works
   

When used as a part of your clients' retirement strategy, Legacy Protection Plus allows them to protect, grow and leave assets to their beneficiaries. Even though the annuity comes with a standard minimum death benefit, with no additional charge, your clients may want the opportunity to leave more to their loved ones by adding the Legacy Protection Plus optional death benefit.


When your clients purchase Legacy Protection Plus, a minimum death benefit value (referred to as the roll-up death benefit amount in the prospectus), a roll-up rate and a roll-up cap will be established. The roll-up rate and roll-up cap percentage are set when the contract is issued and will not change for the life of the contract.


This chart highlights how the Legacy Protection Plus benefit grows over time compared to the account value. Upon the contract owner's passing , his or her beneficiaries would receive the greater of the death benefit value or the account value.

On each contract anniversary, the roll-up rate will increase the death benefit value until it reaches the roll-up cap.






























Even if the account value falls below the death benefit value, your client's beneficiaries will receive the greater amount.






























If the account value grows above the death benefit value, your client's beneficiaries would receive the greater amount, which is the account value.

Your clients' guaranteed death benefit value will continue to grow each year, even in down markets. On each contract anniversary, the roll-up rate amount will be added to their guaranteed death benefit value and will continue to grow until one of the following occurs:

The guaranteed death benefit value reaches the roll-up cap amount (this cap amount can change, and may be different for each client depending on their age)
The contract anniversary date following the owner's 80th birthday is reached
The owner passes away

Additionally, your clients will choose from a range of investment options that can provide the opportunity to increase their account value through positive performance.

To help us offer attractive rates for your clients, we may change the roll-up and roll-up cap percentage rates as often as monthly. However, when we issue a new contract for your clients, those rates are set, and will not change for the life of their contract. Before you share rate information with your clients, be sure you have checked the most current rate sheet prospectus supplement which must be used in conjunction with the current prospectus.

Your clients can also choose from several different payout options for their beneficiaries, and in some cases, can maintain control over how their legacy will be distributed after they pass away. And, since most annuities are non-probate, your clients' beneficiaries may avoid a lengthy and cumbersome legal process when they inherit the money.

Footnote

What is a variable annuity?

A variable annuity is a contract with an insurance company. It's a long‐term investment designed for retirement purposes. You place money in professionally managed investment portfolios, where it accumulates tax‐deferred. When you retire, your savings can be used to generate a stream of regular income payments that are guaranteed for as long as you live. In addition, variable annuities may provide a guaranteed death benefit for your beneficiaries. Any such death benefit, however, may be impacted by withdrawals or other actions you take in connection with the annuity. It is important to remember that annuity contracts contain exclusions, limitations, reductions of benefits and terms for keeping them in force.

Why does the company behind the annuity matter?

All references to guarantees, including the benefit payment obligations arising under the annuity contract guarantees, rider guarantees, optional benefits, any fixed account crediting rates or annuity payout rates are backed by the claims‐paying ability of Pruco Life Insurance Company and Pruco Life Insurance Company of New Jersey. Those payments and the responsibility to make them are not the obligations of the third party broker/dealer from which this annuity is purchased or any of its affiliates. All guarantees, including optional benefits, do not apply to the underlying investment options.

What are the withdrawal consequences?

Withdrawals in excess of the income amount impact the value of a product or benefit and can also affect the certainty of the income. An excess withdrawal occurs when cumulative Lifetime Withdrawals exceed the income amount in an annuity year. If an excess withdrawal is taken, only the portion of the Lifetime Withdrawal that exceeds the remaining income amount for that year will proportionally and permanently reduce future guaranteed amounts. If an excess withdrawal reduces the account value to zero, no further amount would be payable and the contract terminates.

	Withdrawals or surrenders may be subject to contingent deferred sales charges. Withdrawals and distributions of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and, if made prior to age 59½, may be subject to an additional 10% federal income tax penalty sometimes referred to as an additional income tax. Withdrawals, other than from IRAs or employer retirement plans, are deemed to be gains out first for tax purposes. Withdrawals reduce the account value and the living and death benefits.

What are the costs associated with purchasing this product?

Prudential Premier Retirement Variable Annuity is offered at an annual cost of 0.55% to 1.95% for mortality expense and administration fees, with additional fees related to the professional investment options. The fees will vary depending on the underlying annuity and investment options selected. The additional fee for Legacy Protection Plus is as follows: Ages 55 or Younger 0.65%, Ages 56‐70 0.80%, Ages 71 and Older 0.95%. Annual benefit charges are determined at issue, subject to the terms outlined in the prospectus. Benefit charges are assessed against the death benefit value, deducted quarterly from the account value and taken pro‐rata across the permitted subaccounts. Charges paid during contract year of death will not be refunded and there will be no prorata roll‐up in the death benefit value. We reserve the right to deduct a final pro‐rated charge if terminated. Charges continue after the roll‐up cap is reached, and cease upon death or termination of the benefit. We reserve the right to increase the benefit charge up to the maximum of 1.50% upon any new election of the benefit or on/or after the fifth contract anniversary. If we increase your benefit charge on or after your fifth contract anniversary, you may terminate the benefit.

What are some of the other considerations that I need to think about when investing in various asset allocation portfolios offered by a variable annuity?

When purchasing an annuity it is important to remember that asset allocation does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss. Investment returns and the principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original investment. The value or price of a particular stock or other equity or equity‐related security owned by a portfolio could go down and you could lose money. Additionally, fixed income investments are subject to risk, including credit and interest rate risk. Because of these risks, subaccount's share value may fluctuate. If interest rates rise, bond prices usually decline. If interest rates decline, bond prices usually increase.

	Certain asset allocation portfolios may use leverage, short sales, and derivatives or engage in other speculative practices within their alternative investments. These practices include a high degree of risk and may increase the risk, size, and velocity of investment losses. Although certain alternative strategies seek to reduce risk by attempting to reduce correlation with equity and bond markets, no guarantee can be given that such efforts will be successful. The fees and expenses associated with alternative investments are generally higher than those for traditional investments. Lastly, diversification does not assure against loss in a declining market.


Optional death benefits may not be available in every state and may not be elected in conjunction with certain optional benefits. Optional benefits have certain investment, holding period, liquidity, and withdrawal limitations and restrictions. The benefit fees are in addition to fees and charges associated with the basic annuity.

Annuities can help meet your retirement needs 























With potential for tax-deferred growth and a guaranteed income stream, annuities can be important to your retirement objectives.

















































Find out if an annuity is right for your retirement needs. Our experts are happy to answer your questions.

  Annuities 































Annuities from Protective offer tax-deferred growth and guaranteed income
You protect your car, your home and even your life with insurance, but are you leaving your retirement income unprotected? Annuities from Protective may help you grow - and protect - your retirement income. 



























An annuity is a retirement investment vehicle that can offer benefits, including:


























 

Tax-Deferred Growth 

   

Any growth within your annuity is tax-deferred until you withdraw it - similar to how a 401(k) works.*  

*Annuity payments from a tax-qualified plan will be fully taxable as ordinary income. Withdrawals made prior to age 59 1/2 may be subject to an additional 10% IRS tax penalty.


























 

Guaranteed Lifetime Income 

   

Annuities can give you a steady stream of income for a set period of time or for your  lifetime.  
























 

Guaranteed Death Benefit 

   

An annuity can pay money directly to your beneficiaries when you die, helping them avoid a lengthy probate process.  





























Whether you're interested in growing your retirement savings, guaranteed income for life, or both, Protective can walk you through our options. Check out our annuities online or give us a call.

Understanding retirement annuities
Protective’s annuity options offer ways to grow your retirement nest egg based on your risk tolerance, while also deferring taxes on that growth. And when you’re ready to retire, you have a wide variety of options to guarantee that income stream for as long as you need - even for the rest of your life.


Annuities can be purchased to start paying immediately or to postpone payouts to the future.
The payouts from an annuity contract can be made as one lump sum or as a series of payouts over time based on your needs.


The information below walks you through several uses for annuities and then reviews specific categories and how they work.




















































How an annuity works 
An annuity is simply a contract where one party agrees to make either a single payment or a series of payments, and the other party then agrees to do the same in return at some point in the future. 















































































Annuities typically have two phases: 
1. Accumulation – A period of time when the owner, or annuitant, is accumulating value in the annuity. This will usually occur before an individual retires.
2. Distribution – The payout phase of an annuity comes when the accumulated value is distributed – either via a lump sum or a series of payments over time.






























Immediate annuities and deferred annuities 
























Immediate Annuities

Funded with a single lump-sum purchase
Can provide a guaranteed lifetime stream of income
Referred to as single premium immediate annuities, or SPIAs 























Deferred Annuities

Funded with either a lump sum payment or a series of payments
Pay out at a future date
Divided into three categories:                                                          
            fixed,                                                          
            indexed and                                                          
            variable. 






























Types of deferred  annuities and their features

























Fixed Annuities


Earns a guaranteed rate of interest for a set period of time. 
Principal and interest are guaranteed by the financial strength of the insurance company that issues it. 
























Indexed Annuities 

Earns interest based on performance of an underlying financial benchmark like the S&P 500 Index, subject to interest rate caps.
Offer a guaranteed minimum rate of return, which can be as low as 0%. 
























Variable Annuities 


Earnings based on the performance of the investment options (or 'subaccounts') you select from among those offered under the annuity.
Do not offer guaranteed returns and may lose or gain value depending upon the performance of the investments.  






























What type of annuity is right for you?
At Protective Life, we offer different types of annuities to help meet your particular financial goals in retirement. Our annuities include enhanced income features, competitive fees and expanded investment options.

Investment Options


   























Product guarantees are backed by the               
        financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing company. Withdrawals made during an annuity’s surrender period may be subject to surrender charges. Annuity withdrawals made prior to age 59 ½ may be subject to a 10% penalty tax.

























 






















Why financial strength matters
Annuities have no FDIC or NCUA insurance. The guarantees offered are backed by the strength of the issuing insurance carrier. That makes it even more important to choose a carrier you can trust. Protective Life has been around for more than 100 years, and carries high ratings from independent rating organizations.

 3 tips for selecting an annuity 
Choosing an annuity is easier when you know what to look for.                 
        
Read More 






























Variable annuities issued by Protective Life Insurance Company (PLICO) in all states except New York and in New York by Protective Life & Annuity Insurance Company (PLAICO). Securities offered by Investment Distributors, Inc. (IDI). All companies located in Birmingham, AL. IDI is the principal underwriter for registered insurance products issued by PLICO and PLAICO, its affiliates.
As you determine what annuity might be right for you, remember they are intended as vehicles for long-term retirement planning, which is why withdrawals reduce an annuity’s remaining death benefit, contract value, cash surrender value and future earnings. Annuities also may be subject to income tax and, if taken prior to age 59 ½, an additional 10% IRS tax penalty may apply. Because Protective and its representatives do not offer legal or tax advice, it is important that you talk with your own legal and tax advisor about your specific tax situation.
Product guarantees are backed by the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing company.
Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of a variable annuity and the underlying investment options before investing. This and other information is contained in the prospectuses for a variable annuity and its underlying investment options. Investors should read the prospectuses carefully before investing in an annuity.
Annuities are not a deposit, not insured by any federal government agency, carry no bank or credit union guarantee, are not FDIC/NCUA insured and may lose value.

(1)We will waive the annual contract maintenance fee if your Contract Value or aggregate Purchase Payments, reduced by 
surrenders and surrender charges, is $50,000 or more. (See "Charges and Deductions.")   (2) There are two death benefits available under the Contract: (1) the 
Return of Purchase Payments Death Benefit; and (2) the 
Maximum Anniversary Value Death Benefit. For more information on these death benefit values and how they are calculated, please see the "DEATH BENEFIT" section of this prospectus. We assess a fee for 
the Maximum Anniversary Value Death Benefit. When you purchase your Contract, you elect either the CoverPay Fee or the ValuPay Fee if you purchase the Maximum Anniversary Value Death Benefit. There is 
no death benefit fee for the Return of Purchase Payments Death Benefit. (See "Charges and Deductions, Death Benefit Fee.").   (3) The ValuPay fee is based on the Net 
Amount at Risk and the oldest Owner's age. If the Net Amount at Risk remains the same, the ValuPay fee 
will increase over time as the age of the oldest Owner increases. (See "Charges and Deductions, ValuPay Fee.")   (4) If we increase the SecurePay Fee, we will give you 
at least 30 days' notice prior to the increase. You may elect not to pay the 
increase in your SecurePay Fee and your SecurePay rider will not terminate, but your current Benefit Base will be capped at its then current value (i.e., your SecurePay Anniversary Value will be reset 
to $0) and you will give up the opportunity for any future increases in the Benefit Base if your Contract Value exceeds your Benefit Base on subsequent Contract Anniversaries. You will continue to be 
assessed your current SecurePay Fee. If you have purchased the SecurePay R72 Benefit, we also will no longer calculate the SecurePay Roll-up Value when determining your Benefit Base if you 
elect not to pay the increase in your SecurePay Fee. If you have purchased the SecurePay GMAB and you elect not to pay the increase in your SecurePay Fee, you also will not be permitted to 
"step-up" the GMAB Guaranteed Amount or repurchase the SecurePay GMAB following its termination. You will continue to be assessed your current SecurePay Fee, even though you will no longer 
be entitled to additional SecurePay Roll-up Values, additional "step-ups" of the GMAB Guaranteed Amounts and/or repurchase the SecurePay GMAB following its termination. See "GUARANTEED 
LIFETIME WITHDRAWAL BENEFIT ("SecurePay") with RightTimeSM Option" in this prospectus.   (5) The Benefit Base is a value used to calculate the Annual 
Withdrawal Amounts, and the fees charged, under the SecurePay rider. On the Rider 
Effective Date, your initial Benefit Base is equal to your Contract Value. For more information on the SecurePay Benefit, the Benefit Base and how it is calculated, please see "GUARANTEED LIFETIME 
WITHDRAWAL BENEFIT ("SecurePay") with RightTimeSM option" in this prospectus.

Example of Charges.    The following section replaces the "Example of Charges" section on pages 6 and 7 of the Prospectus: 
 
 
  Example of Charges     
        If your Contract was purchased on or after December 1, 2008, the following example is intended to help you compare the cost of 
investing in this Contract with the cost of investing in other variable annuity contracts. The example shows the costs of investing in the Contract, including owner transaction expenses, the annual 
contract maintenance fee, Variable Account Charges, the death benefit fee (assuming you elected the Maximum Anniversary Value Death Benefit with the CoverPay Fee), at both maximum and minimum total 
Annual Fund Operating Expenses, depending on whether and when you purchased the SecurePay rider with the SecurePay R72 Benefit and the SecurePay GMAB. Please note that while election of the Maximum 
Anniversary Value Death Benefit with the CoverPay Fee is assumed in the following example, under certain circumstances, the ValuPay fee for the Maximum Anniversary Value Death Benefit may be more 
expensive, depending on the oldest Owner's age and the Net Amount at Risk. The example includes a persistency reward of 0.25% of Contract Value that we add to the Contract Value on each Contract 
Anniversary beginning with the eighth Contract Anniversary and continuing until the Annuity Commencement Date. The example assumes that all Contract Value is allocated to the Variable Account. The 
example does not reflect transfer fees or premium taxes, which may range up to 3.5% depending on the jurisdiction. 
        The 
example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Contract for the periods indicated. The example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year.

Annuity Value will not be eligible for the PayStream Plus Annuitant Benefit. For more information, see "ANNUITY PAYMENTS, Annuity Commencement Date, Changing the Annuity Commencement Date." Neither 
the death benefit fee nor the SecurePay Fee apply after the Annuity Commencement Date.

  Asset Allocation Models     
        For Contracts issued on or after December 1, 2008, the Asset Allocation Models described on pages 21 and 22 of the 
Prospectus are not available. Please disregard all references in the Prospectus to the Asset Allocation Models or the Model Portfolios. 
 
 
  SecurePay Investment Restrictions     
        For Contracts issued on or after December 1, 2008, the Allocation Guidelines and Restrictions under the SecurePay rider have 
changed from those described in the Prospectus. Instead of requiring that you allocate your Contract Value in accordance with a model allocation portfolio, you will be required to allocate your 
Contract Value among three Investment Categories, as described below. We believe this will give you more freedom in structuring your investment allocations. Please replace the discussion of the 
SecurePay Allocation Guidelines and Restrictions on pages 45 and 46 of the Prospectus with the following. 
        If 
you select the SecurePay rider, you must allocate your Contract Value and Purchase Payments among the three categories of Sub-Accounts listed below, or you may allocate 
your Purchase Payments to the dollar cost averaging ("DCA") Fixed Account(s), provided that transfers from the DCA Fixed Account are allocated to the Sub-Accounts in accordance with these 
Allocation Guidelines and Restrictions. 
        The 
following SecurePay Allocation Guidelines and Restrictions specify the minimum and maximum percentages of your Contract Value that must be allocated to each category for you to 
remain eligible for benefits under the SecurePay rider. You can select the percentage of Contract Value to allocate to individual Sub-Accounts within each category, but the total 
investment for all Sub-Accounts in a category must comply with the specified minimum or maximum percentages for that category. 
5



 
        If 
you desire to change your allocation percentages, you may submit new allocation instructions to us in writing. If you instruct us to allocate Purchase Payments or Contract Value, or 
to take withdrawals or partial surrenders, in a manner that does not satisfy the Allocation Guidelines and Restrictions (a "Prohibited Allocation Instruction"), we will terminate your SecurePay 
rider. For example, if you instruct us to transfer 40% of your Contract Value to the Fidelity VIP Contrafund Sub-Account, we will consider this to be a Prohibited Allocation Instruction because the 
maximum allocation you may make to the Sub-Accounts in Category 3 is 30% of your Contract Value. If we terminate your SecurePay rider due to a Prohibited Allocation Instruction, you may 
reinstate the rider subject to certain conditions. See "Reinstating the SecurePay Rider Within 30 Days of Termination" in the Prospectus. 
        In 
general, the Allocation Guidelines and Restrictions focus on investment strategies that: 


include conservative, high quality bond funds;   
combine bond funds and growth stock funds; or   
emphasize growth stock funds while including a significant weighting of bond funds. 

        Each 
of these required allocations seeks to provide income and/or capital appreciation while avoiding excessive risk. These Allocation Guidelines and Restrictions may not be consistent 
with an aggressive investment strategy. You should consult with your registered representative to determine if they are consistent with your investment objectives. 
        NOTE: You may not allocate any of your Purchase Payments or Contract Value to the Fixed Account.

Changes to the Allocation Guidelines and Restrictions.    We, in our sole discretion, determine whether a Sub-Account is classified as Category 1, 
Category 2, or Category 3. We may change the list of Sub-Accounts in a category, change the number of categories, change the minimum or maximum percentages of Contract Value 
required or permitted within a category, or change the investment options that are or are not available to you, at any time, in our sole discretion. We may make such modifications any time we believe 
the modifications are necessary to protect our ability to provide the guarantees under the SecurePay rider. We will provide you prior written notice of any change to the Allocation Guidelines and 
Restrictions. 
        If 
you receive notice of a change to the Allocation Guidelines and Restrictions, you are not required to take any action. We will apply the new Allocation Guidelines and Restrictions to 
additional Purchase Payments or to future transfers of Contract Value only (not including transfers made to reallocate your Contract Value under the portfolio rebalancing program). However, you will 
not be able to make additional Purchase Payments or transfers of Contract Value until your current allocation instructions meet the Allocation Guidelines and Restrictions in effect at that time 
(although you will still be required to participate in the portfolio rebalancing program). This means if you make additional Purchase Payments or transfers of Contract Value that do not meet the new 
Allocation Guidelines and Restrictions, we will automatically terminate your SecurePay rider, subject to your right to reinstate the rider within 30 days of termination. See "Reinstating the 
SecurePay Rider Within 30 Days of Termination" in the Prospectus. 
         
Portfolio Rebalancing.    You must elect portfolio rebalancing if you select the SecurePay rider. Under this program, we will "re-balance" your Contract 
Value based on your allocation instructions in effect at the time of the rebalancing. You may specify rebalancing on a quarterly, semi-annual, or annual basis. If you do not specify the 
period, we will rebalance your 
Contract Value annually. We will also rebalance your Contract Value when we receive a subsequent Purchase Payment that is accompanied by new allocation instructions. (See "Portfolio 
Rebalancing" in the Prospectus.) 
        Confirmation 
of the rebalancing will appear on your quarterly statement and you will not receive an individual confirmation after each reallocation. We reserve the right to change the 
rebalancing frequency, at any time, in our sole discretion, but we will not make changes more than once per calendar year. You will be notified at least 30 days prior to the date of any change 
in frequency. 
        If 
you terminate the rebalancing of your Contract Value, we will consider this to be a Prohibited Allocation Instruction and we will terminate your SecurePay rider.

  Supplement Dated December 1, 2008 
to 
Prospectus Dated May 1, 2008  
 For 
Protective Rewards II Variable Annuity Contracts 
Issued Before December 1, 2008  
 Issued by 
Protective Life Insurance Company 
Protective Variable Annuity Separate Account  
        This Supplement amends certain information contained in your variable annuity product prospectus. Please read this Supplement carefully 
and keep it with your Prospectus for future reference. The changes outlined in this Supplement are only applicable for Contracts issued before December 1, 
2008. These changes affect: 


The Asset Allocation Models; and   
The investment Allocation Guidelines and Restrictions for the SecurePay guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit rider. 

 Asset Allocation Models  
        Effective December 1, 2008, the Asset Allocation Models described on pages 21 and 22 of the Prospectus will no longer be 
available. However, if you have Contract Value in a Model Portfolio on December 1, 2008, your Contract Value and additional Purchase Payments will remain allocated in accordance with that model 
until you request a change in this allocation. 
 SecurePay Investment Restrictions  
        Effective December 1, 2008, the Allocation Guidelines and Restrictions under the SecurePay rider have changed from those 
described in the Prospectus. Instead of requiring that you allocate your Contract Value in accordance with a model allocation portfolio, you will be required to allocate your Contract Value among 
three Investment Categories, as described below. We believe this will give you more freedom in structuring your investment allocations.  


If you elect the SecurePay rider on or after December 1, 2008, your Contract Value must be allocated in accordance 
with the new Allocation Guidelines and Restrictions described below.   
If you elected the SecurePay rider before December 1, 2008, your Contract Value and additional Purchase Payments 
will remain allocated in accordance with the applicable Model Portfolio until you request a change in this allocation. Once you request a change, your new allocation must satisfy the new Allocation 
Guidelines and Restrictions described below. If it does not, we will consider your allocation to be a Prohibited Allocation Instruction and we will terminate your SecurePay rider 

        
New Allocation Guidelines and Restrictions.    If you select the SecurePay rider, you must allocate your Contract Value and Purchase Payments among the three 
categories of Sub-Accounts 
listed below, or you may allocate your Purchase Payments to the dollar cost averaging ("DCA") Fixed Account(s), provided that transfers from the DCA Fixed Account are allocated to the 
Sub-Accounts in accordance with these Allocation Guidelines and Restrictions. 
        The 
following SecurePay Allocation Guidelines and Restrictions specify the minimum and maximum percentages of your Contract Value that must be allocated to each category for you to 
remain eligible for benefits under the SecurePay rider. You can select the percentage of Contract Value to allocate to individual Sub-Accounts within each category, but the total 
investment for all Sub-Accounts in a category must comply with the specified minimum or maximum percentages for that category. 



 
        If 
you desire to change your allocation percentages, you may submit new allocation instructions to us in writing. If you instruct us to allocate Purchase Payments or Contract Value, or 
to take withdrawals or partial surrenders, in a manner that does not satisfy the Allocation Guidelines and Restrictions (a "Prohibited Allocation Instruction"), we will terminate your SecurePay rider. 
For example, if you instruct us to transfer 40% of your Contract Value to the Fidelity VIP Contrafund Sub-Account, we will consider this to be a Prohibited Allocation Instruction because the maximum 
allocation you may make to the Sub-Accounts in Category 3 is 30% of your Contract Value. If we terminate your SecurePay rider due to a Prohibited Allocation Instruction, you may reinstate the 
rider subject to certain conditions. See "Reinstating the SecurePay Rider Within 30 Days of Termination" in the Prospectus. 
        In 
general, the Allocation Guidelines and Restrictions focus on investment strategies that: 


include conservative, high quality bond funds;   
combine bond funds and growth stock funds; or   
emphasize growth stock funds while including a significant weighting of bond funds. 

        Each 
of these required allocations seeks to provide income and/or capital appreciation while avoiding excessive risk. These Allocation Guidelines and Restrictions may not be consistent 
with an aggressive investment strategy. You should consult with your registered representative to determine if they are consistent with your investment objectives. 
        NOTE: You may not allocate any of your Purchase Payments or Contract Value to the Fixed Account.

Changes to the Allocation Guidelines and Restrictions.    We, in our sole discretion, determine whether a Sub-Account is classified as Category 1, 
Category 2, or Category 3. We may change the list of Sub-Accounts in a category, change the number of categories, change the minimum or maximum percentages of Contract Value 
required or permitted within a category, or change the investment options that are or are not available to you, at any time, in our sole discretion. We may make such modifications any time we believe

        Confirmation 
of the rebalancing will appear on your quarterly statement and you will not receive an individual confirmation after each reallocation. We reserve the right to change the 
rebalancing frequency, at any time, in our sole discretion, but we will not make changes more than once per calendar year. You will be notified at least 30 days prior to the date of any change 
in frequency. 
        If 
you terminate the rebalancing of your Contract Value, we will consider this to be a Prohibited Allocation Instruction and we will terminate your SecurePay rider.

 Item 26.    Persons Controlled by or Under Common Control With the Depositor and Registrant.
        The 
registrant is a segregated asset account of the Company and is therefore owned and controlled by the Company. All of the Company's outstanding voting common stock is owned by 
Protective Life Corporation. Protective Life Corporation is described more fully in the prospectus included in this registration statement. Various companies and other entities controlled by 
Protective Life Corporation may therefore be considered to be under common control with the registrant or the Company. Such other companies and entities, together with the identity of their 
controlling persons (where applicable), are set forth in Exhibit 21 to Form 10-K of Protective Life Corporation for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007 (File 
No. 1-11339) filed with the Commission on February 29, 2008. 
 Item 27.    Number of Contractowners.  

        As of October 31, 2008, there were 1,311 contract owners of ProtectiveRewards® II individual and group 
flexible premium deferred variable and fixed annuity contracts offered by Registrant. 

 

 Item 28.    Indemnification of Directors and Officers.  
        Article XI of the By-laws of Protective Life provides, in substance, that any of Protective Life's directors and 
officers, who is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any action, suit or proceeding, other than an action by or in the right of Protective Life, by reason of the fact that he is or was an 
officer or director, shall be indemnified by Protective Life against expenses (including attorneys' 
C-4



 

fees), 
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such claim, action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a 
manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of Protective Life and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct 
was unlawful. If the claim, action or suit is or was by or in the right of Protective Life to procure a judgment in its favor, such person shall be indemnified by Protective Life against expenses 
(including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed 
to be in or not opposed to the best interests of Protective Life, except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged 
to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of his duty to Protective Life unless and only to the extent that the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon 
application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which such court 
shall deem proper. To the extent that a director or officer has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any such action, suit or proceeding, or in defense of any claim, issue or 
matter therein, he shall be indemnified by Protective Life against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith, not withstanding that he has 
not been successful on any other claim issue or matter in any such action, suit or proceeding. Unless ordered by a court, indemnification shall be made by Protective Life only as authorized in the 
specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the officer or director is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct Such determination shall be made 
(a) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to, or who have been successful on the merits or otherwise with respect to, such claim 
action, suit or proceeding, or (b) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion 
or (c) by the shareholders. 
        In 
addition, the executive officers and directors are insured by PLC's Directors' and Officers' Liability Insurance Policy including Company Reimbursement and are indemnified by a 
written contract with PLC which supplements such coverage. 
        Insofar 
as indemnification for liability arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the Registrant pursuant to the 
foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act 
and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer 
or controlling person of the Registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being 
registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such 
indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. 
 Item 29.    Principal Underwriter.  


(a)Investment 
Distributors, Inc. ("IDI") is the principal underwriter of the Contracts as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940. IDI is also 
principal underwriter for the Protective Variable Life Separate Account and Variable Annuity Account A of Protective Life.

Participation and Protection: With No Annual Fees




When planning for retirement, you can’t risk everything and you can’t protect everything.
But there is a way to have some of both.










A Shield Annuity from Brighthouse Financial can help you use a portion of your assets to take advantage of market
            growth with a level of downside protection that other options may not provide. Shield is designed to provide
            some protection in an unpredictable endeavor — investing.





Protect your retirement assets
A Brighthouse Shield Annuity is designed to provide a level of protection that, when markets inevitably turn volatile,
            ensures your losses are limited.



Participate in growth opportunities
With a Shield Annuity, balance is built-in. This means that even with the protection you enjoy, you can still take
            advantage of growth opportunities in the market up to a certain percentage.



Pay no annual fees
Unlike many financial products, you pay no annual fees with a Shield Annuity.

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Brighthouse Financial, an operating segment of MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET), announced on March 6, 2017 that it is now offering its suite of life insurance and annuity products under the Brighthouse Financial brand. 
*Data as of March 31, 2017. Total assets includes certain adjustments for transactions associated with the separation from MetLife, Inc.

Ratings as of May 2017. Operating entities collectively rated include Brighthouse Life Insurance Company (BLIC), NELICO, and Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY (BLNY); note, Moody’s and Fitch do not rate BLNY.
A.M. Best’s Financial Strength Rating is an independent opinion of an insurer’s financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. A Financial Strength Rating is not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and does not address any other risk, including, but not limited to, an insurer’s claims-payment policies or procedures; the ability of the insurer to dispute or deny claims payment on grounds of misrepresentation or fraud; or any specific liability contractually borne by the policy or contract holder. A Financial Strength Rating is not a recommendation to purchase, hold, or terminate any insurance policy, contract or any other financial obligation issued by an insurer, nor does it address the suitability of any particular policy or contract, for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.ambest.com.
Fitch’s Insurer Financial Strength Rating provides an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization. The Insurer Financial Strength Rating is assigned to the insurance company’s policyholder obligations, including assumed reinsurance obligations and contract holder obligations, such as guaranteed investment contracts. Ratings explanations can be found at www.fitchratings.com.
Moody’s Insurance Financial Strength Rating is an opinion of the ability of an insurance company to pay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations and also reflect the expected financial loss suffered in the event of default. Specific obligations are considered unrated unless they are individually rated because the standing of a particular insurance obligation would depend on an assessment of its relative standing under those laws governing both the obligation and the insurance company. Ratings explanations can be found at www.moodys.com.
S&P Global Insurer Financial Strength Rating is a forward-looking opinion about the financial security characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. This opinion is not specific to any particular policy or contract, nor does it address the suitability of a particular policy or contract for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.standardandpoors.com.

      How Legacy Protection Plus Works
   

When used as a part of your clients' retirement strategy, Legacy Protection Plus allows them to protect, grow and leave assets to their beneficiaries. Even though the annuity comes with a standard minimum death benefit, with no additional charge, your clients may want the opportunity to leave more to their loved ones by adding the Legacy Protection Plus optional death benefit.


When your clients purchase Legacy Protection Plus, a minimum death benefit value (referred to as the roll-up death benefit amount in the prospectus), a roll-up rate and a roll-up cap will be established. The roll-up rate and roll-up cap percentage are set when the contract is issued and will not change for the life of the contract.


This chart highlights how the Legacy Protection Plus benefit grows over time compared to the account value. Upon the contract owner's passing , his or her beneficiaries would receive the greater of the death benefit value or the account value.

On each contract anniversary, the roll-up rate will increase the death benefit value until it reaches the roll-up cap.






























Even if the account value falls below the death benefit value, your client's beneficiaries will receive the greater amount.






























If the account value grows above the death benefit value, your client's beneficiaries would receive the greater amount, which is the account value.

Your clients' guaranteed death benefit value will continue to grow each year, even in down markets. On each contract anniversary, the roll-up rate amount will be added to their guaranteed death benefit value and will continue to grow until one of the following occurs:

The guaranteed death benefit value reaches the roll-up cap amount (this cap amount can change, and may be different for each client depending on their age)
The contract anniversary date following the owner's 80th birthday is reached
The owner passes away

Additionally, your clients will choose from a range of investment options that can provide the opportunity to increase their account value through positive performance.

To help us offer attractive rates for your clients, we may change the roll-up and roll-up cap percentage rates as often as monthly. However, when we issue a new contract for your clients, those rates are set, and will not change for the life of their contract. Before you share rate information with your clients, be sure you have checked the most current rate sheet prospectus supplement which must be used in conjunction with the current prospectus.

Your clients can also choose from several different payout options for their beneficiaries, and in some cases, can maintain control over how their legacy will be distributed after they pass away. And, since most annuities are non-probate, your clients' beneficiaries may avoid a lengthy and cumbersome legal process when they inherit the money.

Footnote

What is a variable annuity?

A variable annuity is a contract with an insurance company. It's a long‐term investment designed for retirement purposes. You place money in professionally managed investment portfolios, where it accumulates tax‐deferred. When you retire, your savings can be used to generate a stream of regular income payments that are guaranteed for as long as you live. In addition, variable annuities may provide a guaranteed death benefit for your beneficiaries. Any such death benefit, however, may be impacted by withdrawals or other actions you take in connection with the annuity. It is important to remember that annuity contracts contain exclusions, limitations, reductions of benefits and terms for keeping them in force.

Why does the company behind the annuity matter?

All references to guarantees, including the benefit payment obligations arising under the annuity contract guarantees, rider guarantees, optional benefits, any fixed account crediting rates or annuity payout rates are backed by the claims‐paying ability of Pruco Life Insurance Company and Pruco Life Insurance Company of New Jersey. Those payments and the responsibility to make them are not the obligations of the third party broker/dealer from which this annuity is purchased or any of its affiliates. All guarantees, including optional benefits, do not apply to the underlying investment options.

What are the withdrawal consequences?

Withdrawals in excess of the income amount impact the value of a product or benefit and can also affect the certainty of the income. An excess withdrawal occurs when cumulative Lifetime Withdrawals exceed the income amount in an annuity year. If an excess withdrawal is taken, only the portion of the Lifetime Withdrawal that exceeds the remaining income amount for that year will proportionally and permanently reduce future guaranteed amounts. If an excess withdrawal reduces the account value to zero, no further amount would be payable and the contract terminates.

	Withdrawals or surrenders may be subject to contingent deferred sales charges. Withdrawals and distributions of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and, if made prior to age 59½, may be subject to an additional 10% federal income tax penalty sometimes referred to as an additional income tax. Withdrawals, other than from IRAs or employer retirement plans, are deemed to be gains out first for tax purposes. Withdrawals reduce the account value and the living and death benefits.

What are the costs associated with purchasing this product?

Prudential Premier Retirement Variable Annuity is offered at an annual cost of 0.55% to 1.95% for mortality expense and administration fees, with additional fees related to the professional investment options. The fees will vary depending on the underlying annuity and investment options selected. The additional fee for Legacy Protection Plus is as follows: Ages 55 or Younger 0.65%, Ages 56‐70 0.80%, Ages 71 and Older 0.95%. Annual benefit charges are determined at issue, subject to the terms outlined in the prospectus. Benefit charges are assessed against the death benefit value, deducted quarterly from the account value and taken pro‐rata across the permitted subaccounts. Charges paid during contract year of death will not be refunded and there will be no prorata roll‐up in the death benefit value. We reserve the right to deduct a final pro‐rated charge if terminated. Charges continue after the roll‐up cap is reached, and cease upon death or termination of the benefit. We reserve the right to increase the benefit charge up to the maximum of 1.50% upon any new election of the benefit or on/or after the fifth contract anniversary. If we increase your benefit charge on or after your fifth contract anniversary, you may terminate the benefit.

What are some of the other considerations that I need to think about when investing in various asset allocation portfolios offered by a variable annuity?

When purchasing an annuity it is important to remember that asset allocation does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss. Investment returns and the principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original investment. The value or price of a particular stock or other equity or equity‐related security owned by a portfolio could go down and you could lose money. Additionally, fixed income investments are subject to risk, including credit and interest rate risk. Because of these risks, subaccount's share value may fluctuate. If interest rates rise, bond prices usually decline. If interest rates decline, bond prices usually increase.

	Certain asset allocation portfolios may use leverage, short sales, and derivatives or engage in other speculative practices within their alternative investments. These practices include a high degree of risk and may increase the risk, size, and velocity of investment losses. Although certain alternative strategies seek to reduce risk by attempting to reduce correlation with equity and bond markets, no guarantee can be given that such efforts will be successful. The fees and expenses associated with alternative investments are generally higher than those for traditional investments. Lastly, diversification does not assure against loss in a declining market.


Optional death benefits may not be available in every state and may not be elected in conjunction with certain optional benefits. Optional benefits have certain investment, holding period, liquidity, and withdrawal limitations and restrictions. The benefit fees are in addition to fees and charges associated with the basic annuity.

More Information about Annuities





What exactly is an Annuity?

                        An annuity is an investment product that provides safe, tax-deferred growth of your
                        retirement nest egg. Annuities are considered low-risk, and can provide guaranteed, monthly
                        income when
                        you retire. There are many types of annuities with varying features & benefits. These include:
                        fixed,
                        variable, immediate, deferred & hybrid. We strongly suggest you consult with a financial
                        professional to
                        help you understand the various types of annuities before you purchase.
                    








Is an Annuity Right for You?

                        Annuities are NOT a good fit for everyone. Annuities are designed for people looking for
                        guaranteed, monthly income when they retire - they are NOT a high-risk / high-return investment.
                        They are considered to be in the mainstream of conservative retirement planning - over $225
                        billion in annuities have been purchased in the past 12 months alone!
                    








What are your Next Steps?

                        The first thing to do is to see if an annuity fits your specific profile and financial
                        situation. This "fit" is based on the amount of retirement savings you currently have, how old
                        you are, and the State you live in. Simply fill in the information above and our system will
                        generate a free, tailor-made Annuity Report that will include annuity rate quotes from A+ rated
                        companies in your area.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
