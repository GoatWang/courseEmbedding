Q&A With the Founder of PittMoss – PittMoss LLC – MediumHomepageSign in / Sign upPittMoss LLCBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingIt's time to grow a better way. Official Twitter Account for PittMoss® & PittMoss LLC.Dec 30, 2016Q&A With the Founder of PittMossSometimes there is nothing more inspiring then revisiting the beginnings of a company. Those seeds of genius, grit and passion are why we launched Mont’s Corner, a blog to share insights and inspiration from Mont Handley, the inventor and founder of PittMoss. To kick-off the first blog post, we wanted to catch up with Mont and learn about the history and mission of the company.Catch up with Mont Handley, founder and inventor of PittMoss, with our latest blog- Mont’s Corner.PittMoss (PM): Tell us a little bit about yourself? What got you interested in gardening and horticulture?Mont Handley (MH): My grandmother always had a big garden. One of my earliest memories was laying out old newspaper on the soil surface around all of the tomato and pepper plants to keep the weeds down. I always liked growing plants and saved money at my first job at the family ice-cream stand and bought a greenhouse at the age of twelve.PM: What inspired you to create PittMoss?MH: While working at a nursery in the Chicago suburbs, I became aware of the environmental issues associated with peat moss production in wetlands. I initially had the thought that someone should come up with an alternative to the truckloads of peat moss we sold every year. Once the thought struck that I could potentially use recycled newspaper as that alternative I began my experiments in an old hand-me-down food processor. I think that machine sits on a shelf in the PittMoss board room.Update- it still does!PM: What do you feel is the company’s most important mission?MH: Providing the very best, sustainable growing medium that we can to commercial growers and home gardeners.PM: Average consumers do not think much about what is in a typical bag of soil. Can you share some insight about why your gardening medium matters?MH: There are very few products that are beneficial to the health of the planet and PittMoss is beneficial in multiple ways. It replaces a product removed from wetlands, is made from cast off resources that would end up in a landfill, allows growers and home gardeners to use less resources and water, while reducing the need for chemical controls due to it’s sterile nature.PM: PittMoss is a manufactured product, can you explain why this is a benefit to the planet and gardeners?MH: Since peat moss is a product taken from wetlands it will contain weed seeds, mold spores and insect larva, which will need to be controlled, often times with chemicals. As a manufactured product, PittMoss is sterile and free of these pathogens so there is no need for the use of chemical agents. Also, those peatlands are drained to prepare for harvesting so the plants and animals in those habitats are displaced while the peat bog, which is a natural carbon sink, becomes a source of major carbon pollution.PM: PittMoss is made from recycled newspapers, why did you choose this resource? Is it harmful at all? We get this question a lot so I want to address it.MH:- Newspaper is a relatively clean source of cellulose and it is not harmful. Most people are concerned about the inks, but most heavy metal inks were eliminated decades ago and replaced with soy based inks, which are safe. The earliest independent research focused on the effects of newsprint on the plant matter. After putting the plant matter through a mass spectrometer no concerns were found.PM: What properties make PittMoss so powerful?MH: The dynamic growth plants experience growing in PittMoss is the result of the exceptional porosity, water and nutrient holding capacity of the medium. Cellulose looks like straws or penne pasta under a microscope. Those hollow tubules act like reservoirs for those resources that the plants use as needed for extended periods, while protecting the roots from excess moisture. Too much moisture on roots can cause root rot, while too little will cause plants to wilt. PittMoss is much more forgiving than other growing media as it allows gardeners or growers a few extra hours before wilt sets in if they forget to water.PM: One of the biggest benefits of PittMoss is it’s ability to increase biological activity- can you elaborate on this?MH: Cellulose is either like protein shakes or candy for the microbes found in the soil. It feeds their reproduction and activity, which leads to exchanges of gases and all sorts of good things happening at the roots of plants.PM: What is the one thing that surprised you about the product?MH: I’ll admit to being surprised by a grower, who hosted one of our earliest demonstration days after we built the proof of concept plant and were able to distribute more trial PittMoss. He’d been growing a very large crop in PittMoss and reported to the other commercial growers who had been invited that they were using 50% less water in their operations. He said if his employees once watered twice a day they were only watering once a day. Even though I knew the water retention was better, it was a great surprise to hear another, independent voice, highlight that benefit of the product.PM: What do you hope PittMoss can accomplish in the next five years?MH: I’d like to see PittMoss take a significant share of the commercial horticulture market and see a majority of landscape plants being grown in it. If one of the major big box retailers takes a stand to protect peatlands, then PittMoss is one of the few alternatives that can scale to meet that resulting need.Share2Never miss a story from PittMoss LLC, when you sign up for Medium.

    Our Story
  



The PittMoss®Story
The Early Years

PittMoss®started as a humble kitchen experiment in 1994 and quickly evolved into founder Mont Handley’s passionate, lifelong project. Soon after graduating from the kitchen to the garage, PittMoss® secured an EPA SBIR grant. This funded critical growth trials, providing the scientific evidence and the foundation for PittMoss® patents.
Further testing by Agronomy and Horticulture researchers at a major university evaluated:

Elemental composition
Water and nutrient retention characteristics and aeration capacity
Growth of plants cultivated in various PittMoss®/peat moss mixes
Elemental analysis of PittMoss®

Leachate testing for various nutrients
Elemental analysis of plant matter to determine uptake value

Researchers concluded that PittMoss® could be utilized extensively by commercial greenhouses and nurseries at a 50% replacement rate. Contact us to request the full report.
Between 2012 and 2015, PittMoss® went through a proof of concept phase in garages and small greenhouses on nights and weekends. With a perfected formula that replaced traditional growing substrates 100% in many crop trials, PittMoss® sparked the interest of Pittsburgh’s Idea Foundry, an incubator and early stage funder of entrepreneurial businesses. With a little “seed” money and professional mentoring and access to some much-needed resources, PittMoss LLC was on its way.
“It takes 20 years to become an overnight success.”
In 2015, PittMoss® was introduced to the investors on Shark Tank, ABC’s favorite reality show for would-be entrepreneurs. Mont Handley, with his unbridled passion for the idea he had nurtured for more than 20 years, convinced three of the “sharks” to invest in his company. Stay tuned to see how the PittMoss® story continues to unfold.
Today, PittMoss® is available to commercial greenhouses and nurseries from Michigan to Maine to North Carolina, with plans to grow!

                Thursday, Oct. 17, 2013 -- Mont Handley, president/CEO of PittMoss Development Corp., talks about the mix of organic additives and recycled paper that can replace peat moss in horticulture. It's his own mix and he said that it can help the environment by using PittMoss, Handley says. (Justine Coyne/Pittsburgh Business Times).

A Pittsburgh startup that counts three "Shark Tank" panelists, including Mt. Lebanon native Mark Cuban, among its investors has parted ways with its founder and top officer.
Mont Handley, who founded PittMoss LLC and created its namesake product, a peat moss substitute made from a mix of organic additives and recycled paper, is no longer president and CEO, confirmed Michael Matesic, an independent director of the Ambridge-based company.

File/Justine Coyne










 


“We are talking with an interim CEO who could be brought on as soon as next week,” said Matesic, who is CEO of Idea Foundry, an original investor in PittMoss. “The company is actively working to identify a replacement CEO.”




Matesic declined comment about Handley and the circumstances of the change. A call to Handley was not returned.
Handley had experimented with the food processor his mother gave him when he graduated from Purdue University to develop a sustainable alternative to peat moss, working on the project off and on for a couple of decades. PittMoss technically launched in 2011, but two years later, Handley quit his job as national sales director at VisionPittsburgh to focus on his startup full time.
In April 2015, Handley appeared on the ABC-TV reality show, “Shark Tank,” to pitch its wealthy entrepreneur panelists to invest in PittMoss, selling them on the potential of the product, which is used in soil mixtures, demonstrating superior growing outcomes while lowering costs. Atypically for the show, three — Cuban, Kevin O’Leary and Robert Herjavec — came in together. The sharks jointly contributed $600,000 in a funding round where PittMoss raised $1.5 million. The other investors were local — BlueTree Allied Angels, Idea Foundry, Angels with Attitude and Innovation Works.

A rolling stone gathers no moss, but a Pittsburgh company with a proprietary process to manufacture an alternative to peat moss has raised $1.2 million from investors.
PittMoss LLC, based in Ambridge, expects to use the money for working capital.

"We're expanding our production facility and our demonstration facility needs to be upgraded," CEO/Founder Mont Handley said.
The company currently employs four and expects to add six to 10 in the coming months as it increases daily production of its peat moss alternative from 1 ton to 10 tons to supply commercial growers and home gardeners, according to Handley.




The investors include BlueTree Allied Angels LLC, Idea Foundry, Innovation Works, independent investor Matthew Schneider and an unidentified super angel in Texas. BlueTree invested $560,000, CEO Catherine Mott confirmed.
Handley launched his company in 2011. PittMoss is used in soil mixtures. A sterile product that doesn't spoil and includes recycled materials including paper, it demonstrates superior growing outcomes while lowering costs.
