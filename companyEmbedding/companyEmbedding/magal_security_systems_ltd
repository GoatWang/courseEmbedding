Outsmart Burglars  the Moment You Plug It In





“I built SimpliSafe to make home security simpler and smarter. It uses advanced wireless technology, there’s no annual contracts, and it saves you hundreds. I’m proud of that.”
Chad Laurans, CEO & Chief Engineer

After his friends were robbed, Chad Laurans discovered a serious problem in the home security industry. You want your home to be safe, but alarm companies charge huge fees of $45 a month and lock you in long-term contracts. The demands are just too high.
So Chad Built Something New.
Relying on his electrical engineering degree from Yale and an MBA from Harvard, he designed an advanced home security system. He called it SimpliSafe.
Now it’s the fastest growing home security company in the nation. SimpliSafe won’t lock you in a long-term contract and 24/7 professional monitoring is only $14.99 a month.
Protect your home—the smart way. 










Award-Winning Home Security
Winner of CNET Editor’s Choice Award, Angie’s List Super Service Award, and A+ Rated by the Better Business Bureau.








Dave Ramsey, Personal Finance Expert:
“Protecting your family is important, but don’t ever sign a long-term contract. Do it the right way with SimpliSafe. These are the good guys!”





Joe Balog, Police Chief:
"My force used SimpliSafe to stop a serial burglary ring. It still helps us catch other criminals in the act today."





Unlike SimpliSafe, most burglar alarms are far too expensive, here’s why...



With so many people making a profit, they need to use sneaky tactics to extract money from you

They bait you with a “$99” offer though there’s typically $1,500 of hidden fees beneath the hood.
They lock you into 2-3 year contracts that contain fine print such as auto-renewal clauses. (Click to find out why the Government is considering making them illegal).
Their alarms use old wired technology and they’re hard to use (so you need to pay a service engineer for even the most straightforward task).




At SimpliSafe, There Are No Middlemen.
SimpliSafe has sliced out shady annual contracts, intrusive installations, and costly middlemen. We designed our system from scratch to give you everything you need in a security system plus some exciting bells and whistles. We sell direct to you, online. Our system is easy to self-install, and we pass the savings onto you with excellent equipment pricing and monthly monitoring for just $14.99/month.

 describes SimpliSafe alarms as

Many alarm companies have absolutely huge sneaky hidden fees. They advertise their alarms as being “from $99”, then they get you to sign a contract for over $1,000—and you can’t leave them for at least 3 years. But SimpliSafe alarms have no hidden charges.
We’re so confident you’ll love your SimpliSafe alarm that we’ll let you try it RISK-FREE with an incredible no-risk 60-day money back guarantee. SimpliSafe alarms are reliable, easy to use, have no annual contracts and
                no hidden costs.

9 Things to Avoid When Choosing A Traditional Alarm Company
We listened to all the things you dislike about traditional burglar alarm companies... then fixed them.




Traditional Alarm Company
SimpliSafe: a Better Way






                        Old wired technology. Traditional alarm companies 
                        want to put wires in your walls, because they know 
                        that ripping their wires out is hard and expensive.
                        



                        State-of-the-art 100% wireless technology. We 
                        took micro-chip technology and 
                        developed smarter software to offer you a robust 
                        and reliable security system. With wireless, there 
                        are no holes in your walls.
                        






                        Monitoring is $42.99 a month.
                        



                        Ours is just $14.99 a month. SimpliSafe protects your home 
                        with COPS Monitoring - named BEST MONITORING in the 
                        Industry by the Central Station Alarm Association.
                        





                        The moment you let them put a system into your home, you’re 
                        typically locked into a $1,547 contract with no way out.
                        



                        No annual contracts! Our customers stay with us because of 
                        our excellent product quality and helpful customer support.
                        





                        Auto-renewal clauses grab another $1,547 from you if you don’t 
                        cancel them within 90 days of the end of your three-year term. 
                        Forget to cancel? You’re legally trapped—there’s no way out.
                        




                        No hidden charges, no 
                        commitments, no sneaky tricks.
                        





                        Many frustrated customers (just google “alarm system 
                        complaints” or “alarm contract complaints” and see 
                        for yourself).
                    



                        Growing by word of mouth. See our Facebook fan page.
                        





                        Uses a phone line to connect to the monitoring center. 
                        Burglars sometimes cut phone lines.
                        



                        Uses its built-in and independent cellular connection, which is 
                        5-10 seconds faster, and is uncuttable. No phone line required.
                        





                        Prices are kept high because there are so many 
                        middlemen and salespeople involved.
                        



                        We don’t have expensive salespeople or middlemen. That’s 
                        how we can afford to keep our prices so low.
                        





                        Installation typically costs between $99 and $500. You’ll 
                        need to take a day off of work, while the installer drills 
                        holes in your walls.
                        



                        Set-up is easier than you could ever imagine. No tools 
                        needed, just adhesive pads. The unit actually talks to you 
                        while you’re setting it up. One of our customers purchased a 
                        second system for his daughter’s home and was “looking 
                        forward to the joy of installing it for her.” Watch our

                        easy installation video to see what he means.
                        

                        Does easy set-up mean the system is flimsy or less secure?  
                        No! Quite the opposite. No wires means there’s nothing for 
                        burglars to cut.
                        




                        As soon as you sign up, there’s no going back: 
                        you cannot cancel even if you try.

Nearly One Million Americans TrustSimpliSafe to Protect Them. Here’s Why:



Dennis R.
Amarillo, TX



This morning at 6:45 AM, my phone rang. It was the SimpliSafe operator, telling me that my alarm was going off. I had them call the police and they were there within minutes. The glass in the back door had been broken but the system worked perfectly and the intruders ran away. We only had to replace a small pane of glass.







Greg W.
Clarksville, TN



Our home was burglarized two weeks ago. I purchased a system that night and installed it within the week. Today, the thieves returned and the alarm scared them off. The officers were at my home within minutes. Nothing was taken.  SimpliSafe works.







Lauren B.
Tacoma, WA



We installed our system and within one week, the water sensor placed at our water heater set off the alarm. Sure enough, the T/P valve had opened on our water heater. The monitoring service alerted us in under 60 seconds. No water damage whatsoever! Way to go Simplisafe! Our system paid for itself that day.







Stephanie T.
Toledo, OH



I love my system. It saved us from thousands of dollars in damage when the power went out in our house in Northern Ohio on the coldest day in February (-17°!). The monitoring center alerted us in Florida that the power was out and the temperature in the house was dropping fast. We were able to contact an electrician to repair the problem. Without the system we never would have known and would have had major freeze damage.






SimpliSafe is recommended by ABC, Fox News, NBC & more!





















“No installation, no annual contracts, very smart.”






“Everything is included, and it’s portable so if you change apartments, you can just bring it with you.”






“David vs Goliath, SimpliSafe vs ADT: 
                SimpliSafe aims to upstage their larger 
                rivals by giving consumers what they really
                 want. Even without fancy marketing, word 
                 is spreading.”  see review








SimpliSafe is not for you if...


1
You have a HUGE home: If your home is larger than 20,000 
            square feet (about the size of a football field)—or if it has more 
            than 50 windows on the first floor—you would probably benefit 
            from a system that can handle a huge number of sensors. Our 
            advice would be to go to a traditional contract security company
            —and keep in mind the things we’ve warned you about.


2
You run a large commercial property such as a 
            shopping mall—you would probably benefit from a 
            system that has CCTV or security guards, in which 
            case you should probably go to one of the traditional 
            contract security companies—and keep in mind the 
            things we’ve warned you about.



However, if you’re one of the 95% of people who don’t run a large commercial property, then SimpliSafe is probably the best
            choice for you. If you’re in any doubt, contact one of our security consultants at 1-888-957-4675 for free friendly advice.

Most Alarms Have Two Dangerous Defects—SimpliSafe Doesn’t
Learn the Two Powerful Secrets for Stopping Intruders In Their Tracks:
				Most wireless alarm systems have a dangerous defect—if an intruder smashes the Keypad quickly enough, the police don’t get alerted. SimpliSafe has solved this problem: we took the brains of your system out of your keypad, and hid them in your Base Station.

This is the most affordable and comprehensive protection possible. 24/7 professional protection is just $14.99—with a free cellular connection built-in!
Most alarm companies charge you over $30, $40 or sometimes $50 every month…for the exact same level of monitoring.

You can cancel at any time

SimpliSafe is the ONLY alarm company that gives you the freedom to subscribe to our monitoring service for as long as you want and cancel at any time, without any termination fees or hassles. You pay $14.99 per month and that’s it.

Please note: While SimpliSafe has no annual contracts, all our monitored customers sign a Terms of Service.





SimpliSafe is There...Even When the Lights Go Out


Never fear a power outage or electricity failure again. SimpliSafe runs on powerful lithium batteries that last 5 years—so you stay secure when the electricity fails. Plus, the Base Station comes equipped with a built-in rechargeable backup battery, which can power your system for 24 hours and be recharged at any time.


Customer Review: Donald Meehan
“I have had my system for about 6 weeks now my wife and I love it. We just lost power for four days, I took the base to my in-laws and recharged it twice. It worked great during the power outage. I spoke to some neighbors who have also recently got alarms with other companies, they were very upset because their system died pretty quickly and were not able to recharge it.”









You’ll Save Up to 20% on Home Insurance With this Certificate


Home insurance companies know the value of professional alarm monitoring. That’s why you will save 5% to 20% on your insurance premiums when your protect your home with SimpliSafe monitoring!
With savings that great, your professional alarm monitoring might even pay for itself. Over 100,000 SimpliSafe customers are saving money on their insurance premiums! These are just a small sample of the insurance companies we work with:













Firefighters Straight to your Door


When a fire is burning in your home every second counts. SimpliSafe smoke detectors are built with photoelectric sensors for faster detection of a fire before it breaks into a flame, giving you and your family more time to get up and out of your home. Photoelectric sensors like ours are less likely to trigger annoying false alarms.
Never worry about sleeping through a fire alarm. This monitored detector will sound its own internal siren as well as trigger the full security system alarm.






Our competitor’s model sells for $79.99. Ours is $29.99. How do we sell the highest quality sensors at half the price? No middlemen.






Extreme Range—and Fully Customizable for Your Home





SimpliSafe sensors have a huge range of 400 ft., so our system is perfect for homes and businesses of any size (unless you live in the Superdome).
Some alarm companies make it almost impossible to personalize your alarm for your home. Every SimpliSafe alarm system is 100% customizable to meet your home’s unique needs. Our systems support up to 41 sensors—you can add more at any time via our online security shop or with a quick call to our friendly support team.





Smart Sensors Never Mistake Pets for Burglars


SimpliSafe uses more precise motion sensors to ensure your pets won’t trigger your alarms. Simply place your motion sensors where your pets can’t fiddle with them, and your cats or dogs can comfortably play at home without triggering an alarm.

It’s Easier Than Ever to Test Your Sensors

It’s easy to make sure your pets won’t set off your alarm with SimpliSafe’s unique Test Mode. And our security specialists are available for a consultation if you’re having trouble finding the right position!

Homeowners with big pets love this trick

Normally, the Motion Sensor looks straight out and down towards the ground. If your pet is triggering the sensor, just place it about 4-5 feet above ground level, and turn it upside down! This way, your pet can’t trigger it, but an intruder will!








Moving is Easier than Ever—Fully Portable Alarms





All SimpliSafe Equipment will fit a new home quickly and easily. Moving to a larger place? No problem. Order extra sensors anytime

Simple Re-Installation

We include extra 3M command strips in every box, making it easy for you to move sensors to a new home. These adhesive strips are super strong, but are also engineered to pull off cleanly without damaging your walls.





Total Security— Exceptional Savings



CNET calls SimpliSafe “better, smarter home security...you’ll have a hard time finding a better option at a better price.” Here’s why:
We protect your home 24 hours a day with a state-of-the-art security system, professional alarm monitoring, and instant police dispatch. Your security system is so effective that actual Wisconsin police uses it to catch criminals. We use COPS monitoring—winner of CSAA’s Best-in-Industry Monitoring.
...and it’s only 14.99/month Compare that to the $50/month most other companies charge. That adds up to savings of over $500 every year.

100% Satisfaction Guaranteed

We at Simplisafe are committed to providing you with 
		   only the best products and services. Our goal is to 
			make your life safer and easier. If you are in any way 
			unsatisfied with your SimpliSafe product or service,

		   a replacement part, completely free of charge. We can afford 
		   to offer this because our components are so reliable.







What is an “auto-renewal clause” anyway?
Most alarm companies have an automatic renewal clause in their monitoring and service contract (and use teeny tiny font). This means that your contract will be renewed for anywhere from 12 months to three years, unless you cancel by mail within 30 days before the end of your contract. Many of the nationwide and local alarm companies use this tactic. Cancelling early usually involves a penalty of 75% to 100% of the value of the contract. 

SimpliSafe offers monthly alarm monitoring. There are no contracts to sign, so there’s no fear of getting tricked by fine print and hidden fees. You can cancel your SimpliSafe alarm monitoring anytime by simply giving us a call.

"SimpliSafe security system is inexpensive, transportable..."








"All the bells and whistles for a lot less money"








SimpliSafe is our idea of not getting robbed.








"Some things can keep you tethered to landline service, such as your home's security system. Not so with SimpliSafe Inc."








SimpliSafe was featured in Elle Decor's top punchlist.








"This ingenious security system uses wireless technology..."








I really like the SimpliSafe security system for its easy setup, expandability, custom setup options and ability to move with you if you relocate. I think the price for the system is really affordable when you compare it to other security systems on the market. It gets a thumbs up from me.








SimpliSafe offers wireless, plug-and-play security for urban dwellers—increasingly being used in the era of disappearing land lines.








Wireless Wonders: SimpliSafe is an affordable, but full-featured, wireless security system similar to the expensive, professionally installed ones.








"David vs Goliath, SimpliSafe  vs ADT: SimpliSafe aims to upstage their larger rivals by giving consumers what they really want. Even without fancy marketing, word is spreading."








Security Doesn't Get Any Easier. Setup took less than 15 minutes from start to finish and drastically improved my peace of mind.









Rating: Strong Recommend (the highest rating). "This is a system anyone could setup in under 30 minutes." See full review  
If you've got a car alarm, using the SimpliSafe home security system will come as naturally and easily.

Motion Sensor
(always on the lookout)



Full Room Coverage
Detects motion within 30 feet. The sensor has a “field of vision” of 90 degrees, giving you a full 
			range of coverage when placed in a corner. 
Flexible Install
The sensor is shaped to stand on a shelf, adhere to a wall, or fit in a corner for maximum room 
			coverage. Set the sensor to be active only in “away” mode (so that you won’t trigger it when you’re 
			at home) or both “home” and “away” modes (for rooms that you want covered with a motion 
			sensor while you’re home).
Pet Friendly
Your dogs and cats under 50 lbs won’t trigger the alarm. We’ve designed the sensor to be less
			sensitive to motion close to the ground.

SimpliSafe Works Even If the Keypad is Destroyed


Away mode:
When you go out,  this activates all  sensors.
Home mode:
When you come home,  this deactivates motion detectors but protects  windows and doors



(dimensions: 6.5 x 3.5 in.)




Problem: Most wireless alarm systems have an Achilles heel—if a burglar
		  smashes the keypad quickly enough, the police don’t get alerted.
Solution: SimpliSafe took the “brains” out of the Keypad and put them into a
		  separate Base Station, which is hidden somewhere in your home or office building. When an alarm is triggered, the Keypad beeps to distract burglars.
Meanwhile, the Base Station stays quiet while it alerts the monitoring
			  service (which takes just a few seconds). Once the alert has been safely
			  sent, the Base Station will blast its sirens.
Unlike other wireless security systems, if a SimpliSafe keypad is
			smashed, the alarm continues to function.
















Works with Nest requires ourInteractive Monitoring Plan





Nest Learning Thermostat




			The Nest Learning Thermostat programs itself, automatically saves 
			energy when you’re away, and can be controlled using your phone. In 
			independent studies, Nest Thermostat saved an average of 10-12% on 
			heating bills and 15% on cooling bills. That means it can pay for itself
			 in under two years.
		  


			SimpliSafe helps your Nest Thermostat know when you’re home or 
			away. When you arm SimpliSafe to leave home, SimpliSafe tells Nest 
			Thermosat, so Nest Thermostat knows it’s time to lower your energy 
			use. When you come home and disarm SimpliSafe, Nest Thermostat 
			knows you’re back and makes home cozy.
		  














(dimensions: 3 x 1.25 in.)




Closed: Less than 2 in. between the magnet and  the grooves of the  sensor.



Open: More than 2 in. between the magnet and the grooves on the sensor.











Entry Sensors
(defend your windows and doors)



Easy to install on every type of door or window
The magnet goes on the door or window, and the sensor goes on the  frame (or vice 
		 versa).  Magnet can be placed up to 2 inches from the  sensor, so sensors fit on all types of 
		 doors and windows. SimpliSafe sensors come with the battery pre-installed and adhesive 
	   tape  pre-applied, making installation a snap.
Door Chime
When your system is OFF and a door or window opens, the Base Station will sound a 
		door-chime so you’ll know if someone is entering.
How does it work?
The sensor detects whenever the magnet moves more than two inches away from 
		it- so it knows whenever the door or  window opens.






 Our competitor’s model sells for $34.00. Ours is $14.99. How do we  sell the highest
	quality sensors at half the price? No middlemen.















The Base Station
(the brains of your system)



The base is Plug-and-Play: Plug it in and it will locate  and
control all of your sensors, making SimpliSafe  the easiest security system in the world to install.
It’s also responsible for sending all your alarm signals  to our 24/7 alarm monitoring center. Your Base
Station  will arrive equipped with the same cellular technology  that’s in your cellphone: Inside there is a SIM card that  gets activated when you subscribe to our alarm  monitoring
service. If you’re subscribed to our  Interactive Monitoring Plan, it will also
send you SMS  text Smart Alerts & Secret Alerts.

Built-in 85 Decibel Siren
Voice Prompts guide you  through installation.
Cellular Technology: No  Phoneline needed for 24/7 alarm  monitoring! However, if you want 
redundancy, you can also plug in  your phoneline or use an internet  connection.
41 Sensor Capacity: Get all the  sensors you need to protect any
home, large or small.
Backup Battery lasts up to 24 hours  during a power outage. Base Station 
will recharge them once the power  is restored to your home.

105dB Extra Siren
(the burglar blaster)



This 105 decibel siren will feel like sitting in the front row of an ear-piercing rock
		  concert. Get two or more and your entire neighborhood will peek out of their windows.
		  This siren will ensure any foolish burglar knows you’re protected. Look out, burglar -
		  the sheriff’s in town.


Weather resistant for outdoor use

Easily mounts under an eave outside or adhere to a wall inside

Panic Button
(instantly trigger your alarm)



Emergency Alert
Pressing the panic button will instantly trigger the alarm and our monitoring center will
		  call to check if you’re okay. If you don’t answer the phone or don’t give your “safe word”
		  when you answer, we’ll alert the police that you’re in danger.
Silent Panic
If you are a retail or business customer, we can program your system to activate a “silent
		  panic” feature for you, allowing you to signal for help without alerting the intruder.



















(dimensions: 3 x 1.6 in.)






Water Sensors
(stop damage from leaks & floods)



Your Water Sensor will trigger an audible alarm whenever it comes into contact with water.  Our
		  alarm monitoring plans offer additional options to get an phone call and SMS/email alert of any
		  water alarms. 
Why do I need this?
Flood damage is the most common Home Insurance claim, and it’s certainly one of the most
		  expensive. Place it near major plumbing to detect breaks or in the attic to detect a leaky
		  roof.  Undetected floods and leaks can lead to nasty mold infestations, ruined carpets, warped
		  wood floors, and damaged cabinetry and more.

Freeze Sensors
(Prevents burst pipes)



The freeze sensor will trigger an alarm if the temperature in your  home falls below 41°. Our alarm monitoring plans also give you the  options to get:  


A phone call and SMS/Email in the even of a freeze alarm.

Access to hourly readings of your home’s temperature in the Online Command Center.


Why do I need this?
If you have a vacation home, this sensor is worth it’s weight in gold if it saves you from repairing expensive burst pipes. It’s also a perfect device  for protecting precious objects like instruments, paintings and plants in a climate controlled room.
















(height: 3 in.)






Glassbreak Sensor
(Detects the sound of smashing glass)




		If a burglar breaks a window in order to enter your home, this Glassbreak Sensor will detect the sound and trigger your burglar alarm. Pair it with a Motion Detector in any rooms on the first floor that have multiple windows.

Smoke Detector
(firefighters straight to your door)



When a fire is quickening in your home every second counts.  SimpliSafe Smoke
		  detectors are built with photoelectric sensors for increased safety over Ionization
		  sensors. Photoelectric smoke detectors respond faster (typically 30 minutes or
		  more) to fire in its early, smouldering stage before it breaks into flame, giving you
		  and your family more time to get up and out of your home. Photoelectric sensors
		  are also less likely to trigger annoying false alarms.
Never worry about sleeping through a fire alarm.  This monitored smoke detector
		  will sound its own internal siren as well as trigger a full-blown security system
		  alarm.
In addition alarm monitoring plans give you the options to receive: 


A call to alert you and firefighters sent to your home to ensure you and
			  your family are safe.

SMS & Email Notifications automatically sent to your phone and to the
			  phones of loved ones.

















(height: 5in.)






Carbon Monoxide Detector
(sniff out deadly gas leaks)



Carbon Monoxide is a gas that you cannot see, smell or taste. Deaths due to CO
		 poisoning most often occur at night, when  everyone is sleeping. SimpliSafe’s CO
		 detector uses  electrochemical sensing technology for highly accurate and early
		 detection of this invisible but deadly gas.
Dangerous levels of CO will trigger both the sensor’s internal  audible alarm and 
		  the siren in your SimpliSafe security system.
Our alarm monitoring plans give you the option to receive:  


A call to alert you and emergency responders sent to
			  your home to ensure you and your family are safe.

SMS & Email notifications automatically sent to your
			  phone and to the phones of loved ones.

Listen to Dave's Words:
                        





                    “Protecting your family is important, but don’t ever sign a
                    long-term contract. Do it the right way with SimpliSafe. They
                    are the good guys.” -Dave Ramsey,  Financial Expert











                    “All the bells and whistles for a lot less.”
                    









                    “David vs Goliath, SimpliSafe vs ADT: SimpliSafe aims to
                    upstage their larger rivals by giving consumers what they
                    really want. Even without fancy marketing, word is spreading.”
                    









                    “Some things can keep you tethered to landline service, such
                    as your home’s security system. Not so with SimpliSafe.”

9 Things to Avoid When Choosing A Traditional Alarm Company
We listened to all the things you dislike about traditional burglar alarm companies... then fixed them.




Traditional Alarm Company
SimpliSafe: a Better Way






                        Old wired technology. Traditional alarm companies 
                        want to put wires in your walls, because they know 
                        that ripping their wires out is hard and expensive.
                        



                        State-of-the-art 100% wireless technology. We 
                        took micro-chip technology and

                        and reliable security system. With wireless, there 
                        are no holes in your walls.
                        






                        Monitoring is $42.99 a month.
                        



                        Ours is just $14.99 a month. SimpliSafe protects your home 
                        with COPS Monitoring - named BEST MONITORING in the 
                        Industry by the Central Station Alarm Association.
                        





                        The moment you let them put a system into your home, you’re 
                        typically locked into a $1,547 contract with no way out.
                        



                        No annual contracts! Our customers stay with us because of 
                        our excellent product quality and helpful customer support.
                        





                        Auto-renewal clauses grab another $1,547 from you if you don’t 
                        cancel them within 90 days of the end of your three-year term. 
                        Forget to cancel? You’re legally trapped—there’s no way out.
                        




                        No hidden charges, no 
                        commitments, no sneaky tricks.
                        





                        Many frustrated customers (just google “alarm system 
                        complaints” or “alarm contract complaints” and see 
                        for yourself).

                        Uses a phone line to connect to the monitoring center. 
                        Burglars sometimes cut phone lines.
                        



                        Uses its built-in and independent cellular connection, which is 
                        5-10 seconds faster, and is uncuttable. No phone line required.
                        





                        Prices are kept high because there are so many 
                        middlemen and salespeople involved.
                        



                        We don’t have expensive salespeople or middlemen. That’s 
                        how we can afford to keep our prices so low.
                        





                        Installation typically costs between $99 and $500. You’ll 
                        need to take a day off of work, while the installer drills 
                        holes in your walls.
                        



                        Set-up is easier than you could ever imagine. No tools 
                        needed, just adhesive pads. The unit actually talks to you 
                        while you’re setting it up. One of our customers purchased a 
                        second system for his daughter’s home and was “looking 
                        forward to the joy of installing it for her.” Watch our

                        easy installation video to see what he means.
                        

                        Does easy set-up mean the system is flimsy or less secure?  
                        No! Quite the opposite. No wires means there’s nothing for 
                        burglars to cut.

SimpliSafe is recommended by ABC, Fox News, NBC & more!





















“No installation, no annual contracts, very smart.”






“Everything is included, and it’s portable so if you change apartments, you can just bring it with you.”






“David vs Goliath, SimpliSafe vs ADT: 
                SimpliSafe aims to upstage their larger 
                rivals by giving consumers what they really
                 want. Even without fancy marketing, word 
                 is spreading.”  see review








SimpliSafe is not for you if...


1
You have a HUGE home: If your home is larger than 20,000 
            square feet (about the size of a football field)—or if it has more 
            than 50 windows on the first floor—you would probably benefit 
            from a system that can handle a huge number of sensors. Our 
            advice would be to go to a traditional contract security company
            —and keep in mind the things we’ve warned you about.


2
You run a large commercial property such as a 
            shopping mall—you would probably benefit from a 
            system that has CCTV or security guards, in which 
            case you should probably go to one of the traditional 
            contract security companies—and keep in mind the 
            things we’ve warned you about.



However, if you’re one of the 95% of people who don’t run a large commercial property, then SimpliSafe is probably the best
            choice for you. If you’re in any doubt, contact one of our security consultants at 1-888-957-4675 for free friendly advice.

I spoke to some neighbors who have also recently got alarms with other companies, they were very upset because their system died pretty quickly and were not able to recharge it.”

Home security systems
Home security is not a subject to be taken lightly. You put a lot of time and effort into purchasing, building, and decorating a home – now it’s time to protect your investment. With a wide variety of home security systems to choose from, you can get peace of mind knowing your family and valuables are being protected in exactly the way you want. Think you’re ready for a home security system? Complete the form above to get free quotes from local pros.

        Alarm system installation
Home security alarm systems help offer protection against burglary and other unwanted intrusions. With the latest technology, you can even choose between a hardwired or wireless alarm. Alarms usually require a keypad and control panel. They’re available in both hardwired and wireless options.

        Equipment options
With all the brands and tech options on the market, your home security equipment can be as minimal or robust as you’d like. The best way to decide what you need is to talk to home security companies about their package and a la carte offerings. There’s a huge range of equipment choices from installing a camera to having a smart lock on your door to 24-hour monitoring and motion detectors.

        Cameras
Installing a camera is a one of the basic equipment options you’ll encounter, so it’s important to know how extensive or minimal you might want your camera system to be. Looking into some of the most popular brands, figuring out which entry points in your home you may want monitored, and deciding if an indoor or outdoor camera would be better for you are some good first steps into researching your camera needs.

        How to get started
Once you’ve done your online research, we recommend talking to a few security companies to see what they think you need for your home’s size and location. This will also help you nail down how best to work within your budget while getting everything you need for your home security. They can walk you through equipment recommendations (like alarm types and cameras) as well as answer all your questions. If you’re considering purchasing a home security system, complete the above form to review free quotes from local professionals.

Home security systems
Home security is not a subject to be taken lightly. You put a lot of time and effort into purchasing, building, and decorating a home – now it’s time to protect your investment. With a wide variety of home security systems to choose from, you can get peace of mind knowing your family and valuables are being protected in exactly the way you want. Think you’re ready for a home security system? Complete the form above to get free quotes from local pros.

        Alarm system installation
Home security alarm systems help offer protection against burglary and other unwanted intrusions. With the latest technology, you can even choose between a hardwired or wireless alarm. Alarms usually require a keypad and control panel. They’re available in both hardwired and wireless options.

        Equipment options
With all the brands and tech options on the market, your home security equipment can be as minimal or robust as you’d like. The best way to decide what you need is to talk to home security companies about their package and a la carte offerings. There’s a huge range of equipment choices from installing a camera to having a smart lock on your door to 24-hour monitoring and motion detectors.

        Cameras
Installing a camera is a one of the basic equipment options you’ll encounter, so it’s important to know how extensive or minimal you might want your camera system to be. Looking into some of the most popular brands, figuring out which entry points in your home you may want monitored, and deciding if an indoor or outdoor camera would be better for you are some good first steps into researching your camera needs.

        How to get started
Once you’ve done your online research, we recommend talking to a few security companies to see what they think you need for your home’s size and location. This will also help you nail down how best to work within your budget while getting everything you need for your home security. They can walk you through equipment recommendations (like alarm types and cameras) as well as answer all your questions. If you’re considering purchasing a home security system, complete the above form to review free quotes from local professionals.

Borders
 
 The 21st Century brings with it more intense and constant threats, as well as the pressure of potential terrorist attacks, increased crime rates and anti-government protests as a result of national and localized issues. It is a small world and getting more condensed every day.
A major concern of most countries is the integrity of their national borders against illegal immigration, smuggling, hostile invasion and the movement of terrorists.
Protecting borders by Intrusion Detection Systems is unavoidable, especially in specific areas susceptible to illegal intrusions. There are a few common requirements for any border intrusion detection solution:
Very low FAR / NAR (False Alarm / Nuisance Rate) is mandatory; first responders are typically spread very thinly along the border; they cannot afford to be alerted in vain.
Very high PD – although the extent of this requirement may vary based on the level of threat, it can only vary between very high PD to very very high PD

Inherent robustness to sustain the environmental challenges – winter, wind, water, salty environment along seashores, noisy EMI / RFI (Electro-Magnetic / Radio Frequency Interference) environment, etc.

Low dependency on infrastructure and accessibility: power may not be available or expensive; communication lines, if available, may be with limited bandwidth; access to the fence / detectors may be blocked due to vegetation; lack of paved road
All the above impose strict requirements on reliability / maintainability and, robustness. And indeed Magal S3 has developed some products with exceptional performance. As an example the DTR tout wire system has a guaranteed detection probability with less than one (1) alarm per one (1) Km per three (3) months. But the specific solution may vary significantly from region to region pending threats, culture and operational concerns.
    


Tailored Solutions to different customer

The US SBInet (Secure Border Initiative) project failure has only confirmed that “one-size-fits-all” hardly fits any security application and definitely is not applicable for securing borders.Here are a few examples of tailored solutions:

West European is characterized by perceived limited national defense threats but with the focus on illegal immigration, drugs smuggling with emphasis and awareness to aesthetics. Therefore physical barriers are the least preferred solution. Virtual fences / volumetric sensors are the best fit: buried cable, microwave and even radars are the backbone of the solution; CCTV day / night / short or long range cameras should augment the solution by a verification layer;PSIM (FORTIS 4G), communication and smart first respond force is crucial to complement the solution.

The Middle East related borders are mainly affected by fundamental homeland security concerns, where every intruder may be a potential ticking time-bomb. This is the classic region for taut wire or high security fences with smart detectors. Radars, short or long range cameras, PSIM (FORTIS 4G) and vehicle personnel should complement any solution.

Populated areas where the border is right on the edge of a city may need to deploy a physical high wall or fence. Early warning is almost useless, since any sensor will be saturated by the level of non hostile noise on the other side. If the barrier already exists, adding Fence Mounted Sensors would turn it into a smart barrier with a minor investment, yielding Instantaneous reliable automatic alert in real time and in any weather and lighting conditions. Naturally verification sensors must be deployed when immediate response is not practical.

Protecting a border crossing may include an array of mobile and thermal cameras, people tracking & inspection devises based on RFID technology, access & gate control, wireless information broadcast for personnel and vehicles, all managed by Magal S3′s FORTIS Command & Control system. 

Magal proven track record in securing borders
Magal S3 has a proven track record of solving all of these needs in several regions around the world, with the ability to maintain excellent reliability, low maintenance and affordable life-cycle costs with no environmental limitations.

Environmental friendliness has also become a major concern along the last few years; any solution should consider wildlife and aesthetics. See also whitepaper on Green Technology

Solutions are a compromise between the level and kinds of threats, environmental concerns and the available budget; yet they are equally influenced by culture, concept of operation, legal aspects and very importantly – terrain.

About Magal
Company Overview
Executive Management
Board of Directors
International Standards
Corporate Governance 




Magal S3 is a leading international provider of integrated solutions and products for physical and cyber security, safety and site management.
Magal was established in 1965 as a branch of the Israeli Aerospace Industry focused on developing smart fences for security; 15 years later Magal was floated and privatized and had its IPO on NASDAQ on 1993.

In 2013 Magal acquired CyberSeal, which became its cyber business arm, pioneering the concept of providing cyber security products for ICS (Industrial Control Systems).

Magal holds fifteen branches worldwide, with two of them serving as main operation centers; one of the sites owns the largest private test rangein the world for outdoor security technology.
Magal's unique business proposition
The core capability of Magal is PIDS technology (Perimeter Intrusion Detection System); Magal is the number one leader in this market. Yet, along the years, Magal transformed its business and is now focused on delivering full security solutions for critical sites. These include seaports, airports, Utilities, oil & gas facilities, industrial sites, prisons, etc. 
Magal's flexible business model enables it to support all the various levels of the security supply chain:

End users - by delivering turnkey solutions
Tier 1 system integrators and contractors - by delivering the core security solution, complementing their project offering
and the system integrators by supplying PIDS and cyber products to complement their solutions

Magal's In-house Capabilities 
In order to support our flexible model we had to develop a wide range of internal competencies:

In-house Software capability to develop our products and in order to be able to tailor solutions with fully integrated third party systems
Project delivery capabilities - from concept, through design, integration, installation, commissioning and through life support
Cyber knowhow - in house expertise to enable us to deliver products and full cyber security solutions to critical sites

An Israeli security company is making a push in Washington this week to help build Donald Trump’s Mexican border wall following the U.S. president’s praise of Israel’s success in boosting security by fencing off its frontiers.Shares of Yehud, Israel-based Magal Security Systems Ltd. jumped 5.6 percent on Jan. 27, the day after Trump told Fox News a security barrier could almost completely stop border breaches. The company’s shares have risen nearly 50 percent since Trump’s election.

Executives from Magal’s U.S.-based Senstar unit will show off its FiberPatrol product at a Jan. 31 conference on border security. Officials from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and other agencies will talk to the gathering of defense contractors in Alexandria, Virginia, according to Magal Chief Executive Officer Saar Koursh. The system, which embeds fiber-optic sensors in long stretches of fences and walls, is already used for perimeter security at airports and seaports around the world, he said.Saar KourshSource: Magal Security Systems Ltd.




“We have the right product and we have the experience in Israel that helps in showcasing our product,” Koursh said in a telephone interview Jan. 26.Magal was a major contractor on Israel’s West Bank barrier, a stretch of sensor-laden fences and concrete walls that was begun in 2002 to counter a wave of Palestinian suicide-bombings. The company has also helped build a fence along Israel’s border with Egypt, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presented on Saturday as an example for Trump’s Mexican wall.“President Trump is right,” Netanyahu said on Twitter. “I built a wall along Israel’s southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea.”






President Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel's southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea ð®ð±ðºð¸— Benjamin Netanyahu (@netanyahu) January 28, 2017


That intervention prompted a statement of “profound surprise, rejection and disappointment” from Mexico’s Foreign Ministry.Netanyahu was referring to Israel’s “specific security experience which we are willing to share,” Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon said later on Twitter. “We do not express a position on U.S.-Mexico relations.”




In the interview with Fox News, Trump said a wall would be effective in preventing illegal immigration from Mexico. “All you have to do is ask Israel,” ,” he said. “They were having a total disaster coming across, and they had a wall. It’s 99.9 percent stoppage.”Palestinians say much of the West Bank barrier intrudes on private land and refer to it as an “apartheid wall.” In an advisory opinion, the International Court of Justice said in 2004 that portions of the project built in occupied territory were illegal.

Outsmart Burglars  the Moment You Plug It In





“I built SimpliSafe to make home security simpler and smarter. It uses advanced wireless technology, there’s no annual contracts, and it saves you hundreds. I’m proud of that.”
Chad Laurans, CEO & Chief Engineer

After his friends were robbed, Chad Laurans discovered a serious problem in the home security industry. You want your home to be safe, but alarm companies charge huge fees of $45 a month and lock you in long-term contracts. The demands are just too high.
So Chad Built Something New.
Relying on his electrical engineering degree from Yale and an MBA from Harvard, he designed an advanced home security system. He called it SimpliSafe.
Now it’s the fastest growing home security company in the nation. SimpliSafe won’t lock you in a long-term contract and 24/7 professional monitoring is only $14.99 a month.
Protect your home—the smart way. 










Award-Winning Home Security
Winner of CNET Editor’s Choice Award, Angie’s List Super Service Award, and A+ Rated by the Better Business Bureau.








Dave Ramsey, Personal Finance Expert:
“Protecting your family is important, but don’t ever sign a long-term contract. Do it the right way with SimpliSafe. These are the good guys!”





Joe Balog, Police Chief:
"My force used SimpliSafe to stop a serial burglary ring. It still helps us catch other criminals in the act today."





Unlike SimpliSafe, most burglar alarms are far too expensive, here’s why...



With so many people making a profit, they need to use sneaky tactics to extract money from you

They bait you with a “$99” offer though there’s typically $1,500 of hidden fees beneath the hood.
They lock you into 2-3 year contracts that contain fine print such as auto-renewal clauses. (Click to find out why the Government is considering making them illegal).
Their alarms use old wired technology and they’re hard to use (so you need to pay a service engineer for even the most straightforward task).




At SimpliSafe, There Are No Middlemen.
SimpliSafe has sliced out shady annual contracts, intrusive installations, and costly middlemen. We designed our system from scratch to give you everything you need in a security system plus some exciting bells and whistles. We sell direct to you, online. Our system is easy to self-install, and we pass the savings onto you with excellent equipment pricing and monthly monitoring for just $14.99/month.

 describes SimpliSafe alarms as

Many alarm companies have absolutely huge sneaky hidden fees. They advertise their alarms as being “from $99”, then they get you to sign a contract for over $1,000—and you can’t leave them for at least 3 years. But SimpliSafe alarms have no hidden charges.
We’re so confident you’ll love your SimpliSafe alarm that we’ll let you try it RISK-FREE with an incredible no-risk 60-day money back guarantee. SimpliSafe alarms are reliable, easy to use, have no annual contracts and
                no hidden costs.

9 Things to Avoid When Choosing A Traditional Alarm Company
We listened to all the things you dislike about traditional burglar alarm companies... then fixed them.




Traditional Alarm Company
SimpliSafe: a Better Way






                        Old wired technology. Traditional alarm companies 
                        want to put wires in your walls, because they know 
                        that ripping their wires out is hard and expensive.
                        



                        State-of-the-art 100% wireless technology. We 
                        took micro-chip technology and 
                        developed smarter software to offer you a robust 
                        and reliable security system. With wireless, there 
                        are no holes in your walls.
                        






                        Monitoring is $42.99 a month.
                        



                        Ours is just $14.99 a month. SimpliSafe protects your home 
                        with COPS Monitoring - named BEST MONITORING in the 
                        Industry by the Central Station Alarm Association.
                        





                        The moment you let them put a system into your home, you’re 
                        typically locked into a $1,547 contract with no way out.
                        



                        No annual contracts! Our customers stay with us because of 
                        our excellent product quality and helpful customer support.
                        





                        Auto-renewal clauses grab another $1,547 from you if you don’t 
                        cancel them within 90 days of the end of your three-year term. 
                        Forget to cancel? You’re legally trapped—there’s no way out.
                        




                        No hidden charges, no 
                        commitments, no sneaky tricks.
                        





                        Many frustrated customers (just google “alarm system 
                        complaints” or “alarm contract complaints” and see 
                        for yourself).
                    



                        Growing by word of mouth. See our Facebook fan page.
                        





                        Uses a phone line to connect to the monitoring center. 
                        Burglars sometimes cut phone lines.
                        



                        Uses its built-in and independent cellular connection, which is 
                        5-10 seconds faster, and is uncuttable. No phone line required.
                        





                        Prices are kept high because there are so many 
                        middlemen and salespeople involved.
                        



                        We don’t have expensive salespeople or middlemen. That’s 
                        how we can afford to keep our prices so low.
                        





                        Installation typically costs between $99 and $500. You’ll 
                        need to take a day off of work, while the installer drills 
                        holes in your walls.
                        



                        Set-up is easier than you could ever imagine. No tools 
                        needed, just adhesive pads. The unit actually talks to you 
                        while you’re setting it up. One of our customers purchased a 
                        second system for his daughter’s home and was “looking 
                        forward to the joy of installing it for her.” Watch our

                        easy installation video to see what he means.
                        

                        Does easy set-up mean the system is flimsy or less secure?  
                        No! Quite the opposite. No wires means there’s nothing for 
                        burglars to cut.
                        




                        As soon as you sign up, there’s no going back: 
                        you cannot cancel even if you try.

Nearly One Million Americans TrustSimpliSafe to Protect Them. Here’s Why:



Dennis R.
Amarillo, TX



This morning at 6:45 AM, my phone rang. It was the SimpliSafe operator, telling me that my alarm was going off. I had them call the police and they were there within minutes. The glass in the back door had been broken but the system worked perfectly and the intruders ran away. We only had to replace a small pane of glass.







Greg W.
Clarksville, TN



Our home was burglarized two weeks ago. I purchased a system that night and installed it within the week. Today, the thieves returned and the alarm scared them off. The officers were at my home within minutes. Nothing was taken.  SimpliSafe works.







Lauren B.
Tacoma, WA



We installed our system and within one week, the water sensor placed at our water heater set off the alarm. Sure enough, the T/P valve had opened on our water heater. The monitoring service alerted us in under 60 seconds. No water damage whatsoever! Way to go Simplisafe! Our system paid for itself that day.







Stephanie T.
Toledo, OH



I love my system. It saved us from thousands of dollars in damage when the power went out in our house in Northern Ohio on the coldest day in February (-17°!). The monitoring center alerted us in Florida that the power was out and the temperature in the house was dropping fast. We were able to contact an electrician to repair the problem. Without the system we never would have known and would have had major freeze damage.






SimpliSafe is recommended by ABC, Fox News, NBC & more!





















“No installation, no annual contracts, very smart.”






“Everything is included, and it’s portable so if you change apartments, you can just bring it with you.”






“David vs Goliath, SimpliSafe vs ADT: 
                SimpliSafe aims to upstage their larger 
                rivals by giving consumers what they really
                 want. Even without fancy marketing, word 
                 is spreading.”  see review








SimpliSafe is not for you if...


1
You have a HUGE home: If your home is larger than 20,000 
            square feet (about the size of a football field)—or if it has more 
            than 50 windows on the first floor—you would probably benefit 
            from a system that can handle a huge number of sensors. Our 
            advice would be to go to a traditional contract security company
            —and keep in mind the things we’ve warned you about.


2
You run a large commercial property such as a 
            shopping mall—you would probably benefit from a 
            system that has CCTV or security guards, in which 
            case you should probably go to one of the traditional 
            contract security companies—and keep in mind the 
            things we’ve warned you about.



However, if you’re one of the 95% of people who don’t run a large commercial property, then SimpliSafe is probably the best
            choice for you. If you’re in any doubt, contact one of our security consultants at 1-888-957-4675 for free friendly advice.

Plus, the Base Station comes equipped with a built-in rechargeable backup battery, which can power your system for 24 hours and be recharged at any time.


Customer Review: Donald Meehan
“I have had my system for about 6 weeks now my wife and I love it. We just lost power for four days, I took the base to my in-laws and recharged it twice. It worked great during the power outage. I spoke to some neighbors who have also recently got alarms with other companies, they were very upset because their system died pretty quickly and were not able to recharge it.”

Firefighters Straight to your Door


When a fire is burning in your home every second counts. SimpliSafe smoke detectors are built with photoelectric sensors for faster detection of a fire before it breaks into a flame, giving you and your family more time to get up and out of your home. Photoelectric sensors like ours are less likely to trigger annoying false alarms.
Never worry about sleeping through a fire alarm. This monitored detector will sound its own internal siren as well as trigger the full security system alarm.






Our competitor’s model sells for $79.99. Ours is $29.99. How do we sell the highest quality sensors at half the price? No middlemen.






Extreme Range—and Fully Customizable for Your Home





SimpliSafe sensors have a huge range of 400 ft., so our system is perfect for homes and businesses of any size (unless you live in the Superdome).
Some alarm companies make it almost impossible to personalize your alarm for your home. Every SimpliSafe alarm system is 100% customizable to meet your home’s unique needs. Our systems support up to 41 sensors—you can add more at any time via our online security shop or with a quick call to our friendly support team.





Smart Sensors Never Mistake Pets for Burglars


SimpliSafe uses more precise motion sensors to ensure your pets won’t trigger your alarms. Simply place your motion sensors where your pets can’t fiddle with them, and your cats or dogs can comfortably play at home without triggering an alarm.

It’s Easier Than Ever to Test Your Sensors

It’s easy to make sure your pets won’t set off your alarm with SimpliSafe’s unique Test Mode. And our security specialists are available for a consultation if you’re having trouble finding the right position!

Homeowners with big pets love this trick

Normally, the Motion Sensor looks straight out and down towards the ground. If your pet is triggering the sensor, just place it about 4-5 feet above ground level, and turn it upside down! This way, your pet can’t trigger it, but an intruder will!








Moving is Easier than Ever—Fully Portable Alarms





All SimpliSafe Equipment will fit a new home quickly and easily. Moving to a larger place? No problem. Order extra sensors anytime

We include extra 3M command strips in every box, making it easy for you to move sensors to a new home. These adhesive strips are super strong, but are also engineered to pull off cleanly without damaging your walls.

We protect your home 24 hours a day with a state-of-the-art security system, professional alarm monitoring, and instant police dispatch. Your security system is so effective that actual Wisconsin police uses it to catch criminals. We use COPS monitoring—winner of CSAA’s Best-in-Industry Monitoring.
...and it’s only 14.99/month Compare that to the $50/month most other companies charge. That adds up to savings of over $500 every year.

What is an “auto-renewal clause” anyway?
Most alarm companies have an automatic renewal clause in their monitoring and service contract (and use teeny tiny font). This means that your contract will be renewed for anywhere from 12 months to three years, unless you cancel by mail within 30 days before the end of your contract. Many of the nationwide and local alarm companies use this tactic. Cancelling early usually involves a penalty of 75% to 100% of the value of the contract. 

SimpliSafe offers monthly alarm monitoring. There are no contracts to sign, so there’s no fear of getting tricked by fine print and hidden fees. You can cancel your SimpliSafe alarm monitoring anytime by simply giving us a call.

There’s a huge range of equipment choices from installing a camera to having a smart lock on your door to 24-hour monitoring and motion detectors.

        Cameras
Installing a camera is a one of the basic equipment options you’ll encounter, so it’s important to know how extensive or minimal you might want your camera system to be. Looking into some of the most popular brands, figuring out which entry points in your home you may want monitored, and deciding if an indoor or outdoor camera would be better for you are some good first steps into researching your camera needs.

        How to get started
Once you’ve done your online research, we recommend talking to a few security companies to see what they think you need for your home’s size and location. This will also help you nail down how best to work within your budget while getting everything you need for your home security. They can walk you through equipment recommendations (like alarm types and cameras) as well as answer all your questions. If you’re considering purchasing a home security system, complete the above form to review free quotes from local professionals.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
