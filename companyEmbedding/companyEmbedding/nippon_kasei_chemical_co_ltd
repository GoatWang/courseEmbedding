Nippon Kasei Chemical Co. Ltd. Reports Net Loss
Font size AAA
16 May 2012 12:12 Helen Clark

CHEMMONITOR.COM – Nippon Kasei Chemical had a challenging year in 2011. Company’s Onahama factory was severely damaged during the earthquake, and the operations there were resumed only in August 2011. Ammonia-based products facility was damaged by the earthquake and shut down; Carbon black facility was forced to close due to equipment damage. Sales volumes decreased due to lesser capacities and weaker demand. The demand from semiconductor-related fields has decreased gradually, and synthetic quartz powder delivered a decrease in sales volume. For high-grade aqueous urea denitration diesel the year appeared flat due to intensifying market competition and sales expansion efforts.
More specifically, sales of the nine-month period ended December 31, 2011 were down 20.9% year on year to JPY 23,022 million. Operating income was down 78.7% YoY.
The results for the quarter ended December 2011 reveal the weakest period in FY 2011/12. Revenue amounted JPY 7.5 B, gross profit equaled JPY 1.2 B, operating and net income both dropped below zero point and reached JPY (139) M and JPY (105) M, respectively.
Founded in 1937 and headquartered in Tokyo (Japan), Nippon Kasei Chemical is a manufacturer and distributor of inorganic and specialty chemicals. The company operates the following departments: Inorganic chemicals, Specialty chemicals, Inorganic materials. It also engages in engineering business (freight and cargo handling). Nippon Kasei is traded on Tokyo Stock Exchange under the ticker 4007.
