Investment Approach






	Focused on Value

	Our investment approach is based on the conviction that a security's market price does not always accurately reflect the company's value. When investor sentiment, emotions, or short-term trends cause the price of a security to deviate from its intrinsic worth, we see opportunity. Consistent with this approach, we believe true investment risk is the potential for permanent loss rather than short-term price volatility or deviation from a benchmark.

	Driven by Research

	Finding opportunities begins with research. Over the years, we have sharpened our in-house research capabilities, enabling us to tune out the noise generated by temporal factors and focus on a company's fundamentals — the true indicators of long-term performance. When we find securities that we consider undervalued, we dig deeper to evaluate risk and model the ability of the company to generate earnings under different conditions over the long term. Our rigorous research helps us find securities that are being adversely affected by misguided sentiment or unsustainable trends or exaggerated risks. The breadth and depth of our proprietary research allows us to investigate stocks with limited Wall Street coverage that may be overlooked.

	Guided by a Well-Defined Process

	Research fuels conviction. Process ensures discipline. We prefer to build diversified portfolios with the best risk-adjusted securities rather than own hundreds of securities that would dilute our advantage. Each security we select has been thoroughly researched, peer-reviewed by team members, and compared to other opportunities. The most attractive securities receive the highest weighting in our portfolios and are sold as they approach our estimate of fair value or when their risk profiles exceed our acceptable limits. By consistently applying our process, we ensure that our conviction is based on well-established and proven economic principles.

	Designed to Deliver Long-Term Results

	Everything we do is guided by our commitment to deliver long-term value to our clients. We invest with a multi-year horizon in mind. Our research is based on enduring economic principles. Our process discipline ensures we remain true to our style over market cycles. Our results show that taking a long view ultimately delivers a better investment outcome.

	Performance









Performance (%)
The performance data quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Current performance may be lower or higher. Click here to obtain the most recent quarter-end performance. Investment return and principal value of the fund will fluctuate, and shares may be worth more or less than their original cost when redeemed. The High Yield Fund imposes a 2.00% redemption fee on shares held for 90 days or less. Performance data does not reflect the redemption fee. If it had, return would be reduced.
Returns shown for A, C and R Shares for the periods prior to their inception are derived from the historical performance of I Shares of the applicable Fund during such periods and have been adjusted to reflect the higher total annual operating expenses of each specific class. Performance for classes without sales charges would be lower if the sales charges were shown. Total returns with sales charges reflect the deduction of the current maximum initial sales charges of 5.25% for A Shares (4.75% for the Capital Income Fund and 3.75% for the High Yield Fund) and the applicable contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) for C Shares. C Shares CDSC is 1% for the first year.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).

                217The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or “star rating”, is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange–traded funds, closed–end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three–year history. Exchange–traded funds and open–ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk–Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product′s monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three–, five–, and 10–year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three–year rating for 36–59 months of total returns, 60% five–year rating⁄40% three–year rating for 60–119 months of total returns, and 50% 10–year rating⁄30% five–year rating⁄20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.Morningstar Stylebox†
