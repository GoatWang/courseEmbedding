The name comes from when a family lived at Hinckley, in  Leicestershire. The place-name Hinckley is derived from the Old English  personal name Hynca, and leah, an Old English word that meant "forest clearing."Hinkle Early OriginsPDF Coat of Arms+ Extended History
    Buy PDF History »The surname Hinkle was first found in  Leicestershire at Hinckley, a market town and parish that dates back to the  Domesday Book of 1086 when it was listed as Hinchelie. [1]CITATION[CLOSE]Williams, Dr Ann. And G.H. Martin, Eds., Domesday Book A Complete Translation. London: Penguin, 1992. Print.  (ISBN 0-141-00523-8) "This place was created a barony soon after the Conquest, and was held by Hugh de Grentismenil, seneschal of  England in the reigns of William Rufus and Henry I., who erected a stately castle and a church, and founded a small priory of Benedictine monks, which, before 1173, was granted as a cell to the abbey of Lyra, in  Normandy, by Robert Blanchmaines, Earl of Leicester." [2]CITATION[CLOSE]Lewis, Samuel, A Topographical Dictionary of England. Institute of Historical Research, 1848, Print.Hinkle Spelling VariationsHinkle Spelling Variations Spelling variations in names were a common occurrence before English spelling was standardized a few  hundred years ago. In the Middle Ages, even the literate spelled their names differently as the English language incorporated elements of French, Latin, and other European languages. Many variations of the name Hinkle have been found, including Hinkley, Hinkler, Hincle, Hinchley, Hinckley and others.Hinkle Early HistoryHinkle Early HistoryThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Hinkle research.

Often faced with persecution and starvation in  England, the possibilities of the New World attracted many English people. Although the ocean trips took many lives, those who did get to North America were instrumental in building the necessary groundwork for what would become for new powerful nations. Some of the first immigrants to cross the Atlantic and come to North America bore the name Hinkle, or a variant listed above: Hinkle Settlers in United States in the 18th CenturyPeter Hinkle, who landed in Pennsylvania in 1765 [3]CITATION[CLOSE]Filby, P.

The name comes from when a family lived at Hinckley, in  Leicestershire. The place-name Hinckley is derived from the Old English  personal name Hynca, and leah, an Old English word that meant "forest clearing."Hinkle Early OriginsPDF Coat of Arms+ Extended History
    Buy PDF History »The surname Hinkle was first found in  Leicestershire at Hinckley, a market town and parish that dates back to the  Domesday Book of 1086 when it was listed as Hinchelie. [1]CITATION[CLOSE]Williams, Dr Ann. And G.H. Martin, Eds., Domesday Book A Complete Translation. London: Penguin, 1992. Print.  (ISBN 0-141-00523-8) "This place was created a barony soon after the Conquest, and was held by Hugh de Grentismenil, seneschal of  England in the reigns of William Rufus and Henry I., who erected a stately castle and a church, and founded a small priory of Benedictine monks, which, before 1173, was granted as a cell to the abbey of Lyra, in  Normandy, by Robert Blanchmaines, Earl of Leicester." [2]CITATION[CLOSE]Lewis, Samuel, A Topographical Dictionary of England. Institute of Historical Research, 1848, Print.Hinkle Spelling VariationsHinkle Spelling Variations Spelling variations in names were a common occurrence before English spelling was standardized a few  hundred years ago. In the Middle Ages, even the literate spelled their names differently as the English language incorporated elements of French, Latin, and other European languages. Many variations of the name Hinkle have been found, including Hinkley, Hinkler, Hincle, Hinchley, Hinckley and others.Hinkle Early HistoryHinkle Early HistoryThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Hinkle research.

Often faced with persecution and starvation in  England, the possibilities of the New World attracted many English people. Although the ocean trips took many lives, those who did get to North America were instrumental in building the necessary groundwork for what would become for new powerful nations.
