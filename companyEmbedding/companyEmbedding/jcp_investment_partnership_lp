 Our mission: 
To ensure our clients get well compensated for the risks they bear
JCP Investment Partners (formerly JF Capital Partners) is a specialist, wholesale Australian focused equities investor.  We are a research-driven, fundamental growth manager.  We specialise in managing high conviction, after-tax and risk customised portfolios for institutional clients.
Our firm was founded in 1998 as a joint venture with JP Morgan Asset Management, but is now 100% owned by our employees, directors and long-term advisors, after acquiring JP Morgan's 50% stake in 2010.
Our investment team is well resourced (16 investment professionals), experienced (average 17 years industry experience), and stable.  Over the last decade, the team has delivered consistently strong investment returns through different market and economic environments.
Our strategic commitment is to a large in-house, risk-based research effort, supported with external proprietary research. This commitment is combined with a rigorous investment platform that has been developed over the last 17 years, with advice from three of Australia's best finance and strategy academics.Our strong competitive advantage comes from combining the art and science of investing, whereby we:
Generate investment insights through targeted proprietary research (art)
Process these insights into consistent probability-weighted risk/return research outputs (science)
Generate investment ideas (buy and sell ideas) through smart portfolio optimisation (science)
Filter ideas through a sensible and experienced qualitative overlay process (art)

About Us Mission, Values, Culture What it means to invest with JCP 


Mission, Values, Culture



 
Mission Statement:
To ensure our clients get well compensated for the risks they bear.
Values: 
Client focus
We act as investment agents for our clients: our fiduciary responsibility to them is our primary concern
Team work
We work in teams that encourage respectful debate and critical review to promote objective and astute decision-making
Initiative
We seek insightful information and efficient processes from which to build real competitive advantage
Sustainability
We recognise the need to weigh short-term economic gains against long-term ethical, social and environmental impacts
Culture:
Our culture promotes rational risk-taking, and specifically encourages our people to:

Recognise uncertainty when other investors are over-confident.
Invest based on probabilities and payoffs when other investors are too risk-averse.
Act on an objective assessment of available information, despite residual uncertainty.
Judge decisions not only on results, but also on how they were made.

JCP Announces Dissident Slate for Election at Fiesta Restaurant Group's Upcoming Annual Meeting

Troubled by Destruction of Stockholder Value, Strongly Believes Direct Stockholder Representation Required in the Boardroom Immediately




Jan 30, 2017, 8:00am EST














HOUSTON, Jan. 30, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- JCP Investment Management, LLC, together with its affiliates and the other participants in its solicitation (collectively, "JCP" or "we"), collectively one of the largest stockholders of Fiesta Restaurant Group, Inc. ("Fiesta" or the "Company") (NASDAQ: FRGI), with aggregate ownership of approximately 7.1% of the Company's outstanding shares, announced today that it has formally nominated three independent, highly qualified candidates, John B. Morlock, James C. Pappas and Joshua E. Schechter, for election to the Company's board of directors (the "Board") at the Company's upcoming 2017 annual meeting of stockholders (the "Annual Meeting").
Over the past several months, JCP has attempted to reach an amicable resolution with the Company regarding the composition of the Board and certain corporate governance matters; however, the incumbent Board and management team have refused to engage meaningfully with us, leaving us little choice but to nominate a competing slate of director candidates at the Annual Meeting who we believe will create value for all stockholders.
JCP is concerned by the massive decline in value that Fiesta stockholders have suffered over the past several years. A prime example of stockholder value destruction is the Board's misguided decision to allocate more than $70 million for Pollo Tropical's failed expansion into Texas. We further believe that Taco Cabana has significant value and growth potential, which the incumbent Board and management team has apparently failed to recognize or, at a minimum, to capitalize upon. Following the departure of former CEO Timothy Taft in September 2016, stockholders have been left with a company without a permanent CEO that is being run by a Board with minimal share ownership and scant restaurant operating experience. Adding to uncertainty for stockholders is the persistent rumor of a strategic review process.
Prior to any significant action, such as the hiring of a permanent CEO or pursuing a sale of the Company, JCP strongly believes that the Board must be reconstituted with direct stockholder representatives and experienced restaurant operators. JCP's director candidates collectively bring not only significant operating experience in the restaurant industry, but a strong track record of creating stockholder value.
JCP's nominees, who have the highest commitment to transparency and good corporate governance practices, are:
John B. Morlock – Chief Operating Officer of Sbarro LLC ("Sbarro"), a quick service Italian pizzeria chain. Prior to joining Sbarro, Mr. Morlock served as the Chief Operations Officer of Potbelly Corporation, a publicly traded sandwich chain, from November 2002 to June 2015, and as its Senior Vice President – Operations Growth from June 2015 until April 2016. From 2001 to 2002, Mr. Morlock served as the Chief Executive Officer of Spin Cycle, Inc., where he led a successful turnaround of a chain of coin laundries. From 1998 to 2001, Mr. Morlock served as the President of Clubhouse International, Inc., an owner and operator of country club themed restaurants. Prior to that, Mr. Morlock served as the Senior Vice President of Operations of Boston Chicken, Inc. (n/k/a Boston Market Corporation), a fast casual restaurant, from 1992 to 1994, then as a Midwest Franchisee with over 100 stores of Boston Market and Einstein Bros. Bagels until 1997, and finally as Vice President of Operations – West Coast from 1997 to 1998. Mr. Morlock's professional experience also includes leadership positions with Blockbuster Entertainment, Inc.; Grady's Goodtimes, a casual dining restaurant chain; and S&A Restaurant Corp. (Steak and Ale), a former chain for casual dining restaurants. 
James C. Pappas – Managing Member of JCP Investment Management, LLC, an investment firm. Mr. Pappas has also served as a director of each of Jamba, Inc., a leading health and wellness brand and the leading retailer of freshly squeezed juice, since January 2015; Tandy Leather Factory, Inc., a retailer and wholesale distributor of a broad line of leather and related products, since June 2016; and U.S. Geothermal Inc., a leading geothermal energy company, since September 2016. Previously, Mr. Pappas served on the board of directors of The Pantry, Inc., a leading independently operated convenience store chain in the southeastern United States and one of the largest independently operated convenience store chains in the country, from March 2014 until the completion of its sale in March 2015. He also previously served as Chairman of the board of directors of Morgan's Foods, Inc., a then publicly traded company, from January 2013 until May 2014, when the company was acquired by Apex Restaurant Management, Inc., after originally joining its board as a director in February 2012.  Previously, Mr. Pappas was with the Investment Banking / Leveraged Finance Division of Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. where he advised private equity groups and corporations on appropriate leveraged buyout, recapitalization and refinancing alternatives, and prior to that with Banc of America Securities, where he focused on Consumer and Retail Investment Banking, providing advice on a wide range of transactions including mergers and acquisitions, financings, restructurings and buy-side engagements.
Joshua E. Schechter – private investor. Mr. Schechter has also served as a director of each of Viad Corp, an S&P SmallCap 600 international experiential services company, since April 2015, and Support.com, Inc., a leading provider of cloud-based software and services, since June 2016. He previously served as a director of Aderans Co., Ltd. ("Aderans"), a multi-national company engaged in hair-related business, and as the Executive Chairman of Aderans America Holdings, Inc., Aderans' holding company in the United States, from August 2008 to May 2015. From 2001 to June 2013, Mr. Schechter served as Managing Director of Steel Partners Ltd., a privately owned hedge fund sponsor, and from 2008 to June 2013, Mr. Schechter served as co-President of Steel Partners Japan Asset Management, LP, a private company offering investment services. Mr. Schechter previously served on the board of directors of The Pantry, Inc., a leading independently operated convenience store chain in the southeastern United States and one of the largest independently operated convenience store chains in the country, from March 2014 until the completion of its sale in March 2015; WHX Corporation (n/k/a Handy & Harman Ltd.), a diversified manufacturer of engineered niche industrial products with leading market positions in many of the markets it serves, from 2005 until 2008; and Puroflow, Inc. (n/k/a Argan, Inc.), a provider of a full range of power industry and telecommunications infrastructure services, from 2001 until 2003.

("Fiesta" or the "Company") (FRGI), with aggregate ownership of approximately 8.7% of the Company's outstanding shares, today issued a letter to the Chairman of Fiesta's Board of Directors. The full text of the letter follows:April 12, 2017Fiesta Restaurant Group, Inc. 14800 Landmark Boulevard, Suite 500 Dallas, Texas 75254 Attn:    Stacey Rauch, Chairman of the BoardDear Stacey,As you know, we own approximately 8.7% of the outstanding shares of Fiesta Restaurant Group, Inc. ("Fiesta" or the "Company"), making us the Company's third largest stockholder. Dating back to August of last year, we have sought to work constructively with Fiesta's Board of Directors (the "Board") and management team in an effort to drive stockholder value and improve the Company's corporate governance. Following the Company's apparent unwillingness to entertain serious discussions regarding Board refreshment, we nominated a slate of three highly qualified individuals for election to the Board at the upcoming annual meeting that we believe would greatly enhance the Board.Despite our nomination, we continued to seek an amicable resolution with the Board in an effort to avoid an expensive and time consuming proxy contest. Unfortunately, we do not believe that the Board's recent offer adequately addresses the shortcomings of the composition of the Board or protects the best interests of the Company's stockholders.The driving factor behind our belief is the makeup of the current seven-member Board. Six of the seven incumbent directors have overseen a 60%+ decline in Fiesta's share price from its 2015 peak, and under their leadership, the Company's total shareholder returns have been negative over the past one, two and three-year periods. These same directors authorized the expenditure of more than $70 million on the failed expansion of Pollo Tropical into Texas and oversaw a corporate structure with bloated SG&A expenses, including three corporate centers. In addition, the recent performance of the Company is concerning, with transaction counts down 4.5% and 7.3%, respectively, at Taco Cabana and Pollo Tropical in the fourth quarter of 2016.  Furthermore, the Board consists largely of directors with little to no industry operating experience nor any personal investment in Fiesta stock. In fact, Paul E. Twohig, who was just appointed as a director effective February 28, 2017, is the only director who has made an open market purchase of Fiesta shares.1 In addition, we note that three of the seven directors are affiliated with Jefferies, including directors Barry J. Alperin and Brian P. Friedman, who are up for election at the upcoming annual meeting. It should be noted that Jefferies sold its entire position in 2013 after previously owning approximately 28.3% of the Company at the time of its spin-off in 2012.While we welcome the appointment of Mr. Twohig to the Board, who we believe is independent and brings considerable industry expertise, we do not think his addition alone is sufficient to offset the lack of industry experience and apparent misalignment of interests between the incumbent directors and Fiesta's stockholders.As such, we find the Board's recent offer contemplating the addition of one of our candidates now and a separate individual to be identified by the Board at a later date to be unacceptable given the lack of assurance that the person selected would be mutually agreeable to both parties. In addition, we are unwilling to commit ourselves to a multi-year standstill period given the current classified Board structure because we believe this would effectively serve to further entrench the incumbent directors who have overseen significant destruction of stockholder value.  We strongly believe that any potential agreement must involve the immediate addition of two highly qualified director candidates, who together will bring significant operating experience and an owner's perspective into the boardroom. We believe adding such individuals to the Board would remedy the Board's apparent lack of restaurant expertise and avoid a seemingly unnecessary election contest, which we believe could only benefit the entrenched directors who we do not believe belong on the Board. Therefore, to simplify the choice for stockholders at the upcoming annual meeting, we intend to withdraw our nomination of Joshua E. Schechter and seek the election of our remaining candidates James C. Pappas and John B. Morlock, both of whom have significant experience in the restaurant industry, in opposition to Messrs. Alperin and Friedman.Read MoreWhile we remain open to a collaborative process regarding Board composition, we are fully prepared to see this through to a vote at the upcoming annual meeting, if necessary, to ensure that stockholders have the opportunity to vote for the most highly qualified candidates to represent their interests.We look forward to your prompt response.Sincerely,James C.
