                  At Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) customers come first and an integral part of our DNA is creating long-lasting customer partnerships and working with them to identify their needs and provide solutions that support their success.

The concept of solutions being driven to address specific customer challenges has been with Cisco since its inception. Husband and wife Len Bosack and Sandy Lerner, both working for Stanford University, wanted to email each other from their respective offices located in different buildings but were unable to due to technological shortcomings. A technology had to be invented to deal with disparate local area protocols; and as a result of solving their challenge - the multi-protocol router was born.

Since then Cisco has shaped the future of the Internet by creating unprecedented value and opportunity for our customers, employees, investors and ecosystem partners and has become the worldwide leader in networking - transforming how people connect, communicate and collaborate.

Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/25/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Nvidia Appoints New CFO After Two-year Search The search for a new CFO is finally over.

Even the most avid of tech enthusiasts could be forgiven for not knowing that Nvidia was even in need of a CFO. Former CFO David White stepped down in May of 2011 and was immediately replaced by interim-CFO Karen Burns. Burns, at the time a corporate controller and vice president of tax, served as CFO for over two years. However, it seems Nvidia's search has finally yielded a new financial chief.

Colette Kress is now manning purse strings in her new position as executive vice president and chief financial officer. Kress is 46-years-old and was most recently senior VP and CFO at Cisco's Business Technology and Operations Finance organization. Prior to that, she spent 13 years at Microsoft (including four years as chief financial officer of the Server and Tools division) and worked at Texas Instruments.

"We have searched extensively for the right candidate and are thrilled to have Colette join us," said Nvidia president and CEO Jen-Hsun Huang. "She brings fantastic experience, excellent financial management skills and deep industry knowledge to Nvidia. Colette will be a great asset as we work to extend our global leadership in visual computing, mobile and the cloud. I want to thank Karen Burns for her truly outstanding work as interim CFO as we conducted our search." 

Kress will start her new job later this month and will report directly to Huang. Karen Burns will return to her previous role at Nvidia.

Hopefully she won't let Nvidia continue to screw over their customers and other companies (Intel, Microsoft, AMD) like they have been for a while now. Those were definitely not smart Financial moves to make IMO.

Colette Kress is having the kind of day CFOs dream about. Her company, Nvidia, just reported its best quarter in history. Shares jumped nearly 30 percent in a single day, reaching a new all-time high. If you bought $10,000 worth of stock this time last year, it’s now worth nearly $30,000.
“The success we see today is a long journey, with a lot of work by a tremendous team of people,” Kress told the Silicon Valley Business Journal, the morning after reporting the company’s third-quarter earnings. “I’m truly, truly fortunate to be part of the team and carry the flag on the financials.”

Kress is one of the Silicon Valley Business Journal’s 2016 CFOs of the Year. While her impact at Nvidia is so much more than its balance sheet or its share price, Kress steering the company’s financials has been unquestionably valuable.




When she joined the company in late 2013, Wall Street valued Nvidia at $9.3 billion. Today, it’s worth $47 billion. The company made $2 billion in revenue in its most recent quarter. That’s about twice as much revenue as the company was making per quarter when she joined.
The Santa Clara-based chipmaker has historically made high-powered graphics processing units, or GPU, chips for the video game market. In recent years, the company has invested outside its core products, establishing beachheads in rapidly growing markets.
“We’re growing from a graphics company to an AI and computing-focused company,” Kress said. “Growth areas in front of us are new areas we’re going to see in the next 10 to 20 years. We’re focused on virtual reality, artificial intelligence and self-driving cars; transformational opportunities, where the GPU in this sense is perfectly aligned.”




 


Kress is a technologist at heart, having worked her entire career in tech: First, at Texas Instruments, followed by executive finance roles at Microsoft and Cisco. She admits she spends most of her day looking at balance sheets, but the line items are more than abstract widgets to her.

“Understanding the role of the CFO is to understand the business I support,” she says. “I’m the first to ask, ‘How does the business work?’”
Working at a chipmaker offers unique challenges — research and development is expensive and the demand for technical innovation is relentless. Nvidia’s engineers are expected to push the boundaries of what’s possible on a silicon chip a little further every day. And while Nvidia’s won ground in AI, self-driving cars and data center chips, their competitors are similarly relentless, eager to create the next killer chip.
Kress’ past employers — Microsoft and Cisco — were both the dominant players in their markets, batting away their smaller competitors. It’s different at Nvidia, which is the young upstart compared to larger companies like Intel. Kress said the corporate culture at Nvidia felt right.
“Nvidia is a very flat organization, a very collaborative organization, where we get together and get work done,” Kress said. “The leadership and culture here has been such a unique match.”
