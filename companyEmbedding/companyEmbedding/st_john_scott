Why is this contact information displayed?  

Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

St. John’s Wort Product Review

By Cheryl Ravey

Description
St. John’s Wort is a plant with yellow flowers, leaves and stems whose medicinal uses were first recorded in ancient Greece. It has long been a happy alternative for those reluctant to pop pills for depression and has also been used for anxiety and sleep disorders.
St. John’s Wort does not cause euphoria and, like regular antidepressants, is unlikely to elevate mood in people who aren’t truly depressed.
The vast majority of double blind placebo-controlled studies have found that St. John’s Wort extracts are as effective as standard antidepressant drugs (including antidepressants in the SSRI (Prozac) family) as a treatment for mild to moderate cases of major depression. Not surprisingly, those taking the herb supplement also showed significantly fewer negative side effects compared to those taking the prescription drug.
Benefits
One study involving menopausal women with depression found that a combination of St. John’s Wort and black cohosh extracts improved both menopause symptoms and mood. St. John’s Wort is also sometimes tried for other conditions in which standard antidepressants might be recommended, such as anxiety, attention deficit disorder, PMS, seasonal affective disorder (SAD), chronic pain, insomnia, neuropathic pain, obsessive compulsive disorder, social phobia, and quitting smoking.
Using St. John’s Wort extract might be justified, but products on the market vary considerably.
Virtually all studies of St. John’s Wort have used extracts rather than whole herb and most St. John’s Wort products are standardized to their content of a substance called hypericin, Hypericin act on chemical messengers in the nervous system that regulate mood. While hypericin may not be the most important constituent, products with standardized hypericin content have proven to be effective in human studies.
Contents
Four St. John’s Wort supplements failed testing by an independent lab due to contamination with cadmium. The following products exceeded these limits of 0.1 mcg of cadmium:...

Despite that and being the team’s captain, he admits that where he’ll be playing for the 2014-2015 season is still up in the air.  “I’m looking to get a contract right now. I don’t know if it’s going to be back in Milwaukee this year. With Nashville being our NHL affiliate and stuff like that it doesn’t look like it’s going to work out,” he said. “It’s one of those things where I’m in a pool of free agents looking for a contract. It’s a waiting game right now. Obviously there’s a bit of anxiety right now but also excitement as well maybe with a new chapter and transitioning to another organization and maybe get an opportunity there.”Ford is continuing to work hard as he waits for his next opportunity on the ice. He isn’t ready to hang up his skates yet and credits local trainer Phil Hiscock for keeping for keeping him in tip-top shape on the ice.“If not it may be time to search elsewhere and do other things. I’ve been pretty privileged to have a career that’s lasted ten years. It’s been fantastic. I have a ton of friends, a ton of memories. I’m just mentally or physically ready to be done with it yet. I’m still working hard with a lot of the guys that come back to the community here,” he explained. “Phil Hiscock has been unbelievable for my career the last three years. I’ve been training with him and the stuff that he does with the youth in the city is just fantastic.”Taking part in the North Peace Alumni Hockey School is something that Ford values for a number of reasons such as reuniting with other Fort St. John hockey players while being able to give back to the grass roots level of the sport.Related   Newsletter  Sign up for the daily Energeticcity.ca newsletter sponsored by NLC          Copyright © 2017 | MH Magazine WordPress Theme by MH Themes
