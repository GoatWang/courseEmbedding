Our Definition of Telemedicine
Telemedicine encompasses the processes, software, and equipment to connect a healthcare professional with a patient via technology and real-time connections. Salus believes in appropriate interaction between a provider and a patient, which follows all state medical and composite board guidelines. This includes giving the provider the comprehensive ability to do a full physical exam and evaluation on the patient by incorporating the proper peripherals for primary care and medical specialties.











Mission Statement
Our mission is to maintain the quality of the patient, provider relationship and improve overall health outcomes with exceptional, compassionate service.
We are experienced as a market leader and a trusted advisor within the telehealth industry, guided by these principles:

Ensure an appropriate physician and patient interaction by giving the physician the comprehensive ability to do a full physical exam and evaluation on the patient.
Offer unparalleled service and support from our highly experienced and responsive account management, customer service, and IT teams.
Constantly test new and innovative technologies, and apply them in ways that make sense with our customers’ needs.
Take the complexity out of implementing a telehealth program and offer a simple and affordable solution that allows for a lower cost of ownership.

Frederick Feit
MD
Board Member











Read Biography




Frederick Feit


			Frederick Feit, MD, Director of the Fellowship Training Program in Interventional Cardiology, and Associate Professor of Medicine at the NYU Langone School of Medicine, is recognized nationally and internationally for his scientific contributions and technical expertise. His pioneering research in collaboration with Dr. Rentrop, beginning in the Summer of 1981 was truly revolutionary in that he and his team injected thrombolytic agents (clot busting drugs) directly into totally obstructed coronary arteries of patients experiencing myocardial infarctions (heart attacks). These catheter-based, invasive, but non-surgical procedures were at the time considered to be too dangerous to perform during a myocardial infarction. Feit and his team not only proved that the procedure was safe, but that the clot-buster could restore blood flow and stop the progress of the heart attack. The results of this clinical investigation, which included more than 100 patients from our Institution and was performed entirely by residents and fellows volunteering their time and talents in the absence of any funding, were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. These observations have literally changed the way we practice medicine, such that today, some 30 years later, whenever a patient presents with a heart attack, it is universally accepted that he must be immediately rushed to a cath lab to have his blocked artery opened.
Subsequently, Dr. Feit has been Principal Investigator on numerous NIH-sponsored clinical trials involving patients with coronary artery disease those with diabetes mellitus and has served as Head of the Steering Committee of a Major International Trial. His work has been published in all of the major medical journals, in which he has several hundred publications. He has shared his insights via presentations, lectures and debates at National and International Cardiology Meetings and at many major medical centers, both here and abroad. He is probably most proud of having trained more than 100 fellows in the practice of Interventional Cardiology.
Dr. Feit grew up in the Bronx, where he attended Bronx HS of Science and received his undergraduate degree with Honors in Chemistry from New York University and his MD from the New York University School of Medicine. He earned membership in both Phi Beta Kappa and Alpha Omega Alpha. In addition to his clinical and research work, he is host of “Heart-to-Heart”-a Weekly educational program on SIRIUSXM Radio, during which he discusses a broad array of health care issues, often with leading scientists, physicians, politicians, celebrities and other luminaries.

The Democratsâ Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
