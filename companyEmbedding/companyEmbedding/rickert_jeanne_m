Nanotechnology products  are in our DNA.
PEN, Inc. is a company created to harness the incredible potential of nanotechnology in real-world products for real-world users. That drive to develop, commercialize and grow the market is in our DNA. In fact, it’s in our name: PEN stands for Products Enabled by Nanotechnology.



We’re uniquely positioned for the challenge. PEN is the combination of Nanofilm, Ltd. and Applied Nanotech Holdings, Inc., two nanotechnology pioneers.

                            Nanofilm was founded in 1985 by Scott Rickert, CEO of PEN. The start-up built on Dr. Rickert’s advanced research and grew to be a company with a leading market position for specialty optical coatings, cleaners and nano-composite products. Nanofilm now serves a global market with a variety of products for consumer, commercial and industrial use.  
                            

                            	Applied Nanotech Holdings, Inc., a global leader in nanotechnology, has become the PEN Design Center.  It has more than 25 years in the industry, holds more than 250 patents, and has partnered with organizations like the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Army Research Office and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to find nanotechnology-based solutions to challenges.
                            
Through our companies – present and future – PEN is committed to developing nanotechnology-based innovations to redefine products, reinvent categories, and – most important – improve people’s lives. 









Three guiding principles for growth:


1

Less means more.
We have a wide vision of nanotechnology’s immense potential to transform products, improve performance, solve problems. That drives an aggressive pursuit of innovation and new opportunities across all the scientific fields and product categories.



2

Products are the measure of success.
A product that’s not in the hands of a customer is of no value to anyone.  We focus on moving nanotechnology out of the lab and into product leadership. We’re poised to achieve that goal through a growing family of companies committed to rapid product development, market development and commercialization. 



3

Sustainability first. And always. 
One of the defining characteristics of PEN products is a focus on the sustainability life cycle – work better, use less material, last longer, reduce waste. That sustainability commitment extends to a long-standing culture of concern for the health and safety of our employees, customers, suppliers and the larger community. From product design process to research lab to manufacturing to customers, it’s a promise we pursue every day.

How do I choose a lawyer?Consider the following: 
Comfort Level - Are you comfortable telling the lawyer personal
information? Does the lawyer seem interested in solving your problem? 
Credentials - How long has the lawyer been in practice? Has
the lawyer worked on other cases similar to yours? 
Cost - How are the lawyer's fees structured - hourly or flat
fee? Can the lawyer estimate the cost of your case? 
City - Is the lawyer's office conveniently located?
Not sure what questions to ask a lawyer?Here are a few to get you started:

How long have you been in practice?
How many cases like mine have you handled?
How often do you settle cases out of court?
What are your fees and costs?
What are the next steps?
