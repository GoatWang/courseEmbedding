A hacker’s view of antivirus


Download White Paper










Traps
Advanced Endpoint Protection





Prevent Cyber Breaches
Preemptively block known and unknown malware, exploits and zero-day threats with the unique multi-method prevention approach of Traps™ advanced endpoint protection. 
Automate Prevention
Automatically reprogram your endpoints to block known and unknown threats – without human intervention – using threat intelligence gained from our global community of customers and partners.
Protect and Enable Users
Empower users to use web-, mobile- and cloud-based applications without fearing cyberthreats. Protect users from inadvertently compromising their systems without burdensome virus scans.

















Traps Secures Endpoints With a Unique Multi-Method Prevention Approach
Traps replaces legacy antivirus and secures endpoints with a multi-method prevention approach that blocks malware and exploits, both known and unknown, before they compromise endpoints such as laptops, desktops and servers.




Multi-Method Malware Prevention
Traps prevents malicious executables rapidly and accurately with a unique, multi-method approach to prevention that maximizes coverage against malware while reducing the attack surface and increasing the accuracy of malware detection. This approach combines several prevention methods to instantly block known and unknown malware from infecting a system.


Multi-Method Exploit Prevention
Traps takes a unique approach to preventing exploits. Instead of focusing on the millions of individual attacks or their underlying software vulnerabilities, it focuses on the small set of techniques all exploit-based attacks use, which rarely change. Traps blocks these techniques, thereby preventing exploitation attempts before they can compromise endpoints.


Learn More













Automatically Convert Threat Intelligence Into Prevention
As an integral component of the Palo Alto Networks® Next-Generation Security Platform, Traps continuously exchanges threat intelligence with the WildFire™ threat analysis service, as does each component of the platform deployed among the global community of Palo Alto Networks customers.
WildFire is the world’s largest distributed sensor system focused on identifying and preventing unknown threats, with more than 15,500 enterprise, government and service provider customers contributing to the collective immunity of all other users. Traps customers receive access to this intelligence and WildFire’s complete set of malware analysis capabilities. Traps uses this intelligence to automatically reprogram itself to prevent malware on the endpoint, no matter where it is discovered first.
The automatic conversion of threat intelligence into prevention all but eliminates the opportunity for an attacker to use unknown and advanced malware to infect a system. An attacker can use a given piece of malware at most once, anywhere, and only has seconds to carry out an attack before WildFire renders it entirely ineffective.








It’s Time to Replace Antivirus
Despite continuous investments in traditional antivirus solutions and “next-gen”
AV products, organizations continue to experience cyber breaches and successful
ransomware attacks with increasing frequency. Existing endpoint security products
as a whole, and traditional antivirus solutions in particular, struggle – and more
often fail – to prevent successful security breaches.
Attempts at improving the effectiveness and efficiency of AV solutions, as well as the
security industry’s collective focus on detection and response, have only resulted in
incremental improvements in endpoint protection, while hindering organizations with
antiquated methodologies and hidden costs.
Discover the core reasons traditional AV no longer offers effective prevention, the five security requirements for any AV replacement, and how the multi-method prevention
approach of Traps replaces AV while offering superior breach prevention.

What Our Customers Say About Traps






Traps provides additional protection that classic antivirus software simply can’t. We want to prevent damaging code from entering our systems in the first place, which is exactly what Traps does. It’s the ultimate answer to meeting today’s standards for endpoint protection. We feel very confident with Traps in place to protect our endpoints and trust the solution completely.
M. Mrugowski, Technology Team Leader, Schauinsland-Reisen
Read the Case Study






If your network is a target, you cannot do without Traps Advanced Endpoint Protection. It’s a must.
M. Tesser, Group CIO, CAME Group
Read the Case Study






Traps stopped every piece of known and unknown malware that had previously infected our endpoints…Pérez-Llorca considers Traps to be a giant step forward in endpoint security.
A. Lasala, Chief Technology Officer, Pérez-Llorca
Read the Case Study






The minute that we turned on Traps, the number of ransomware infections dropped to zero... A week later it was still zero. We literally haven’t had a successful CryptoLocker attack since we installed Traps
C. Chojnacki, Infrastructure Manager, CBI Health Group
Read the Case Study






We chose Traps because, unlike other approaches, it can reliably prevent exploits and malware – known and unknown – across all our endpoints, no matter where in the world they are used.
M. Tesser, Group CIO, CAME Group
Read the Case Study






Traps offers a highly reliable, strong level of protection in the cyber attack lifecycle – much better than legacy anti-virus, and takes a different, prevention-oriented approach to achieving endpoint security.
J. Lorenzo, Group Field Infrastructure Leader, Entsorgung Recycling Zurich
Read the Case Study






Day to day, we don’t notice Traps at all, which is a good thing. It just runs. And as we grow, we’re confident that Traps will grow alongside us without any problems.
M. Mrugowski, Technology Team Leader, Schauinsland-Reisen
Read the Case Study






The rollout was extremely easy. It took just a few hours of tweaking. We had purchased three days of Palo Alto Networks Consulting Services and wound up using only one and a half for the Traps installation and knowledge transfer.
C. Chojnacki, Infrastructure Manager, CBI Health Group
Read the Case Study






When we were attacked by CryptoLocker in the past, we not only had the cost to get back our data but also the cost for the time and resources required by our organization. All those costs have been eliminated by having Traps in place. As a result, we expect to save $250,000 in the next three years.
M. Tesser, Group CIO, CAME Group
Read the Case Study






I like the simplicity of Traps, that it uses an innovative, completely new approach compared to typical anti-virus products, and that it uses less resources.
J. Lorenzo, Group Field Infrastructure Leader, Entsorgung Recycling Zurich

Traps: Advanced Endpoint Protection

Palo Alto Networks Advanced Endpoint Protection represents a complete paradigm shift from identification to pure prevention. Providing comprehensive exploit and malware prevention that is not designed to identify; instead, it prevents an attack before the malware can be successful.

Traps Advanced Endpoint Protection Technology Overview

Most organizations deploy a number of security products to protect their endpoints, including one or more
traditional antivirus solutions. Nevertheless, cyber breaches continue to increase in frequency, variety and sophistication.
Faced with the rapidly changing threat landscape, current endpoint security solutions and antivirus can
no longer prevent security breaches on the endpoint. Palo Alto Networks® Traps™ advanced endpoint protection
replaces traditional antivirus with a unique combination of the most effective, purpose-built, malware and exploit
prevention methods that pre-emptively block known and unknown threats from compromising a system.

Platform Approach to SaaS Security
Aperture™ SaaS security service delivers CASB (cloud access security broker) capabilities by connecting directly to SaaS applications. This way you never lose visibility into your data or applications and can apply granular policy and control at all times. Effective SaaS security can’t be achieved with layered point products. Meet your cloud security needs with the Palo Alto Networks® Next-Generation Security Platform, including our Next-Generation Firewall, which inspects all traffic – including applications, threats and content – and ties it to the user, regardless of location or device type. 







Protect Enterprise SaaS Apps
Data resident within enterprise-enabled SaaS applications may not be visible to an organization’s network perimeter. Aperture can connect directly to sanctioned SaaS applications to provide:

Data classification and monitoring
Data Loss Prevention (DLP) capabilities
User activity tracking for anomalies
Known and unknown malware prevention

This yields unparalleled visibility, allowing organizations to inspect content for data risk violations and control access to shared data via a contextual policy.



 

 





 

 



Advanced Threat Prevention
WildFire™ threat analysis service integration with Aperture provides advanced threat prevention to block known malware and identify and block unknown malware. This extends the WildFire service’s existing integration to prevent threats from spreading through the sanctioned SaaS applications, preventing a new insertion point for malware. 
New malware discovered by Aperture is shared with the rest of the Next-Generation Security Platform, even if it is not in-line with the SaaS applications.

Better Buy: Palo Alto Networks Inc. vs. FireEye
Both data security upstarts are in the midst of sweeping changes, and their recent share-price performance doesn't tell the whole story.











                Tim Brugger
            

                (timbrugger)



            
            Jul 11, 2017 at 12:00PM
            
            





Given that FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) stock is up a whopping 30% year to date while peer Palo Alto Network (NYSE:PANW) has inched up a mere 8%, it would be easy to assume the former knocked its first-quarter earnings out of the park, while the latter struggled.
Thing is, FireEye's Q1 included a mere 3% increase  in sales to $173.7 million, while Palo Alto pleasantly surprised investors and pundits   with an impressive 25% jump in revenue to $431.8 million, well above guidance and Wall Street's estimates. So which is the better buy now? Despite the performance discrepancy this year, the answer to which stock looks like the best long-term holding is far from cut-and-dried.

The case for Palo Alto Networks
Investors have long overlooked Palo Alto's bottom-line losses thanks to its soaring revenues, which rose quarterly by more than 50% year over year for a string seven quarters. Those days are over, though, and growth has been slowing for more than a year, which is why Palo Alto's revenue guidance for last  quarter of "just" 17% to 20% hit its stock hard. Until Palo Alto reported its 25% sales gain due to "[e]xpansion within our existing customer base and new customer acquisitions."
Though its top  line remains impressive, it's become harder to overlook Palo Alto's mounting expenses as its revenue growth rate slows. The upside is that CEO Mark McLaughlin has finally taken steps to better manage overhead, particularly sales and marketing costs. While there is still a long way to go, Palo Alto made some progress in its fiscal third quarter.
The company shelled  out $226.9 million to fund its sales efforts, a 16%  year-over-year increase. However, in the previous quarter, Palo Alto spent virtually the same amount in sale costs -- $226.7 million -- which was a 25% increase from Q2 2016. Expenses will be a key metric to monitor whenit shares fiscal Q4 results next month.





McLaughlin's efforts to grow Palo Alto's recurring revenue via software subscription sales should also help put a lid on spending because it costs less to service existing clients than to rely on new sales. It reported $267.6 million in subscription and support revenue last quarter, a 46% jump and equal to 62% of total sales. If Palo Alto continues making headway in these critical areas, a strong case can be made for its stock as the better buy.
The case for FireEye
Answering the question of why FireEye stock is up 30% this year despite its anemic revenue growth is simple: The results of CEO Kevin Mandia's cost-cutting initiative and the shift to cloud-based software subscription sales have been nothing short of stellar. Mandia's first order of business when he moved up to the CEO position last year was paring down FireEye's workforce, particularly within its sales and marketing division.
FireEye still spent more on operating expenses than it generated  in revenue last quarter, but the $180.85 million was a 29% drop compared to last year's eye-popping $252.94 million, especially when you consider it only reported $167.98 million in sales in 2016. Sales costs nosedived 23% to $94.88 million, which is still more than half of sales -- a trait FireEye shares with Palo Alto -- but a clear sign its expense management is taking hold.
FireEye's own recurring revenue push is also making headway. A full 86% of its $173.74 million in Q1 revenue was derived from subscription and service sales. Just as impressively, the $150 million in ongoing revenue was a 12% year-over-year increase, more than making up for the nearly $10 million drop in product revenue to $23.74 million.





There are a lot of similarities between Palo Alto and FireEye as they continue their respective transitions. That said, FireEye is further along in its transformation, as it demonstrated last quarter. That's why -- in the near-term, at least -- its gets the nod as the better stock to buy.

Palo Alto Networks Upholds Leadership Position in Gartner Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Network Firewalls

  SANTA CLARA, Calif., July 17, 2017 /PRNewswire/ Palo Alto Networks (NYSE: PANW), the next-generation security company, today announced that it has again been recognized in the "Leaders" quadrant of the July 10, 2017 "Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Network Firewalls" by Gartner Inc. 
According to the report, "The Leaders quadrant contains vendors that build products that fulfill enterprise requirements. These requirements include a wide range of models, support for virtualization and virtual LANs, and a management and reporting capability that is designed for complex and high-volume environments, such as multitier administration and rule/policy minimization. A solid NGFW capability is an important element, as enterprises continue to move away from having dedicated IPS appliances at their perimeter and remote locations. Vendors in this quadrant lead the market in offering new features that protect customers from emerging threats, provide expert capability rather than treat the firewall as a commodity and have a good track record of avoiding vulnerabilities in their security products. Common characteristics include handling the highest throughput with minimal performance loss, offering options for hardware acceleration and offering form factors that protect enterprises as they move to new infrastructure form factors."
This marks the sixth consecutive time that Palo Alto Networks has been named a leader in the Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Firewalls 1,which evaluates vendors' ability to execute and completeness of vision.

History[edit]
Palo Alto Networks was founded in 2005 by Nir Zuk, a former engineer from Check Point and NetScreen Technologies. Zuk served in the elite Unit 8200 of the Israel Defense Forces[2] and was the principal developer of the first stateful inspection firewall and the first intrusion prevention system.[3] When asked why he started Palo Alto Networks, Zuk cited his objective of solving a problem enterprises were facing with existing network security solutions: the inability to safely enable employees to use modern applications, which entailed developing a firewall that could identify and provide fine-grained control of applications.[4]
The company produced and shipped its first firewall in 2007[citation needed][5] and debuted on the NYSE with its July 20, 2012 initial public offering.[6]
Technology[edit]
In 2009, the company released a publication defining the "next-generation firewall."[7] Palo Alto Networks defined this next generation firewall as containing application awareness, full stack visibility, extra-firewall intelligence, and upgrade paths in addition to the full capabilities of both traditional firewalls and intrusion prevention systems. Additionally, the company defines its firewall technology by the following abilities:

Identify applications regardless of port, protocol, evasive tactic or Secure Sockets Layer
Identify and control users regardless of IP address, location or device
Protect against known and unknown application-borne threats
Fine-grained visibility and policy control over application access/functionality
Multi-gigabit, low latency, in-line deployment[8]

The company is listed in the "leaders quadrant" of research firm Gartner, Inc.'s Magic Quadrant for Enterprise firewalls.[citation needed]
Products[edit]
In 2013 MSM - Mobile Security manager was added to extend the firewall security down to mobile devices. In 2014 TRAPS was added to the product list. Traps serves as a version on endpoint protection, client protection without the standard virus file - rather it takes a different view and attempts to monitor, detect, and thwart the entry of the virus into the client by monitoring common entry points.
Acquisitions[edit]

Morta Security was acquired for an undisclosed sum in January 2014[9][10]
Cyvera was acquired for approximately $200 million in April 2014[11][12]
CirroSecure was acquired for an undisclosed sum in May 2015[13]
LightCyber was acquired for approximately $100 million in March 2017 [14]

Recognition[edit]
Recognition from industry analysts and labs for Palo Alto Networks firewalls include:

The 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 Gartner Magic Quadrant identified Palo Alto Networks as a leader in the enterprise firewall.[15]
NetworkWorld granted short list status to Palo Alto Networks’ firewalls in its next-generation firewall review in 2011 and 2012.[16]
NSS Labs rated Palo Alto Networks firewalls “Recommended” in 3 network security tests:

IPS Group Test (2011) in which NSS Labs notes it exceeded datasheet performance[17]
Traditional Firewall Group Test (2011); additionally, evaluated as best cost solution per protected megabit[17]
Next-Generation Firewall Group Test (2012) also receiving an evaluation as best cost solution per protected megabit[18]


The Forrester Research Market Overview for Intrusion Prevention Systems in 2011 credited Palo Alto Networks with “[disrupting] the detente between IPS and firewalls” and “pushing the entire vendor community toward further innovation.”[19]

Recognition from industry analysts and labs for Palo Alto Networks firewalls include:

The 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 Gartner Magic Quadrant identified Palo Alto Networks as a leader in the enterprise firewall.[15]
NetworkWorld granted short list status to Palo Alto Networks’ firewalls in its next-generation firewall review in 2011 and 2012.[16]
NSS Labs rated Palo Alto Networks firewalls “Recommended” in 3 network security tests:

IPS Group Test (2011) in which NSS Labs notes it exceeded datasheet performance[17]
Traditional Firewall Group Test (2011); additionally, evaluated as best cost solution per protected megabit[17]
Next-Generation Firewall Group Test (2012) also receiving an evaluation as best cost solution per protected megabit[18]


The Forrester Research Market Overview for Intrusion Prevention Systems in 2011 credited Palo Alto Networks with “[disrupting] the detente between IPS and firewalls” and “pushing the entire vendor community toward further innovation.”[19]

History[edit]
Palo Alto Networks was founded in 2005 by Nir Zuk, a former engineer from Check Point and NetScreen Technologies. Zuk served in the elite Unit 8200 of the Israel Defense Forces[2] and was the principal developer of the first stateful inspection firewall and the first intrusion prevention system.[3] When asked why he started Palo Alto Networks, Zuk cited his objective of solving a problem enterprises were facing with existing network security solutions: the inability to safely enable employees to use modern applications, which entailed developing a firewall that could identify and provide fine-grained control of applications.[4]
The company produced and shipped its first firewall in 2007[citation needed][5] and debuted on the NYSE with its July 20, 2012 initial public offering.[6]
Technology[edit]
In 2009, the company released a publication defining the "next-generation firewall."[7] Palo Alto Networks defined this next generation firewall as containing application awareness, full stack visibility, extra-firewall intelligence, and upgrade paths in addition to the full capabilities of both traditional firewalls and intrusion prevention systems. Additionally, the company defines its firewall technology by the following abilities:

Identify applications regardless of port, protocol, evasive tactic or Secure Sockets Layer
Identify and control users regardless of IP address, location or device
Protect against known and unknown application-borne threats
Fine-grained visibility and policy control over application access/functionality
Multi-gigabit, low latency, in-line deployment[8]

The company is listed in the "leaders quadrant" of research firm Gartner, Inc.'s Magic Quadrant for Enterprise firewalls.[citation needed]
Products[edit]
In 2013 MSM - Mobile Security manager was added to extend the firewall security down to mobile devices. In 2014 TRAPS was added to the product list. Traps serves as a version on endpoint protection, client protection without the standard virus file - rather it takes a different view and attempts to monitor, detect, and thwart the entry of the virus into the client by monitoring common entry points.
Acquisitions[edit]

Morta Security was acquired for an undisclosed sum in January 2014[9][10]
Cyvera was acquired for approximately $200 million in April 2014[11][12]
CirroSecure was acquired for an undisclosed sum in May 2015[13]
LightCyber was acquired for approximately $100 million in March 2017 [14]

Recognition[edit]
Recognition from industry analysts and labs for Palo Alto Networks firewalls include:

The 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 Gartner Magic Quadrant identified Palo Alto Networks as a leader in the enterprise firewall.[15]

How Palo Alto Networks, Inc. Makes Most of Its Money
Here are the key contributors to this fast-growing cybersecurity business.











                Demitrios Kalogeropoulos
            

                (TMFSigma)



            
            Jun 20, 2017 at 10:31AM
            
            





Since it was founded over a decade ago, Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) has only generated net profit in one fiscal year: 2012. Yet the next-generation security specialist is amassing a large customer base that has helped power strong sales growth despite the stubborn losses. Revenue spiked by 49% last year and by 55% in fiscal 2015. 
Below, we'll look at the major contributors to that revenue growth.

Services over products
Palo Alto Networks' business divisions are split into two segments: products and services. Product revenue comes from sales of its software applications including Panorama, its centralized security management solution.
In addition to these straight licensing sales, the company offers subscriptions that deliver ongoing support and maintenance to customers through contracts that typically last between one and five years. 
The subscription side of the business is growing at a much faster clip than products as customers increasingly opt for term-based licenses. In fact, services reached a bare majority of the business (51%) last year -- up from 47% in 2015 and 43% in 2014. But the company has plenty of room to expand on this score. Almost 80% of rival FireEye's (NASDAQ:FEYE) business, for example, comes from subscriptions and services.
Palo Alto Networks expects product sales to continue trending lower as a percentage of the business as the customer base expands. That's good news because these contracts are a source of steady, recurring revenue that isn't nearly as volatile as product sales. Slightly offsetting that positive trend is the fact that services carry lower profit margins. Gross profit for the segment was 72.5% last year, compared to 73.9% for the product division.
The U.S. geography
Palo Alto Networks is heavily dependent on the U.S. geography that accounted for 71% of revenue last year and was responsible for a significant chunk of its reported growth. Europe is its next biggest region with 18% of sales. These figures closely track with independent security peers, as FireEye also gets roughly 70% of its revenue from the U.S. and 14% from the Europe region. 

PANW Net Income (TTM) data by YCharts.
Major networking giants like Cisco aren't nearly as leveraged to the U.S. market, and while that limits growth opportunities during boom times, it also provides scale advantages and valuable diversity. After all, a prolonged slowdown in security spending in the U.S. market could derail Palo Alto's momentum without causing much disruption to Cisco's wider results.





Customer concentrations
Palo Alto's customer base rose to just under 39,000 last quarter, which marked its second-best client acquisition performance in its history. No single customer accounts for 10% or more of revenue, although the company counts many of the largest Fortune 100 businesses as its clients.
The customer base skews toward the federal government, which has a huge appetite for protecting its IT assets from intrusion. This segment carries a few unique risks, though. Across-the-board budget cuts would but a big damper on the business, for one. The federal government also tends to require extra certification and compliance requirements. If Palo Alto Networks falls behind on any of these, it would lose out to rivals.
That's one reason why the company is working toward diversifying into new industries to help lessen these risks. Some of the brightest growth areas include banking, insurance, and utilities.
Palo Alto's long-term success will turn on whether it can develop strong enough security products -- paired with a robust sales and marketing infrastructure -- to convince tech managers that its next-generation solution is worth the extra resources. Its recent billings trends show encouraging momentum on that score, but the proof for investors will be accelerating customer growth eventually powering consistent profitability.

					Full Description



Palo Alto Networks, Inc., incorporated on February 28, 2005, offers a next-generation security platform that empowers enterprises, service providers and government entities to secure their organizations by enabling applications running on their networks and by preventing breaches that stem from targeted cyber attacks. The Company's security platform consists of three elements: Next-Generation Firewall, Advanced Endpoint Protection and Threat Intelligence Cloud. Its Next-Generation Firewall delivers application, user and content visibility and control, as well as protection against network-based cyber threats integrated within the firewall through its hardware and software architecture. Its Advanced Endpoint Protection prevents cyber attacks that run malicious code or exploit software vulnerabilities on a range of fixed and virtual endpoints and servers. Its Threat Intelligence Cloud provides central intelligence capabilities, security for software as a service (SaaS) applications and automated delivery of preventative measures against cyber attacks.The Company's products and services include firewall appliances, panorama, virtual system upgrades, subscription services, support and maintenance, and professional services. All of its firewall appliances incorporate its PAN-OS operating system and come with the set of features ensuring consistent operation across its entire product line. These features include App-ID, User-ID, site-to-site virtual private network (VPN), remote access secure sockets layer (SSL) VPN, and quality-of-service (QoS). Panorama is its centralized security management solution for global control of its appliances deployed on an end-customer's network as a virtual appliance or a physical appliance. Panorama is used for centralized policy management, device management, software licensing and updates, centralized logging and reporting, and log storage. Panorama controls the security, network address translation (NAT), QoS, policy based forwarding, decryption, application override, captive portal, and distributed denial of service/denial of service (DDoS/DoS) protection aspects of the appliances and virtual systems under management. Panorama centrally manages device software and associated updates, including SSL-VPN clients, GlobalProtect clients, content updates and software licenses. Panorama offers the ability to view logs and run reports from various managed appliances without the need to forward the logs and to report on aggregate user activity for all users, including mobile users.Virtual system upgrades are available as extensions to the virtual system capacity that ships with its physical appliances. Virtual Systems provide a mechanism to support multiple distinct security policies and administrative access for tenants on the same hardware device, which is applicable to its enterprise and service provider end-customers. The Company offers various subscription services, including Threat Prevention Subscription, Uniform Resource Locator (URL) Filtering Subscription, WildFire Subscription, GlobalProtect Subscription, VM-Series Subscription, Traps Endpoint Protection Subscription, AutoFocus Subscription and Aperture Subscription. It also offers an annual subscription-based technical account management (TAM) service that provides support for end-customers. The Company offers its end-customers ongoing maintenance services for both hardware and software in order to receive ongoing security updates, PAN-OS upgrades, bug fixes and repair. In addition, it provides expedited replacement for any defective hardware.Professional services are primarily delivered through its authorized channel partners and include on-location, hands-on experts planning, designing and deploying effective security solutions tailored to its end customers' specific requirements. These services include application traffic management, solution design and planning, configuration, and firewall migration. Its education services provide online and classroom-style training and are also primarily delivered through its authorized partners. App-ID is its application classification engine that uses multiple identification techniques to determine the exact identity of applications traversing the network. App-ID is the foundational classification engine that provides the traffic classification to all other functions in its platform. The App-ID classification is used to invoke other security functions. App-ID uses a series of classification techniques to identify an application. When traffic first enters the network, App-ID applies an initial policy check based on Internet protocol (IP) and port. App-ID classifies all network traffic, including business applications, consumer applications and network protocols, across all ports.User-ID integrates its platform with a range of enterprise user directories and technologies, including Active Directory, eDirectory, Open LDAP, Citrix Terminal Server, Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft Terminal Server and ZENworks. A network-based, User-ID agent communicates with the domain controllers, directories, or supported enterprise applications, mapping information, such as user, role, and current IP address to the firewall, making the policy integration transparent. It offers Content-ID, which is a collection of technologies that enables its subscription services. Content-ID combines a threat prevention engine, a cloud-based analysis service, and a URL categorization database to limit unauthorized data and file transfers, detect and block a range of threats and control non-work related Web surfing. Its cloud-based analysis service, WildFire, provides an engine for detecting previously unseen targeted malware. Its URL filtering database consists of URLs across various categories, and is designed to monitor and control employee Web surfing activities.SP3 is the Company's software and hardware architecture that consists of two elements: single-pass software and parallel processing hardware. The Company's PAN-OS operating system provides the foundation for its security platform and contains App-ID, User-ID and Content-ID. PAN-OS also includes attack protection capabilities, such as blocking invalid or malformed packets, IP defragmentation, transmission control protocol (TCP) reassembly and network traffic normalization. Traps is its Advanced Endpoint Protection product that prevents advanced attacks originating from either exploits or malicious executables before any malicious activity can run, regardless of software patches in place.The Company competes with Cisco Systems, Inc., Juniper Networks, Inc., Intel Corporation, International Business Machines Corporation, Check Point Software Technologies Ltd., Fortinet, Inc., FireEye, Inc. and Symantec Corporation.

History[edit]
Palo Alto Networks was founded in 2005 by Nir Zuk, a former engineer from Check Point and NetScreen Technologies. Zuk served in the elite Unit 8200 of the Israel Defense Forces[2] and was the principal developer of the first stateful inspection firewall and the first intrusion prevention system.[3] When asked why he started Palo Alto Networks, Zuk cited his objective of solving a problem enterprises were facing with existing network security solutions: the inability to safely enable employees to use modern applications, which entailed developing a firewall that could identify and provide fine-grained control of applications.[4]
The company produced and shipped its first firewall in 2007[citation needed][5] and debuted on the NYSE with its July 20, 2012 initial public offering.[6]
Technology[edit]
In 2009, the company released a publication defining the "next-generation firewall."[7] Palo Alto Networks defined this next generation firewall as containing application awareness, full stack visibility, extra-firewall intelligence, and upgrade paths in addition to the full capabilities of both traditional firewalls and intrusion prevention systems. Additionally, the company defines its firewall technology by the following abilities:

Identify applications regardless of port, protocol, evasive tactic or Secure Sockets Layer
Identify and control users regardless of IP address, location or device
Protect against known and unknown application-borne threats
Fine-grained visibility and policy control over application access/functionality
Multi-gigabit, low latency, in-line deployment[8]

The company is listed in the "leaders quadrant" of research firm Gartner, Inc.'s Magic Quadrant for Enterprise firewalls.[citation needed]
Products[edit]
In 2013 MSM - Mobile Security manager was added to extend the firewall security down to mobile devices. In 2014 TRAPS was added to the product list. Traps serves as a version on endpoint protection, client protection without the standard virus file - rather it takes a different view and attempts to monitor, detect, and thwart the entry of the virus into the client by monitoring common entry points.
Acquisitions[edit]

Morta Security was acquired for an undisclosed sum in January 2014[9][10]
Cyvera was acquired for approximately $200 million in April 2014[11][12]
CirroSecure was acquired for an undisclosed sum in May 2015[13]
LightCyber was acquired for approximately $100 million in March 2017 [14]

Recognition[edit]
Recognition from industry analysts and labs for Palo Alto Networks firewalls include:

The 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 Gartner Magic Quadrant identified Palo Alto Networks as a leader in the enterprise firewall.[15]
NetworkWorld granted short list status to Palo Alto Networks’ firewalls in its next-generation firewall review in 2011 and 2012.[16]
NSS Labs rated Palo Alto Networks firewalls “Recommended” in 3 network security tests:

IPS Group Test (2011) in which NSS Labs notes it exceeded datasheet performance[17]
Traditional Firewall Group Test (2011); additionally, evaluated as best cost solution per protected megabit[17]
Next-Generation Firewall Group Test (2012) also receiving an evaluation as best cost solution per protected megabit[18]


The Forrester Research Market Overview for Intrusion Prevention Systems in 2011 credited Palo Alto Networks with “[disrupting] the detente between IPS and firewalls” and “pushing the entire vendor community toward further innovation.”[19]

Sichere Aktivierung von SaaS-Anwendung mit Aperture
Die Nutzung von SaaS-Anwendungen steigt weiterhin exponentiell an. Da es sich bei diesen Anwendungen um nützliche Werkzeuge für viele Mitarbeiter handelt, möchte man an sich auch nicht dagegen vorgehen. Jedoch setzen Sie Ihr Unternehmen mit den SaaS-Anwendungen großen Risiken in Hinblick auf Sicherheitsbelange und Datendiebstahl aus, da Daten und Nutzung dieser Anwendungen für IT-Administratoren unsichtbar sind.

Safely Enable SaaS Applications with Aperture
 The adoption of SaaS applications continues to grow at an exponential pace. You do not want to clamp down on these applications because they are valuable tools for many of your employees. However, because the data and usage of these SaaS applications is invisible to IT administrators, they do expose your organization to potentially disastrous security and data theft risks. Join us for a live webinar where you will learn how your organization can enable safe usage of SaaS applications and: • Gain visibility and granular, context-based control of SaaS applications. • Protect corporate data from malicious and inadvertent exposure after it has left the traditional corporate perimeter. • Protect against new insertion and distribution points for malware. • Satisfy compliance requirements while still maintaining the benefits of SaaS based application services. The challenges of SaaS applications are already here whether they are enabled by IT or end users themselves. Find out how to take back control and safely enable their use.

Palo Alto Networks, Inc. is a network and enterprise security company based in Santa Clara, California. The company’s core products are a platform that includes advanced firewalls designed to provide network security, visibility, and granular control of network activity based on application, user, and content identification and cloud-based offerings that extend those firewalls to cover other aspects of security.

History[edit]
Palo Alto Networks was founded in 2005 by Nir Zuk, a former engineer from Check Point and NetScreen Technologies. Zuk served in the elite Unit 8200 of the Israel Defense Forces[2] and was the principal developer of the first stateful inspection firewall and the first intrusion prevention system.[3] When asked why he started Palo Alto Networks, Zuk cited his objective of solving a problem enterprises were facing with existing network security solutions: the inability to safely enable employees to use modern applications, which entailed developing a firewall that could identify and provide fine-grained control of applications.[4]
The company produced and shipped its first firewall in 2007[citation needed][5] and debuted on the NYSE with its July 20, 2012 initial public offering.[6]
Technology[edit]
In 2009, the company released a publication defining the "next-generation firewall."[7] Palo Alto Networks defined this next generation firewall as containing application awareness, full stack visibility, extra-firewall intelligence, and upgrade paths in addition to the full capabilities of both traditional firewalls and intrusion prevention systems. Additionally, the company defines its firewall technology by the following abilities:

Identify applications regardless of port, protocol, evasive tactic or Secure Sockets Layer
Identify and control users regardless of IP address, location or device
Protect against known and unknown application-borne threats
Fine-grained visibility and policy control over application access/functionality
Multi-gigabit, low latency, in-line deployment[8]

The company is listed in the "leaders quadrant" of research firm Gartner, Inc.'s Magic Quadrant for Enterprise firewalls.[citation needed]
Products[edit]
In 2013 MSM - Mobile Security manager was added to extend the firewall security down to mobile devices. In 2014 TRAPS was added to the product list. Traps serves as a version on endpoint protection, client protection without the standard virus file - rather it takes a different view and attempts to monitor, detect, and thwart the entry of the virus into the client by monitoring common entry points.
Acquisitions[edit]

Morta Security was acquired for an undisclosed sum in January 2014[9][10]
Cyvera was acquired for approximately $200 million in April 2014[11][12]
CirroSecure was acquired for an undisclosed sum in May 2015[13]
LightCyber was acquired for approximately $100 million in March 2017 [14]

Recognition[edit]
Recognition from industry analysts and labs for Palo Alto Networks firewalls include:

The 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 Gartner Magic Quadrant identified Palo Alto Networks as a leader in the enterprise firewall.[15]
NetworkWorld granted short list status to Palo Alto Networks’ firewalls in its next-generation firewall review in 2011 and 2012.[16]
NSS Labs rated Palo Alto Networks firewalls “Recommended” in 3 network security tests:

IPS Group Test (2011) in which NSS Labs notes it exceeded datasheet performance[17]
Traditional Firewall Group Test (2011); additionally, evaluated as best cost solution per protected megabit[17]
Next-Generation Firewall Group Test (2012) also receiving an evaluation as best cost solution per protected megabit[18]


The Forrester Research Market Overview for Intrusion Prevention Systems in 2011 credited Palo Alto Networks with “[disrupting] the detente between IPS and firewalls” and “pushing the entire vendor community toward further innovation.”[19]

Palo Alto Networks, Inc. is a network and enterprise security company based in Santa Clara, California. The company’s core products are a platform that includes advanced firewalls designed to provide network security, visibility, and granular control of network activity based on application, user, and content identification and cloud-based offerings that extend those firewalls to cover other aspects of security.

History[edit]
Palo Alto Networks was founded in 2005 by Nir Zuk, a former engineer from Check Point and NetScreen Technologies. Zuk served in the elite Unit 8200 of the Israel Defense Forces[2] and was the principal developer of the first stateful inspection firewall and the first intrusion prevention system.[3] When asked why he started Palo Alto Networks, Zuk cited his objective of solving a problem enterprises were facing with existing network security solutions: the inability to safely enable employees to use modern applications, which entailed developing a firewall that could identify and provide fine-grained control of applications.[4]
The company produced and shipped its first firewall in 2007[citation needed][5] and debuted on the NYSE with its July 20, 2012 initial public offering.[6]
Technology[edit]
In 2009, the company released a publication defining the "next-generation firewall."[7] Palo Alto Networks defined this next generation firewall as containing application awareness, full stack visibility, extra-firewall intelligence, and upgrade paths in addition to the full capabilities of both traditional firewalls and intrusion prevention systems. Additionally, the company defines its firewall technology by the following abilities:

Identify applications regardless of port, protocol, evasive tactic or Secure Sockets Layer
Identify and control users regardless of IP address, location or device
Protect against known and unknown application-borne threats
Fine-grained visibility and policy control over application access/functionality
Multi-gigabit, low latency, in-line deployment[8]

The company is listed in the "leaders quadrant" of research firm Gartner, Inc.'s Magic Quadrant for Enterprise firewalls.[citation needed]
Products[edit]
In 2013 MSM - Mobile Security manager was added to extend the firewall security down to mobile devices. In 2014 TRAPS was added to the product list. Traps serves as a version on endpoint protection, client protection without the standard virus file - rather it takes a different view and attempts to monitor, detect, and thwart the entry of the virus into the client by monitoring common entry points.
Acquisitions[edit]

Morta Security was acquired for an undisclosed sum in January 2014[9][10]
Cyvera was acquired for approximately $200 million in April 2014[11][12]
CirroSecure was acquired for an undisclosed sum in May 2015[13]
LightCyber was acquired for approximately $100 million in March 2017 [14]

Recognition[edit]
Recognition from industry analysts and labs for Palo Alto Networks firewalls include:

The 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 Gartner Magic Quadrant identified Palo Alto Networks as a leader in the enterprise firewall.[15]
NetworkWorld granted short list status to Palo Alto Networks’ firewalls in its next-generation firewall review in 2011 and 2012.[16]
NSS Labs rated Palo Alto Networks firewalls “Recommended” in 3 network security tests:

IPS Group Test (2011) in which NSS Labs notes it exceeded datasheet performance[17]
Traditional Firewall Group Test (2011); additionally, evaluated as best cost solution per protected megabit[17]
Next-Generation Firewall Group Test (2012) also receiving an evaluation as best cost solution per protected megabit[18]


The Forrester Research Market Overview for Intrusion Prevention Systems in 2011 credited Palo Alto Networks with “[disrupting] the detente between IPS and firewalls” and “pushing the entire vendor community toward further innovation.”[19]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
