Copeland’s New L.P. Pavement Sealer

                        March 28, 2016                        



                     Imagine installing a product as friendly to install as an asphalt based beautifier with a lot of the same strengths as a coal tar based sealer.   Action-Pave LP Base Sealer                    



A Fresh Start for Katonah Courts

                        October 15, 2011                        



                     In this installment, Copeland provided USTA Eastern a step-by-step view of a recent court repair and resurfacing project at Katonah Memorial Park in Katonah, NY. Please check out the PDF of the full article!                    






I would like it to be known that Copeland Coating is a wonderful company to do business with. I am the Head Tennis Coach at Bard College and have had dealings with Copeland in the person of Steve Puzio over these past 20 years. We have used Copeland as our “got to” company for all our court needs. Our six courts have been resurfaced twice. Steve was involved personally from start to completion both times. He came first to advise and determine our needs, followed by a quote.
He made himself accessible always and we eagerly walked the job after the courts dried to insure our total satisfaction. Copeland allowed us to commit to an acceptable time frame for the job. We were always treated respectfully and fairly. Their many years of experience proved invaluable as their advice was always “spot on”. I feel that they are the best in the business. I am sure you will agree.
Bard College



Copeland Coating Company has been Schodack Schools preferred pavement coating Systems Company for over 20 years. Copeland has continued to support the school in proper care of the coating, repair and budgeting. Copeland provides durable long lasting coatings professionally installed and supported for the life of the project.

We have worked with Copland Coating for well over twenty years. There work is outstanding and they stand by the what they do. John and Steve have always been responsive to our needs. Copland is a 1st rate organization.

Indian Head Camp


Over the past 20 years our camps have worked with Copeland Coating to meet our surfacing needs. Steve and the team at Copeland have consistently exceeded expectation in helping to recondition our sport courts and to build new facilities including our hockey rink and tennis courts. I highly recommend them and look forward to working with Copeland in the future.

Over the past 15 years, RDA Landscape Architects
has successfully worked with your company on a myriad of Long Island school
running track and tennis court surfacing projects. I am always impressed with
the way you respond to us, whether it is to provide an in-depth review of
existing conditions, prepare cost estimates or ensure a surfacing project moves
swiftly and smoothly from start to finish. We breathe easier when you are on
the job and we will continue to recommend Copeland Coating to our Clients for
quality and timely work.

Vassar College has experienced a very good working relationship with Copeland Coating during the past 8 years. We currently have 3 separate tiers of courts consisting of; 6 varsity courts in the north tier, 3 campus use courts in the center tier and 4 campus/local community use courts in the south tier. 
Copeland management and their front line crew have always responded in a timely manner and have worked under very tight schedules to prepare our courts for the fall tennis season. They reconfigured our center tier from 4 to 3 doubles courts per a request from the tennis coaching staff with excellent results and have coated our south tier courts in a manner that will lengthen the useful life even though major renovation work is clearly needed.I can confidently recommend Copeland Coating for tennis court re-coating and overall renovation work and should add that they are very competitive in their pricing.

Island Lake has employed Copeland Coating for over 25 years. We have found them to be professional and a quality provider of court surfacing. They are consistently on time and perform as expected. We wouldn’t look anywhere else for this service.

Whenever there is any court resurfacing, repair or painting the only company I have ever used is Copeland Coating. I have found them to reliable, professional and reasonable with regards to pricing.

Track & Field has always been a major part of my life.  I was an athlete from a young age growing up in New York and now a Master official and high school track & field coach.  Never did I imagine that I would have the ability and opportunity to build a track & field facility. 
Every detail was planned carefully.  It was very important to me to choose the correct workers and companies that would make my dream a reality.  Most of the workers were local with many being Bethel track & field alumni and families.  When it came to choosing a track surfacing company, the choices were many, but one significantly stood out from the rest….Action Track Surfacing.
My first meeting with Steve Hinding & Doug Stone left me with an impression of honesty and commitment, as well as superior knowledge and expertise.   They listened carefully to my desires and needs. They offered suggestions and a well organized plan to accomplish my goal.  They were as concerned with completing a high quality track facility as I was.  Every question was met with a timely answer.  There were no hidden costs.  The project was completed in the contracted budget with no surprises.  Their crews worked perfectly with in the time table.  They were clean, hard working and professional…even to the point of cutting a slot drain on their hands and knees to meet the desired design!  Steve has been back several times to check the quality of his work.  Action Track has made sure that I am completely satisfied with the project.  
 Each day I arrive at the facility it takes my breath away.  The beautiful 8 lane track, javelin runway, and sealed walkways, all completed by Action Track Surfacing, have given my team and the town of Bethel a first class track & field facility!  I would highly recommend their services for all track & field surfacing needs.

Copeland Coating has been a very reliable
company for us over the years.

When we have had projects, they work hard to make sure all our questions

and concerns have been met. Their work crews have always been reliable and

the work has been completed on time. The end product has always been

outstanding.

We continue to use Copeland Coating and strongly recommend them.

If you don't find an answer to your question, please contact us so we can help you. 
Click on the links below to view answers:











How can you tell if a scroll is running backwards?

 

Three phase scrolls can rotate in either direction depending on how it is wired. If running in reverse rotation the compressor will have elevated sound levels, reduced current draw and suction pressures will not drop along with a non rise in discharge pressure. The compressor will eventually trip on motor protector.



Where do I find what the approved refrigerants are for compressors?

 

Compressor refrigerant ratings are based on engineering design, displacement and motor specifications. These and other factors are used to determine the refrigerant type and application. This information is found using the Online Product Information section of our website, or by contacting your nearest Authorized Emerson Wholesaler.



How can the BTU rating of a compressor be determined?

 

Capacity ratings for Copeland® compressors are found on our published performance curves. These curves can be obtained through our wholesalers or from the Online Product Information section of our website. To use these curves, convert the measured suction and discharge pressure readings to their corresponding evaporating and condensing temperatures using a pressure/temperature chart for the refrigerant being used. Plotting those temperatures on the performance curve tables will reveal the BTU/H ratings, amperage, and watts.



What is the recommended super heat of Copeland® compressors?

 

To insure proper compressor cooling and lubrication the minimum operating compressor superheat is 20 0F.



What is the discharge temperature limit of Copeland® compressors?

 

Typically the maximum DLT is 225 0F. However, this temperature can vary depending on specific applications.



How do you check oil pressure on a semi-hermetic compressor?

 

Net oil pressure is found by subtracting the crankcase pressure from the pressure measured at the oil pump outlet.



Can I mix Polyol Ester (POE) and Mineral Oil (MO) together?

 

When using CFC or HCHC refrigerants, POE and MO can be mixed. The exception is R12 that only uses MO or Alkyl Benzene Mineral Oil (ABMO) blend. HFC refrigerants can only use POE oil.



Where do I find what contactor a compressor takes?

 

Contactors can be found in the Application Bulletin 10-1244. These bulletins can be located using the Online Product Information section of our website, or by contacting your local Authorized Emerson Wholesaler.



Where can I find what starting components a compressor takes?

 

The best place to see what starting components a compressor takes is on this website under Online Produce Information. Other sources include the Emerson Climate Technologies, Inc. Electrical Handbook and product information sheet, however use caution on when referring to the product information sheets as these may be out dated and contain obsolete information.



What is the viscosity of POE oil?

 

The viscosity of oils used in Copeland® compressors is selected by design of the compressors and varies from 22 to 32 (centistokes). Refer to Emerson publication No. 93-11-R12 for further details.



Does Emerson have published Cross Reference Information?

 

Yes. To cross an obsolete compressor or unit to what supersedes it, or to cross a competitor to a Copeland® compressor, log into the Online Product Information section of our website and look under Supersession.



Where do I find the bolt torque specifications for Copelametic compressors?

 

Bolt torque specifications for Copelametic compressors can be found in the Application Bulletins, 4-1219. These bulletins are located using the Online Product Information section of our website, or by contacting your local Authorized Emerson Wholesaler.



Can I add an additive to the oil in a system?

 

No. Additives are not permitted. Refer to Application Bulletin 17-1282.



How can I determine the type and quantity of oil in a compressor?

 

This information can be found on the compressor nameplate. The oil type will be abbreviated, for example MIN, meaning mineral oil or POE, meaning polyol ester oil. The oil amount is the number found beneath the oil type and is a unit measure of fluid ounces (US). So if it says 265, which means 265 fluid ounces.



Are laser and delta reed valve plate kits interchangeable?

 

Due to engineering design differences of the compressor bodies and valve methods, valve plate kits are not interchangeable.
