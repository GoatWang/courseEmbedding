STREET ACQUISITION CORPORATION 

Notes to
Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements

NOTE 1
NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

NATURE OF
OPERATIONS

Crow
Street Acquisition Corporation (the "Company") was incorporated on
July 22, 2016 under the laws of the state of Delaware to engage in
any lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not limited to,
selected mergers and acquisitions. The Company has been in the
developmental stage since inception and its operations to date have
been limited to issuing shares to its original shareholders. The
Company will attempt to locate and negotiate with a business entity
for the combination of that target company with Crow Street. The
combination will normally take the form of a merger,
stock-for-stock exchange or stock-for-assets exchange. In most
instances the target company will wish to structure the business
combination to be within the definition of a tax-free
reorganization under
Section 351 or Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended. No assurances can be given that the Company will be
successful in locating or negotiating with any target company. The
Company has been formed to provide a method for a foreign or
domestic private company to become a reporting company with a class
of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934.

BASIS OF
PRESENTATION

The
summary of significant accounting policies presented below is
designed to assist in understanding the Company's unaudited
condensed financial statements. Such unaudited condensed financial
statements and accompanying notes are the representations of the
Company's management, who are responsible for their integrity and
objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
("GAAP") in all material respects, and have been consistently
applied in preparing the accompanying unaudited condensed financial
statements.

Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally present in annual
financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
("U.S. GAAP") were omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.
The results for the period from July 22, 2016 (Inception) to
September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results
to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.

USE OF
ESTIMATES

The
preparation of unaudited condensed financial statements in
conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the condensed financial statements, and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

CASH

Cash and
cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit at banking
institutions as well as all highly liquid short-term investments
with original maturities of 90 days or less. The Company did not
have cash equivalents as of September 30, 2016.

CONCENTRATION
OF RISK

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations
of credit risk consist principally of cash. The Company places its
cash with high quality banking institutions. The Company did not
have cash balances in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation limit as of September 30, 2016.

STREET ACQUISITION CORPORATION
Notes to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements

INCOME
TAXES

Under ASC
740, "Income Taxes," deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
temporary differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years
in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered
or settled. Valuation allowances are established when it is more
likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will
not be realized. As of Sesptember 30, 2016 there were no deferred
taxes due to the uncertainty of the realization of net operating
loss or carry forward prior to expiration.

LOSS PER
COMMON SHARE

Basic loss
per common share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net
loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted loss per common share reflect the
potential dilution that could occur if securities or other
contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into
common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then
shared in the loss of the entity. As of September 30, 2016, there
are no outstanding dilutive securities.

FAIR VALUE
OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The
Company follows guidance for accounting for fair value measurements
of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value
measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed
at fair value in the unaudited condensed financial statements on a
recurring basis. Additionally, the Company adopted guidance for
fair value measurement related to nonfinancial items that are
recognized and disclosed at fair value in the unaudited condensed
financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. The guidance
establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to
valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy
gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements)
and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant
unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the
fair value hierarchy are as follows:

Level 1
inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to
access at the measurement date.

Level 2
inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1
that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or
indirectly.

Level 3
inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. The
carrying amounts of financial assets such as cash approximate their
fair values because of the short maturity of these
instruments.

RECENT
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

On
November 20, 2015, FASB issued ASU-2015-17-Income Taxes. The Board
is issuing this Update as part of its initiative to reduce
complexity in accounting standards (the Simplification Initiative).
The objective of the Simplification Initiative is to identify,
evaluate, and improve areas of generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP) for which cost and complexity can be reduced
while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information
provided to users of financial statements. Current GAAP requires an
entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into
current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of
financial position. To simplify the presentation of deferred income
taxes, the amendments in this Update require that deferred tax
liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified
statement of financial position. The amendments in this Update
apply to all entities that present a classified statement of
financial position. The current requirement that deferred tax
liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be
offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the
amendments in this Update. For public business entities, the
amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements
issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and
interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is
permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or
annual reporting period. The Company is still in the process of
evaluating future impact of adopting this standard.

On June
12, 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-10-Technical Corrections
and Improvements. The amendments in this Update cover a wide range
of Topics in the Codification. The amendments in this Update
represent changes to make minor corrections or minor improvements
to the Codification that are not expected to have a significant
effect on current accounting practice or create a significant
administrative cost to most entities. This Accounting Standards
Update is the final version of Proposed Accounting Standards Update
2014-240-Technical Corrections and Improvements, which has been
deleted. Transition guidance varies based on the amendments in this
Update. The amendments in this Update that require transition
guidance are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and
interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December
15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an
interim period. All other amendments will be effective upon the
issuance of this Update. Management is in the process of assessing
the impact of this ASU on the Company's financial
statements.

Notes to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements

On April
30, 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-06 Earnings Per Share
(Topic 260):
Effects on Historical Earnings per Units of Master Limited
Partnership Dropdown Transactions. Under Topic 260, Earnings Per
Share, master limited partnerships (MLPs) apply the two-class
method to calculate earnings per unit (EPU) because the general
partner, limited partners, and incentive distribution rights
holders each participate differently in the distribution of
available cash. When a general partner transfers (or "drops down")
net assets to a master limited partnership and that transaction is
accounted for as a transaction between entities under common
control, the statements of operations of the master limited
partnership are adjusted retrospectively to reflect the dropdown
transaction as if it occurred on the earliest date during which the
entities were under common control. The amendments in this Update
specify that for purposes of calculating historical EPU under

(1)   A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the funds we received
      in the form of a loan from Union Street Capital Management, LLC as described
      below. This loan will be repaid out of the gross proceeds of this offering. 

(2)   Includes deferred underwriting discounts and commissions equal to 3.7% of   
      the gross proceeds from the sale of the units to the public stockholders, or
      $3,700,000 ($4,255,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is        
      exercised in full), which will be deposited in the trust account and which  
      the underwriters have agreed to defer until the consummation of our initial 
      business combination. If we consummate an initial business combination,     
      $3,700,000 ($4,255,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is        
      exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters as deferred discounts 
      and commissions (subject to a $0.296 per share reduction for public 
      stockholders who exercise their conversion rights).

(3)   These expenses include any reimbursements to be made to our executive       
      officers and directors for out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in       
      performing due diligence and activities in connection with the evaluation of
      a potential business combination, as well as any potential fees that we may 
      pay to third parties, such as market research firms and other consultants,  
      that perform due diligence of a target business on our behalf (other than to
      the extent such fees are paid by our executive officers and directors on our
      behalf and such persons are reimbursed in the amount and to the extent of   
      such fees).                                                                 

(4)   The not yet identified miscellaneous expenses include, without limitation,  
      the reimbursement of our executive officers and directors for out-of-pocket 
      expenses in connection with this offering, such as roadshow expenses and    
      advances for offering costs made by them and not covered by the amounts set 
      aside for offering expenses set forth on the table above and costs and      
      expenses associated with our dissolution and liquidation.                    

We intend to use the proceeds from the sale of the units in this offering and
the sale of warrants in the private placement to acquire one or more operating
businesses in the business services industry.

After non-deferred expenses of this offering and the private placement,
$98,500,000 (or $113,005,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full) will be placed in a trust account maintained by Continental
Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee. Except for payment of taxes
and interest income earned, net of taxes payable, on the trust account of up to
$1,500,000 to fund our working capital requirements, the proceeds will not be
released from the trust account until the earlier of the consummation of an
initial business combination or our dissolution and liquidation. During the
12-month period following completion of the offering the amount that may be
distributed to us to fund our working capital requirements will be limited to
the greater of 50% of the interest income earned, net of taxes payable, and
$1,250,000. We expect to use the proceeds held in the trust account to acquire
one or more domestic or foreign operating businesses in the business services
industry. Interest earned on the trust account (net of taxes payable) will be
held in the trust account for use in consummating an initial business
combination or released to investors upon exercise of their conversion rights or
upon our dissolution and liquidation, as the case may be. However, we may not
use all of the funds remaining in the trust account in connection with a
business combination, either because the consideration for the initial business
combination is less than the proceeds in the trust account or because we finance
a portion of the consideration with our capital stock or debt securities. In
that event, the remaining proceeds held in the trust account, as well as any
other net proceeds not expended, will constitute working capital for our
business after our initial business combination. While it is difficult to
determine what the specific operating expenses of our business after
consummation of an initial business combination may be, we expect that they may
include some or all of the following: capital expenditures, general ongoing
expenses, including overhead, payroll and costs involved in expanding markets
and in developing strategic acquisitions or alliances. In addition, we may use
any remaining proceeds held in the trust account to satisfy any unpaid
reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our executive officers and
directors, as well as any unpaid finder’s fees or similar fees or compensation
to the extent such expenses, fees or compensation exceed the available proceeds
not deposited in the trust account. If we consummate an initial business
combination, $3,700,000 (or $4,255,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters as deferred
discounts and compensation, as set forth in this prospectus (subject to a $0.296
per share reduction for public stockholders who exercise their conversion
rights).

Net proceeds of this offering and the private placement in the amount of
$500,000 will not be held in the trust account and may be used to fund our
operations up to the next 24 months, as described below.

We expect to use approximately $600,000 for legal, accounting and other expenses
attendant to the structuring and negotiation of an initial business combination,
$600,000 for expenses related to due diligence and investigation of prospective
target businesses, and $50,000 for legal and accounting fees relating to SEC
reporting obligations. We expect that due diligence of prospective target
businesses will be performed by some or all members of our executive officers
and directors and may include engaging market research and valuation firms as
well as other third-party consultants. None of our executive officers or
directors will receive any compensation for any due diligence efforts, other
than reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses they may incur on our behalf
while performing due diligence of prospective target businesses. Any
reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses would occur at our discretion. To the 
extent such out-of-pocket expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited 
in the trust account, such out-of-pocket expenses would not be reimbursed by 
us unless and until we consummate a business combination.

We have agreed to pay Union Street Capital Management, LLC a monthly fee of
$7,500 for general and administrative services, including office space,
utilities and secretarial support. We believe that, based on rents and fees for
similar services in Alexandria, Virginia, the fees charged by Union Street
Capital Management, LLC are at least as favorable as we could have obtained from
unaffiliated third parties.

We expect to use approximately $300,000 for premiums for director and officer
insurance for a 24-month period. In addition, we have reserved approximately
$60,000 for the payment of corporate franchise taxes. We intend to use the
excess working capital (approximately $210,000) for other expenses incurred in
structuring and negotiating an initial business combination and, if necessary,
to cover the costs and expenses associated with our dissolution and liquidation
(which we estimate would be in the range of $50,000 to $75,000). For example, we
may opt to make a deposit or down payment or pay exclusivity or similar fees in
connection with structuring and negotiating our initial business combination.
While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms
that specialize in business acquisitions, we may do so in the future to assist
us in locating suitable target businesses, in which event we may pay a finder’s
fee, or other compensation. We have not reserved any specific amounts for a
deposit, down payment, exclusivity fees, finder’s fees or similar fees or
compensation, each of which may have the effect of reducing the available net
proceeds not deposited in the trust account for payment of our ongoing expenses
and reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred on our behalf. To the
extent that any such fees or compensation exceeds the available proceeds not
deposited in the trust account, we would not be able to pay such fees or
compensation unless we consummate an initial business combination. In addition,
the excess working capital will be used to cover miscellaneous expenses that we
have not yet identified, which may include, without limitation, the
reimbursement of our executive officers and directors for out-of-pocket expenses
in connection with this offering, such as roadshow expenses and advances for
offering costs made by them and not covered by the amounts set aside for
offering expenses described above.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering and the private placement,
we will have sufficient available funds to operate at least for the next 24
months, assuming that an initial business combination is not consummated during
that time. The amount of available proceeds is based on the executive officers’
and directors’ estimate of the amount needed to fund our operations for the next
24 months and to consummate a business combination. Those estimates may prove
inaccurate, especially if a portion of the available proceeds is used to make a
deposit or down payment or pay exclusivity or similar fees in connection with an
initial business combination or if we expend a significant portion of the
available proceeds in pursuit of an initial business combination that is not
consummated. If our estimates prove inaccurate, our ability to consummate an
initial business combination may be impaired, and if we are required to dissolve
and liquidate upon our failure to complete a business combination, the amount
distributed to our public stockholders could be subject to reduction compared to
our estimates as a result of the claims of creditors. 

However, if we do not have sufficient proceeds available to cover our expenses,
we may be required to obtain additional financing, either from our executive
officers and directors, Union Street Capital Management, LLC or third parties.
We may not be able to obtain additional financing, and none of our management,
including our executive officers and directors, our existing stockholders or
Union Street Capital Management, LLC is obligated to provide any additional
financing. If we do not have sufficient proceeds not held in the trust account
and cannot find additional financing, we may be required to dissolve and
liquidate prior to consummating an initial business combination.

Union Street Capital Management, LLC has loaned a total of $200,000 to us for
the payment of offering expenses. The loan is interest free and will be paid
upon the completion of this offering out of the gross proceeds.

The net proceeds of this offering that are not immediately required for the
purposes set forth above will be held in the trust account and invested only in
money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under
the 1940 Act, or securities issued by the United States so that we are not
deemed to be an investment company under the 1940 Act.

Other than (i) the repayment of the $200,000 loan described above and
(ii) administrative services arrangement for services rendered to us, no
compensation of any kind, including finder’s and consulting fees, will be paid
to any of our executive officers, directors, or existing stockholders or any of
their respective affiliates prior to or in connection with the initial business
combination. However, our executive officers and directors will receive
reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with
activities on our behalf, such as participating in the offering process,
identifying potential target businesses, and performing due diligence on
suitable business combinations. Since the role of our current executive officers
and directors after an initial business combination is uncertain, we have no
ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons
after an initial business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account,
including interest earned on its pro rata portion of the funds in the trust
account (net of taxes payable and after release of up to $1,500,000 of interest
income, after tax, to fund working capital requirements, including the costs of
our dissolution and liquidation), only in the event of our dissolution and
liquidation upon our failure to consummate an initial business combination or if
that public stockholder were to seek to convert shares into cash in connection
with our initial business combination that the public stockholder previously
voted against and which we actually consummate. In no other circumstances will a
public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust
account.


In identifying, evaluating, and selecting a target business for an initial
business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities
having a business objective similar to ours including other blank check
companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating
businesses seeking acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and
have extensive experience identifying and consummating business combinations
directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess
greater financial, technical, human, and other resources than us. While we
believe there are numerous potential target businesses with which we could
combine, our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our
available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an
advantage in pursuing an initial business combination with a target business. In
addition: 

    •   the requirement that we obtain stockholder approval of an initial business 
        combination and audited and perhaps interim-unaudited financial information
        to be included in the proxy statement to be sent to stockholders in        
        connection with such business combination may delay or prevent the         
        consummation of a transaction;                                             

    •   the conversion of common stock held by our public stockholders into cash   
        may reduce the resources available to us to fund an initial business       
        combination;                                                               

    •   our outstanding warrants, and the dilution they potentially represent, may 
        not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses; and                  

    •   the requirement to acquire assets or an operating business that has a fair 
        market value at least equal to 80% of the balance in the trust account     
        (less the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions and taxes        
        payable) at the time of the initial business combination could require us  
        to acquire several assets or closely related operating businesses at the   
        same time, all of which sales would be contingent on the closings of the   
        other sales, which could make it more difficult to consummate the initial  
        business combination.                                                   

Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully
negotiating an initial business combination. Our executive officers and
directors believes, however, that a privately held target business may view our
status as a well-financed public entity as offering advantages over other
entities that have a business objective similar to ours.

Identifying, executing and realizing attractive returns on business combinations
is highly competitive and involves a high degree of uncertainty. We expect to
encounter intense competition for potential target businesses from other
entities having a business objective similar to ours, including venture capital
funds, leveraged buyout funds, operating businesses, and other entities and
individuals, both foreign and domestic. Many of these competitors are well
established and have extensive experience in identifying and consummating
business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors
possess greater technical, human and other resources than we do, and or
financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of
many of these competitors. Furthermore, over the past several years, other
“blank check” companies have been formed, and a number of such companies have
grown in size, for the purpose of investing in the business service and related
industries. Additional investment funds and blank check companies with similar
investment objectives as ours may be formed in the future by other unrelated
parties and these funds and companies may have substantially more capital and
may be able to have access to and utilize additional financing on more
attractive terms. While we believe that there are numerous potential target
businesses with which we could combine using the net proceeds of this offering,
together with additional financing, if available, our ability to compete in
combining with certain sizeable target businesses will be limited by our
available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others
an advantage in pursuing an initial business combination with certain target
businesses. In addition:

    •   the requirement that we obtain stockholder approval of an initial business 
        combination may delay or prevent the consummation of an initial business   
        combination within the 18-month or 24-month time periods;                  

    •   the requirement that we prepare audited and perhaps interim-unaudited      
        financial information to be included in the proxy statement to be sent to  
        stockholders in connection with such business combination may delay or     
        prevent the consummation of a transaction;                                 

    •   the conversion of common stock held by our public stockholders into cash   
        may reduce the resources available to us to fund an initial business       
        combination;                                                               

    •   our outstanding warrants, and the dilution they potentially represent, may 
        not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses; and                  

    •   the requirement to acquire assets or an operating business that have a fair
        market value at least equal to 80% of the balance in the trust account     
        (less the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions and taxes        
        payable) at the time of the initial business combination could require us  
        to acquire several assets or closely related operating businesses at the   
        same time, all of which sales would be contingent on the closings of the   
        other sales, which could make it more difficult to consummate the initial  
        business combination.                                                      

Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in consummating
an initial business combination on favorable terms or at all.

If we succeed in consummating an initial business combination, there will, in
all likelihood, be intense competition from competitors of the target
businesses. In particular, certain industries that experience rapid growth
frequently attract an increasingly larger number of competitors, including
competitors with increasingly greater financial, marketing, technical, human,
and other resources than the initial competitors in the industry. The degree of
competition characterizing the industry of any prospective target business
cannot presently be ascertained. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to an
initial business combination, we will have the resources to compete effectively,
especially to the extent that the acquired businesses are in high-growth
industries.


Company Description
We are a recently organized blank check company formed for the purpose of
acquiring, through a business combination, one or more operating businesses in
the business services industry in North America. To date, our efforts have been
limited solely to organizational activities. The business services


 industry, a
subset of the services sector, encompasses companies that undertake the
management, delivery or operation of one or more business processes or functions
of other companies. Among the areas that we intend to focus on are marketing
services, business information services, human capital management, facilities
and logistics services and professional services.

We do not have any specific business combination under consideration and we have
not, nor has anyone on our behalf, contacted any prospective target business or
had any discussions, formal or otherwise, with respect to such a transaction. We
have not, nor have any of our agents or affiliates, been approached by any
prospective target business, or representatives of any prospective target
business, with respect to a possible business combination with our company.
Additionally, we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, taken any measure,
directly or indirectly, to identify or locate a specific target business nor
have we engaged or retained any agent or other representative to identify or
locate a specific target business.

We intend to direct our efforts on identifying target companies in the business
services industry that have at least one of the following characteristics:

    •   a strong fundamental, under-capitalized business with the potential to     
        further grow its services, products, brands and/or geographic reach;       

    •   a valuable asset embedded in an underperforming business that would be more
        effectively utilized by improved management or technological or operational
        improvements; and                                                          

    •   a service or product offering that may be enhanced by one or more “bolt on”
        acquisitions to complete the service or product offering of a target       
        company.                                                                   

We believe that the skills and experience of our executive officers will be
crucial to consummating a successful business combination. Our executive
officers and directors have over 140 years of collective experience and a proven
track record of advising, acquiring, building, operating and selling public and
private business services companies. Our team includes:

    •   A. Clayton Perfall, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, is
        Chief Executive Officer of AHL Services, Inc. and, for four years, was the 
        Chief Financial Officer of Snyder Communications, Inc.                     

     He has served on the board of directors of companies sponsored by the       
     Carlyle Group, Bain Capital and GTCR Golder Rauner.                         

    •   Brian H. Burke, our Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Director, was   
        Chief Financial Officer of AHL Services Inc. and was Vice President of     
        Corporate Development of Snyder Communications, Inc. He has been a business
        partner with Mr. Perfall for over 20 years.                                

    •   Matthew C. Fletchall, our Vice-President of Corporate Development and      
        Secretary, was Vice President of Corporate Development of AHL Services,    
        Inc. He has been a colleague of both Mr. Perfall and Mr. Burke since 1995. 

    •   John T. Schwieters, our Director, as Vice Chairman of Perseus, LLC, is     
        involved in sourcing, acquiring, operating and selling middle-market       
        businesses. He is also a director of Manor Care Inc., Smithfield Foods,    
        Danaher Corporation and Choice Hotels International and the former Managing
        Partner of Arthur Andersen’s Mid-Atlantic region.                          

    •   Eran Broshy, our Director, is the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of  
        inVentiv Health, Inc. (Nasdaq: VTIV), a leading provider of outsourced     
        clinical, communications and commercial services to the pharmaceutical and 
        life sciences industry. InVentiv was recently ranked number 15 on FORTUNE  
        Magazine’s 100 Fastest-Growing Companies listing for 2006.                 

    •   David B. Kay, our Director, as Managing Director of Navigant Consulting,   
        leads a practice that provides financial, accounting and operational       
        consulting services to large, complex multinational companies.             

Our executive officers and directors have built and maintained extensive
networks of relationships that we plan to use to identify and generate
acquisition opportunities. These relationships include, among other sources,
executives and board members at public and private companies, business brokers,
private equity and venture capital firms, consultants, investment bankers,
attorneys and accountants.

Our executive officers currently intend to stay involved in our management
following an initial business combination. The roles that they will assume will
depend on the type of business with which we combine and the specific skills and
depth of the target company’s management. If one or more of our executive
officers remain with our company, we may enter into employment or other
compensation arrangements with them following an initial business combination,
the terms of which have not yet been determined.

While we may seek to consummate business combinations with more than one target
business, our initial business combination must be with one or more operating
businesses whose fair market value is at least equal to 80% of the balance in
the trust account (less the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions and
taxes payable) at the time of such acquisition. As a result, we expect that an
initial public offering of $100,000,000 will enable us to consummate an initial
business combination with a business whose fair market value is at least
$75,840,000. The actual amount of consideration which we will be able to pay for
the initial business combination will depend on whether we choose, or are able,
to pay a portion of the initial business combination consideration with shares
of our common stock or if we are able to finance a portion of the consideration
with debt or equity financing. No financing arrangements have been entered into
or contemplated with any third parties to raise any additional funds, whether
through the sale of securities or otherwise, that we may need if we decide to
consummate an initial business combination for consideration in excess of our
available assets at the time of acquisition.

We were organized and sponsored by Union Street Capital Management, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company owned and controlled by our executive
officers, which has as its members family trusts affiliated with A. Clayton
Perfall and Brian H. Burke and Matthew C. Fletchall individually. Union Street
Capital Management, LLC will provide administrative services to us, but
otherwise has no business activities other than sponsoring us.

We are a Delaware corporation formed on July 18, 2006. Our offices are located
at 102 South Union Street, Alexandria, VA 22314 and our telephone number is
(703) 682-0730.
