PRTX-100

About PRTX-100
PRTX-100 is a formulation of a proprietary, highly purified form of the Staphylococcal Protein A, which is an immunomodulatory protein produced by Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. PRTX-100 has the ability, at very low concentrations, to bind to human B-lymphocytes and macrophages and to modulate immune processes that mediate inflammation in certain autoimmune diseases. Laboratory studies indicate that the mechanism involves interaction with specific immunologic signaling pathways. Pre-clinical animal studies also demonstrate that very low doses of PRTX-100 have potent therapeutic effects in certain models of immune mediated inflammatory diseases. To date, human clinical studies indicate that PRTX-100 is generally safe and well tolerated at all dose levels evaluated.
Staphylococcal protein A (SpA) is a bacterial virulence factor which structurally consists of five homologous immunoglobulin (Ig) binding domains placed in tandem.1 Each SpA domain is capable of binding with high affinity to the Fc region of human IgG and also binds to the Fab framework region of Igs in the mammalian VH3 gene family.2 This ability to bind to VH3 Igs results in SpA being one of the best characterized mammalian B-cell superantigens.
Non-clinical papers suggest that SpA, in the presence of excess serum IgG, may form small complexes of SpA and IgG, 3 which in vitro and in vivo can induce ‘alternatively activated’ or ‘regulatory’ macrophages. These have an anti-inflammatory phenotype, and such complexes may have activity in the mouse collagen induced arthritis model.4 SpA also interacts directly with VH3 B cells in mice and, at doses of 5 or 50 mg/kg, can cause activation followed by apoptosis of VH3 expressing B-cells.5

PRTX-100 Clinical Experience
The Company has completed five clinical studies in man. In January 2012 Protalex completed a Phase 1b clinical trial in adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in South Africa (Study PRTX-100-103) which demonstrated that PRTX-100 was generally safe and well tolerated at all dose levels, and at the higher doses, more patients showed improvement in their CDAI (Clinical Disease Activity Index) for RA than did patients at the lower dose or placebo cohorts. In November 2012, Protalex commenced a new Phase 1b double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter, multiple-dose, dose escalation study (Study PRTX-100-104) in patients with active RA at nine U.S. sites to investigate safety and possible treatment effects at higher doses. Protalex completed dosing of the final cohort in this U.S. Study in July 2014 and reported top line data from the fifth and final cohort in the fourth quarter of 2014. The Company has commenced enrollment of PRTX-100-203.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Growth Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
