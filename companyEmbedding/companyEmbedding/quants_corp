Stock-market volatility was so low in the first few months of the year that some analysts said bad times were coming soon. Then the market got calmer. Over half of the 25 lowest readings ever in the...

Dear colleagues,The Inventory Revaluation is now implemented, and proposed PR to OCA. Runbot is green. Still is missing automated tests and greenify travis for pep8 issues.Pull Request: https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-warehouse/pull/118Runbot: http://3141377-118-a1c846.runbot1.odoo-community.org/web?debug=1* It supports revaluation under standard, moving average and real cost methods.* It allows you to revaluate the inventory by specifying a new unit cost, or by specifying the change in the overall inventory value (which will adjust the corresponding unit cost)* In moving average costing method, the new average cost is computed and updated in the product.As Eric suggested, for Real costing method user can select the quants to be revaluated, based on a date range, and then can change the cost. If the product is managed under real-time valuation the corresponding journal entries will be created:When product value is increased:Dr. Inventory Cr. Inventory Valuation Increase AccountWhen product value is decreased:Cr. InventoryDr. Inventory Valuation Decrease AccountRegards,Jordi.On Wed, Feb 10, 2016 at 9:08 AM, Eric Caudal <eric.caudal@elico-corp.com> wrote:+1.
    IMO  a date "as of" (or range) should be provided for the change of
    price or the possibility to pick the involved quants.
    Standard price in product should be recalculate a posteriori

      Dear accounting experts,
        
We're addressing the topic of inventory revaluation. That
          is, you don't like the value of a product (e.g. obsolescence,
          solve issues in valuation, wrong PO price, etc..), and you
          need to change it.

In Odoo you are offered the option to change the standard
          price of the product, and under real time valuation this
          produces a corresponding inventory posting entries.

But since Odoo manages Quants, and each Quant keeps it's
          purchase cost (and hopefully manufacture cost in we can add
          support for that soon), the standard price field in the
          product is irrelevant as a stored field, because should really
          be the result of the cost of the quants. 

Under the FIFO costing, the price of the product to be
          shown would be the cost of the first quant for that product.
          In reality Odoo is using FIFO costing method because it
          considers the cost of the quant to generate the accounting
          entries in stock moves...

If you are to undergo an inventory revaluation, wouldn't
          you need then to revaluate the quants, and not the product
          standard prices? Revaluating a quant would as a consequence
          generate the corresponding accounting entries for inventory
          revaluation.

“It’s quiet out there. Too quiet.” The number of times that this movie cliché turned trading cliché has appeared in market commentaries recently is a testament to how dull trading has been and how nervous investors are about it. Stock-market volatility was so low in the first few months of the year that some analysts said bad times were coming soon. Then the market got calmer. Over half of the 25 lowest readings ever in the...

About QuantsHome About Quants









Who We Are
Quants and its subsidiaries develop and publish risk indices with financial derivatives, portfolio models for smart beta investing, and market and operate liquid alternative funds and financial technology platforms for superior risk management since 2010. The company combines decades of experience and intellectual properties in the quantitative risk analysis and portfolio optimization with derivative overlays, and has been providing services to the institutional clients since inception.
Quants Capital Management, Inc is registered with California Department of Business Oversight as a Registered Investment Adviser (CRD # 153124) and with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission as a commodity pool operator. Quants Capital is also a member of the National Futures Association (NFA ID # 0418577).
The company has headquarters in Los Angeles and offices in New York, London and Istanbul.


What We Do
Quants develops complete portfolio solutions with real-time risk scenarios in quantitative platforms and is dedicated to offering strategic alternative products for investors, advisors and fund managers. The company is planning to streamline and democratize the sophisticated risk management by releasing new Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) that are using derivative overlays and an online platform for automation (Robo-Advisor).
The investment portfolios consist of the major index investments in stocks and bonds with the risk management in the financial derivatives. These alternative investment models historically outperform the traditional mutual funds. Quants's investment model optimizes the risk and return profile of the portfolios for potentially better risk-adjusted returns than the benchmark indices. Quants generated 74% annual returns in its managed accounts after all fees and expenses in 2012-2013 with its risk management models.


OverviewQuants develops software generally specialized in analyzing the global markets and risk management with the financial derivatives. The main trading focus of the firm has been in derivative overlays on large cap indices, major industries, US Treasuries and select commodities. The software assets maximize the profits through the optimal asset allocation and rotations, generally with a hedged approach according to the trend and volatility characteristics without tactical trading.
Quants has been licensing its software assets to the high net worth and institutional investors since 2011. The support services included providing the consulting and specialist trading services in the derivatives markets and customizing them for the strategic alternative trading and investment platforms. The partnerships with private and institutional investors provided Quants the corporate investments and revenues to keep improving on its investment programs since inception.
The firm has established a track record in derivative overlays, but especially focused on the index and sector investments with the statistical volatility strategies since 2012. Quants currently operates its own US and offshore liquid alternative smart beta index funds, and provide the specialist services in executing the derivative overlays for institutional risk management. Currently, portfolio and fund offerings target to achieve better risk-adjusted returns by reducing the risk exposure (Sharpe near or over 2) and to maximize the investable capacity in a slower paced execution environments.  
Quants is also introducing the Exchange Traded Funds (“ETFs”) to streamline the risk and return optimization and portfolio insurance process, and provide liquidity for the creation units of the ETFs from its liquid alternative fund assets. The ETFs will allow the complexities of derivative overlays to be abstracted and offer instead easily applicable, better risk-managed portfolios in both institutional and individual investment accounts.
Quants’s asset allocation methods are applicable to the institutions and advisors following the traditional index and industry investments in the long term portfolios while looking to mitigate the portfolio volatility in the short to medium term.
