Career[edit]
Sorkin graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1975 (Phi Beta Kappa). In 1977 he received a Masters degree in Comparative Literature, and in 1983 a PhD in History from the University of California-Berkeley.[4]
From 1983 to 1986 he worked as Assistant Professor of Judaic studies at Brown University. In 1986 he became a Research Fellow and in 1990 a Lecturer in Modern History at Oxford University. He was a Governing Body Fellow at St. Antony's College and a Fellow of the Oxford Centre for Postgraduate Hebrew Studies. From 1992 to 2011 he was Frances and Laurence Weinstein Professor of Jewish Studies and Professor of History at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.[5] From 2011 to 2014 he served as Distinguished Professor of History at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. In 2014 he moved to Yale where he is the Lucy G. Moses Professor in the Department of History and Program in Judaic Studies.[6]
Sorkin has published several prominent works on Jewish history.[7] His first book, The Transformation of Germany Jewry, 1780-1840 published in 1987, argued that Jewish culture in the German states constituted a “subculture.”[8] In 1996 he wrote Moses Mendelssohn and the Religious Enlightenment, a concise study of Mendelssohn's Jewish thought in which he emphasized the neglected Hebrew writings. The book has been translated into French, German, and Italian.[9]
In 2000 he wrote The Berlin Haskalah and German Religious Thought: Orphans of Knowledge. The book, first delivered in 1997 as the Sherman Lectures in the Department of Religions and Theology at Manchester University (UK), argued that the Haskalah should be understood within the context of wider Central European religious and intellectual changes.[10] In his most recent book, The Religious Enlightenment: Protestants, Jews, and Catholics from London to Vienna (Jews, Christians, and Muslims from the Ancient to the Modern World) published in 2008, Sorkin reconceived the relationship of the Enlightenment to religion.[11]
Sorkin has also co-edited three volumes: Profiles in Diversity: Jews in a Changing Europe, 1750-1870 (1998),[12] New Perspectives on the Haskalah (2001),[13] and What History Tells: George L. Mosse and the Culture of Modern Europe (2004).[14] He also served as associate editor of The Oxford Handbook of Jewish Studies (2002), which won the National Jewish Book Award.[15]
Reception[edit]
Sorkin’s books have had a notable impact.[16][17] The American Historical Review described Sorkin’s The Religious Enlightenment: Protestants, Jews, and Catholics from London to Vienna as a work that makes “very interesting discoveries about the parallel developments within different religions in the eighteenth century." Similarly, the New York Times described it as a “persuasive work” about how “Europe’s major religions produced movements of religious reform compatible with the enlightenment.”[18] Central European History reviewed it as a book of "very great importance, for early modernists and modern historians alike."[19]
Sorkin has received fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities (1994-5) and the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation (2005-06). He is a fellow of the American Academy for Jewish Research.

Lucy G. Moses Professor of Modern Jewish Historydavid.sorkin@yale.eduOffice: HGS 202Phone: 203-432-1367CV:  sorkin_cv.pdfFields of interest: Intersection of Jewish history and European history since the 16th century
Bio: <br>
David Sorkin joined the Yale History faculty in 2014.  He is interested in finding new approaches to the intersection of Jewish and European history since the 16th century. 
He first examined the formation of Jewish culture in the German states, which he came to understand as a “subculture.” The Transformation of German Jewry, 1780-1840 (1987) won the Present Tense/Joel H. Cavior Literary Award for History. In a commissioned study of Moses Mendelssohn’s Jewish thought he emphasized the neglected Hebrew works. Moses Mendelssohn and the Religious Enlightenment (1996) has been translated into French, German and Italian. In the Sherman Lectures delivered at Manchester University (UK) he used comparison to remove the “Haskalah” (Jewish Enlightenment) from its conventional parochial setting. Those lectures were published as The Berlin Haskalah and German Religious Thought (2000).  In his most recent book he crossed confessional boundaries and national borders to reconceive the relationship of the Enlightenment to religion. The Religious Enlightenment:  Protestants, Jews and Catholics from London to Vienna (2008), was featured in a New York Times’ “Beliefs” column (October 11, 2008, A21). 
He is the co-editor of three volumes.  Profiles in Diversity:  Jews in a Changing Europe, 1750-1870 (1998) studies how individual Jews and families experienced major historical changes.  New Perspectives on the Haskalah (2001) emerged from the first international conference devoted to the subject.  “What History Tells”: George L. Mosse and the Culture of Modern Europe (2004) is a tribute to his undergraduate teacher and mentor.  He also served as Associate Editor of The Oxford Handbook of Jewish Studies (2002), which won the National Jewish Book Award.
He is currently writing a history of Jewish emancipation in Europe (tentative title:  “Interminable Emancipation:  European Jews and the Search for Equality, 1550-2000”).  He has published three preliminary studies of key issues:  “Beyond the East-West Divide: Rethinking the Narrative of the Jews’ Political Status in Europe, 1600-1750,” Jewish History 24 (2010) 247-56; ”Is American Jewry ‘Exceptional’?  Comparing Jewish Emancipation in Europe and America,” American Jewish History 96 (September, 2010) 175-200; “The Count Stanislas de Clermont-Tonnerre’s ‘To the Jews as a Nation ….’; The Career of a Quotation,” Jacob Katz Memorial Lecture 2011 (Jerusalem:  Leo Baeck Institute, 2012).  
He has received grants from the British Academy, the National Endowment for the Humanities and the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation.  He has twice been a Visiting Professor at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales (Paris) and has taught at the Scuola Normale Superiore (Pisa).  He has also been a Visiting Fellow at the Max Planck Institut für Geschichte (Göttingen); All Souls College, Oxford; the Center for Advanced Judaic Studies at the University of Pennsylvania; and the Swedish Collegium for Advanced Study, Uppsala. 
He previously taught at Brown (1983-86), Oxford (1986-92), the University of Wisconsin-Madison (1992-2011) and the City University of New York-Graduate Center (2011-14).

                           The transformation of German Jewry from 1780 to 1840 exemplified a twofold revolution: on one level, the end of the feudal
                              status of Jews as an autonomous community forced them to face a protracted process of political emancipation, a far-reaching
                              social metamorphosis, and growing racial anti-Semitism; yet, on another level, their encounter with the surrounding culture
                              resulted in their own intense cultural productivity. In this ground-breaking study, David Sorkin argues that emancipation
                              and encounter with German culture and society led not to assimilation but to the creation of a new Jewish identity and community--a
                              true and vibrant subculture that produced many of Judaism's modern movements and fostered a pantheon of outstanding writers,
                              artists, composers, scientists, and academics. He contends that German-Jewish subculture was based not, as widely believed,
                              on nationalistic--Jewish versus German--or religious--Jewish versus Christian--disparities, but rather on the struggle for
                              freedom and social acceptance in German society. By studying German Jewry's cultural history in its social and political context,
                              as well as in the larger setting of German history, this study firmly asserts that the subculture both distinguished German
                              Jewry from other European Jewish communities and accounted for its members' prominent role in Jewish and general culture

                           From the Publisher: "Sorkin is right to argue that enlightenment and faith went together for most participants in the Enlightenment,
                              and that this is a major topic that has been relatively neglected. He has written an outstanding and eminently accessible
                              book bringing the whole question centrally to scholars' attention. He skillfully demonstrates that all confessions and religious
                              traditions found themselves very much in a common predicament and sought similar solutions."--Jonathan Israel, Institute for
                              Advanced Study" Powerfully cogent. Sorkin seeks to show that the 'religious Enlightenment' was not a contradiction in terms
                              but was an integral and central part of the Enlightenment. Anyone interested in the history of the Enlightenment in particular
                              or the eighteenth century in general will want to read this book. Sorkin is one of the leading scholars working in the field.
                              His scholarship is as wide as it is deep."-Tim Blanning, University of Cambridge

                           Moses Mendelssohn (1729-1786) was the premier Jewish thinker of his day who was recognized, in the phrase "from Moses unto
                              Moses there was none like Moses," as the legitimate successor to the medieval Moses Maimonides. At the same time, Mendelssohn
                              was one of the best-known figures of the German Enlightenment, earning the sobriquet "the Socrates of Berlin." Because of
                              his eminence in both spheres, Mendelssohn has been treated as a symbol of the modern Jewish predicament: the conflict between
                              Jewish tradition and secular culture. Moses Mendelssohn and the Religious Enlightenment presents a new interpretation of Mendelssohn's
                              work. David Sorkin offers a close study of Mendelssohn's complete writings, treating the German and the often neglected Hebrew
                              writings as a single corpus. By showing that Mendelssohn's well-known German pronouncements on Judaism and religion take on
                              a different meaning when they are read in the context of his entire body of work, Sorkin argues that Mendelssohn's two spheres
                              of endeavor were entirely consistent

                           "In 1880 the Jewish community in Palestine encompassed some 20,000 Orthodox Jews; within sixty-five years it was transformed
                              into a secular proto-state with well-developed political, military, and economic institutions, a vigorous Hebrew-language
                              culture, and some 600,000 inhabitants. The Origins of Israel, 1882-1948: A Documentary History chronicles the making of modern
                              Israel before statehood, providing in English the texts of original sources (many translated from Hebrew and other languages)
                              accompanied by extensive introductions and commentaries from the volume editors. This sourcebook assembles a diverse array
                              of 62 documents, many of them unabridged, to convey the ferment, dissent, energy, and anxiety that permeated the Zionist project
                              from its inception to the creation of the modern nation of Israel. Focusing primarily on social, economic, and cultural history
                              rather than Zionist thought and diplomacy, the texts are organized in themed chapters. They present the views of Zionists
                              from many political and religious camps, factory workers, farm women, militants, intellectuals promoting the Hebrew language
                              and arts--as well as views of ultra-Orthodox anti-Zionists. The volume includes important unabridged documents from the origins
                              of the Arab-Israeli conflict that are often cited but are rarely read in full. The editors, Eran Kaplan and Derek J. Penslar,
                              provide both primary texts and informative notes and commentary, giving readers the opportunity to encounter voices from history
                              and make judgments for themselves about matters of world-historical significance."--Publisher's description

                              "In this provocative work, first given as the Sherman Lectures at Manchester University (1997), David Sorkin takes issue with
                                 the conventional view of the Berlin Haskalah as a peculiarly Jewish phenomenon by comparing it with Protestant and Catholic
                                 parallels in German-speaking central Europe." "This work offers a new perspective on the Haskalah that will be of interest
                                 to all concerned with modern Jewish history, German history and religion in the modern world."--Jacket

Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.

Lulu abides by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), which governs how we are to treat claims of copyright infringement. If someone believes in good faith that a Lulu Account Holder has infringed their copyright, they can request that we take down the infringing material by filing a DMCA Notice. To file a DMCA Notice with Lulu, click on the button "Continue".
We reserve the right to ignore a Notice that is not in compliance with the DMCA. When a clear and valid Notice is received pursuant to the guidelines, we will respond by either taking down the allegedly infringing content or blocking access to it, and we may also contact you for more information.
If you are not the copyright holder or its agent and if the content is clearly infringing the copyright of a well-known work, please select "Infringes a well-known work" from the dropdown menu.
