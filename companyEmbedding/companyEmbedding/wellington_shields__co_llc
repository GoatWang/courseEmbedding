 Mutual FundsAll Cap Fund Fact Sheet
 


Wellington Shields All‐Cap Mutual Fund (WSCMX)
Wellington Shields All Cap Mutual Fund (WSCMX) has an objective of capital appreciation. The managers use a G.A.A.R.P philosophy to invest in high quality companies with above market growth potential.
Earnings Growth
WSCMX owns a portfolio that in aggregate has an outlook for above market earnings growth.
Capitalization Focus
The Fund invests across the capitalization spectrum but owns a core portfolio of large and mid‐cap names representing over 80% of the portfolio. The balance of the portfolio may be invested in smaller capitalization names offering the prospect of exceptional growth.
Dividend and Cash Generation
While WSCMX does not have a current income objective, it targets businesses that produce free cash flow, giving flexibility to return cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks or to reinvest in their business. As a result not all holdings pay a dividend.
Sector Diversification
Sectors and industries come into and out of favor in an unpredictable manner. Therefore we maintain exposure to quality companies in all major sectors of the S&P 500, targeting sector weights of no more than double, and no less than half of the major sectors of the S&P 500.
Risk Control
WSCMX targets initial positions weightings of approximately 3.3%. If a position decreases 15% in value from its original cost, it is reviewed by the investment committee. If a position appreciates to 7.5% of the portfolio, the investment committee evaluates taking profits.
The Fund may hold up to 20% of its assets in cash.

 After working for nearly a year with a rival investment bank to finance an acquisition, we approached Wellington Shields at year-end and told them we needed to get a deal done quickly since our LOI was about to expire. Ed Cabrera and Wellington spent time with us to understand the transaction, they developed a unique marketing strategy and were successful in raising us $4.5 million between Christmas and New Years, to our amazement. The professionalism of Wellington Shields and their creativity has led us to make Wellington Shields our go-to bankers
- John Salerno, iGambit, Inc Chairman, CEO
