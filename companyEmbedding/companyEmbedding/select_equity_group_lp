July 2017
                                
                                            Overall very positive culture and relatively flat organization.  Leadership is willing and often solicites feedback on a wide range of subjects. Discussions with HR are currently taking place on increasing primary and non-primary caregiver leave - fingers crossed this is approved and launched soon, as currently policies are a bit behind.  There are also several wellness initiatives and plenty of awesome benefits that balance this out however (ex: new mothers rooms, meditation / prayer rooms, wellness rooms, yoga and pilates classes at the office, meditation sessions, several discount partnerships with surrounding retailers, college coach and women's leadership seminars etc....)

Flexibility depends on your department and your manager.  Most managers are flexible and accomodating, but the stigma that comes with it within the culture is bad.  A big part of that problem is the constant abuse of the flexibility and lack of accountability.  It penalizes the conscious, hardworking employees and encourages the ones with a lack in work ethic.  This is a major issue within the organization as a whole.  The company needs more accountability.

                                                                                                    Maybe. I think its a great place to start and depending on the woman and manager can be a great place to florish.  However there are major challenges as a woman in this organization including equal pay, equal treatement, and a double-standard culture.

Our initial focus on US small-mid cap investing evolved in the late 1990s to include larger cap companies, then in the early 2000s to include international businesses and in 2015 to include private investments.Our research universe has now grown to over 1,000 businesses across geographies and market capitalizations.

    Our investment and research process provides a consistent, rigorous and repeatable approach to identifying and analyzing businesses. This has allowed us to deliver absolute returns for our clients while preserving capital and mitigating downside risk. 



							Our analyst team identifies and vets its own ideas through a disciplined, bottom-up process that often entails years of study before a core investment is made. Our analysts are members of a collective research pool that supports all portfolios at the Firm. 
						

							Our research is conducted independently with a focus on developing fresh perspectives on companies or value chains. In order to preserve our objectivity, Select Equity analysts make almost no use of Wall Street research on the long side and do not actively exchange insights with our peers.  As a result, we believe our portfolios tend to be highly differentiated from those of other managers. 
						

							Our process includes extensive quantitative analysis as well as qualitative fieldwork conducted by a dedicated team of six former financial journalists and five sourcing specialists. 
						

							Our analysts are generalists, but focus on value chain analysis, studying suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and customers within specialized areas of the economy, and looking at companies across geographies and market capitalizations. 
						

							Our focus on detailed value chain analysis is driven by the multi-year holding period for most of our core investments; we are interested in predicting a company’s earnings power during the next three to five years rather than in the next quarter. 
						

							By investing in businesses with clean balance sheets, strong market positions, predictable growth, sustainable barriers to competition and the ability to prosper regardless of economic cycles, we hope to reduce the risk of significant capital loss even in the face of adverse news. In evaluating potential investment opportunities, we weigh downside risk more heavily than upside reward. 
						

							Portfolio managers have primary responsibility to oversee and manage risk but generally do so within clear portfolio-specific guidelines on leverage, position sizing, concentration, market cap exposure and other metrics.

    Select Equity Group manages over $20 billion across long-only and long/short equity strategies that share a fundamental investment philosophy and centralized research effort. The Firm was founded on the premise that rigorous, independent research and disciplined investing will generate superior returns for our clients. Our investment team of over 40 professionals includes a 12-person field research division composed of former journalists and sourcing specialists.We seek to identify the highest quality businesses that the public markets have to offer – those with strong, predictable growth, high returns on invested capital and well-established barriers to competition. We are not interested in owning most businesses at any price. We make minimal use of Wall Street research, and we do not actively share our insights with peers. Our independent process and focus on a narrow subset of businesses has delivered portfolios that we believe are meaningfully different than those of our peers.The Firm is employee owned and has been located at 380 Lafayette Street in lower Manhattan since the early 1990s.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
