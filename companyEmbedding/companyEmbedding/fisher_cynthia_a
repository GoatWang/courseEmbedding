Description



Access to case studies expires six months after purchase date.



Publication Date: December 21, 2005

 Describes the start up of Viacord, a Boston-based medical services firm founded by Cynthia Fisher (HBS MBA) in 1993. Told from Fisher's perspective, the entrepreneur details the conceptualization and launch of the business and the many obstacles and expenses faced in the company's first seven years. Fisher describes the venture capital negotiations and a merger with a biotech company that led to the creation of ViaCell in 2000. Fisher explains how her role changed from founder and CEO of Viacord to president and then board member of ViaCell, and carries the firm's story to the successful 2005 IPO.
