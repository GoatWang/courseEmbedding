DetailsMovie DescriptionConnie Sumner (Diane Lane) travels to New York City from the suburban home she shares with her husband Edward (Richard Gere) and young son Charlie (Erik Per Sullivan). It is a very windy day and, caught by a particularly savage gust, Connie falls and bumps into bookseller Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez) in the process. She scrapes her knees, and Paul invites her into his apartment. She stays only briefly, leaving after attending to her knees. She passes the accident off as trivial to Edward. But, she is drawn to the younger man and soon returns to his apartment with eventually disastrous results.UNFAITHFUL is based on Claude Chabrol's classic LA FEMME INFIDELE (1969). The drama has been shifted from Paris to New York City by scriptwriters Alvin Sargent and William Broyles Jr. Beautifully lit by director of photography Peter Biziou, UNFAITHFUL is staged with rare subtlety by director Adrian Lyne. Diane Lane gives an extraordinarily fine performance, viscerally conveying how torn Connie is between her attraction for Paul and her love for Edward and Charlie. There is excellent support from Gere, Martinez, Sullivan and Zeljko Ivanek. UNFAITHFUL is the rare case of a remake that measures up to, and maybe even surpasses, the original.CreditsCast:Diane Lane, Richard GereDirector:Adrian LyneProducer:Adrian Lyne, G. Mac BrownIndustry Reviews"...Slick, sleek...Erotic....Lane's finely emotional presentation is the film's convincer..."Los Angeles Times - Kenneth Turan (05/08/2002)"...UNFAITHFUL has a taut, economical screenplay..."New York Times - Stephen Holden (05/08/2002)"...Filmed both sensually and thoughtfully, thanks in part to a performance by Diane Lane that gracefully turns from forcefully sensual to weary..."USA Today - Mike Clark (05/10/2002)"...Lane is a force of nature. Her slow-burning, fiercely erotic performance charges the movie..."Rolling Stone - Peter Travers (06/06/2002)"...Sensational sex-and-its-consequences melodrama....Lane, in the most urgent performance of her career, is a revelation..."Entertainment Weekly - Owen Gleiberman (05/17/2002)"The film is Ms. Lane's from start to finish; she gives a sensationally fine performance."Wall Street Journal (10/23/2009)"...Lane serves up a compulsively watchable performance....Martinez is smoothly convincing..."Variety - Todd McCarthy (05/06/2002)"...Lane reaches a new career plateau..."USA Today - Mike Clark (05/08/2002)

GET DETAILSClickFIND A STOREThe Big Humanities: Digital Humanities/Digital Laboratoriesby Lane, Richard J.This book provides an accessible introduction to, and overview of, the digital humanities, one of the fastest growing areas of literary studies. Lane takes a unique approach by focusing on the technologies and the new environment in which the digital humanities largely takes place: the digital laboratory. The book provides a brief history of DH, explores and explains the methodologies of past and current DH projects, and offers resources such as detailed case studies and bibliographies. Further, the focus on the digital laboratory space reveals affiliations with the types of research that have traditionally taken place in the sciences, as well as convergences with other fast-growing research spaces, namely innovation labs, fabrication labs, maker spaces, digital media labs, and change labs. The volume highlights the profound transformation of literary studies that is underway, one in which the adoption of powerful technology and concomitantly being situated within a laboratory environment is leading to an important re-engagement in the arts and humanities, and a renewed understanding of literary studies in the digital age, as well as a return to large-scale financial investment in humanistic research. It will be useful to students and teachers, as well as administrators and managers in charge of research infrastructure and funding decisions who need an accessible overview of this technological transformation in the humanities. Combining useful detail and an overview of the field, the book will offers accessible entry into this rapidly growing field.GeneralCondition: --HPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.
