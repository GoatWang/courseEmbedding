NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Empire State Realty Trust, Inc. (NYSE:ESRT) (the "Company"), a 
      real estate investment trust with office and retail properties in 
      Manhattan and the greater New York metropolitan area, today reported its 
      operational and financial results for the second quarter of 2017.
    

      “We are pleased with our strong second quarter results. Core FFO 
      increased 13.1% from the second quarter of 2016. We continue to 
      consolidate, redevelop and re-lease space to larger, higher credit 
      quality tenants at materially higher rents and create value. During the 
      quarter, we leased over 329,000 square feet which resulted in attractive 
      spreads on both new Manhattan office and total portfolio leases of 49.9% 
      and 31.0%, respectively. We continue to deliver on the embedded, 
      de-risked growth within our portfolio. Prospective tenants are attracted 
      to our modernized spaces within well-located, amenity-rich office 
      buildings,” stated John B. Kessler, Empire State Realty Trust’s 
      President and Chief Operating Officer.
    

      “Year-to-date, Observatory revenue grew 3.6% and Observatory net 
      operating income grew 5.5%, as compared with the first half of 2016, 
      driven by improved revenue mix despite unfavorable weather conditions. 
      We further strengthened our balance sheet through the successful 
      refinancing of our 2017 mortgage maturities which lowered our interest 
      expense and meaningfully extended our maturities. We are happy to have 
      the liquidity, strength, and flexibility of our balance sheet to fund 
      future growth opportunities and create long-term value for our 
      shareholders,” added Kessler.

Empire State Building


      The Company continues to renovate and lease the 2.8 million rentable 
      square foot Empire State Building, its flagship property. In the second 
      quarter 2017, the Company commenced the first phase of a capital project 
      to enhance the experience of office and retail tenants and Observatory 
      visitors. The first phase will move the Observatory entrance to a new, 
      larger, designated entrance at the western side of the Empire State 
      Building on 34th Street which will improve the commercial tenant and 
      office visitor experience and the value of the Empire State Building’s 34th 
      Street retail. At June 30, 2017, the Empire State Building was 92.1% 
      occupied; including SLNC, the Empire State Building was 92.4% leased.
    

      During the second quarter 2017, the Company signed 10 office leases at

      quarter 2017 compared to 1,124,000 visitors in the second quarter 2016, 
      an increase of 0.2%. A portion of this increase can be attributed to the 
      shift of the Easter weekend to the second quarter in 2017 from the first 
      quarter in 2016. In the second quarter 2017, there were 15 bad weather 
      days compared to 13 bad weather days in the second quarter 2016.
    

      Observatory revenue was $54.9 million for the six months ended June 30,

      30, 2016. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, the Observatory hosted 
      approximately 1,762,000 visitors, compared to 1,843,000 visitors for the 
      same period in 2016, a decrease of 4.4%. For the six months ended June 
      30, 2017, there were 37 bad weather days compared to 21 bad weather days 
      in the six months ended June 30, 2016.

 EMPIRE STATE REALTY TRUST, INC. (NYSE:ESRT) Files An 8-K Results of Operations and Financial ConditionItem 2.02.

The information in Item 2.02 of this Current Report, including Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, is being furnished and shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section.

As discussed in Item 2.02 above, the Company issued a press release regarding its financial results for the second quarter 2017 and made available on its website certain supplemental information relating thereto.

Supplemental report


Non-GAAP Supplemental Financial Measures 
Funds From Operations (“FFO”) 
We compute FFO in accordance with the “White Paper” on FFO published by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, which defines FFO as net income (loss) (determined in accordance with GAAP), excluding impairment writedowns of investments in depreciable real estate and investments in in-substance real estate investments, gains or losses from debt restructurings and sales of depreciable operating properties, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of 
2 
 deferred financing costs), less distributions to non-controlling interests and gains/losses from discontinued operations and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO is a widely recognized non-GAAP financial measure for REITs that we believe, when considered with financial statements determined in accordance with GAAP, is useful to investors in understanding financial performance and providing a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. In addition, FFO is useful to investors as it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate has generally appreciated over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciable assets. Investors should review FFO, along with GAAP net income, when trying to understand an equity REIT’s operating performance. We present FFO because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believe that it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs. However, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our results of operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of performance is limited. There can be no assurance that FFO presented by us is comparable to similarly titled measures of other REITs. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. FFO is not indicative of cash available to fund ongoing cash needs, including the ability to make cash distributions. Although FFO is a measure used for comparability in assessing the performance of REITs, as the NAREIT White Paper only provides guidelines for computing FFO, the computation of FFO may vary from one company to another.

Modified FFO adds back an adjustment for any above or below-market ground lease amortization to traditionally defined FFO. We consider this a useful supplemental measure in evaluating our operating performance due to the non-cash accounting treatment under GAAP, which stems from the third quarter 2014 acquisition of two option properties following our formation transactions as they carry significantly below market ground leases, the amortization of which is material to our overall results. We present Modified FFO because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance in that it adds back the non-cash amortization of below-market ground leases. There can be no assurance that Modified FFO presented by us is comparable to similarly titled measures of other REITs. Modified FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. Modified FFO is not indicative of cash available to fund ongoing cash needs, including the ability to make cash distributions. 
3 
Core Funds From Operations (“Core FFO”) 
Core FFO adds back to Modified FFO the following items: acquisition expenses, deferred financing costs write-offs, prepayment penalties and acquisition break-up fee. The Company presents Core FFO because it considers it an important supplemental measure of its operating performance in that it excludes non-recurring items. There can be no assurance that Core FFO presented by the Company is comparable to similarly titled measures of other REITs. Core FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. Core FFO is not indicative of cash available to fund ongoing cash needs, including the ability to make cash distributions. In future periods, we may also exclude other items from Core FFO that we believe may help investors compare our results. 
Core Funds Available for Distribution (“Core FAD”) 
In addition to Core FFO, we present Core FAD by (i)adding to Core FFO non-real estate depreciation and amortization, the amortization of deferred financing costs, amortization of debt discounts and non-cash compensation expense and (ii)deducting straight line rent, recurring second generation leasing commissions, tenant improvements, prebuilts, capital expenditures, furniture, fixtures& equipment purchases, amortization of debt premiums and above/below market rent revenue. Core FAD is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure that management believes provides useful information regarding our ability to fund our dividends. Core FAD does not represent cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. Core FAD is not indicative of cash available to fund ongoing cash needs, including the ability to make cash distributions. There can be no assurance that Core FAD presented by us is comparable to similarly titled measures of other REITs. 
Net Operating Income (“NOI”) 
NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance. NOI is used by our management to evaluate and compare the performance of our properties and to determine trends in earnings and to compute the fair value of our properties as it is not affected by: (i)the cost of funds of the property owner, (ii)the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets that are included in net income computed in accordance with GAAP, (iii)acquisition expenses and break-up fee, or (iv)general and administrative expenses and other gains and losses that are specific to the property owner. The cost of funds is eliminated from NOI because it is specific to the particular financing capabilities and constraints of the owner. The cost of funds is eliminated because it is dependent on historical interest rates and other costs of capital as well as past decisions made by us regarding the appropriate mix of capital which may have changed or may change in the future. Depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets are eliminated because they may not accurately represent the actual change in value in our 
4 
 office or retail properties that result from use of the properties or changes in market conditions. While certain aspects of real property do decline in value over time in a manner that is reasonably captured by depreciation and amortization, the value of the properties as a whole have historically increased or decreased as a result of changes in overall economic conditions instead of from actual use of the property or the passage of time. Gains and losses from the sale of real property vary from property to property and are affected by market conditions at the time of sale which will usually change from period to period. These gains and losses can create distortions when comparing one period to another or when comparing our operating results to the operating results of other real estate companies that have not made similarly-timed purchases or sales. We believe that eliminating these costs from net income is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual revenue, generated and actual expenses incurred in operating our properties as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. However, the usefulness of NOI is limited because it excludes general and administrative costs, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense and gains or losses from the sale of properties, and other gains and losses as stipulated by GAAP, the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which are significant economic costs. NOI may fail to capture significant trends in these components of net income which further limits its usefulness. NOI is a measure of the operating performance of our properties but does not measure our performance as a whole. NOI is therefore not a substitute for net income as computed in accordance with GAAP. This measure should be analyzed in conjunction with net income computed in accordance with. Other companies may use different methods for calculating NOI or similarly titled measures and, accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies that do not define the measure exactly as we do. 
EBITDA 
We compute EBITDA as net income plus interest expense, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. We present EBITDA because we believe that EBITDA, along with cash flow from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities, provides investors with an additional indicator of its ability to incur and service debt. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), as an indication of our financial performance, as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), or as a measure of its liquidity.

NEW YORK, May 15, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- The Empire State Building (ESB) today announced that seven students from the New York City Department of Youth and Community Development's (DYCD) Ladders for Leaders program will join the Empire State Building Observatory staff this summer. The students will serve as front-line hosts and cashiers at the "World's Most Famous Building." The Ladders for Leaders is a nationally recognized program that offers high school and college students the opportunity to participate in paid professional summer internships with leading corporations, non-profit organizations, and government agencies in New York City.








The Empire State Building will provide employee training via a two-day orientation with a strong focus on customer service.  Each student will also shadow current employees before assuming full responsibility in his or her role at the Empire State Building's Observatories. 
"Our partnership with Ladders to Leaders has not only helped our recruiting efforts but has also given the Empire State Building additional opportunities to give back to our community," said Jean-Yves Ghazi, Senior Vice President of the Observatory. 
"I am thrilled that our Ladders for Leaders participants will get the opportunity to work this summer at New York City's most iconic skyscraper, the Empire State Building," said DYCD Commissioner Bill Chong. "This internship will not only help enhance our young people's skills in hospitality and customer service but will also open up doors for them to interact with people from all over the world. DYCD is proud to work with Empire State Realty Trust and the Mayor's Fund to ensure NYC youth are exposed to unique jobs that help build the necessary skills to succeed." 
"The Mayor's Fund is excited to count Empire State Realty Trust among our dedicated group of Ladders for Leaders employers this summer," said Darren Bloch, Executive Director of the Mayor's Fund to Advance NYC. "The partnership will provide an invaluable experience, at an iconic New York City location, for these young adults – while giving the organization valuable seasonal support from these up-and-coming students. We are proud to have such strong partners that believe in building our future workforce."

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
