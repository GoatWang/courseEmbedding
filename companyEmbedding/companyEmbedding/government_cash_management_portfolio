The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted. Performance of share classes will differ because each class is sold pursuant to different sales arrangements and bears different expenses.  The Class A returns shown with sales charges are based on the maximum sales charge of 5.75%. The Class B returns shown with sales charges are adjusted for the applicable deferred sales charge (maximum of 4% in the first year). The Advisor Class and Institutional Class returns are shown as NAV only returns since these classes are sold without sales charges. Redemptions of Class B shares may be subject to a deferred sales charge. For performance data current to the most recent month-end call 800 524 2803 or visit Pricing & Performance. Returns may reflect waivers or reimbursements of certain expenses. Absent of these waivers or reimbursements, returns may be lower.

An investment in a fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency.
 
   A Word About Risk 
An investment in the Fund is neither insured nor guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, you can lose money by investing in the Fund. The Fund should not be relied upon as a complete investment program. Any investment carries with it some level of risk.


Principal Risks: You could lose money by investing in the Fund.  Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so.  An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency.  The Fund’s sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide support to the Fund at any time.
The Fund is intended for investors who:

Are seeking income, and
Are seeking a conservative investment that provides a high degree of credit quality.

Here are the principal risks of investing in the Fund:
Credit Risk.  The U.S. government securities the Fund invests in may or may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Securities issued by U.S. government sponsored enterprises are supported only by the credit of the issuing entity. There is a risk that the value of an investment will decline if there is a default by or deterioration in the credit quality of the issuer or a provider of a credit enhancement or demand feature. This could cause the Fund’s NAV to decline below $1.00 per share.
Interest Rate Risk. Like the values of other debt instruments, the market values of U.S. government securities are affected by changes in interest rates. When interest rates rise, the market values of money market instruments decline. This could cause the Fund's NAV to decline below $1.00 per share.
Liquidity Risk. The Fund may be unable to sell a security promptly and at an acceptable price, which could have the effect of decreasing the overall level of the Fund's liquidity. Market developments may cause the Fund's investments to become less liquid and subject to erratic price movements, which may have an adverse effect on the Fund's ability to maintain a $1.00 share price.
Market Risk.  The prices of the U.S. government securities held by the Fund may decline in response to certain events, such as general economic and market conditions, adverse political or regulatory developments, interest rate fluctuations, and those events directly involving the issuers.  Adverse market events may lead to increased redemptions, which could cause the Fund to experience a loss or difficulty in selling securities to meet redemptions or cause the Fund’s NAV to decline below $1.00 per share.  The conversion of money market funds to “government money market funds” could lead to supply issues within the U.S. Treasury securities market as demand increases for U.S. government securities.
Repurchase Agreement Risk.  If the seller in a repurchase agreement transaction defaults on its obligation to repurchase a security, the Fund may suffer delays, incur costs and lose money in exercising its rights.
Yield Risk. The yields received by the Fund on its investments will decline as interest rates decline.
