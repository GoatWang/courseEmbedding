Our Services






Our Process


Waters, Parkerson & Co., LLC operates as an independent, employee-owned Registered Investment Advisor. Our team of advisors act as fiduciaries making investment and financial planning recommendations in the best interest of our clients. Using a fee-only business model without commissions or hidden costs for professional services, our business interests are directly aligned with those of the clients that we serve.
Our client relationships are built through trust. Waters, Parkerson & Co.’s sound investment and financial planning advice allows our clients to be comfortable with all financial aspects of their lives. Through in-depth client and family meetings, our advisors develop a comprehensive financial plan and investment strategy to meet our clients’ objectives.
Once a financial plan, investment approach and asset allocation is agreed upon, Waters, Parkerson & Co. uses a conservative, long-term and diversified investment philosophy to build personalized client investment portfolios and provide sound financial planning advice. Since each client has different financial needs, risk tolerances and portfolio goals, our investment advisors actively manage each client portfolio themselves to ensure success as well as to meet our clients’ expectations.





Investment Management


Waters, Parkerson & Co., LLC’s investment philosophy is conservative with an emphasis on diversification of assets and preservation of capital. Our relationship-based approach allows a comprehensive understanding of clients’ financial and wealth objectives. Through an active portfolio management process, our advisors use a disciplined, long-term, unemotional and independent investment approach to develop personalized and tax-efficient investment portfolios.
Our team of investment advisors are managing individual stocks and bonds on behalf of our clients. Waters, Parkerson & Co.’s proven success in personalized investment services is achieved through an in-depth, strategic financial management process.





The equity portion of the portfolio should produce capital appreciation augmented by dividend income through a diverse portfolio of companies with primarily large capitalizations, strong fundamentals, outstanding management, and a history of earnings growth. Our equity strategy includes:

Bottom-up stock selection with a focus on undervalued companies that will experience long-term secular change
Diversified individual stock selections to eliminate unnecessary risk of concentrating on a narrow array of companies or industries
Emphasis on long-term investment approach with in-depth analysis separating short term volatility from fundamental changes
Investment Committee is responsible for research, analysis and on-going monitoring of equity holdings
Holdings include growth, value and yield oriented equities that are leaders in their respective industries



The fixed income portion of the portfolio should produce maximum current income with safety of principal. Our advisors stress current income over potential appreciation and attempt to insulate the fixed income portfolio by the following:

Diversification of holdings across the intermediate term yield curve
Staggering maturities equally within the portfolio to provide annual reinvestment opportunities
Selecting from Corporate, Agency and Municipal bonds
Analysis of historical yield spreads
Adherence to client specific investment objectives and guidelines
Continued monitoring of credit ratings









Financial Planning


Waters, Parkerson & Co.’s financial planning services provide clients the information needed to ask the right questions and make the necessary decisions in all financial aspects of their lives. Our advisors offer financial planning services by providing objective advice on:

Retirement planning
Cash flow management
Estate planning
Tax efficiency






Fee Structure


The Investment Advisor Fee is a percentage of the market value of assets under our supervision. Fees are calculated and deducted quarterly, based on the market value of the supervised assets at the end of the prior quarter, using the following rates:
 








ANNUAL RATE


On the first $1,000,000
1%
(.01000)

The above fee schedule is subject to a minimum annual fee of $10,000.00.

                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

Bed Bath & Beyond® Credit Card


                                            The Bed Bath & Beyond Mastercard was purchased from US Bank in October 2016. My advice: If you have been with US Bank and made the transition to Comenity - check your credit report. Comenity reports twice and never reports the old account closed, so it looks like you have 2...show more

Woodforest National Bank


                                            It is my opinion that you would do better to find a different company. In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

                                            It's not the worst, but it's certainly deceptive. I can't trust a company that lies to me for two bucks.

Veridian Credit Union


                                            i love banking with veridian, but the new updated online banking is garbage.10x harder to navigate than before staring from the log in page. Making simple transfers or even looking at accounts is harder and more confusing. bring back the old version.

Discover it® - Cashback Match™


                                            I have $84,000 credit line in total and I got Discover credit card with $6,000. After 11 months I did carry $45,000 balance distribute on several cards that I have which dropped my FICO score to 676 points.

Grange Insurance


                                            Grange Insurance added a 58% surcharge to our auto policy after a icy bridge weather related accident.  The increase totaled of $1042.00.  No "accident forgiveness" with this company.  Take your business elswhere!

Virginia Credit Union


                                            I was pre qualified for a mortgage loan. They waited until the week before closing and decided that I did not qualify.  This was after i put $500.00 down and paid for the inspection and gave notice to where I was renting .

Lowe's Store Card


                                            You will never get a credit line increase. I have good credit and zero late payments and get turned down every time. I don't have this problem with any of my other credit accounts. Had my account over a year in good standing. Paid it down to zero twice. What a joke!
