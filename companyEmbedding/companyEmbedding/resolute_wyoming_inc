Corporate profile	

Resolute Energy Corporation is a leading operator in the Delaware Basin of West Texas, one of the most prolific and economic oil producing basins in the United States.




Our 16,300 net acres and 375 plus potential development locations in Reeves County Texas are concentrated, operated and have been substantially de-risked by drilling.  We focus on drilling mid and long length laterals in the Wolfcamp formation and Resolute wells have been recognized as some of the best in the basin.
Our first quarter production makes us one of the larger producers in the basin and with the completion of recently announced or planned divestitures Resolute will be one of a very few pure play Delaware Basin producers with industry leading organic production growth and well level economics.  Resolute is traded on the NYSE under the symbol “REN”.
