What our customers say ...








                                    Angel Investment Network did a fantastic job for us.  We said we wanted to meet a very select number of sophisticated investors who understood our industry to join our investor group.  We were very impressed with the calibre and expertise of the prospective investors to whom we were introduced.  The success rate, in terms of how many of them joined our investment round, was excellent.  Angel Investment Network were professional,  committed and ex...

                                    Angel Investment Network provided a good opportunity to talk face to face with a range of potential investors who were interested in hearing more about my business.  We have generated a couple of follow on meetings as a result.

                                    I and Pivigo worked with Ed and Angel Investment Network for our seed investment round. We wanted angel involvement, and Ed and AIN gave us access to a global network of highly relevant angels. Ed specifically was very helpful in preparing the materials to be sent out, and in drumming up interest and managing the contacts. He was always quick to answer questions and offer support. We raised a significant portion of our round via AIN, and would wa...

NEWS RELEASE - Commercial real estate venture gets funded for $250K from funded.com's funding provider. Comment: I was very pleased with the speed and professional attitude of the site. I will recommend this to anyone in the future.

"Funded.com has been great and my project is in the final stages of being funded by an investor I found on here. I was surprized at the quick process and how fast investors funded my project. Website was a big help!"

Entreprenuer





Let me first start by saying I believe your site is THE BEST there is for connecting Entrepreneurs and Investors.  It is the site I've had most success with.  I had about 6 Investors either respond back or contact me because of your site with an interest in investing in my company. Thank you very much!  I love your site and will recommend it to any of my Colleagues.  I love the fact that we are able to contact the Investors directly (which many of the sites joining Entrepreneurs and Investors don't allow).  It looks like I'm about to go into contract with an Investor because of your site.  Thank you again.

I am grateful I had the opportunity to access your network of investors. I am reasonably confident that the current negotiations with one of your investors will go through for our film production. I will be back for my next production.
