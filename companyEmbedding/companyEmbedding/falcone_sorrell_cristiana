Early life and education[edit]
Martin Stuart Sorrell was born in London on 14 February 1945 to a Jewish family with an electronics retailer father,[3][4] whose ancestors came from Russia, Poland and Romania,[5] Sorrell was educated at the independent Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School then Christ's College, Cambridge, and has an MBA from Harvard University.[3][6]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
Sorrell joined Glendinning Associates, then James Gulliver and then worked for the sports agent Mark McCormack.[7] He joined Saatchi & Saatchi in 1975, and was group finance director from 1977 until 1984. Often referred to as "the third brother",[8] he designed and carried out many of Saatchi's agency acquisitions. Sorrell undertook this by refining the practice of the ‘earn-out’.
WPP[edit]
In 1985, Sorrell privately invested in Wire and Plastic Products, a British wire shopping basket manufacturer, and joined it full-time as Chief Executive in 1986. He began to acquire "below-the-line" advertising-related companies, purchasing 18 in three years, including in 1987 when he stunned the agency world with a $566 million hostile takeover of J. Walter Thompson. Sorrell followed this in 1989 with another dramatic hostile $825 million buy of Ogilvy and Mather. Since 2000, WPP has also acquired two more integrated, global agency networks, Young & Rubicam and Grey.[9]
WPP is regarded as the driving force for the period of consolidation which has been going on within the communications industry for the last ten to fifteen years. WPP group has amassed the largest media buying group in the world, GroupM. Including its creative agency networks JWT, Ogilvy and Mather, Young & Rubicam and Grey, WPP is one of the "Big Four" major players in the global advertising industry.
WPP has become one of the world's leading communications services and advertising companies valued by the UK stockmarket at £5 billion. With billings of £37 billion and revenues of £7.5 billion, WPP's operating companies provide national, multi-national and global clients with advertising, media investment management, information and consultancy, public relations and public affairs, branding and identity, healthcare communications, direct, digital, promotion and relationship marketing, and specialist communications services. WPP employs 140,000 people in 2,400 offices in 107 countries. He owns a substantial stake in the company through a series of pay awards and his own purchases of shares. Until recently he had never before sold shares in the company; his shares are worth around £70 million.[citation needed]
Sorrell himself is widely respected throughout the advertising industry, with his words being scrutinised and quoted by many within the marketing sector. He had articulated in 1996 how interactive media—including the Internet—could transform the way we build brands and communicate to consumers in a November 1996 Harvard Business Review article, "The Future of Interactive Marketing".[10] Many industry observers credit him with the fact that the UK still has an independent, vibrant communications industry. His famed remark that the advertising recession in the early part of this decade was "bath shaped" was one of the most repeated quotes in the 2003 – 2004 period.[citation needed]
On 18 November 2008, WPP technically re-incorporated itself as an offshore entity in Jersey (Jersey is considered as a fiscal paradise by the OECD) in order to reduce an annual tax bill of more than £200million.[11]
In 2014, Sorrell received total compensation from WPP of GBP £40 million, his largest annual total since £53 million in 2004.[1]
Other interests[edit]




Martin Sorrell in 2008


In 1997, he was appointed an Ambassador for British Business by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and subsequently appointed to the Office's Panel 2000 aimed at rebranding Britain abroad. In 1999 he was appointed by the Secretary of State for Education and Employment to serve on the Council for Excellence in Management and Leadership.
He is a Governor of London Business School, and a member of the Advisory Boards of both the Judge Business School in Cambridge, UK and IESE in Spain. He is also Chairman of the Global Advisory Board of the Centre for International Business and Management (CIBAM), at the University of Cambridge, UK.[12] In 1998, he was appointed to the Board of Directors of Associates of Harvard Business School and to the Board of the Indian School of Business.[9]
On behalf of New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, he chaired Media.NYC.2020,[13] which reviewed the future of the global media industry, the implications for NYC, and suggested actionable next steps for the NYC government.
Criticism[edit]
In 2005 Sorrell sold £9m of shares in WPP at the end of a restricted stock holding period. He also agreed to change a contract with the company which had been much criticised by institutional shareholders in WPP as being unfairly written in Sorrell's favour. Under the previous agreement if Sorrell had been terminated, it would have led to a very large payout; the new agreement provides him instead with no termination payment.
In 2005 his pay was £2.42 million including cash and bonuses.[14] Further he exercised £52 million in share options, is entitled to a further £5.8million in stock, and deferred further options on another 2.65 million shares valued at £15 million until 2008.[15] In 2011 Sorrell's pay package increased by 70% to £4.5 million after WPP's pre-tax profits rose 28%.[16] In October 2011 Sorrell went on the BBC to defend large increases in his and other CEO pay packages[17] at a time when real average wages in the Western world are declining.[18][19]
Shareholders have criticised aspects of corporate governance at WPP. This came to the fore again in 2006 with the advent of two court cases revolving around alleged corruption in an Italian subsidiary and contract disputes with the US launch of the OK! magazine.
In June 2008 WPP drew strong criticism for the involvement of an agency, 'Imago', in which WPP's Y&R subsidiary held a minority interest, with the ZANU-PF presidential campaign in Zimbabwe. A report by the Financial Times[20] found out that Imago was employed by Robert Mugabe's campaign for reelection to the presidency of Zimbabwe. WPP subsequently divested Y&R's minority interests in Zimbabwe.[21]
Recognition[edit]
He was knighted in the 2000 New Year Honours.[22] On 27 September 2007, Sorrell was awarded the Harvard Business School’s highest honour, the Alumni Achievement Award, by Dean Jay O. Light. The award was also given to: Ayala Corp. chair Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala, A. Malachi Mixon of Invacare, Donna Dubinsky and Hansjorg Wyss of Synthes.[23] In 2015 he was a Trustee of the British Museum.[24]
Personal life[edit]
Sorrell is married to Cristiana Falcone, director of media and entertainment industries at the World Economic Forum.[25][26]
Sorrell was previously married to the American-born[25] Sandra Finestone, with whom he has three sons, but the marriage broke down in 2003, as a result of Sir Martin's "obsession with work".[25] In October 2005, he cashed in £12 million of WPP shares to fund the divorce,[27] in which Ms. Finestone, represented by Nicholas Mostyn QC, was awarded a £30 million settlement including: a £3.25m four-storey Georgian townhouse; two Harrods underground car parking spaces worth around £90,000 each; £23.5m in cash; £2m in bank deposits; and other assets including stocks and shares.[25][27][28] Despite the divorce settlement, Sorrell still had 13 million shares, an estimated £80m stake in WPP, at the time of the divorce, which represented around 1% of the company, plus his 2005 pay settlement award.[27]
The divorce settlement was, at the time, the largest divorce settlement in British legal history,[25] and was unusual in being a 60/40 split in favour of Sir Martin — a break from the previously-established policy of a 50/50 split even in big-money divorces since an influential ruling by Appeal Court Justice Mathew Thorpe in the 2002 divorce between Harry and Shan Lambert established that the contribution to the household of non-working wives should be considered equal to their husbands'.[28] In the Lambert judgement, Lord Justice Thorpe stated that "special contribution remains a legitimate possibility but only in exceptional circumstances"; Sir Martin was the first husband deemed to have met that criterion in a subsequent divorce settlement, with Mr Justice Bennett citing Sir Martin's "special contribution" to the family's wealth in justification.[28]
Sorrell's three sons, Mark, Jonathan and Robert all went to Cambridge University and then Goldman Sachs, although two have since left.[29] Jonathan is chief financial officer of the commodities hedge fund Man Group.[30]

Early life and education[edit]
Martin Stuart Sorrell was born in London on 14 February 1945 to a Jewish family with an electronics retailer father,[3][4] whose ancestors came from Russia, Poland and Romania,[5] Sorrell was educated at the independent Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School then Christ's College, Cambridge, and has an MBA from Harvard University.[3][6]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
Sorrell joined Glendinning Associates, then James Gulliver and then worked for the sports agent Mark McCormack.[7] He joined Saatchi & Saatchi in 1975, and was group finance director from 1977 until 1984. Often referred to as "the third brother",[8] he designed and carried out many of Saatchi's agency acquisitions. Sorrell undertook this by refining the practice of the ‘earn-out’.

He began to acquire "below-the-line" advertising-related companies, purchasing 18 in three years, including in 1987 when he stunned the agency world with a $566 million hostile takeover of J. Walter Thompson. Sorrell followed this in 1989 with another dramatic hostile $825 million buy of Ogilvy and Mather. Since 2000, WPP has also acquired two more integrated, global agency networks, Young & Rubicam and Grey.[9]
WPP is regarded as the driving force for the period of consolidation which has been going on within the communications industry for the last ten to fifteen years. WPP group has amassed the largest media buying group in the world, GroupM. Including its creative agency networks JWT, Ogilvy and Mather, Young & Rubicam and Grey, WPP is one of the "Big Four" major players in the global advertising industry.
WPP has become one of the world's leading communications services and advertising companies valued by the UK stockmarket at £5 billion. With billings of £37 billion and revenues of £7.5 billion, WPP's operating companies provide national, multi-national and global clients with advertising, media investment management, information and consultancy, public relations and public affairs, branding and identity, healthcare communications, direct, digital, promotion and relationship marketing, and specialist communications services. WPP employs 140,000 people in 2,400 offices in 107 countries. He owns a substantial stake in the company through a series of pay awards and his own purchases of shares. Until recently he had never before sold shares in the company; his shares are worth around £70 million.[citation needed]

In 2014, Sorrell received total compensation from WPP of GBP £40 million, his largest annual total since £53 million in 2004.[1]
Other interests[edit]




Martin Sorrell in 2008


In 1997, he was appointed an Ambassador for British Business by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and subsequently appointed to the Office's Panel 2000 aimed at rebranding Britain abroad. In 1999 he was appointed by the Secretary of State for Education and Employment to serve on the Council for Excellence in Management and Leadership.
He is a Governor of London Business School, and a member of the Advisory Boards of both the Judge Business School in Cambridge, UK and IESE in Spain. He is also Chairman of the Global Advisory Board of the Centre for International Business and Management (CIBAM), at the University of Cambridge, UK.[12] In 1998, he was appointed to the Board of Directors of Associates of Harvard Business School and to the Board of the Indian School of Business.[9]
On behalf of New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, he chaired Media.NYC.2020,[13] which reviewed the future of the global media industry, the implications for NYC, and suggested actionable next steps for the NYC government.
Criticism[edit]
In 2005 Sorrell sold £9m of shares in WPP at the end of a restricted stock holding period. He also agreed to change a contract with the company which had been much criticised by institutional shareholders in WPP as being unfairly written in Sorrell's favour. Under the previous agreement if Sorrell had been terminated, it would have led to a very large payout; the new agreement provides him instead with no termination payment.
In 2005 his pay was £2.42 million including cash and bonuses.[14] Further he exercised £52 million in share options, is entitled to a further £5.8million in stock, and deferred further options on another 2.65 million shares valued at £15 million until 2008.[15] In 2011 Sorrell's pay package increased by 70% to £4.5 million after WPP's pre-tax profits rose 28%.[16] In October 2011 Sorrell went on the BBC to defend large increases in his and other CEO pay packages[17] at a time when real average wages in the Western world are declining.[18][19]
Shareholders have criticised aspects of corporate governance at WPP. This came to the fore again in 2006 with the advent of two court cases revolving around alleged corruption in an Italian subsidiary and contract disputes with the US launch of the OK! magazine.
In June 2008 WPP drew strong criticism for the involvement of an agency, 'Imago', in which WPP's Y&R subsidiary held a minority interest, with the ZANU-PF presidential campaign in Zimbabwe. A report by the Financial Times[20] found out that Imago was employed by Robert Mugabe's campaign for reelection to the presidency of Zimbabwe. WPP subsequently divested Y&R's minority interests in Zimbabwe.[21]
Recognition[edit]
He was knighted in the 2000 New Year Honours.[22] On 27 September 2007, Sorrell was awarded the Harvard Business School’s highest honour, the Alumni Achievement Award, by Dean Jay O. Light. The award was also given to: Ayala Corp. chair Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala, A. Malachi Mixon of Invacare, Donna Dubinsky and Hansjorg Wyss of Synthes.[23] In 2015 he was a Trustee of the British Museum.[24]
Personal life[edit]
Sorrell is married to Cristiana Falcone, director of media and entertainment industries at the World Economic Forum.[25][26]
Sorrell was previously married to the American-born[25] Sandra Finestone, with whom he has three sons, but the marriage broke down in 2003, as a result of Sir Martin's "obsession with work".[25] In October 2005, he cashed in £12 million of WPP shares to fund the divorce,[27] in which Ms. Finestone, represented by Nicholas Mostyn QC, was awarded a £30 million settlement including: a £3.25m four-storey Georgian townhouse; two Harrods underground car parking spaces worth around £90,000 each; £23.5m in cash; £2m in bank deposits; and other assets including stocks and shares.[25][27][28] Despite the divorce settlement, Sorrell still had 13 million shares, an estimated £80m stake in WPP, at the time of the divorce, which represented around 1% of the company, plus his 2005 pay settlement award.[27]
The divorce settlement was, at the time, the largest divorce settlement in British legal history,[25] and was unusual in being a 60/40 split in favour of Sir Martin — a break from the previously-established policy of a 50/50 split even in big-money divorces since an influential ruling by Appeal Court Justice Mathew Thorpe in the 2002 divorce between Harry and Shan Lambert established that the contribution to the household of non-working wives should be considered equal to their husbands'.[28] In the Lambert judgement, Lord Justice Thorpe stated that "special contribution remains a legitimate possibility but only in exceptional circumstances"; Sir Martin was the first husband deemed to have met that criterion in a subsequent divorce settlement, with Mr Justice Bennett citing Sir Martin's "special contribution" to the family's wealth in justification.[28]
Sorrell's three sons, Mark, Jonathan and Robert all went to Cambridge University and then Goldman Sachs, although two have since left.[29] Jonathan is chief financial officer of the commodities hedge fund Man Group.[30]

Early life and education[edit]
Martin Stuart Sorrell was born in London on 14 February 1945 to a Jewish family with an electronics retailer father,[3][4] whose ancestors came from Russia, Poland and Romania,[5] Sorrell was educated at the independent Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School then Christ's College, Cambridge, and has an MBA from Harvard University.[3][6]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
Sorrell joined Glendinning Associates, then James Gulliver and then worked for the sports agent Mark McCormack.[7] He joined Saatchi & Saatchi in 1975, and was group finance director from 1977 until 1984. Often referred to as "the third brother",[8] he designed and carried out many of Saatchi's agency acquisitions. Sorrell undertook this by refining the practice of the ‘earn-out’.
WPP[edit]
In 1985, Sorrell privately invested in Wire and Plastic Products, a British wire shopping basket manufacturer, and joined it full-time as Chief Executive in 1986. He began to acquire "below-the-line" advertising-related companies, purchasing 18 in three years, including in 1987 when he stunned the agency world with a $566 million hostile takeover of J. Walter Thompson. Sorrell followed this in 1989 with another dramatic hostile $825 million buy of Ogilvy and Mather. Since 2000, WPP has also acquired two more integrated, global agency networks, Young & Rubicam and Grey.[9]
WPP is regarded as the driving force for the period of consolidation which has been going on within the communications industry for the last ten to fifteen years. WPP group has amassed the largest media buying group in the world, GroupM. Including its creative agency networks JWT, Ogilvy and Mather, Young & Rubicam and Grey, WPP is one of the "Big Four" major players in the global advertising industry.
WPP has become one of the world's leading communications services and advertising companies valued by the UK stockmarket at £5 billion. With billings of £37 billion and revenues of £7.5 billion, WPP's operating companies provide national, multi-national and global clients with advertising, media investment management, information and consultancy, public relations and public affairs, branding and identity, healthcare communications, direct, digital, promotion and relationship marketing, and specialist communications services. WPP employs 140,000 people in 2,400 offices in 107 countries. He owns a substantial stake in the company through a series of pay awards and his own purchases of shares. Until recently he had never before sold shares in the company; his shares are worth around £70 million.[citation needed]
Sorrell himself is widely respected throughout the advertising industry, with his words being scrutinised and quoted by many within the marketing sector. He had articulated in 1996 how interactive media—including the Internet—could transform the way we build brands and communicate to consumers in a November 1996 Harvard Business Review article, "The Future of Interactive Marketing".[10] Many industry observers credit him with the fact that the UK still has an independent, vibrant communications industry. His famed remark that the advertising recession in the early part of this decade was "bath shaped" was one of the most repeated quotes in the 2003 – 2004 period.[citation needed]
On 18 November 2008, WPP technically re-incorporated itself as an offshore entity in Jersey (Jersey is considered as a fiscal paradise by the OECD) in order to reduce an annual tax bill of more than £200million.[11]
In 2014, Sorrell received total compensation from WPP of GBP £40 million, his largest annual total since £53 million in 2004.[1]
Other interests[edit]




Martin Sorrell in 2008


In 1997, he was appointed an Ambassador for British Business by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and subsequently appointed to the Office's Panel 2000 aimed at rebranding Britain abroad. In 1999 he was appointed by the Secretary of State for Education and Employment to serve on the Council for Excellence in Management and Leadership.
He is a Governor of London Business School, and a member of the Advisory Boards of both the Judge Business School in Cambridge, UK and IESE in Spain. He is also Chairman of the Global Advisory Board of the Centre for International Business and Management (CIBAM), at the University of Cambridge, UK.[12] In 1998, he was appointed to the Board of Directors of Associates of Harvard Business School and to the Board of the Indian School of Business.[9]
On behalf of New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, he chaired Media.NYC.2020,[13] which reviewed the future of the global media industry, the implications for NYC, and suggested actionable next steps for the NYC government.
Criticism[edit]
In 2005 Sorrell sold £9m of shares in WPP at the end of a restricted stock holding period. He also agreed to change a contract with the company which had been much criticised by institutional shareholders in WPP as being unfairly written in Sorrell's favour. Under the previous agreement if Sorrell had been terminated, it would have led to a very large payout; the new agreement provides him instead with no termination payment.
In 2005 his pay was £2.42 million including cash and bonuses.[14] Further he exercised £52 million in share options, is entitled to a further £5.8million in stock, and deferred further options on another 2.65 million shares valued at £15 million until 2008.[15] In 2011 Sorrell's pay package increased by 70% to £4.5 million after WPP's pre-tax profits rose 28%.[16] In October 2011 Sorrell went on the BBC to defend large increases in his and other CEO pay packages[17] at a time when real average wages in the Western world are declining.[18][19]
Shareholders have criticised aspects of corporate governance at WPP. This came to the fore again in 2006 with the advent of two court cases revolving around alleged corruption in an Italian subsidiary and contract disputes with the US launch of the OK! magazine.
In June 2008 WPP drew strong criticism for the involvement of an agency, 'Imago', in which WPP's Y&R subsidiary held a minority interest, with the ZANU-PF presidential campaign in Zimbabwe. A report by the Financial Times[20] found out that Imago was employed by Robert Mugabe's campaign for reelection to the presidency of Zimbabwe. WPP subsequently divested Y&R's minority interests in Zimbabwe.[21]
Recognition[edit]
He was knighted in the 2000 New Year Honours.[22] On 27 September 2007, Sorrell was awarded the Harvard Business School’s highest honour, the Alumni Achievement Award, by Dean Jay O. Light. The award was also given to: Ayala Corp. chair Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala, A. Malachi Mixon of Invacare, Donna Dubinsky and Hansjorg Wyss of Synthes.[23] In 2015 he was a Trustee of the British Museum.[24]
Personal life[edit]
Sorrell is married to Cristiana Falcone, director of media and entertainment industries at the World Economic Forum.[25][26]
Sorrell was previously married to the American-born[25] Sandra Finestone, with whom he has three sons, but the marriage broke down in 2003, as a result of Sir Martin's "obsession with work".[25] In October 2005, he cashed in £12 million of WPP shares to fund the divorce,[27] in which Ms. Finestone, represented by Nicholas Mostyn QC, was awarded a £30 million settlement including: a £3.25m four-storey Georgian townhouse; two Harrods underground car parking spaces worth around £90,000 each; £23.5m in cash; £2m in bank deposits; and other assets including stocks and shares.[25][27][28] Despite the divorce settlement, Sorrell still had 13 million shares, an estimated £80m stake in WPP, at the time of the divorce, which represented around 1% of the company, plus his 2005 pay settlement award.[27]
The divorce settlement was, at the time, the largest divorce settlement in British legal history,[25] and was unusual in being a 60/40 split in favour of Sir Martin — a break from the previously-established policy of a 50/50 split even in big-money divorces since an influential ruling by Appeal Court Justice Mathew Thorpe in the 2002 divorce between Harry and Shan Lambert established that the contribution to the household of non-working wives should be considered equal to their husbands'.[28] In the Lambert judgement, Lord Justice Thorpe stated that "special contribution remains a legitimate possibility but only in exceptional circumstances"; Sir Martin was the first husband deemed to have met that criterion in a subsequent divorce settlement, with Mr Justice Bennett citing Sir Martin's "special contribution" to the family's wealth in justification.[28]
Sorrell's three sons, Mark, Jonathan and Robert all went to Cambridge University and then Goldman Sachs, although two have since left.[29] Jonathan is chief financial officer of the commodities hedge fund Man Group.[30]

Early life and education[edit]
Martin Stuart Sorrell was born in London on 14 February 1945 to a Jewish family with an electronics retailer father,[3][4] whose ancestors came from Russia, Poland and Romania,[5] Sorrell was educated at the independent Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School then Christ's College, Cambridge, and has an MBA from Harvard University.[3][6]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
Sorrell joined Glendinning Associates, then James Gulliver and then worked for the sports agent Mark McCormack.[7] He joined Saatchi & Saatchi in 1975, and was group finance director from 1977 until 1984. Often referred to as "the third brother",[8] he designed and carried out many of Saatchi's agency acquisitions. Sorrell undertook this by refining the practice of the ‘earn-out’.
WPP[edit]
In 1985, Sorrell privately invested in Wire and Plastic Products, a British wire shopping basket manufacturer, and joined it full-time as Chief Executive in 1986. He began to acquire "below-the-line" advertising-related companies, purchasing 18 in three years, including in 1987 when he stunned the agency world with a $566 million hostile takeover of J. Walter Thompson. Sorrell followed this in 1989 with another dramatic hostile $825 million buy of Ogilvy and Mather. Since 2000, WPP has also acquired two more integrated, global agency networks, Young & Rubicam and Grey.[9]
WPP is regarded as the driving force for the period of consolidation which has been going on within the communications industry for the last ten to fifteen years. WPP group has amassed the largest media buying group in the world, GroupM. Including its creative agency networks JWT, Ogilvy and Mather, Young & Rubicam and Grey, WPP is one of the "Big Four" major players in the global advertising industry.
WPP has become one of the world's leading communications services and advertising companies valued by the UK stockmarket at £5 billion. With billings of £37 billion and revenues of £7.5 billion, WPP's operating companies provide national, multi-national and global clients with advertising, media investment management, information and consultancy, public relations and public affairs, branding and identity, healthcare communications, direct, digital, promotion and relationship marketing, and specialist communications services. WPP employs 140,000 people in 2,400 offices in 107 countries. He owns a substantial stake in the company through a series of pay awards and his own purchases of shares. Until recently he had never before sold shares in the company; his shares are worth around £70 million.[citation needed]
Sorrell himself is widely respected throughout the advertising industry, with his words being scrutinised and quoted by many within the marketing sector. He had articulated in 1996 how interactive media—including the Internet—could transform the way we build brands and communicate to consumers in a November 1996 Harvard Business Review article, "The Future of Interactive Marketing".[10] Many industry observers credit him with the fact that the UK still has an independent, vibrant communications industry. His famed remark that the advertising recession in the early part of this decade was "bath shaped" was one of the most repeated quotes in the 2003 – 2004 period.[citation needed]
On 18 November 2008, WPP technically re-incorporated itself as an offshore entity in Jersey (Jersey is considered as a fiscal paradise by the OECD) in order to reduce an annual tax bill of more than £200million.[11]
In 2014, Sorrell received total compensation from WPP of GBP £40 million, his largest annual total since £53 million in 2004.[1]
Other interests[edit]




Martin Sorrell in 2008


In 1997, he was appointed an Ambassador for British Business by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and subsequently appointed to the Office's Panel 2000 aimed at rebranding Britain abroad. In 1999 he was appointed by the Secretary of State for Education and Employment to serve on the Council for Excellence in Management and Leadership.
He is a Governor of London Business School, and a member of the Advisory Boards of both the Judge Business School in Cambridge, UK and IESE in Spain. He is also Chairman of the Global Advisory Board of the Centre for International Business and Management (CIBAM), at the University of Cambridge, UK.[12] In 1998, he was appointed to the Board of Directors of Associates of Harvard Business School and to the Board of the Indian School of Business.[9]
On behalf of New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, he chaired Media.NYC.2020,[13] which reviewed the future of the global media industry, the implications for NYC, and suggested actionable next steps for the NYC government.
Criticism[edit]
In 2005 Sorrell sold £9m of shares in WPP at the end of a restricted stock holding period. He also agreed to change a contract with the company which had been much criticised by institutional shareholders in WPP as being unfairly written in Sorrell's favour. Under the previous agreement if Sorrell had been terminated, it would have led to a very large payout; the new agreement provides him instead with no termination payment.
In 2005 his pay was £2.42 million including cash and bonuses.[14] Further he exercised £52 million in share options, is entitled to a further £5.8million in stock, and deferred further options on another 2.65 million shares valued at £15 million until 2008.[15] In 2011 Sorrell's pay package increased by 70% to £4.5 million after WPP's pre-tax profits rose 28%.[16] In October 2011 Sorrell went on the BBC to defend large increases in his and other CEO pay packages[17] at a time when real average wages in the Western world are declining.[18][19]
Shareholders have criticised aspects of corporate governance at WPP. This came to the fore again in 2006 with the advent of two court cases revolving around alleged corruption in an Italian subsidiary and contract disputes with the US launch of the OK! magazine.
In June 2008 WPP drew strong criticism for the involvement of an agency, 'Imago', in which WPP's Y&R subsidiary held a minority interest, with the ZANU-PF presidential campaign in Zimbabwe. A report by the Financial Times[20] found out that Imago was employed by Robert Mugabe's campaign for reelection to the presidency of Zimbabwe. WPP subsequently divested Y&R's minority interests in Zimbabwe.[21]
Recognition[edit]
He was knighted in the 2000 New Year Honours.[22] On 27 September 2007, Sorrell was awarded the Harvard Business School’s highest honour, the Alumni Achievement Award, by Dean Jay O. Light. The award was also given to: Ayala Corp. chair Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala, A. Malachi Mixon of Invacare, Donna Dubinsky and Hansjorg Wyss of Synthes.[23] In 2015 he was a Trustee of the British Museum.[24]
Personal life[edit]
Sorrell is married to Cristiana Falcone, director of media and entertainment industries at the World Economic Forum.[25][26]
Sorrell was previously married to the American-born[25] Sandra Finestone, with whom he has three sons, but the marriage broke down in 2003, as a result of Sir Martin's "obsession with work".[25] In October 2005, he cashed in £12 million of WPP shares to fund the divorce,[27] in which Ms. Finestone, represented by Nicholas Mostyn QC, was awarded a £30 million settlement including: a £3.25m four-storey Georgian townhouse; two Harrods underground car parking spaces worth around £90,000 each; £23.5m in cash; £2m in bank deposits; and other assets including stocks and shares.[25][27][28] Despite the divorce settlement, Sorrell still had 13 million shares, an estimated £80m stake in WPP, at the time of the divorce, which represented around 1% of the company, plus his 2005 pay settlement award.[27]
The divorce settlement was, at the time, the largest divorce settlement in British legal history,[25] and was unusual in being a 60/40 split in favour of Sir Martin — a break from the previously-established policy of a 50/50 split even in big-money divorces since an influential ruling by Appeal Court Justice Mathew Thorpe in the 2002 divorce between Harry and Shan Lambert established that the contribution to the household of non-working wives should be considered equal to their husbands'.[28] In the Lambert judgement, Lord Justice Thorpe stated that "special contribution remains a legitimate possibility but only in exceptional circumstances"; Sir Martin was the first husband deemed to have met that criterion in a subsequent divorce settlement, with Mr Justice Bennett citing Sir Martin's "special contribution" to the family's wealth in justification.[28]
Sorrell's three sons, Mark, Jonathan and Robert all went to Cambridge University and then Goldman Sachs, although two have since left.[29] Jonathan is chief financial officer of the commodities hedge fund Man Group.[30]

Early life and education[edit]
Martin Stuart Sorrell was born in London on 14 February 1945 to a Jewish family with an electronics retailer father,[3][4] whose ancestors came from Russia, Poland and Romania,[5] Sorrell was educated at the independent Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School then Christ's College, Cambridge, and has an MBA from Harvard University.[3][6]

Sorrell joined Glendinning Associates, then James Gulliver and then worked for the sports agent Mark McCormack.[7] He joined Saatchi & Saatchi in 1975, and was group finance director from 1977 until 1984.

Including its creative agency networks JWT, Ogilvy and Mather, Young & Rubicam and Grey, WPP is one of the "Big Four" major players in the global advertising industry.
WPP has become one of the world's leading communications services and advertising companies valued by the UK stockmarket at £5 billion. With billings of £37 billion and revenues of £7.5 billion, WPP's operating companies provide national, multi-national and global clients with advertising, media investment management, information and consultancy, public relations and public affairs, branding and identity, healthcare communications, direct, digital, promotion and relationship marketing, and specialist communications services. WPP employs 140,000 people in 2,400 offices in 107 countries. He owns a substantial stake in the company through a series of pay awards and his own purchases of shares.

Under the previous agreement if Sorrell had been terminated, it would have led to a very large payout; the new agreement provides him instead with no termination payment.

Recognition[edit]
He was knighted in the 2000 New Year Honours.[22] On 27 September 2007, Sorrell was awarded the Harvard Business School’s highest honour, the Alumni Achievement Award, by Dean Jay O. Light. The award was also given to: Ayala Corp. chair Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala, A. Malachi Mixon of Invacare, Donna Dubinsky and Hansjorg Wyss of Synthes.[23] In 2015 he was a Trustee of the British Museum.[24]
Personal life[edit]
Sorrell is married to Cristiana Falcone, director of media and entertainment industries at the World Economic Forum.[25][26]
Sorrell was previously married to the American-born[25] Sandra Finestone, with whom he has three sons, but the marriage broke down in 2003, as a result of Sir Martin's "obsession with work".[25] In October 2005, he cashed in £12 million of WPP shares to fund the divorce,[27] in which Ms. Finestone, represented by Nicholas Mostyn QC, was awarded a £30 million settlement including: a £3.25m four-storey Georgian townhouse; two Harrods underground car parking spaces worth around £90,000 each; £23.5m in cash; £2m in bank deposits; and other assets including stocks and shares.[25][27][28] Despite the divorce settlement, Sorrell still had 13 million shares, an estimated £80m stake in WPP, at the time of the divorce, which represented around 1% of the company, plus his 2005 pay settlement award.[27]
The divorce settlement was, at the time, the largest divorce settlement in British legal history,[25] and was unusual in being a 60/40 split in favour of Sir Martin — a break from the previously-established policy of a 50/50 split even in big-money divorces since an influential ruling by Appeal Court Justice Mathew Thorpe in the 2002 divorce between Harry and Shan Lambert established that the contribution to the household of non-working wives should be considered equal to their husbands'.[28] In the Lambert judgement, Lord Justice Thorpe stated that "special contribution remains a legitimate possibility but only in exceptional circumstances"; Sir Martin was the first husband deemed to have met that criterion in a subsequent divorce settlement, with Mr Justice Bennett citing Sir Martin's "special contribution" to the family's wealth in justification.[28]
Sorrell's three sons, Mark, Jonathan and Robert all went to Cambridge University and then Goldman Sachs, although two have since left.[29] Jonathan is chief financial officer of the commodities hedge fund Man Group.[30]

Early life and education[edit]
Martin Stuart Sorrell was born in London on 14 February 1945 to a Jewish family with an electronics retailer father,[3][4] whose ancestors came from Russia, Poland and Romania,[5] Sorrell was educated at the independent Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School then Christ's College, Cambridge, and has an MBA from Harvard University.[3][6]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
Sorrell joined Glendinning Associates, then James Gulliver and then worked for the sports agent Mark McCormack.[7] He joined Saatchi & Saatchi in 1975, and was group finance director from 1977 until 1984. Often referred to as "the third brother",[8] he designed and carried out many of Saatchi's agency acquisitions. Sorrell undertook this by refining the practice of the ‘earn-out’.
WPP[edit]
In 1985, Sorrell privately invested in Wire and Plastic Products, a British wire shopping basket manufacturer, and joined it full-time as Chief Executive in 1986. He began to acquire "below-the-line" advertising-related companies, purchasing 18 in three years, including in 1987 when he stunned the agency world with a $566 million hostile takeover of J. Walter Thompson. Sorrell followed this in 1989 with another dramatic hostile $825 million buy of Ogilvy and Mather. Since 2000, WPP has also acquired two more integrated, global agency networks, Young & Rubicam and Grey.[9]
WPP is regarded as the driving force for the period of consolidation which has been going on within the communications industry for the last ten to fifteen years. WPP group has amassed the largest media buying group in the world, GroupM. Including its creative agency networks JWT, Ogilvy and Mather, Young & Rubicam and Grey, WPP is one of the "Big Four" major players in the global advertising industry.
WPP has become one of the world's leading communications services and advertising companies valued by the UK stockmarket at £5 billion. With billings of £37 billion and revenues of £7.5 billion, WPP's operating companies provide national, multi-national and global clients with advertising, media investment management, information and consultancy, public relations and public affairs, branding and identity, healthcare communications, direct, digital, promotion and relationship marketing, and specialist communications services. WPP employs 140,000 people in 2,400 offices in 107 countries. He owns a substantial stake in the company through a series of pay awards and his own purchases of shares. Until recently he had never before sold shares in the company; his shares are worth around £70 million.[citation needed]
Sorrell himself is widely respected throughout the advertising industry, with his words being scrutinised and quoted by many within the marketing sector. He had articulated in 1996 how interactive media—including the Internet—could transform the way we build brands and communicate to consumers in a November 1996 Harvard Business Review article, "The Future of Interactive Marketing".[10] Many industry observers credit him with the fact that the UK still has an independent, vibrant communications industry. His famed remark that the advertising recession in the early part of this decade was "bath shaped" was one of the most repeated quotes in the 2003 – 2004 period.[citation needed]
On 18 November 2008, WPP technically re-incorporated itself as an offshore entity in Jersey (Jersey is considered as a fiscal paradise by the OECD) in order to reduce an annual tax bill of more than £200million.[11]
In 2014, Sorrell received total compensation from WPP of GBP £40 million, his largest annual total since £53 million in 2004.[1]
Other interests[edit]




Martin Sorrell in 2008


In 1997, he was appointed an Ambassador for British Business by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and subsequently appointed to the Office's Panel 2000 aimed at rebranding Britain abroad. In 1999 he was appointed by the Secretary of State for Education and Employment to serve on the Council for Excellence in Management and Leadership.
He is a Governor of London Business School, and a member of the Advisory Boards of both the Judge Business School in Cambridge, UK and IESE in Spain. He is also Chairman of the Global Advisory Board of the Centre for International Business and Management (CIBAM), at the University of Cambridge, UK.[12] In 1998, he was appointed to the Board of Directors of Associates of Harvard Business School and to the Board of the Indian School of Business.[9]
On behalf of New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, he chaired Media.NYC.2020,[13] which reviewed the future of the global media industry, the implications for NYC, and suggested actionable next steps for the NYC government.
Criticism[edit]
In 2005 Sorrell sold £9m of shares in WPP at the end of a restricted stock holding period. He also agreed to change a contract with the company which had been much criticised by institutional shareholders in WPP as being unfairly written in Sorrell's favour. Under the previous agreement if Sorrell had been terminated, it would have led to a very large payout; the new agreement provides him instead with no termination payment.
In 2005 his pay was £2.42 million including cash and bonuses.[14] Further he exercised £52 million in share options, is entitled to a further £5.8million in stock, and deferred further options on another 2.65 million shares valued at £15 million until 2008.[15] In 2011 Sorrell's pay package increased by 70% to £4.5 million after WPP's pre-tax profits rose 28%.[16] In October 2011 Sorrell went on the BBC to defend large increases in his and other CEO pay packages[17] at a time when real average wages in the Western world are declining.[18][19]
Shareholders have criticised aspects of corporate governance at WPP. This came to the fore again in 2006 with the advent of two court cases revolving around alleged corruption in an Italian subsidiary and contract disputes with the US launch of the OK! magazine.
In June 2008 WPP drew strong criticism for the involvement of an agency, 'Imago', in which WPP's Y&R subsidiary held a minority interest, with the ZANU-PF presidential campaign in Zimbabwe. A report by the Financial Times[20] found out that Imago was employed by Robert Mugabe's campaign for reelection to the presidency of Zimbabwe. WPP subsequently divested Y&R's minority interests in Zimbabwe.[21]
Recognition[edit]
He was knighted in the 2000 New Year Honours.[22] On 27 September 2007, Sorrell was awarded the Harvard Business School’s highest honour, the Alumni Achievement Award, by Dean Jay O. Light. The award was also given to: Ayala Corp. chair Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala, A. Malachi Mixon of Invacare, Donna Dubinsky and Hansjorg Wyss of Synthes.[23] In 2015 he was a Trustee of the British Museum.[24]
Personal life[edit]
Sorrell is married to Cristiana Falcone, director of media and entertainment industries at the World Economic Forum.[25][26]
Sorrell was previously married to the American-born[25] Sandra Finestone, with whom he has three sons, but the marriage broke down in 2003, as a result of Sir Martin's "obsession with work".[25] In October 2005, he cashed in £12 million of WPP shares to fund the divorce,[27] in which Ms. Finestone, represented by Nicholas Mostyn QC, was awarded a £30 million settlement including: a £3.25m four-storey Georgian townhouse; two Harrods underground car parking spaces worth around £90,000 each; £23.5m in cash; £2m in bank deposits; and other assets including stocks and shares.[25][27][28] Despite the divorce settlement, Sorrell still had 13 million shares, an estimated £80m stake in WPP, at the time of the divorce, which represented around 1% of the company, plus his 2005 pay settlement award.[27]
The divorce settlement was, at the time, the largest divorce settlement in British legal history,[25] and was unusual in being a 60/40 split in favour of Sir Martin — a break from the previously-established policy of a 50/50 split even in big-money divorces since an influential ruling by Appeal Court Justice Mathew Thorpe in the 2002 divorce between Harry and Shan Lambert established that the contribution to the household of non-working wives should be considered equal to their husbands'.[28] In the Lambert judgement, Lord Justice Thorpe stated that "special contribution remains a legitimate possibility but only in exceptional circumstances"; Sir Martin was the first husband deemed to have met that criterion in a subsequent divorce settlement, with Mr Justice Bennett citing Sir Martin's "special contribution" to the family's wealth in justification.[28]
Sorrell's three sons, Mark, Jonathan and Robert all went to Cambridge University and then Goldman Sachs, although two have since left.[29] Jonathan is chief financial officer of the commodities hedge fund Man Group.[30]

 Sir Martin Sorrell has been allowed to keep his £43million package, which includes £274,000 to fly wife Lady Cristiana Falcone-Sorrell around the worldBritain's highest paid FTSE 100 boss has been allowed to keep his £43million pay package – including £274,000 to fly his wife around the world.Sir Martin Sorrell’s exorbitant pay package includes the perk for his second wife, Lady Cristiana Falcone-Sorrell, to accompany him on business trips.The perk was branded ‘ridiculous’ and ‘odd’, as critics questioned whether the advertising tycoon needed an allowance for his wife on top of his bumper pay package.Italian-born Lady Cristiana, who is almost 30 years younger than her 70-year-old husband, accompanies him on trips in between carrying out her own role with the World Economic Forum in Switzerland.Sir Martin, the chief executive of the world’s largest advertising agency WPP, is also paid £50,000 a year to stay in his own homes, including his New York flat, while on business, on the premise this saves the company money on hotel bills.Yesterday, almost a quarter of investors refused to back the enormous £43million annual pay packet at an annual shareholders’ meeting, but were over-ruled by the majority.Some shareholders argued that the pay was ‘more than enough’ and criticised the chief executive for all the add-on perks included in his package.But Sir Martin, who lives with his wife in a grand four-storey townhouse in Knightsbridge, has argued he is worth the money.Addressing his performance head-on at the annual meeting in central London, the chief executive said any shareholder who invested £1,000 pounds 20 years ago would now have a holding worth £15,800.But Luke Hildyard, of the High Pay Centre, said: ‘If Sorrell was paid a more sensible, proportionate amount of money, he would be more famous for his undoubted business prowess than for his ludicrous pay packages.  





 Sir Martin has argued that he is worth the money - but one critic said his salary made him 'look a bit grubby'‘Instead he makes himself look a bit grubby and ridiculous with these payments.‘It’s hard to fathom the thought process of someone who is paid £43 million but still wants to weasel money out of his company to pay for his wife’s trips abroad.‘Ordinary people, whose employers mostly don’t pay for their spouse to accompany them to work, might find this a little odd.’

Roger Jeary, a trustee of ShareAction, said yesterday: ‘I am concerned that this remuneration package does not offer value for shareholders.’But another private shareholder called Mr Hudson, speaking at the annual meeting, said: ‘Martin is worth every penny.’Sir Martin, who built up WPP from nothing in 1986 into one of Britain’s best known companies, has clashed repeatedly with investors over his pay in the past few years.  





 Sir Martin has clashed repeatedly with investors over the amount he is paid in the past few yearsBut the number of investors objecting has decreased over time. Nearly 60 percent of shareholders rejected his pay package in 2012, compared to 30 percent last year and 22 per cent this year.Ashley Hamilton Claxton, at shareholder Royal London Asset Management, said: ‘There is no doubt that Martin Sorrell is a successful CEO who has created value for shareholders, but sometimes investors need to ask themselves ‘when is enough, enough?’.‘In our view, £43million is more than enough.’Guy Jubb, of Standard Life, who opposed the pay reward, said: ‘We have been concerned for some time by the perception that Sir Martin has the potential to dominate the board’s decision taking.’Sir Martin’s 2005 divorce from his first wife Sandra cost him £29.3million.During the divorce hearing, it was claimed that his business interests took him away from home for weeks at a time, apparently placing a strain on their marriage.American-born Lady Sorrell said she felt ‘marginalised and dehumanised’ as he threw himself into his career. She claimed his obsession with work was the reason for the marriage breaking down in 2003.Sir Martin has donated millions of pounds to his charitable foundation over the years, which supports cancer research.

Sorrell joined Glendinning Associates, then James Gulliver and then worked for the sports agent Mark McCormack.[7] He joined Saatchi & Saatchi in 1975, and was group finance director from 1977 until 1984. Often referred to as "the third brother",[8] he designed and carried out many of Saatchi's agency acquisitions. Sorrell undertook this by refining the practice of the ‘earn-out’.
WPP[edit]
In 1985, Sorrell privately invested in Wire and Plastic Products, a British wire shopping basket manufacturer, and joined it full-time as Chief Executive in 1986. He began to acquire "below-the-line" advertising-related companies, purchasing 18 in three years, including in 1987 when he stunned the agency world with a $566 million hostile takeover of J. Walter Thompson. Sorrell followed this in 1989 with another dramatic hostile $825 million buy of Ogilvy and Mather. Since 2000, WPP has also acquired two more integrated, global agency networks, Young & Rubicam and Grey.[9]
WPP is regarded as the driving force for the period of consolidation which has been going on within the communications industry for the last ten to fifteen years. WPP group has amassed the largest media buying group in the world, GroupM. Including its creative agency networks JWT, Ogilvy and Mather, Young & Rubicam and Grey, WPP is one of the "Big Four" major players in the global advertising industry.
WPP has become one of the world's leading communications services and advertising companies valued by the UK stockmarket at £5 billion. With billings of £37 billion and revenues of £7.5 billion, WPP's operating companies provide national, multi-national and global clients with advertising, media investment management, information and consultancy, public relations and public affairs, branding and identity, healthcare communications, direct, digital, promotion and relationship marketing, and specialist communications services. WPP employs 140,000 people in 2,400 offices in 107 countries. He owns a substantial stake in the company through a series of pay awards and his own purchases of shares. Until recently he had never before sold shares in the company; his shares are worth around £70 million.[citation needed]
Sorrell himself is widely respected throughout the advertising industry, with his words being scrutinised and quoted by many within the marketing sector. He had articulated in 1996 how interactive media—including the Internet—could transform the way we build brands and communicate to consumers in a November 1996 Harvard Business Review article, "The Future of Interactive Marketing".[10] Many industry observers credit him with the fact that the UK still has an independent, vibrant communications industry. His famed remark that the advertising recession in the early part of this decade was "bath shaped" was one of the most repeated quotes in the 2003 – 2004 period.[citation needed]
On 18 November 2008, WPP technically re-incorporated itself as an offshore entity in Jersey (Jersey is considered as a fiscal paradise by the OECD) in order to reduce an annual tax bill of more than £200million.[11]
In 2014, Sorrell received total compensation from WPP of GBP £40 million, his largest annual total since £53 million in 2004.[1]
Other interests[edit]




Martin Sorrell in 2008


In 1997, he was appointed an Ambassador for British Business by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and subsequently appointed to the Office's Panel 2000 aimed at rebranding Britain abroad. In 1999 he was appointed by the Secretary of State for Education and Employment to serve on the Council for Excellence in Management and Leadership.
He is a Governor of London Business School, and a member of the Advisory Boards of both the Judge Business School in Cambridge, UK and IESE in Spain. He is also Chairman of the Global Advisory Board of the Centre for International Business and Management (CIBAM), at the University of Cambridge, UK.[12] In 1998, he was appointed to the Board of Directors of Associates of Harvard Business School and to the Board of the Indian School of Business.[9]
On behalf of New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, he chaired Media.NYC.2020,[13] which reviewed the future of the global media industry, the implications for NYC, and suggested actionable next steps for the NYC government.
Criticism[edit]
In 2005 Sorrell sold £9m of shares in WPP at the end of a restricted stock holding period. He also agreed to change a contract with the company which had been much criticised by institutional shareholders in WPP as being unfairly written in Sorrell's favour. Under the previous agreement if Sorrell had been terminated, it would have led to a very large payout; the new agreement provides him instead with no termination payment.
In 2005 his pay was £2.42 million including cash and bonuses.[14] Further he exercised £52 million in share options, is entitled to a further £5.8million in stock, and deferred further options on another 2.65 million shares valued at £15 million until 2008.[15] In 2011 Sorrell's pay package increased by 70% to £4.5 million after WPP's pre-tax profits rose 28%.[16] In October 2011 Sorrell went on the BBC to defend large increases in his and other CEO pay packages[17] at a time when real average wages in the Western world are declining.[18][19]
Shareholders have criticised aspects of corporate governance at WPP. This came to the fore again in 2006 with the advent of two court cases revolving around alleged corruption in an Italian subsidiary and contract disputes with the US launch of the OK! magazine.
In June 2008 WPP drew strong criticism for the involvement of an agency, 'Imago', in which WPP's Y&R subsidiary held a minority interest, with the ZANU-PF presidential campaign in Zimbabwe. A report by the Financial Times[20] found out that Imago was employed by Robert Mugabe's campaign for reelection to the presidency of Zimbabwe. WPP subsequently divested Y&R's minority interests in Zimbabwe.[21]
Recognition[edit]
He was knighted in the 2000 New Year Honours.[22] On 27 September 2007, Sorrell was awarded the Harvard Business School’s highest honour, the Alumni Achievement Award, by Dean Jay O. Light. The award was also given to: Ayala Corp. chair Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala, A. Malachi Mixon of Invacare, Donna Dubinsky and Hansjorg Wyss of Synthes.[23] In 2015 he was a Trustee of the British Museum.[24]
Personal life[edit]
Sorrell is married to Cristiana Falcone, director of media and entertainment industries at the World Economic Forum.[25][26]
Sorrell was previously married to the American-born[25] Sandra Finestone, with whom he has three sons, but the marriage broke down in 2003, as a result of Sir Martin's "obsession with work".[25] In October 2005, he cashed in £12 million of WPP shares to fund the divorce,[27] in which Ms. Finestone, represented by Nicholas Mostyn QC, was awarded a £30 million settlement including: a £3.25m four-storey Georgian townhouse; two Harrods underground car parking spaces worth around £90,000 each; £23.5m in cash; £2m in bank deposits; and other assets including stocks and shares.[25][27][28] Despite the divorce settlement, Sorrell still had 13 million shares, an estimated £80m stake in WPP, at the time of the divorce, which represented around 1% of the company, plus his 2005 pay settlement award.[27]
The divorce settlement was, at the time, the largest divorce settlement in British legal history,[25] and was unusual in being a 60/40 split in favour of Sir Martin — a break from the previously-established policy of a 50/50 split even in big-money divorces since an influential ruling by Appeal Court Justice Mathew Thorpe in the 2002 divorce between Harry and Shan Lambert established that the contribution to the household of non-working wives should be considered equal to their husbands'.[28] In the Lambert judgement, Lord Justice Thorpe stated that "special contribution remains a legitimate possibility but only in exceptional circumstances"; Sir Martin was the first husband deemed to have met that criterion in a subsequent divorce settlement, with Mr Justice Bennett citing Sir Martin's "special contribution" to the family's wealth in justification.[28]
Sorrell's three sons, Mark, Jonathan and Robert all went to Cambridge University and then Goldman Sachs, although two have since left.[29] Jonathan is chief financial officer of the commodities hedge fund Man Group.[30]

Sorry for my poor english translation

  The new challenge of Sir Martin Sorrell
 With the acquisition of Grey, WPP would become the world's largest advertising groups. But he will have to live two rivals Unilever and Procter & Gamble.
Sir Martin has struck again. The greatest predator the world of advertising, Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP, has just afford the seventh group of global industry: Grey. A transaction valued at 1.31 billion, or nearly once the U.S. group's revenues, which totaled $ 1.43 billion in 2003. A ratio well below that of other transactions of this kind. To acquire Bcom3 in 2002, Publicis had paid 1.6 times the earnings of the holding company of Leo Burnett and D'Arcy.
So a new trophy hanging on the hunting board already full, the CEO of WPP, which has successively set his sights on J. Walter Thompson (1987), Ogilvy & Mather (1989) and Young & Rubicam (2000), as well Tempus in 2001. Ironically, on the case as then Grey on Tempus WPP takes all ahead in Havas. Candidate to buy the network Ed Meyer, the group chaired by Alain de Pouzilhac did not want to out-bid by WPP (see sidebar).
With this acquisition, WPP donning a short head Omnicom based on 2003 revenue (8.637 billion dollars with Grey, against 8.621 billion). More important, the boss of WPP acquires a fourth global network. A new offer on the market. But this solution was probably imposed to manage the main budget Grey, representing over 10% of its revenues: Procter & Gamble. Martin Sorrell will have to demonstrate that they can coexist within the same group two rivals also demanding that P & G and Unilever (client history of J. Walter Thompson). Publicis, another major partner of P & G, a prospective time in the race to buy Grey, will not pray out of the woodwork at the slightest problem. Conversely, P & G has perhaps no interest in putting all your eggs in one basket.
Martin Sorrell has also promised to increase the operating margin of Grey, particularly low in relation to market standards. An objective requiring radical methods that could cringe at Grey. Ed Meyer, seventy-seven years, will remain in effect at the head of the group until late 2006. That's enough to fill the remaining months of Martin Sorrell, whose strategy seems to boil down to a mad race for acquisitions. Twenty years after Saatchi, ephemeral world number one and was its finance director, Sir Martin was clearly a revenge.

Sir Martin Sorrell, WPP CEO: the share of investment in new media advertising will continue to rise
The chief executive of advertising agency WPP and global communication, Sir Martin Sorrell, had nothing very encouraging to tell television professionals came to hear at MIP-TV, the international market for television programs Cannes. A veteran of the advertising and marketing believes the economic crisis will force the media to review their production costs and their business models and expected that the share of advertising spending continues to slip from old to new media.

Shortly after the takeover of TNS Sofres, WPP tells the press he set up his headquarters in the Isle of Jersey (considered a tax haven by the OECD) 2.

A giant talking
Martin Sorrell, boss of WPP global leader, has built his group shots spectacular raids. He observes the turmoil in the sector in France and his point of view on the evolution of a market that weighs heavy in our economies and our lifestyles
It's a sly glance at the ogre who mask at a flow rate of any British suavity a fiery temperament. For nearly ten years than Sir Martin Sorrell, a British burning certainty that the Queen of England knighted, two years ago, marauding in the global advertising landscape. The Rhythm of campaigns at no charge, this pattern Swift, who displays his picture greedily hunting, was able to get his group, WPP, the rank of a small business than a global leader employing 65,000 people across the globe, including 3,000 in France. Like Rupert Murdoch in an audiovisual digesting at breakneck speed acquisitions, Martin Sorrell is driven by a galloping frenzy that nothing seems exhausted. Its engine? Twisted as hell, this raider has a reputation of never trusting his opponents, convinced that they gave way sooner or later ... A day in New York, another Singapore or Mexico, Sorrell was in Paris at the end of spring. What was he doing in France? Why was there lurking? "I just smell the air," he confided to The Express then, ironically, while the future of the Havas group, since the intrusion of muscular Vincent Bollore, after a stormy meeting of shareholders held June 9, continues to excite the envy and conjecture the most diverse. The Englishman, who spoke repeatedly of the file with the industrial Breton Havas, invite them there one day? Whoever had a hand in the past year, nose and beard of the leaders of Havas, precisely, on a jewel of the advertising world, one of the last major independent agencies in the world, Grey evokes the economy, trends in global advertising market, and maneuvers ahead. All on background after the referendum on EU constitution: poll about which Sir Martin Sorrell, of course, an opinion. As always definitive.

  -> Created for Lady Cristiana Falcone Sorrell
"A tough and relentless predator": how do you react to these qualifiers, including the press and the world of advertising you are accustomed to dress up? Look at me: do I really look like that?
I do not really think. If I was portrayed as, from time to time, because I'm trying to build, with strength and conviction, for a decade, step by step and year after year, in this rough world where competition is still terrible A group of global reach. But I think succeeded. My dream, my ambition is that eventually every business leader, every student leaving university have with respect to the group that I lead a Pavlovian reflex just. I hope that WPP become a kind of passage, an icon of the pub that attracts the best. In short, an essential corporate markets marketing and communication. Because the canvas on which we paint every morning continues to grow: if the United States and Western Europe now represent 80% of our turnover, and Asia, Africa and the Eastern Europe the remaining 20%, I think, tomorrow, the globalization of the economy will make us strong as the other side of the Atlantic, the United States, on the Asian continent or called emerging countries of Eastern Europe. The explosion of non-traditional media, interactive era, beginning with the Internet is shaking up the market in new ways. I am struck by the fact that in Britain, for example, enthusiasm for careers in advertising has never been stronger. There are countless young managers willing to engage with greed in this industry that seems to have regained its might.

What are the big trends this year?
WPP, which marks the 20th anniversary next July, has been the best year ever in 2001 and has grown steadily over the past two years, after a slight backlash in 2002. 2004 will be a good vintage: the group, which saw its profits increase 15% to 546 million pounds, has reaped very large budgets, including those of Microsoft, Samsung and HSBC. And today, we digest the Grey agency: it will take three years to the exact toll of this great acquisition. But I can tell you already, that Grey is a great step for WPP. I do not regret myself launched an assault on the agency: together we weigh currently about $ 10 billion in sales.
