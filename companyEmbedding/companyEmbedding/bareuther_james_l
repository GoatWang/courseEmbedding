MGP Ingredients Announces Agreement Of James L. Bareuther To Serve As Director Upon Election At 2016 Annual Meeting






GlobeNewswire



Apr 7, 2016 8:00 AM EDT













 




























































 ATCHISON, Kan., April 07, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MGP Ingredients, Inc. (Nasdaq:MGPI), a leading supplier of premium distilled spirits and specialty wheat proteins and starches, today announced that James L. Bareuther agreed to serve as a director if elected by MGP's common shareholders at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders scheduled for May 19, 2016. Bareuther served as chief operating officer of Brown-Forman Corporation from 2003 until his retirement in 2010.  At Brown-Forman, he was responsible for the company's spirits and wine business in more than 140 countries across the globe.  Prior to joining Brown-Forman as director of U.S. sales in 1994, Bareuther was executive vice president of sales and marketing for the Seagram Classics Wine Company in New York and California.  He previously worked for Beringer Vineyards, a leading wine firm in Napa Valley, California.  He is a former three-term chairman of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS), a national trade association based in Washington, D.C., representing producers and marketers of distilled spirits sold in the U.S. and around the world.  He has served as a director of First Beverage Group since 2012 and as chairman of its board of directors since April 2014.  Additionally, Bareuther has served on the boards of directors of Luna Winery since 2013 and Windy Hill Spirits since 2012. "We are extremely pleased and honored to gain the vast experience and industry knowledge that Jim Bareuther will bring to the MGP board of directors," said Gus Griffin, president and CEO of MGP.  "His wisdom, expertise and insights will be an invaluable resource in helping guide the evolution and expansion of our Distillery Products business segment." Bareuther was nominated for election as a director to fill the vacancy created by current director John Bridendall's decision not to stand for re-election when his term expires at this year's Annual Meeting of Shareholders.  "We are extremely grateful for the valuable contributions John made to MGP's business and financial performance the past three years as a result of his extensive experience and expertise in the beverage alcohol industry," said Karen Seaberg, chairperson of the board of directors. "John also played a critical role in achieving success in the 2013 proxy contest for control of MGP's board of directors."

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.

ATCHISON, KAS. — James L. Bareuther has agreed to join the board of directors of MGP Ingredients Inc. if elected by the company’s common shareholders at the annual shareholders meeting May 19.
Mr. Bareuther was chief operating officer of Brown-Forman Corp. from 2003 until his retirement in 2010. At Brown-Forman, he was responsible for the company’s spirits and wine business in more than 140 countries across the globe.
Prior to joining Brown-Forman as director of U.S. sales in 1994, Mr. Bareuther was executive vice-president of sales and marketing for the Seagram Classics Wine Co. in New York and California. He previously worked for Beringer Vineyards in Napa Valley, Calif. He is a former three-term chairman of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, a national trade association based in Washington.
He has served as a director of First Beverage Group since 2012 and as chairman of its board of directors since April 2014. Additionally, Mr. Bareuther has served on the boards of directors of Luna Winery since 2013 and Windy Hill Spirits since 2012.
“We are extremely pleased and honored to gain the vast experience and industry knowledge that Jim Bareuther will bring to the MGP board of directors,” said Gus Griffin, president and chief executive officer of MGPI. “His wisdom, expertise and insights will be an invaluable resource in helping guide the evolution and expansion of our Distillery Products business segment.”
Mr. Bareuther was nominated for election as a director to fill the vacancy created by current director John Bridendall’s decision not to stand for re-election when his term expires at this year’s annual shareholders meeting.
