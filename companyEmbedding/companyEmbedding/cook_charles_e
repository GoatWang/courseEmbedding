Cook graduated in 1972 from Captain Shreve High School in Shreveport and attended Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.[1]
Cook worked on Capitol Hill for then-Senator J. Bennett Johnston, Jr., a Democrat from Shreveport who served from 1972 to 1997. Cook also worked for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, and the Democratic Policy Committee. In addition, he worked as a pollster and campaign consultant and on the staff of BUILD-PAC, the political action committee of the trade association, the National Association of Home Builders.[1]
In 1984, he founded the newsletter The Cook Political Report,[1] which publishes analyses of the primaries and general elections for federal political offices and state governorships. The Report's predictions are accorded high credibility among journalists and politicians.[2] CBS News' Bob Schieffer called the Cook Political Report "the bible of the political community."[citation needed]
The New York Times has called Cook "one of the best political handicappers in the nation" and has said the Cook Political Report is "a newsletter which both parties regard as authoritative."[citation needed] David Broder wrote in The Washington Post that Cook was "perhaps the best non-partisan tracker of Congressional races."[citation needed]
In 2006, Cook was inducted into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield.[3]
In 2010, he won the Carey McWilliams award from the American Political Science Association.[4] The award is given annually to honor a major journalistic contribution to our understanding of politics and carries a prize of $750.[4]
In 2013, he served as a Resident Fellow at the Harvard Institute of Politics.[5]
Family life[edit]
Cook is the son of Mary Hudgens Cook and Charles Cook, Sr. (Magnolia, Arkansas 1916–2012). His father was a highly decorated officer in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II, and an electrical engineering graduate from the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville.[6]
Cook and his wife Lucy live in Chevy Chase, Maryland.[6] He has two sisters, Carole and Margaret, and a brother, Robert.[6]

History[edit]
Charles Ragus founded AdvoCare in 1993 as a multi-level marketing (MLM) company that distributes dietary supplement products.[7][8] The name AdvoCare is short for "Advocates Who Care".[9] Before founding AdvoCare, Ragus worked as a regional vice president for Fidelity Union Insurance, and as a multi-level marketing (MLM) distributor for Herbalife. He had initially founded the MLM company Omnitrition International in 1989. Ragus briefly played defensive end for the National Football League's Kansas City Chiefs in the 1960s.[9][10][11] He died in 2001 at the age 58.[12][13]
In May 2007, Richard H. Wright became president and CEO of AdvoCare. Wright had previously served as Chief of Staff for US Representative Jim McCrery.[7][14]
Products[edit]
AdvoCare sells several lines of dietary supplements under the brand names Trim, Active, Well, Performance Elite, Fit, and 24 Day Challenge.[15]
Business[edit]
AdvoCare is a multilevel marketing company.[3][4][5] In addition to revenue from product sales, AdvoCare distributors can potentially earn additional commissions from sales by their 'downline' distributors. According to the company's 2013 Income disclosure statement, the average annual income, not including expenses, for AdvoCare distributors who were 'active' in 2013 (defined as earning a payment during the year) was $1,704.08.[16]
In a 2010 court case Advocare said that it had around 60,000 active distributors, and had sold approximately 350,000 distributorships since 2003.[6]
AdvoCare is a member of the U.S. Direct Selling Association (DSA), and participated in the 2010 DSA Code of Ethics Communication Initiative.[17] AdvoCare President Richard Wright served on the DSA Board of Directors in 2011.[18]
Sponsorships and Endorsements[edit]




Trevor Bayne's AdvoCare-branded Ford Mustang in NASCAR competition.


Among AdvoCare's contracted celebrity endorsers are NFL quarterbacks Andy Dalton, Philip Rivers and Alex Smith; Major League Baseball pitcher Doug Fister; CrossFit champion Rich Froning; and, previously, Carli Lloyd, Sam Bradford, and Wes Welker.[9] However, their most important spokesman is New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees.[9] Celebrity endorsers are said to be central to "the Bulletproof Shield," a key sales and recruitment technique used by the company: distributors place themselves at the center of a chart illustrating the company's endorsements and members of its scientific and medical advisory board, and deflects questions about the company by replying, "Well, I don't know about (X), but what I do know is" that particular athletes or doctors have endorsed AdvoCare.[9]
From 2009 until 2013, AdvoCare was the title sponsor of the Independence Bowl in Shreveport, Louisiana. The 2013 game was known as the AdvoCare V100 Bowl.[19][20][21] In 2012, AdvoCare partnered with the Major League Soccer team FC Dallas and became its jersey sponsor.[22]
In 2014, AdvoCare secured the naming rights of a professional sports practice facility located at The Greenbrier in West Virginia.[23] The facility was named the AdvoCare Sports Performance Center and hosted the 2014 training camp for the New Orleans Saints.[24][25][26] AdvoCare also became the title sponsor of the 2014 Texas Bowl.[27] In 2016, AdvoCare will be sponsoring the Texas Kickoff and Cowboys Classic games.[28][29]
Since 2011,[30][31] AdvoCare has sponsored several NASCAR racing teams, as well as races at Atlanta Motor Speedway and Phoenix International Raceway.[30][31] The company has sponsored driver Trevor Bayne and Roush Fenway Racing in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series and Xfinity Series since 2014.[9][32]
Controversy[edit]
In July 2008, Olympic swimmer Jessica Hardy tested positive for the banned breathing enhancer, clenbuterol. Hardy said she had never heard of the substance, attributing the positive result to either a tainted supplement or sabotage.[33][34] At the time, Hardy had been taking the supplement Arginine Extreme, which she had received for free from AdvoCare in exchange for making product testimonials,[35][36] and she claimed in a subsequent lawsuit that the company's product was tainted.[37] AdvoCare sued Hardy for making false claims.[38] An arbitration hearing reduced Hardy's suspension after a scientific expert testified that the AdvoCare product was tainted. AdvoCare disputed the panel's findings, saying that two independent laboratories had not found any evidence of Clenbuterol in the supplements.[39]
In 2009, a Dallas County jury awarded $1.9 million in damages against AdvoCare after finding that the company had engaged in deceptive trade practices and unfairly canceled agreements with two of its distributors.[40] According to the lawsuit, litigants Bruce and Teresa Badgett of Arlington, Texas, had been active and profitable marketers of AdvoCare products for more than a dozen years before their distributorship was canceled by the company in 2006 "based upon vague and trumped-up charges." The jury found that AdvoCare engaged in false, misleading or deceptive practices that damaged the Badgetts and that the termination provisions of the distributor contract with AdvoCare were unconscionable, according to court documents. AdvoCare disputed the ruling[40] and on April 30, 2010, filed to appeal the decision on the basis that the plaintiffs were not customers and therefore did not fit the statutory definition necessary to be covered under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act.[41] The appeal was dismissed on March 13, 2012 and the company was ordered to reimburse the Badgett's for court costs related to their defense in the appeal case.[42]
AdvoCare ceased offering KickStart Spark, targeted to youth age 4-11, after pediatricians had expressed concerns about the product containing 60 mg of caffeine.[43] AdvoCare was also the subject of criticism for its marketing at youth athletic events. In 2005, the company paid $5,000 to sponsor a high school wrestling tournament in Sacramento but after negative publicity, AdvoCare officials said they would not sponsor any more school events.[43]
Wendy Miller of the Beaumont Weight Control Center said AdvoCare's Herbal Cleanse is probably safe for many users, but she suggested that the same results could be achieved without the products.[44]
In March 2016, Advocare was the subject of a critical exposée in ESPN The Magazine. The exposée argues that the company and a small number of distributors at the top of a distribution network makes most of its money from the signing-up of new distributors rather than sales of the product, while exaggerating the likelihood of financial success of distributors when only a few make a significant amount of money; that the company creates a cult-like atmosphere of not questioning the company's claims or the probability of financial success in new distributors, to the point where distributors will shun friends and family members who do so; and that the company is internally riven by divisions over the company's strong use of religious affiliation as part of its business model, with more devout members of the organization using it to gain and hold power in the organization and over its members.[9]

History[edit]
Charles Ragus founded AdvoCare in 1993 as a multi-level marketing (MLM) company that distributes dietary supplement products.[7][8] The name AdvoCare is short for "Advocates Who Care".[9] Before founding AdvoCare, Ragus worked as a regional vice president for Fidelity Union Insurance, and as a multi-level marketing (MLM) distributor for Herbalife. He had initially founded the MLM company Omnitrition International in 1989. Ragus briefly played defensive end for the National Football League's Kansas City Chiefs in the 1960s.[9][10][11] He died in 2001 at the age 58.[12][13]
In May 2007, Richard H. Wright became president and CEO of AdvoCare. Wright had previously served as Chief of Staff for US Representative Jim McCrery.[7][14]
Products[edit]
AdvoCare sells several lines of dietary supplements under the brand names Trim, Active, Well, Performance Elite, Fit, and 24 Day Challenge.[15]
Business[edit]
AdvoCare is a multilevel marketing company.[3][4][5] In addition to revenue from product sales, AdvoCare distributors can potentially earn additional commissions from sales by their 'downline' distributors. According to the company's 2013 Income disclosure statement, the average annual income, not including expenses, for AdvoCare distributors who were 'active' in 2013 (defined as earning a payment during the year) was $1,704.08.[16]
In a 2010 court case Advocare said that it had around 60,000 active distributors, and had sold approximately 350,000 distributorships since 2003.[6]
AdvoCare is a member of the U.S. Direct Selling Association (DSA), and participated in the 2010 DSA Code of Ethics Communication Initiative.[17] AdvoCare President Richard Wright served on the DSA Board of Directors in 2011.[18]
Sponsorships and Endorsements[edit]




Trevor Bayne's AdvoCare-branded Ford Mustang in NASCAR competition.


Among AdvoCare's contracted celebrity endorsers are NFL quarterbacks Andy Dalton, Philip Rivers and Alex Smith; Major League Baseball pitcher Doug Fister; CrossFit champion Rich Froning; and, previously, Carli Lloyd, Sam Bradford, and Wes Welker.[9] However, their most important spokesman is New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees.[9] Celebrity endorsers are said to be central to "the Bulletproof Shield," a key sales and recruitment technique used by the company: distributors place themselves at the center of a chart illustrating the company's endorsements and members of its scientific and medical advisory board, and deflects questions about the company by replying, "Well, I don't know about (X), but what I do know is" that particular athletes or doctors have endorsed AdvoCare.[9]
From 2009 until 2013, AdvoCare was the title sponsor of the Independence Bowl in Shreveport, Louisiana. The 2013 game was known as the AdvoCare V100 Bowl.[19][20][21] In 2012, AdvoCare partnered with the Major League Soccer team FC Dallas and became its jersey sponsor.[22]

Since 2011,[30][31] AdvoCare has sponsored several NASCAR racing teams, as well as races at Atlanta Motor Speedway and Phoenix International Raceway.[30][31] The company has sponsored driver Trevor Bayne and Roush Fenway Racing in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series and Xfinity Series since 2014.[9][32]

(September 2013) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Cook graduated in 1972 from Captain Shreve High School in Shreveport and attended Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.[1]
Cook worked on Capitol Hill for then-Senator J. Bennett Johnston, Jr., a Democrat from Shreveport who served from 1972 to 1997. Cook also worked for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, and the Democratic Policy Committee. In addition, he worked as a pollster and campaign consultant and on the staff of BUILD-PAC, the political action committee of the trade association, the National Association of Home Builders.[1]
In 1984, he founded the newsletter The Cook Political Report,[1] which publishes analyses of the primaries and general elections for federal political offices and state governorships. The Report's predictions are accorded high credibility among journalists and politicians.[2] CBS News' Bob Schieffer called the Cook Political Report "the bible of the political community."[citation needed]
The New York Times has called Cook "one of the best political handicappers in the nation" and has said the Cook Political Report is "a newsletter which both parties regard as authoritative."[citation needed] David Broder wrote in The Washington Post that Cook was "perhaps the best non-partisan tracker of Congressional races."[citation needed]
In 2006, Cook was inducted into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield.[3]
In 2010, he won the Carey McWilliams award from the American Political Science Association.[4] The award is given annually to honor a major journalistic contribution to our understanding of politics and carries a prize of $750.[4]
In 2013, he served as a Resident Fellow at the Harvard Institute of Politics.[5]
Family life[edit]
Cook is the son of Mary Hudgens Cook and Charles Cook, Sr. (Magnolia, Arkansas 1916–2012). His father was a highly decorated officer in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II, and an electrical engineering graduate from the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville.[6]
Cook and his wife Lucy live in Chevy Chase, Maryland.[6] He has two sisters, Carole and Margaret, and a brother, Robert.[6]

History[edit]
Charles Ragus founded AdvoCare in 1993 as a multi-level marketing (MLM) company that distributes dietary supplement products.[7][8] The name AdvoCare is short for "Advocates Who Care".[9] Before founding AdvoCare, Ragus worked as a regional vice president for Fidelity Union Insurance, and as a multi-level marketing (MLM) distributor for Herbalife. He had initially founded the MLM company Omnitrition International in 1989. Ragus briefly played defensive end for the National Football League's Kansas City Chiefs in the 1960s.[9][10][11] He died in 2001 at the age 58.[12][13]
In May 2007, Richard H. Wright became president and CEO of AdvoCare. Wright had previously served as Chief of Staff for US Representative Jim McCrery.[7][14]
Products[edit]
AdvoCare sells several lines of dietary supplements under the brand names Trim, Active, Well, Performance Elite, Fit, and 24 Day Challenge.[15]
Business[edit]
AdvoCare is a multilevel marketing company.[3][4][5] In addition to revenue from product sales, AdvoCare distributors can potentially earn additional commissions from sales by their 'downline' distributors. According to the company's 2013 Income disclosure statement, the average annual income, not including expenses, for AdvoCare distributors who were 'active' in 2013 (defined as earning a payment during the year) was $1,704.08.[16]
In a 2010 court case Advocare said that it had around 60,000 active distributors, and had sold approximately 350,000 distributorships since 2003.[6]
AdvoCare is a member of the U.S. Direct Selling Association (DSA), and participated in the 2010 DSA Code of Ethics Communication Initiative.[17] AdvoCare President Richard Wright served on the DSA Board of Directors in 2011.[18]
Sponsorships and Endorsements[edit]




Trevor Bayne's AdvoCare-branded Ford Mustang in NASCAR competition.


Among AdvoCare's contracted celebrity endorsers are NFL quarterbacks Andy Dalton, Philip Rivers and Alex Smith; Major League Baseball pitcher Doug Fister; CrossFit champion Rich Froning; and, previously, Carli Lloyd, Sam Bradford, and Wes Welker.[9] However, their most important spokesman is New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees.[9] Celebrity endorsers are said to be central to "the Bulletproof Shield," a key sales and recruitment technique used by the company: distributors place themselves at the center of a chart illustrating the company's endorsements and members of its scientific and medical advisory board, and deflects questions about the company by replying, "Well, I don't know about (X), but what I do know is" that particular athletes or doctors have endorsed AdvoCare.[9]
From 2009 until 2013, AdvoCare was the title sponsor of the Independence Bowl in Shreveport, Louisiana. The 2013 game was known as the AdvoCare V100 Bowl.[19][20][21] In 2012, AdvoCare partnered with the Major League Soccer team FC Dallas and became its jersey sponsor.[22]
In 2014, AdvoCare secured the naming rights of a professional sports practice facility located at The Greenbrier in West Virginia.[23] The facility was named the AdvoCare Sports Performance Center and hosted the 2014 training camp for the New Orleans Saints.[24][25][26] AdvoCare also became the title sponsor of the 2014 Texas Bowl.[27] In 2016, AdvoCare will be sponsoring the Texas Kickoff and Cowboys Classic games.[28][29]
Since 2011,[30][31] AdvoCare has sponsored several NASCAR racing teams, as well as races at Atlanta Motor Speedway and Phoenix International Raceway.[30][31] The company has sponsored driver Trevor Bayne and Roush Fenway Racing in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series and Xfinity Series since 2014.[9][32]
Controversy[edit]
In July 2008, Olympic swimmer Jessica Hardy tested positive for the banned breathing enhancer, clenbuterol. Hardy said she had never heard of the substance, attributing the positive result to either a tainted supplement or sabotage.[33][34] At the time, Hardy had been taking the supplement Arginine Extreme, which she had received for free from AdvoCare in exchange for making product testimonials,[35][36] and she claimed in a subsequent lawsuit that the company's product was tainted.[37] AdvoCare sued Hardy for making false claims.[38] An arbitration hearing reduced Hardy's suspension after a scientific expert testified that the AdvoCare product was tainted. AdvoCare disputed the panel's findings, saying that two independent laboratories had not found any evidence of Clenbuterol in the supplements.[39]
In 2009, a Dallas County jury awarded $1.9 million in damages against AdvoCare after finding that the company had engaged in deceptive trade practices and unfairly canceled agreements with two of its distributors.[40] According to the lawsuit, litigants Bruce and Teresa Badgett of Arlington, Texas, had been active and profitable marketers of AdvoCare products for more than a dozen years before their distributorship was canceled by the company in 2006 "based upon vague and trumped-up charges." The jury found that AdvoCare engaged in false, misleading or deceptive practices that damaged the Badgetts and that the termination provisions of the distributor contract with AdvoCare were unconscionable, according to court documents. AdvoCare disputed the ruling[40] and on April 30, 2010, filed to appeal the decision on the basis that the plaintiffs were not customers and therefore did not fit the statutory definition necessary to be covered under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act.[41] The appeal was dismissed on March 13, 2012 and the company was ordered to reimburse the Badgett's for court costs related to their defense in the appeal case.[42]
AdvoCare ceased offering KickStart Spark, targeted to youth age 4-11, after pediatricians had expressed concerns about the product containing 60 mg of caffeine.[43] AdvoCare was also the subject of criticism for its marketing at youth athletic events. In 2005, the company paid $5,000 to sponsor a high school wrestling tournament in Sacramento but after negative publicity, AdvoCare officials said they would not sponsor any more school events.[43]
Wendy Miller of the Beaumont Weight Control Center said AdvoCare's Herbal Cleanse is probably safe for many users, but she suggested that the same results could be achieved without the products.[44]
In March 2016, Advocare was the subject of a critical exposée in ESPN The Magazine. The exposée argues that the company and a small number of distributors at the top of a distribution network makes most of its money from the signing-up of new distributors rather than sales of the product, while exaggerating the likelihood of financial success of distributors when only a few make a significant amount of money; that the company creates a cult-like atmosphere of not questioning the company's claims or the probability of financial success in new distributors, to the point where distributors will shun friends and family members who do so; and that the company is internally riven by divisions over the company's strong use of religious affiliation as part of its business model, with more devout members of the organization using it to gain and hold power in the organization and over its members.[9]

AdvoCare is a member of the U.S. Direct Selling Association (DSA), and participated in the 2010 DSA Code of Ethics Communication Initiative.[17] AdvoCare President Richard Wright served on the DSA Board of Directors in 2011.[18]
Sponsorships and Endorsements[edit]

Among AdvoCare's contracted celebrity endorsers are NFL quarterbacks Andy Dalton, Philip Rivers and Alex Smith; Major League Baseball pitcher Doug Fister; CrossFit champion Rich Froning; and, previously, Carli Lloyd, Sam Bradford, and Wes Welker.[9] However, their most important spokesman is New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees.[9] Celebrity endorsers are said to be central to "the Bulletproof Shield," a key sales and recruitment technique used by the company: distributors place themselves at the center of a chart illustrating the company's endorsements and members of its scientific and medical advisory board, and deflects questions about the company by replying, "Well, I don't know about (X), but what I do know is" that particular athletes or doctors have endorsed AdvoCare.[9]
From 2009 until 2013, AdvoCare was the title sponsor of the Independence Bowl in Shreveport, Louisiana. The 2013 game was known as the AdvoCare V100 Bowl.[19][20][21] In 2012, AdvoCare partnered with the Major League Soccer team FC Dallas and became its jersey sponsor.[22]
In 2014, AdvoCare secured the naming rights of a professional sports practice facility located at The Greenbrier in West Virginia.[23] The facility was named the AdvoCare Sports Performance Center and hosted the 2014 training camp for the New Orleans Saints.[24][25][26] AdvoCare also became the title sponsor of the 2014 Texas Bowl.[27] In 2016, AdvoCare will be sponsoring the Texas Kickoff and Cowboys Classic games.[28][29]
Since 2011,[30][31] AdvoCare has sponsored several NASCAR racing teams, as well as races at Atlanta Motor Speedway and Phoenix International Raceway.[30][31] The company has sponsored driver Trevor Bayne and Roush Fenway Racing in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series and Xfinity Series since 2014.[9][32]
Controversy[edit]
In July 2008, Olympic swimmer Jessica Hardy tested positive for the banned breathing enhancer, clenbuterol. Hardy said she had never heard of the substance, attributing the positive result to either a tainted supplement or sabotage.[33][34] At the time, Hardy had been taking the supplement Arginine Extreme, which she had received for free from AdvoCare in exchange for making product testimonials,[35][36] and she claimed in a subsequent lawsuit that the company's product was tainted.[37] AdvoCare sued Hardy for making false claims.[38] An arbitration hearing reduced Hardy's suspension after a scientific expert testified that the AdvoCare product was tainted. AdvoCare disputed the panel's findings, saying that two independent laboratories had not found any evidence of Clenbuterol in the supplements.[39]
In 2009, a Dallas County jury awarded $1.9 million in damages against AdvoCare after finding that the company had engaged in deceptive trade practices and unfairly canceled agreements with two of its distributors.[40] According to the lawsuit, litigants Bruce and Teresa Badgett of Arlington, Texas, had been active and profitable marketers of AdvoCare products for more than a dozen years before their distributorship was canceled by the company in 2006 "based upon vague and trumped-up charges." The jury found that AdvoCare engaged in false, misleading or deceptive practices that damaged the Badgetts and that the termination provisions of the distributor contract with AdvoCare were unconscionable, according to court documents. AdvoCare disputed the ruling[40] and on April 30, 2010, filed to appeal the decision on the basis that the plaintiffs were not customers and therefore did not fit the statutory definition necessary to be covered under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act.[41] The appeal was dismissed on March 13, 2012 and the company was ordered to reimburse the Badgett's for court costs related to their defense in the appeal case.[42]
AdvoCare ceased offering KickStart Spark, targeted to youth age 4-11, after pediatricians had expressed concerns about the product containing 60 mg of caffeine.[43] AdvoCare was also the subject of criticism for its marketing at youth athletic events. In 2005, the company paid $5,000 to sponsor a high school wrestling tournament in Sacramento but after negative publicity, AdvoCare officials said they would not sponsor any more school events.[43]
Wendy Miller of the Beaumont Weight Control Center said AdvoCare's Herbal Cleanse is probably safe for many users, but she suggested that the same results could be achieved without the products.[44]
In March 2016, Advocare was the subject of a critical exposée in ESPN The Magazine. The exposée argues that the company and a small number of distributors at the top of a distribution network makes most of its money from the signing-up of new distributors rather than sales of the product, while exaggerating the likelihood of financial success of distributors when only a few make a significant amount of money; that the company creates a cult-like atmosphere of not questioning the company's claims or the probability of financial success in new distributors, to the point where distributors will shun friends and family members who do so; and that the company is internally riven by divisions over the company's strong use of religious affiliation as part of its business model, with more devout members of the organization using it to gain and hold power in the organization and over its members.[9]

History[edit]
Charles Ragus founded AdvoCare in 1993 as a multi-level marketing (MLM) company that distributes dietary supplement products.[7][8] The name AdvoCare is short for "Advocates Who Care".[9] Before founding AdvoCare, Ragus worked as a regional vice president for Fidelity Union Insurance, and as a multi-level marketing (MLM) distributor for Herbalife. He had initially founded the MLM company Omnitrition International in 1989. Ragus briefly played defensive end for the National Football League's Kansas City Chiefs in the 1960s.[9][10][11] He died in 2001 at the age 58.[12][13]
In May 2007, Richard H. Wright became president and CEO of AdvoCare. Wright had previously served as Chief of Staff for US Representative Jim McCrery.[7][14]
Products[edit]
AdvoCare sells several lines of dietary supplements under the brand names Trim, Active, Well, Performance Elite, Fit, and 24 Day Challenge.[15]
Business[edit]
AdvoCare is a multilevel marketing company.[3][4][5] In addition to revenue from product sales, AdvoCare distributors can potentially earn additional commissions from sales by their 'downline' distributors. According to the company's 2013 Income disclosure statement, the average annual income, not including expenses, for AdvoCare distributors who were 'active' in 2013 (defined as earning a payment during the year) was $1,704.08.[16]
In a 2010 court case Advocare said that it had around 60,000 active distributors, and had sold approximately 350,000 distributorships since 2003.[6]
AdvoCare is a member of the U.S. Direct Selling Association (DSA), and participated in the 2010 DSA Code of Ethics Communication Initiative.[17] AdvoCare President Richard Wright served on the DSA Board of Directors in 2011.[18]

History[edit]
Charles Ragus founded AdvoCare in 1993 as a multi-level marketing (MLM) company that distributes dietary supplement products.[7][8] The name AdvoCare is short for "Advocates Who Care".[9] Before founding AdvoCare, Ragus worked as a regional vice president for Fidelity Union Insurance, and as a multi-level marketing (MLM) distributor for Herbalife. He had initially founded the MLM company Omnitrition International in 1989. Ragus briefly played defensive end for the National Football League's Kansas City Chiefs in the 1960s.[9][10][11] He died in 2001 at the age 58.[12][13]
In May 2007, Richard H. Wright became president and CEO of AdvoCare. Wright had previously served as Chief of Staff for US Representative Jim McCrery.[7][14]
Products[edit]
AdvoCare sells several lines of dietary supplements under the brand names Trim, Active, Well, Performance Elite, Fit, and 24 Day Challenge.[15]
Business[edit]
AdvoCare is a multilevel marketing company.[3][4][5] In addition to revenue from product sales, AdvoCare distributors can potentially earn additional commissions from sales by their 'downline' distributors. According to the company's 2013 Income disclosure statement, the average annual income, not including expenses, for AdvoCare distributors who were 'active' in 2013 (defined as earning a payment during the year) was $1,704.08.[16]
In a 2010 court case Advocare said that it had around 60,000 active distributors, and had sold approximately 350,000 distributorships since 2003.[6]
AdvoCare is a member of the U.S. Direct Selling Association (DSA), and participated in the 2010 DSA Code of Ethics Communication Initiative.[17] AdvoCare President Richard Wright served on the DSA Board of Directors in 2011.[18]
Sponsorships and Endorsements[edit]




Trevor Bayne's AdvoCare-branded Ford Mustang in NASCAR competition.


Among AdvoCare's contracted celebrity endorsers are NFL quarterbacks Andy Dalton, Philip Rivers and Alex Smith; Major League Baseball pitcher Doug Fister; CrossFit champion Rich Froning; and, previously, Carli Lloyd, Sam Bradford, and Wes Welker.[9] However, their most important spokesman is New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees.[9] Celebrity endorsers are said to be central to "the Bulletproof Shield," a key sales and recruitment technique used by the company: distributors place themselves at the center of a chart illustrating the company's endorsements and members of its scientific and medical advisory board, and deflects questions about the company by replying, "Well, I don't know about (X), but what I do know is" that particular athletes or doctors have endorsed AdvoCare.[9]
From 2009 until 2013, AdvoCare was the title sponsor of the Independence Bowl in Shreveport, Louisiana. The 2013 game was known as the AdvoCare V100 Bowl.[19][20][21] In 2012, AdvoCare partnered with the Major League Soccer team FC Dallas and became its jersey sponsor.[22]
In 2014, AdvoCare secured the naming rights of a professional sports practice facility located at The Greenbrier in West Virginia.[23] The facility was named the AdvoCare Sports Performance Center and hosted the 2014 training camp for the New Orleans Saints.[24][25][26] AdvoCare also became the title sponsor of the 2014 Texas Bowl.[27] In 2016, AdvoCare will be sponsoring the Texas Kickoff and Cowboys Classic games.[28][29]
Since 2011,[30][31] AdvoCare has sponsored several NASCAR racing teams, as well as races at Atlanta Motor Speedway and Phoenix International Raceway.[30][31] The company has sponsored driver Trevor Bayne and Roush Fenway Racing in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series and Xfinity Series since 2014.[9][32]
Controversy[edit]
In July 2008, Olympic swimmer Jessica Hardy tested positive for the banned breathing enhancer, clenbuterol. Hardy said she had never heard of the substance, attributing the positive result to either a tainted supplement or sabotage.[33][34] At the time, Hardy had been taking the supplement Arginine Extreme, which she had received for free from AdvoCare in exchange for making product testimonials,[35][36] and she claimed in a subsequent lawsuit that the company's product was tainted.[37] AdvoCare sued Hardy for making false claims.[38] An arbitration hearing reduced Hardy's suspension after a scientific expert testified that the AdvoCare product was tainted. AdvoCare disputed the panel's findings, saying that two independent laboratories had not found any evidence of Clenbuterol in the supplements.[39]
In 2009, a Dallas County jury awarded $1.9 million in damages against AdvoCare after finding that the company had engaged in deceptive trade practices and unfairly canceled agreements with two of its distributors.[40] According to the lawsuit, litigants Bruce and Teresa Badgett of Arlington, Texas, had been active and profitable marketers of AdvoCare products for more than a dozen years before their distributorship was canceled by the company in 2006 "based upon vague and trumped-up charges." The jury found that AdvoCare engaged in false, misleading or deceptive practices that damaged the Badgetts and that the termination provisions of the distributor contract with AdvoCare were unconscionable, according to court documents. AdvoCare disputed the ruling[40] and on April 30, 2010, filed to appeal the decision on the basis that the plaintiffs were not customers and therefore did not fit the statutory definition necessary to be covered under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act.[41] The appeal was dismissed on March 13, 2012 and the company was ordered to reimburse the Badgett's for court costs related to their defense in the appeal case.[42]
AdvoCare ceased offering KickStart Spark, targeted to youth age 4-11, after pediatricians had expressed concerns about the product containing 60 mg of caffeine.[43] AdvoCare was also the subject of criticism for its marketing at youth athletic events. In 2005, the company paid $5,000 to sponsor a high school wrestling tournament in Sacramento but after negative publicity, AdvoCare officials said they would not sponsor any more school events.[43]
Wendy Miller of the Beaumont Weight Control Center said AdvoCare's Herbal Cleanse is probably safe for many users, but she suggested that the same results could be achieved without the products.[44]
In March 2016, Advocare was the subject of a critical exposée in ESPN The Magazine. The exposée argues that the company and a small number of distributors at the top of a distribution network makes most of its money from the signing-up of new distributors rather than sales of the product, while exaggerating the likelihood of financial success of distributors when only a few make a significant amount of money; that the company creates a cult-like atmosphere of not questioning the company's claims or the probability of financial success in new distributors, to the point where distributors will shun friends and family members who do so; and that the company is internally riven by divisions over the company's strong use of religious affiliation as part of its business model, with more devout members of the organization using it to gain and hold power in the organization and over its members.[9]

Company History Revised Version 

If you would like to see the original version of our company history statement just click here!

Charles E. Blumer Company, Inc. was founded on October 28, 1994.
Chuck Blumer once had a vision to start a Food Brokerage Company specializing in Dairy, Deli, Meats and Provisions. As part of his vision came a commitment not to stray from the core business at which his company would become specialists. This has not changed.
There are many food brokers in this market and in markets across the country who claim to specialize in these areas but if you take a close look, most of them have bakery lines, or grocery lines, or frozen food lines. Some of them even have product lines which are non-foods. Worse yet, there are even some food brokers who service their refrigerated principles with just a "perishables division".
At Charles Blumer Company, perishables are what we are all about. We do not handle any products which do not fall in to the Dairy, Deli, Meat & Provisions format. This is not what we are all about. This is not where our interests lie. This is not an area we have expertise in. We are the fresh & processed meat and cheese folks.
It is our goal as a company to become the standard by which our customers and packers alike judge every other sales and marketing effort they come in contact with. We will constantly strive to meet and exceed all expectations regarding customer service, follow up and professionalism.
Boasting of principles such as Cargill Meat Solutions and Cook's Ham Company (a division of Smithfield foods), one can easily see that we will represent only the very finest products in each category. Spring Lake American Cheese and Prima Imported Ham products are other classic examples of this philosophy.
Because we specialize, Charles E. Blumer Company has the luxury of being able to choose the very best packers to represent. Each packer knows that he is being represented by a company who understands his business inside and out. We feel we are privileged to sell only the very finest products in a category. This works out well for all parties involved.  
The real winner is our valued customer base. A customer can call this office and talk to a live person from 7:00 a.m. through 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday. Even though our office hours are from 8:30 to 5:00, there is always someone here a little early or a little late to personally handle a question comment or an order. Our staff is highly trained and boasts of years of experience in the meat business. Several members of our company have been food industry professionals for well over thirty years.
Any one who answers the phone in our office is qualified to take and process an order or obtain information requested by packers and customers alike. Our commitment to quality products and services extends to everything we do.
If, in the unlikely event a customer has a problem with one of our products, we 
guarantee that the problem will be taken care of, in person, within twenty-four 
hours of our office being contacted. In other words, by simply dialing our toll 
free number, the problem goes away; I guarantee it.
By sticking to our core business, the business we know best, we have grown and prospered over the past decade plus in to a brokerage company most respected for quality products, quality people, professionalism, expertise and work ethic.

Allow us the opportunity to become the service specialists for you!

Charles E. Cook, Jr.



							Editor and Publisher of The Cook Political Report, Columnist for the National Journal


							Charlie Cook is Editor and Publisher of the Cook Political Report and a political analyst for National Journal magazine, where he writes a twice weekly column. Charlie is considered one of the nation’s leading authorities on American politics and U.S. elections. In 2010, Charlie was a co-recipient of the American Political Science Association's prestigious Carey McWilliams award to honor "a major journalistic contribution to our understanding of politics." In the spring semester of 2013, Charlie served as a Resident Fellow at the Institute of Politics at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.
						

							Charlie founded the Cook Political Report in 1984 and became a columnist for Roll Call, the newspaper of Capitol Hill, in 1986. In 1998 he moved his column to National Journal. Charlie has served as a political analyst or election night analyst for CBS, CNN and NBC News and has been a frequent political analyst for all three major broadcast news networks and has appeared on Meet the Press and This Week.
						

“There are political junkies, and then there's Charlie Cook — the man who knows more about everything political than anyone else.” -The Washingtonian


The New York Times has called Charlie “one of the best political handicappers in the nation" and has said the Cook Political Report is "a newsletter which both parties regard as authoritative." The late David Broder wrote in the Washington Post that Charlie was "perhaps the best non-partisan tracker of Congressional races," while CBS News' Bob Schieffer called the Cook Political Report, "the bible of the political community."
						

Book Charlie for a speech


							"In Washington, where almost everyone has an opinion on every subject, it can be difficult to recognize true expertise. With Charlie Cook, it would be hard not to recognize. He is widely regarded as one of the most astute impartial analysts of the Washington political scene and is one of the nation's leading authorities on U.S. elections...."
						

							Charlie Cook participates in a number of speaking engagements nationwide and is exclusively represented by Leading Authorities Speakers Bureau.
