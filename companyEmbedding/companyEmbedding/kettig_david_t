IHC’s Chief Operating Officer David Kettig said that The IHC Group’s 2015 focus is short term insurance



A recent A.M. BestTV broadcast featured IHC’s Chief Operating Officer David Kettig discussing the company’s 2015 vision of focusing on new forms of coverage and medical plans, specifically short-term health insurance.
“I think it’s a product that really brings tremendous value,” said Kettig of STM, which The IHC Group promotes and sells through Health eDeals.com, a marketing site operated through IHC Specialty Benefits, a subsidiary of The IHC Group.  
Health eDeals offers affordable, comprehensive high-deductible major medical health insurance plans through several carriers. Going forward, its main product will be short term health insurance, as well as Metal Gap, a supplemental health insurance product, and dental insurance.
Kettig said short term health insurance1 is affordable and a practical choice for consumers who are between Obamacare enrollment periods. “Not everyone qualifies for it, but most do,” he said. “I see it as a real gap-filler in Obamacare, so that people have coverage for short periods of time when they might not otherwise have it.” 
According to Kettig, The IHC Group has been selling short term medical insurance for about 10 years. “We’re really one of the leaders in it,” he explained. “We know how to do it. We’ve really sort of mastered it.” 

About The IHC Group The IHC Group is an organization of insurance carriers and marketing and administrative affiliates that has been providing life, health, disability, medical stop-loss and specialty insurance solutions to groups and individuals for over 30 years. Members of The IHC Group include Independence Holding Company (NYSE:IHC), American Independence Corp.

Each insurance carrier in The IHC Group has a financial strength rating of A- (Excellent) from A.M. Best Company, Inc., a widely recognized rating agency that rates insurance companies on their relative financial strength and ability to meet policyholder obligations. (An A++ rating from A.M. Best is its highest rating.) Collectively, the companies in The IHC Group provide insurance coverage to more than one million individuals and groups.
