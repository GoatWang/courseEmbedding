Huntington Bancshares to Strengthen Midwest Franchise With Financially and Strategically Accretive Merger With FirstMerit Corporation

January 26, 2016: 12:09 AM ET






         Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (NASDAQ: HBAN) (www.huntington.com) and FirstMerit Corporation (NASDAQ: FMER) (www.firstmerit.com) jointly announced today the signing of a definitive merger agreement under which Ohio-based FirstMerit Corporation, the parent company of FirstMerit Bank, will merge into Huntington in a stock and cash transaction. Based on the closing price of Huntington's common shares on January 25, 2016 of $8.80, the total transaction value is approximately $3.4 billion, including outstanding options and other equity-linked securities.
The partnership brings together two companies who have served their respective communities for 150 years or more, meeting the banking needs of consumers and small and middle market businesses across the Midwest. Huntington recently posted record earnings for 2015, including a 10% increase in net income and a 13% increase in earnings per common share, driven by ongoing growth in revenues, deposits, and lending. FirstMerit today announced their 67th consecutive quarter of profitability, reflecting strong organic loan growth and continued balance sheet strength. The pro forma company is expected to have nearly $100 billion in assets and will operate across an eight-state Midwestern footprint. The combination will create the largest bank in Ohio, based on deposit market share. Huntington will also expand its operations into the attractive new markets of Chicago and Wisconsin.
"We are very pleased to come together with FirstMerit to create a regional bank with added customer convenience, an enhanced portfolio of products for consumers and businesses, as well as strong market share. I believe the strength of this deal is that both organizations already understand the needs and goals of our Midwestern customers and communities. Our combined track records of service excellence and efficient financial management will add value for our collective shareholders, customers, communities, and colleagues," said Steve Steinour, Huntington chairman, president, and CEO.
"Joining forces with Huntington will give us an opportunity to combine both companies' commercial, small business, wealth, and consumer expertise while giving all of our customers greater access to services. We will also leverage our strong credit culture and continue our mutual tradition of community involvement to help our Midwest markets grow. We have every confidence that the integration with Huntington will be smooth and seamless for our customers and our communities, and are pleased with the commitments that Huntington has made to our employees and communities," said Paul Greig, FirstMerit chairman, president, and CEO. 
Under the terms of the definitive agreement, FirstMerit will merge with a subsidiary of Huntington Bancshares, and FirstMerit Bank will merge with and into The Huntington National Bank. In conjunction with the closing of the transaction, four independent members of the FirstMerit Board of Directors will join the Huntington Board, which will be expanded accordingly.
Shareholders of FirstMerit Corporation will receive 1.72 shares of Huntington common stock, and $5.00 in cash, for each share of FirstMerit Corporation common stock. The per share consideration is valued at $20.14 per share based on the closing price of Huntington common stock on January 25, 2016.
The transaction is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2016, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the approval of the shareholders of Huntington and FirstMerit Corporation. 
Huntington expects the acquisition to be accretive to earnings per share in 2017, excluding one-time merger-related expenses, and approximately 10% accretive to earnings per share in 2018, the first full year after all expected synergies are implemented. 
Pro forma tangible capital equity to tangible assets (TCE ratio) is projected to be 7.1% at closing, and pro forma regulatory common equity Tier 1 ratio (CET1 ratio) is projected to be 8.7% at closing on a fully phased-in Basel III basis. Huntington will not re-submit its 2015 CCAR capital plan, and intends to forgo the remaining $166 million of share repurchase capacity under its 2015 CCAR capital plan. Huntington will include FirstMerit Corporation in its 2016 CCAR capital plan proposal and expects the plan will include share repurchases.
Goldman, Sachs & Co. served as financial advisor, and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen, & Katz served as legal advisor to Huntington. Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P. served as financial advisor, and Sullivan & Cromwell LLP served as legal advisor to FirstMerit and Jones Day served as legal advisor to FirstMerit's Board of Directors.

        Conference Call / Webcast Information
      
Huntington's senior management will host a conference call on January 26, 2016, at 9:00 a.m. (Eastern Standard Time) to discuss the strategic and financial implications of the transaction. The call may be accessed via a live Internet webcast at the Investor Relations section of Huntington's website, www.huntington.com, or through a dial-in telephone number at (844) 318-8148; Conference ID# 38543166. Slides will be available in the Investor Relations section of Huntington's website about an hour prior to the call.

Huntington Bank pledges $16.1 billion for community development in Midwest
Partners with National Community Reinvestment Coalition to help underserved

KEYWORDS community banking Community development community lending community reinvestment Huntington Huntington Bancshares National Community Reinvestment Coalition NCRC



Huntington Bancshares is partnering with the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, and more than 100 of the NCRC’s local community organizations, to launch a five-year plan that will see Huntington invest more than $16 billion for community development throughout the Midwest.

	The program, announced jointly by the NCRC and Huntington, is part of Huntington’s previously announced merger with FirstMerit Corporation, which will see Huntington expand its network of operations Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Indiana, West Virginia and Kentucky to include FirstMerit’s operations in Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois and Pennsylvania.

	The merger is expected to be completed in third quarter of 2016, with the community development plan set to begin in 2017.

	According to the announcements from Huntington and the NCRC, Huntington’s community development plan will see the bank increase its mortgage and small business lending in low- and moderate-income communities, as well as community development lending and investments, along with a philanthropy program, and other services to increase access to financial services in low- and moderate-income communities and communities of color.

	As part of its community development plan, Huntington is committing to:


		Funding $5.7 billion in single-family mortgage lending in low- to moderate-income areas



		Funding $6.6 billion in small business lending including within low- to moderate-income areas



		Funding $3.7 billion in community development lending and investment targeting affordable housing access and community-based loan funds



		Funding $25 million of additional grants and philanthropy primarily targeting housing and small business credit service access



		Creating $30 million in further economic impact through support including 10 new branch locations within low- to moderate-income areas and/or majority minority areas; the addition of dedicated community mortgage loan officers; and the formation of a dedicated mortgage processing team to handle unique underwriting opportunities


	"With the merger of FirstMerit into Huntington, we think it is important to share our intentions in continuing to provide exceptional support and service to the communities where we live and work," said Stephen Steinour, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Huntington.

	"The strength and vitality of these communities and the people we serve are integral to our shared future,” Steinour added. “Huntington has a 150-year track record of investing in our communities and we will continue to do so as we expand."

	According to information provided by Huntington, the metro areas that will be targeted by its community development plan include: Akron, Ohio; Chicago, Illinois; Cincinnati, Ohio; Cleveland, Ohio; Columbus, Ohio; Dayton, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan; Flint, Michigan; Lansing, Michigan; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Toledo, Ohio.

	“We commend Huntington for working with local community advocates to reach an agreement that will help many people in working class communities and communities of color build wealth,” said NCRC President and CEO John Taylor.

	“This plan lays out activities that will produce the kind of significant public benefit that needs to be created when banking institutions merge,” Taylor continued. “Commitments like this are only possible with strong leadership from the highest levels of institutions, and we applaud Huntington Chairman, President and CEO Stephen Steinour for his leadership in this process.”

	Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-OH, also celebrated Huntington’s plan, especially considering that once the FirstMerit merger is complete, Huntington will be the largest bank in Ohio.

	"I applaud Huntington for going the extra mile in working with community organizations throughout Ohio and in the neighboring states it serves," Brown said. "Huntington has a proven track record of investing to address critical needs in the communities where it does business."

Fannie Mae: from legacy to startup


        You'd be forgiven for thinking that a quasi-federal agency founded in the 1930s is the last place you’d describe using words like innovative or agile. But you’d be wrong. Defying all stereotypes, Fannie Mae’s recent actions read a lot more like a startup than a $2.8 billion company with more than 7,000 employees. In the last two years, the company has implemented a user experience strategy, adopted design thinking and accelerated time to market for an innovative array of products.

Prime status: an update on luxury residential real estate


Deborah Huso


Real Estate


        In the years leading up to the housing bubble of 2007, it seemed like everyone was getting a piece of the American Dream of homeownership (or maybe even second homeownership). Ten years after the Great Recession, how is luxury residential real estate faring? Was the recent market slowdown just a temporary blip on the radar and will the sector continue to draw the aspirational interest of buyers as it did in the early to mid-2000s?

Convert leads like a top producer



Casey Cunningham


Lending


        Most mortgage professionals know that the client feels a sense of loyalty to the first person they speak with. When they establish themselves as the first contact, loan officers gain a critical sales advantage. In fact, speed-to-call is the single largest driver of conversion for new customer leads. 
Studies show that returning a call from a new customer within the first 30 minutes produces an average of a 62% increase in conversion rates.

We are excited to host the next edition of the conference in Chicago and bring new and exclusive content to the table including:
Family Offices Unplugged: An uncensored discussion with family office decision makers. Must attend session for investors and operators alike.
Closed Door Manager Meetings: This is the venue for funds and operators to sit down with investors and explain their projects and funds, open only to a limited number of product providers.
Lessons From Multi-Generation Family Offices: Lessons from multi-generational family offices on how to keep things going past the founding generation.
Power in Numbers: Joining Club Deals: Reasons why to and how to find other like-minded family offices to enter in club deals.

We are committed to making this event the premiere Family Office event in the Midwest and look forward working with the community of investors and investment providers to create an experience that combines networking, education and a good measure of fun!

Email tracking: So that we can better understand our users' needs, we track responses to our emails - for example, to see which links are the 
                most popular in newsletters, and to log and follow up responses to our marketing messages. To do this, we use pixel GIFs, also known as "pixel tags" - these are 
                small image files that are placed within the body of our email messages. They enable us to tell if a message has been opened and to track click-throughs on links 
                within the message. Any other purposes for which Euromoney wishes to use your personal data will be notified to you and your personal data will not be used 
                for any such purpose without obtaining your prior consent.

                purposes listed above. Your personal data may also be sold to other companies in the form of lists and directories, but only after permission from 
                you in accordance with the provisions above. We may also disclose your personal data to other third parties, including, without limitation, professional 
                advisers, or governmental or State institutions or regulatory authorities, where necessary in order to exercise or defend legal rights or where required by law.

                Any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should always be careful when deciding to disclose your personal information.
            

Transfers outside the EEA


                Services on the Internet are accessible globally so collection and transmission of personal data is not always limited to one country.

                third parties which may be located in countries outside the European Economic Area, whose laws may not give the level of protection to personal data as within the UK. 
                This will include transfers to Institutional Investor Inc. in the US (and Institutional Investor Inc. will collect some data directly from you, in relation to the 
                Sites which it operates) and to third parties who provide us with email and marketing services. Where we conduct any transfers we will take all steps reasonably 
                necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Statement.

                security features described above to try to prevent unauthorised access. We have implemented information security policies, rules and technical measures to 
                protect the personal data that we have under our control from:

unauthorised access
improper use or disclosure
unauthorised modification
unlawful destruction or accidental loss

All our employees, contractors and data processors (i.e. those who process your personal data on our behalf, for the purposes listed above), who have access to, and 
                are associated with the processing of your personal data, are obliged to keep the information confidential and not use it for any other purpose than to carry out 
                the services they are performing for us. We also give you the option of using a secure transmission method to send us personal data identifiers, such as 
                credit card details and bank account number. How to Access, Update and Erase your Personal Information


                If you wish to know whether we are keeping personal data about you, or if you have an enquiry about our privacy policy or your personal data held by us, in

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
