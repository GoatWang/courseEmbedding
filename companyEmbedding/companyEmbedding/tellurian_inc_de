Technical Notes






























Tellurian Technologies, Inc. has been an innovator in the Frequency Control industry for over 22 years.  We have built our reputation on supplying frequency based products dock-to-stock, on time or just-in-time from our ISO9001 certified factories.




















Quartz Crystals
Crystals are used to provide a very stable frequency reference in oscillators or as a resonator in a very narrow bandwidth filter.OSCILLATORS






A crystal controlled oscillator or clock oscillator is an oscillator which produces a stable square-wave output used to time or âclockâ digital logic. vCXO





A VCXO (voltage controlled crystal oscillator) is similar to a clock oscillator except that the frequency of a VCXO may be varied by changing a control voltage on Pin 1

TCXO & VCTCXO

TCXO (temperature compensated crystal oscillator) is a crystal controlled oscillator which has additional circuitry to compensate for the normal frequency/ temperature characteristic of a crystal. This compensation minimizes frequency variation due to temperature.

OCXOThis type of oscillator achieves the highest frequency stability possible with a crystal. They are typically used to control the frequency of radio transmitters, cellular base stations, military communications equipment, and for precision frequency measurement.

VCOThis is a non-crystal based oscillator which provides much higher frequencies up to the GHz range whose output frequency can be changed by applying a voltage to its control port or tuning port.

SAW FILTERS & RESONATORSA filter depending on the propagation of surface acoustic waves through a resonant structure mounted on a piezoelectric material. Advantages include highly predictable and stable performance and very sharp cut-off characteristics; insertion loss is higher than for conventional filters, but amplification can compensate for this.CRYSTAL FILTERSA highly selective form of quartz crystal used in electronics systems and in intermediate-frequency amplifiers of communication receivers to improve the selectivity.

	Driftwood terminal vs. traditional
	LNG plant – design DWLNG layout: 5.2 mtpa Traditional layout: 4.5 mtpa GE LM6000 PF+ (x4): cheapest dollar per installed horsepower = more LNG production per acre Gas pre-treatment facility Chart cold boxes (x4): IPSMR technology uses single
	mixed refrigerant; design scaled up from mid-scale design, rather than down from top Cold boxes (x3): 3 cold boxes, one for each refrigerant gas loop GE LM2500 (x6): smaller turbine means one needs 6 turbines and 3 circuits to produce 4.5 mtpa Gas
	pre-treatment Single refrigerant loop (x4): requires less land, less pipe Redundancy built-in: if 1 compressor is out of service, only that circuit is affected Larger footprint: 3 cold boxes need more land, more pipe Redundancy necessary: if 1

	EXPLANATORY NOTE



	Tellurian Inc. (we, us, Tellurian or the Company), a Delaware corporation formerly known as
	Magellan Petroleum Corporation (Magellan), is filing this Amendment No. 1 on Form

	8-K/A

	(this Amended Filing) to amend its Current Report on Form

	8-K

	filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on February 10, 2017 (the Original Filing), to file the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended
	December 31, 2016 (the Audited Financial Statements) of Tellurian Investments Inc. (Tellurian Investments) which was acquired by Magellan on February 10, 2017, and to file the business and properties and pro forma
	information of Tellurian described below.


	As discussed more fully in our Original Filing, on February 10, 2017, Tellurian completed
	the merger (the Merger) contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 2, 2016, as amended (the Merger Agreement), by and among Magellan, Tellurian Investments, and River Merger Sub, Inc., a direct,
	wholly owned subsidiary of Magellan (Merger Sub).


	Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each outstanding share of common stock,
	par value $0.001 per share, of Tellurian Investments was canceled and converted into the right to receive 1.300 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company, and Merger Sub merged with and into Tellurian Investments, with
	Tellurian Investments continuing as the surviving corporation and a subsidiary of the Company. The Merger will be accounted for as a reverse acquisition in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
	America (U.S. GAAP). Under U.S. GAAP, Tellurian Investments will be treated as the accounting acquirer in the Merger.


	The
	Audited Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016, and pro forma financial information relating to the Merger as of that date, is included in this report. Except for the Audited Financial Statements and pro forma
	financial information, this Amended Filing does not amend or restate the Original Filing, nor does it modify or update those disclosures affected by subsequent events or discoveries, except that, as set forth in Item 8.01 below, certain supplemental
	information regarding the Company is included in Exhibit 99.1 hereto and is incorporated by reference herein.

	SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES RELATING TO TELLURIAN INC.




	ABOUT TELLURIAN INC.



	Tellurian Inc., a Delaware corporation (we, us, our, Tellurian or the
	Company), intends to create value for shareholders by developing

	low-cost

	natural

	gas-related

	infrastructure, profitably delivering natural gas to customers
	worldwide and pursuing value enhancing, complementary business lines in the energy industry. Tellurian owns all of the common stock of Tellurian Investments Inc., a Delaware corporation (Tellurian Investments), which indirectly owns a
	100% ownership interest in each of Driftwood LNG LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (Driftwood LNG), and Driftwood Pipeline LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (Driftwood Pipeline), and directly owns a 100%
	membership interest in Tellurian Services LLC (f/k/a Parallax Services LLC), a Delaware limited liability company (Tellurian Services).


	Tellurian plans to own, develop and operate natural gas liquefaction facilities, storage facilities and loading terminals
	(collectively, the LNG Facilities) and is developing a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal facility (the Driftwood terminal) and an associated pipeline (the Driftwood pipeline) in Southwest Louisiana
	(the Driftwood terminal and the Driftwood pipeline collectively, the Driftwood Project). The proposed Driftwood terminal will have a liquefaction capacity of approximately 26 million tonnes per annum, situated on approximately 1,000
	acres in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana. The proposed terminal facility will include up to twenty liquefaction trains, three full containment LNG storage tanks and three marine berths. In February 2016, Tellurian engaged Bechtel Oil, Gas and Chemicals,
	Inc. (Bechtel) to complete a

	Front-End

	Engineering and Design (FEED) study for the Driftwood terminal. Based on the progress of such FEED study to date, Tellurian estimates construction
	costs for the Driftwood terminal of approximately $500 to $600 per tonne ($13 to $16 billion) before owners costs, financing costs and contingencies.


	Tellurian is developing the proposed Driftwood pipeline, a new

	96-mile

	large diameter
	pipeline which will interconnect with 14 existing interstate pipelines throughout Southwest Louisiana to secure adequate natural gas feedstock for the Driftwood terminal. The Driftwood pipeline will be comprised of

	48-inch,


	42-inch

	and

	36-inch

	diameter pipeline segments, and three compressor stations totaling approximately 270,000 horsepower,
	all as necessary to provide approximately 4.0 Bcf/d of average daily gas transportation service. In June 2016, Tellurian engaged Bechtel to complete a FEED study for the Driftwood pipeline. Based on the progress of such FEED study to date, Tellurian
	estimates construction costs for the Driftwood pipeline of approximately $1.6 to $2.0 billion before owners costs, financing costs and contingencies.


	Also in June 2016, Driftwood LNG and Driftwood Pipeline commenced the

	pre-filing

	process with the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Driftwood LNG intends to file, by the end of the first quarter of 2017, an application with FERC for authorization pursuant to Section 3 of the Natural Gas Act
	(NGA) to site, construct and operate the LNG Facilities and Driftwood Pipeline simultaneously will seek authorization pursuant to Section 7 of the NGA for authorization to construct and operate interstate natural gas pipeline
	facilities. Each will request that FERC issue an order approving the facilities by the first quarter of 2018. Construction of the LNG and pipeline facilities would begin after FERC issues an order granting the necessary authorizations under the NGA
	and once all required federal, state and local permits have been obtained. The Company expects to receive all regulatory approvals and commence construction in 2018, produce first LNG in 2022 and achieve full operations in 2025.


	 


	1






	In September 2016, Driftwood LNG filed an application with the U.S. Department of
	Energy, Office of Fossil Energy (the DOE/FE) seeking long-term, multi-contract authorization under Section 3 of the NGA to export, on its own behalf and as agent for others, up to 26 million tonnes per year of LNG. The
	application requested export authorization to countries with which the United States has a free trade agreement providing for national treatment for trade in natural gas (FTA countries) for a

	30-year

	term and to countries with which the United States does not have a free trade agreement providing for national treatment for trade in natural gas and with which trade is permitted

	(non-FTA

	countries) for a

	20-year

	term. In February 2017, Driftwood LNG filed a Statement and Notice of Change in Control with the DOE/FE informing it of the
	merger transaction between the Company, then known as Magellan Petroleum Corporation, and Tellurian Investments. The merger closed on February 10, 2017. On February 28, 2017, the DOE/FE issued an order authorizing Driftwood LNG to export up to
	26 million tonnes per year of LNG to FTA countries, on its own behalf and as agent for others, for a term of 30 years. The authorization to export LNG to

	non-FTA

	countries is currently pending before the
	DOE/FE and is expected to be issued in the first quarter of 2018.


	The Company was founded in 1957 and incorporated in
	Delaware in 1967 as Magellan Petroleum Corporation. We changed our corporate name to Tellurian Inc. shortly after completing the merger transaction with Tellurian Investments. Our common stock has been trading on the NASDAQ Stock Market since 1972.
	It currently trades under the ticker symbol TELL and as of March 13, 2017, the Company had 199,706,159 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.


	Our principal executive offices are located at 1201 Louisiana Street, Suite 3100, Houston, Texas 77002, and our telephone
	number is

	(832) 962-4000. We

	maintain a website at http://www.tellurianinc.com. The information contained in, or that can be accessed through, our website is not part of this report.

	The information in this report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the
	Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, that address activities, events, or developments with respect to our financial

	ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE



	Tellurians current, abbreviated corporate structure is as follows:


	 


Click to enlarge



	CAPITAL RESOURCES AND STRUCTURE



	Our current capital resources consist of proceeds from issuances of common and preferred stock, including, as described below,
	an issuance of preferred stock to GE Oil & Gas, Inc. (GE), a Delaware corporation and subsidiary of General Electric Company, and an issuance of common stock to TOTAL Delaware, Inc. (TOTAL), a Delaware corporation
	and subsidiary of TOTAL S.A. On a consolidated basis, Tellurian had approximately $189,545,121 of cash and cash equivalents as of March 10, 2017. Tellurian considers cash equivalents to be short term, highly liquid investments that are both
	readily convertible to known amounts of cash and so near to their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. We believe that we will have sufficient capital resources to fund our business
	for at least the next 12 months.


	Tellurian Investments issued approximately 5.5 million shares of Tellurian
	Investments preferred stock to GE in November 2016 for an aggregate purchase price of $25 million. Those shares, which currently represent 4.76% of the outstanding equity securities of Tellurian Investments, are convertible at any time into
	either shares of a substantially similar class of Tellurian Inc. preferred stock or shares of Tellurian Inc. common stock, in each case on a


	one-for-one


	basis, subject
	to adjustments in certain circumstances. In connection with the preferred stock issuance to GE, we agreed to enter into a registration rights agreement with respect to the Tellurian Inc. common stock to be issued upon the conversion or exchange of
	the preferred stock.


	 


	5






	Tellurian Investments issued approximately 35.4 million shares of its common
	stock to TOTAL in January 2017 for an aggregate purchase price of $207 million. In connection with that investment, we agreed that we would enter into (i) a

	pre-emptive

	rights agreement pursuant to
	which TOTAL will be granted a right to purchase its pro rata portion of any new equity securities that Tellurian may issue to a third party on the same terms and conditions as such equity securities are offered and sold to such party, subject to
	certain excepted offerings and (ii) a registration rights agreement with respect to the common stock purchased by TOTAL.


	As of the date of this report, neither Tellurian nor any of its subsidiaries have entered into definitive registration rights
	agreements with either GE or TOTAL and Tellurian has not entered into a definitive

	pre-emptive

	rights agreement with TOTAL.

	Risks Relating to our Financial Matters





	Tellurian does not expect to generate sufficient cash to pay dividends until the completion of construction of the Driftwood Project.




	Tellurians directly and indirectly held assets consist primarily of cash held for

	certain start-up and

	operating expenses, applications for permits from regulatory agencies relating to the Driftwood Project and certain real property interests related to that project. Tellurians
	cash flow and consequently its ability to distribute earnings is solely dependent upon the cash flow its subsidiaries receive from the Driftwood Project and the transfer of funds in the form of distributions or otherwise. Tellurians ability to
	complete the Driftwood Project, as discussed further below, is dependent upon its subsidiaries ability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals and raise the capital necessary to fund the development of the project.


	Tellurians ability to pay dividends in the future is uncertain and will depend on a variety of factors, including
	limitations on the ability of it or its subsidiaries to pay dividends under applicable law and/or the terms of debt or other agreements, and the judgment of the board of directors or other governing body of the relevant entity. Tellurian is
	currently prohibited from paying dividends under the terms of the Tellurian Investments preferred stock.




	Tellurian will be required
	to seek additional debt and equity financing in the future to complete the Driftwood Project, and may not be able to secure such financing on acceptable terms, or at all.




	Because Tellurian will be unable to generate any revenue from its operations and expects to be in the development stage for
	multiple years, Tellurian will need additional financing to provide the capital required to execute its business plan. Tellurian will need significant funding to develop the Driftwood Project as well as for working capital requirements and other
	operating and general corporate purposes. See Capital Resources and Structure above.


	There can be no
	assurance that Tellurian will be able to raise sufficient capital on acceptable terms, or at all. If such financing is not available on satisfactory terms, or is not available at all, Tellurian may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate the
	development of business opportunities, and its operations and financial condition may be adversely affected to a significant extent.


	 


	7






	Debt financing, if obtained, may involve agreements that include liens on
	Tellurians assets and covenants limiting or restricting the ability to take specific actions, such as paying dividends or making distributions, incurring additional debt, acquiring or disposing of assets and increasing expenses. Debt financing
	would also be required to be repaid regardless of Tellurians operating results.


	In addition, the ability to obtain
	financing for the proposed Driftwood Project is expected to be contingent upon, among other things, Tellurians ability to enter into sufficient long-term commercial agreements prior to the commencement of construction. To date, Tellurian has
	not entered into any definitive third-party agreements for the proposed Driftwood Project, and it may not be successful in negotiating and entering into such agreements.




	Driftwood LNG, Driftwood Pipeline and Tellurian Investments have a limited operating history.




	Each of Driftwood LNG, Driftwood Pipeline and Tellurian Investments was formed in 2016, and only recently commenced
	development. Although Tellurians current directors, managers and officers have prior professional and industry experience, Driftwood LNG, Driftwood Pipeline and Tellurian Investments have a limited prior operating history, track record and
	historical financial information upon which you may evaluate prospects.


	Tellurian has not yet commenced the construction
	of the Driftwood Project. Accordingly, Tellurian expects to incur significant additional costs and expenses through completion of development and construction of the Driftwood Project. Tellurian expects operating losses will increase substantially
	in the remainder of 2017 and thereafter, and expects to continue to incur operating losses and experience negative operating cash flow through at least 2022.




	Tellurians exposure to the performance and credit risks of counterparties under agreements may adversely affect our operating
	results, liquidity and access to financing.




	Our LNG and natural gas marketing business will involve our entering
	into various purchase and sale, hedging and other transactions with numerous third parties. In such arrangements, we will be exposed to the performance and credit risks of our counterparties, including the risk that one or more counterparties fails
	to perform its obligation to make deliveries of commodities and/or to make payments. These risks may increase during periods of commodity price volatility. Defaults by suppliers and other counterparties may adversely affect our operating results,
	liquidity and access to financing.




	Tellurians ability to generate cash is substantially dependent upon it entering into
	contracts with third party customers and the performance of those customers under those contracts.




	Tellurian has
	not yet entered into, and may never be able to enter into, satisfactory commercial arrangements with third-party customers for products and services at the Driftwood Project.


	Tellurians business strategy may change regarding how and when the proposed Driftwood Projects export capacity is
	marketed. Also, Tellurians business strategy may change due to an inability to enter into agreements with customers or based on views regarding future prices, supply and demand of LNG, natural gas liquefaction capacity, and worldwide
	regasification capacity. If the efforts to market the proposed Driftwood Project are not successful, Tellurians business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.

	Changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material
	impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.




	We are subject to income taxes as well as

	non-income

	based taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of
	these audits to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. However, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the actual outcomes could have a material impact on our net income or financial
	condition.


	Changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially impact our effective tax rate. For example, the Trump
	Administration has called for substantial change to fiscal and tax policies, inclusive of proposed changes to the U.S. federal tax treatment of foreign operations, the current tax depreciation system and the deductibility of interest expense in
	connection with comprehensive U.S. federal tax reform. If enacted, any change in law may affect our tax position, including the amount of taxes we are required to pay, and could have a significant impact on our future results of operations,
	profitability and financial condition, including the size of our expected net operating losses. However, until we know what changes are enacted, we will not know fully whether in total we benefit from, or are negatively affected by, the proposed
	changes.



	Risks Relating to Our Common Stock





	The price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile, which may make it difficult for shareholders to sell our
	common stock when desired or at attractive prices.




	The market price of our common stock is highly volatile, and we
	expect it to continue to be volatile for the foreseeable future. Adverse events could trigger a significant decline in the trading price of our common stock, including, among others, failure to obtain necessary permits, unfavorable changes in
	commodity prices or commodity price expectations, adverse regulatory developments, loss of a relationship with a partner, litigation and departures of key personnel. Furthermore, general market conditions, including the level of, and fluctuations
	in, the trading prices of equity securities generally could affect the price of our stock. Recently, the stock markets have experienced price and volume volatility that has affected many companies stock prices. Stock prices for many companies
	have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies. These fluctuations may affect the market price of our common stock.




	The market price of our common stock could be adversely affected by sales of substantial amounts of our common stock by us or our major
	shareholders.




	Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the market by us or any of our major
	shareholders, or the perception that these sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In addition, the sale of these shares in the public market, or the possibility of such sales, could impair our ability to raise
	capital through the sale of additional equity securities. Our insider trading policy does not prohibit our officers and directors, some of whom own substantial percentages of our outstanding common stock, from pledging shares of stock that they own
	as collateral for loans. In some circumstances, such pledges could result in large amounts of shares of our stock being sold in the market in a short period of time, which would be expected to have a significant adverse effect on the trading price
	of the common stock. In addition, in the future, we may issue shares of our common stock in connection with acquisitions of assets or businesses. If we use our shares for this purpose, the issuances could have a dilutive effect on the market value
	of shares of our common stock, depending on market conditions at the time of an acquisition, the price we pay, the value of the business or assets acquired, our success in exploiting the properties or integrating the businesses we acquire and other
	factors.

	Risks Relating to our LNG Business





	Various economic and political factors could negatively affect the development, construction and operation of LNG Facilities, including
	the Driftwood Project, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.




	Commercial development of an LNG facility takes a number of years, requires substantial capital investment and may be delayed
	by factors such as:


	 




	 


	


	 



	increased construction costs;





	 




	 


	


	 



	economic downturns, increases in interest rates or other events that may affect the availability of sufficient
	financing for LNG projects on commercially reasonable terms;





	 




	 


	


	 



	decreases in the price of LNG, which might decrease the expected returns relating to investments in LNG
	projects;





	 




	 


	


	 



	the inability of project owners or operators to obtain governmental approvals to construct or operate LNG
	Facilities; and





	 




	 


	


	 



	political unrest or local community resistance to the siting of LNG Facilities due to safety, environmental or
	security concerns.





	Our failure to execute our business plan in a timely manner could materially
	adversely effect our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.




	Tellurians estimated costs
	for the Driftwood Project may not be accurate and are subject to change due to various factors.




	Tellurian
	currently estimates that the construction costs for the Driftwood Project will be between approximately $13 and $16 billion. However, cost estimates are only an approximation of the actual costs of construction and are before owners
	costs, financing costs and contingencies. Moreover, cost estimates may change due to various factors, such as the final terms of any definitive request for services with its engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) service
	provider, as well as cost overruns, change orders, delays in construction, legal and regulatory requirements, site issues, increased component and material costs, escalation of labor costs, labor disputes, changes in commodity prices, increased
	spending to maintain Tellurians construction schedule and other factors.


	Our failure to achieve our cost estimates
	could materially adversely effect our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.




	If third-party
	pipelines and other facilities interconnected to our LNG Facilities become unavailable to transport natural gas, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.




	We will depend upon third-party pipelines and other facilities that will provide gas delivery options to our LNG Facilities. If
	the construction of new or modified pipeline connections is not completed on schedule or any pipeline connection were to become unavailable for current or future volumes of natural gas due to repairs, damage to the facility, lack of capacity or any
	other reason, our ability to meet our LNG sale and purchase agreement obligations and continue shipping natural gas from producing regions or to end markets could be restricted, thereby reducing our revenues. This could have a material adverse
	effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.


	 


	10








	We may not be able to purchase or receive physical delivery of sufficient natural gas to
	satisfy our delivery obligations under our LNG sale and purchase agreements, which could have an adverse effect on us.




	Under LNG sale and purchase agreements with our customers, we will be required to make available to them a specified amount of
	LNG at specified times. However, we may not be able to purchase or receive physical delivery of sufficient quantities of natural gas to satisfy those obligations, which may provide affected customers with the right to terminate their LNG sale and
	purchase agreements. Our failure to purchase or receive physical delivery of sufficient quantities of natural gas could have an adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.




	The construction and operation of the Driftwood Project remains subject to further approvals, and some approvals may be subject to
	further conditions, review and/or revocation.




	The design, construction and operation of LNG export terminals is a
	highly regulated activity. The approval of FERC under Section 3 of the Natural Gas Act, as well as several other material governmental and regulatory approvals and permits, is required in order to construct and operate an LNG terminal. Even if
	the necessary authorizations initially required to operate our proposed LNG Facilities are obtained, such authorizations are subject to ongoing conditions imposed by regulatory agencies, and additional approval and permit requirements may be
	imposed.


	Tellurian will be required to obtain governmental approvals and authorizations to implement its proposed
	business strategy, which includes the construction and operation of the Driftwood Project. In particular, authorization from FERC and the DOE/FE is required to construct and operate our proposed LNG Facilities. In addition to seeking approval for
	export to FTA countries, Tellurian will seek to obtain approval for export to

	non-FTA

	countries. There is no assurance that Tellurian will obtain and maintain these governmental permits, approvals and
	authorizations, and failure to obtain and maintain any of these permits, approvals or authorizations could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.




	Tellurian will be dependent on third-party contractors for the successful completion of the Driftwood Project, and these contractors may
	be unable to complete the Driftwood Project.




	There is limited recent industry experience in the United States
	regarding the construction or operation of large-scale liquefaction facilities. The construction of the Driftwood Project is expected to take several years, will be confined to a limited geographic area and could be subject to delays, cost overruns,
	labor disputes and other factors that could adversely affect financial performance or impair Tellurians ability to execute its scheduled business plan.


	Timely and cost-effective completion of the Driftwood Project in compliance with agreed-upon specifications will be highly
	dependent upon the performance of third-party contractors pursuant to their agreements. However, Tellurian has not yet entered into definitive agreements with certain of the contractors, advisors and consultants necessary for the development and
	construction of the Driftwood Project. Tellurian may not be able to successfully enter into such construction contracts on terms or at prices that are acceptable to it.


	 


	11






	Further, faulty construction that does not conform to Tellurians design and
	quality standards may have an adverse effect on Tellurians business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. For example, improper equipment installation may lead to a shortened life of Tellurians equipment, increased
	operations and maintenance costs or a reduced availability or production capacity of the affected facility. The ability of Tellurians third-party contractors to perform successfully under any agreements to be entered into is dependent on a
	number of factors, including force majeure events and such contractors ability to:


	 




	 


	


	 



	design, engineer and receive critical components and equipment necessary for the Driftwood Project to operate
	in accordance with specifications and address

	any start-up and

	operational issues that may arise in connection with the commencement of commercial operations;





	 




	 


	


	 



	attract, develop and retain skilled personnel and engage and retain third-party subcontractors, and address
	any labor issues that may arise;





	 




	 


	


	 



	post required construction bonds and comply with the terms thereof, and maintain their own financial
	condition, including adequate working capital;





	 




	 


	


	 



	adhere to any warranties the contractors provide in their EPC contracts; and





	 




	 


	


	 



	respond to difficulties such as equipment failure, delivery delays, schedule changes and failure to perform by
	subcontractors, some of which are beyond their control, and manage the construction process generally, including engaging and retaining third-party contractors, coordinating with other contractors and regulatory agencies and dealing with inclement
	weather conditions.





	Furthermore, Tellurian may have disagreements with its third-party contractors
	about different elements of the construction process, which could lead to the assertion of rights and remedies under the related contracts, resulting in a contractors unwillingness to perform further work on the relevant project. Tellurian may
	also face difficulties in commissioning a newly constructed facility. Any significant project delays in the development of the Driftwood Project could materially and adversely affect Tellurians business, results of operations, financial
	condition and prospects.




	Tellurians construction and operations activities are subject to a number of development risks,
	operational hazards, regulatory approvals and other risks, which could cause cost overruns and delays and could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects.




	Siting, development and construction of the Driftwood Project will be subject to the risks of delay or cost overruns inherent
	in any construction project resulting from numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the following:


	 




	 


	


	 



	difficulties or delays in obtaining, or failure to obtain, sufficient debt or equity financing on reasonable
	terms;





	 




	 


	


	 



	failure to obtain all necessary government and third-party permits, approvals and licenses for the
	construction and operation of any of our proposed LNG Facilities;





	 




	 


	


	 



	failure to obtain sale and purchase agreements that generate sufficient revenue to support the financing and
	construction of the Driftwood Project;





	 




	 


	


	 



	difficulties in engaging qualified contractors necessary to the construction of the contemplated Driftwood
	Project or other LNG Facilities;





	 


	12








	 


	


	 



	shortages of equipment, material or skilled labor;





	 




	 


	


	 



	natural disasters and catastrophes, such as hurricanes, explosions, fires, floods, industrial accidents and
	terrorism;





	 




	 


	


	 



	unscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials;





	 




	 


	


	 



	work stoppages and labor disputes;





	 




	 


	


	 



	competition with other domestic and international LNG export terminals;





	 




	 


	


	 



	unanticipated changes in domestic and international market demand for and supply of natural gas and LNG, which
	will depend in part on supplies of and prices for alternative energy sources and the discovery of new sources of natural resources;





	 




	 


	


	 



	unexpected or unanticipated need for additional improvements; and





	 




	 


	


	 



	adverse general economic conditions.





	Delays beyond the estimated development periods, as well as cost overruns, could increase the cost of completion beyond the
	amounts that are currently estimated, which could require Tellurian to obtain additional sources of financing to fund the activities until the proposed Driftwood Project is constructed and operational (which could cause further delays). Any delay in
	completion of the Driftwood Project may also cause a delay in the receipt of revenues projected from the Driftwood Project or cause a loss of one or more customers. As a result, any significant construction delay, whatever the cause, could have a
	material adverse effect on Tellurians business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects.




	Technological innovation
	may render Tellurians anticipated competitive advantage or its processes obsolete.




	Tellurians success
	will depend on its ability to create and maintain a competitive position in the natural gas liquefaction industry. In particular, although Tellurian plans to construct the Driftwood Project using proven technologies that it believes provide it with
	certain advantages, Tellurian does not have any exclusive rights to any of the technologies that it will be utilizing. In addition, the technology Tellurian anticipates using in the Driftwood Project may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by legal
	or regulatory requirements, technological advances, more efficient and cost-effective processes or entirely different approaches developed by one or more of its competitors or others, which could materially and adversely affect Tellurians
	business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects.




	Cyclical or other changes in the demand for and price of LNG and
	natural gas may adversely affect Tellurians LNG business and the performance of our customers and could lead to reduced development of LNG projects worldwide.




	Tellurians plans and expectations regarding its business and the development of domestic LNG Facilities and projects are
	generally based on assumptions about the future price of natural gas and LNG and the conditions of the global natural gas and LNG markets. Natural gas and LNG prices have been, and are likely to remain in the future, volatile and subject to wide
	fluctuations that are difficult to predict. Such fluctuations may be caused by factors including, but not limited to, one or more of the following:


	 




	 


	


	 



	competitive liquefaction capacity in North America;





	 


	13








	 


	


	 


	insufficient or oversupply of natural gas liquefaction or receiving capacity worldwide;




	 




	 


	


	 


	insufficient or oversupply of LNG tanker capacity;




	 




	 


	


	 


	weather conditions;




	 




	 


	


	 


	reduced demand and lower prices for natural gas;




	 




	 


	


	 


	increased natural gas production deliverable by pipelines, which could suppress demand for LNG;




	 




	 


	


	 


	decreased oil and natural gas exploration activities, which may decrease the production of natural gas;




	 




	 


	


	 


	cost improvements that allow competitors to offer LNG regasification services or provide natural gas liquefaction capabilities at reduced prices;




	 




	 


	


	 


	changes in supplies of, and prices for, alternative energy sources such as coal, oil, nuclear, hydroelectric, wind and solar energy, which may reduce the demand for natural gas;




	 




	 


	


	 


	changes in regulatory, tax or other governmental policies regarding imported or exported LNG, natural gas or alternative energy sources, which may reduce the demand for imported or exported LNG and/or natural gas;




	 




	 


	


	 


	political conditions in natural gas producing regions; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	cyclical trends in general business and economic conditions that cause changes in the demand for natural gas.




	Adverse trends or developments affecting any of these factors could result in decreases in the price of LNG and/or natural gas, which could
	materially and adversely affect the performance of our customers, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, liquidity and prospects.




	Failure of exported LNG to be a competitive source of energy for international markets could adversely affect our customers and could materially and
	adversely affect our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.




	Operations of the Driftwood Project will be dependent upon the ability of our LNG sale and purchase agreement customers to
	deliver LNG supplies from the United States, which is primarily dependent upon LNG being a competitive source of energy internationally. The success of our business plan is dependent, in part, on the extent to which LNG can, for significant periods
	and in significant volumes, be supplied from North America and delivered to international markets at a lower cost than the cost of alternative energy sources. Through the use of improved exploration technologies, additional sources of natural gas
	may be discovered outside the United States, which could increase the available supply of natural gas outside the United States and could result in natural gas in those markets being available at a lower cost than that of LNG exported to those
	markets.


	 


	14






	Additionally, our liquefaction projects will be subject to the risk of LNG price
	competition at times when we need to replace any existing LNG sale and purchase contract, whether due to natural expiration, default or otherwise, or enter into new LNG sale and purchase contracts. Factors relating to competition may prevent us from
	entering into a new or replacement LNG sale and purchase contract on economically comparable terms as prior LNG sale and purchase contracts, or at all. Factors which may negatively affect potential demand for LNG from our liquefaction projects are
	diverse and include, among others:


	 




	 


	


	 



	increases in worldwide LNG production capacity and availability of LNG for market supply;





	 




	 


	


	 



	increases in demand for LNG but at levels below those required to maintain current price equilibrium with
	respect to supply;





	 




	 


	


	 



	increases in the cost to supply natural gas feedstock to our liquefaction projects;





	 




	 


	


	 



	decreases in the cost of competing sources of natural gas or alternate sources of energy such as coal, heavy
	fuel oil, diesel, nuclear, hydroelectric, wind and solar energy;





	 




	 


	


	 



	decreases in the price of

	non-U.S.

	LNG, including decreases in price
	as a result of contracts indexed to lower oil prices;





	 




	 


	


	 



	increases in capacity and utilization of nuclear power and related facilities;





	 




	 


	


	 



	increases in the cost of LNG shipping; and





	 




	 


	


	 



	displacement of LNG by pipeline natural gas or alternate fuels in locations where access to these energy
	sources is not currently available.





	Political instability in foreign countries that import natural gas,
	or strained relations between such countries and the United States, may also impede the willingness or ability of LNG suppliers, purchasers and merchants in such countries to import LNG from the United States. Furthermore, some foreign purchasers of
	LNG may have economic or other reasons to obtain their LNG from

	non-U.S.

	markets or from our competitors liquefaction facilities in the United States.


	As a result of these and other factors, LNG may not be a competitive source of energy in the United States or internationally.
	The failure of LNG to be a competitive supply alternative to local natural gas, oil and other alternative energy sources in markets accessible to our customers could adversely affect the ability of our customers to deliver LNG from the United States
	on a commercial basis. Any significant impediment to the ability to deliver LNG from the United States generally, or from the Driftwood Project specifically, could have a material adverse effect on our customers and on our business, contracts,
	financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.




	Competition in the liquefied natural gas industry is
	intense, and some of Tellurians competitors have greater financial, technological and other resources.




	Tellurian plans to operate in the highly competitive area of liquefied natural gas production and faces intense competition
	from independent, technology-driven companies as well as from both major and other independent oil and natural gas companies and utilities.


	 


	15






	Many competing companies have secured access to, or are pursuing development or
	acquisition of, LNG Facilities to serve the North American natural gas market, including other proposed liquefaction facilities in North America. Tellurian may face competition from major energy companies and others in pursuing its proposed business
	strategy to provide liquefaction and export products and services at its proposed Driftwood Project. In addition, competitors have and are developing additional LNG terminals in other markets, which also compete with our proposed LNG Facilities.
	Almost all of these competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger staffs and substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources than Tellurian currently possesses. The superior resources that these
	competitors have available for deployment could allow them to compete successfully against Tellurian, which could have a material adverse effect on Tellurians business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects.




	There may be shortages of LNG vessels worldwide, which could have a material adverse effect on Tellurians business, results of
	operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects.




	The construction and delivery of LNG vessels requires
	significant capital and long construction lead times, and the availability of the vessels could be delayed to the detriment of Tellurians business and customers due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the following:


	 




	 


	


	 



	an inadequate number of shipyards constructing LNG vessels and a backlog of orders at these shipyards;





	 




	 


	


	 



	political or economic disturbances in the countries where the vessels are being constructed;





	 




	 


	


	 



	changes in governmental regulations or maritime self-regulatory organizations;





	 




	 


	


	 



	work stoppages or other labor disturbances at the shipyards;





	 




	 


	


	 



	bankruptcies or other financial crises of shipbuilders;





	 




	 


	


	 



	quality or engineering problems;





	 




	 


	


	 



	weather interference or catastrophic events, such as a major earthquake, tsunami, or fire; or





	 




	 


	


	 



	shortages of or delays in the receipt of necessary construction materials.





	Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on Tellurians business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity
	and prospects.




	A terrorist attack, including cyberterrorism, or military incident involving an LNG carrier could result in delays
	in, or cancellation of, construction or closure of our proposed LNG Facilities.




	A terrorist, including a
	cyberterrorist, incident or military incident involving an LNG carrier or LNG facility may result in delays in, or cancellation of, construction of new LNG Facilities, including our proposed LNG Facilities, which would increase Tellurians
	costs and decrease cash flows. A terrorist incident may also result in temporary or permanent closure of Tellurians proposed LNG Facilities, including the Driftwood Project, which could increase costs and decrease cash flows, depending on the
	duration of the closure. Operations at the proposed LNG Facilities, including the Driftwood Project, could also become subject to increased governmental scrutiny that may result in additional security measures at a significant incremental cost. In
	addition, the threat of terrorism and the impact of military campaigns may lead to continued volatility in prices for natural gas that could adversely affect Tellurians business and customers, including the ability of Tellurians
	suppliers or customers to satisfy their respective obligations under Tellurians commercial agreements.


	 


	16








	Changes in legislation and regulations relating to the LNG industry could have a material
	adverse impact on Tellurians business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects.




	Future legislation and regulations, such as those relating to the transportation and security of LNG exported from our proposed
	LNG Facilities through the Calcasieu Ship Channel, could cause additional expenditures, restrictions and delays in connection with the proposed LNG Facilities and their construction, the extent of which cannot be predicted and which may require
	Tellurian to limit substantially, delay or cease operations in some circumstances. Revised, reinterpreted or additional laws and regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating costs and restrictions could have a
	material adverse effect on Tellurians business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects.




	The
	operation of the proposed Driftwood Project may be subject to significant operating hazards and uninsured risks, one or more of which may create significant liabilities and losses that could have a material adverse effect on Tellurians
	business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects.




	The plan of operations for the
	proposed Driftwood Project is subject to the inherent risks associated with LNG operations, including explosions, pollution, release of toxic substances, fires, hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions, and other hazards, each of which could
	result in significant delays in commencement or interruptions of operations and/or result in damage to or destruction of the proposed Driftwood Project and assets or damage to persons and property. In addition, operations at the proposed Driftwood
	Project and vessels of third parties on which Tellurians operations are dependent face possible risks associated with acts of aggression or terrorism.


	In 2005 and 2008, hurricanes damaged coastal and inland areas located in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, resulting
	in disruption and damage to certain LNG terminals located in those regions. Future storms and related storm activity and collateral effects, or other disasters such as explosions, fires, floods or accidents, could result in damage to, or
	interruption of operations at, the Driftwood Project or related infrastructure, as well as delays or cost increases in the construction and the development of the Driftwood Project or other facilities. Changes in the global climate may have
	significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and rising sea levels; if any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our coastal operations.


	Tellurian does not, nor does it intend to, maintain insurance against all of these risks and losses. Tellurian may not be able
	to maintain desired or required insurance in the future at rates that it considers reasonable. The occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against could have a material adverse effect on Tellurians business,
	contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.




	We will rely on third-party engineers to
	estimate the future capacity ratings and performance capabilities of the Driftwood Project, and these estimates may prove to be inaccurate.




	We will rely on third parties for the design and engineering services underlying our estimates of the future capacity ratings
	and performance capabilities of the Driftwood Project. Any of our LNG Facilities, when actually constructed, may not have the capacity ratings and performance capabilities that we intend or estimate. Failure of any of our LNG Facilities to achieve
	our intended capacity ratings and performance capabilities could prevent us from achieving the commercial start dates under our future LNG sale and purchase agreements and could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial
	condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.


	 


	17







	Risks Relating to Our Business in General





	Tellurian will be subject to risks related to doing business in, and having counterparties based in, foreign countries.




	Tellurian may engage in operations or make substantial commitments and investments, or enter into agreements with
	counterparties, located outside the United States, which would expose Tellurian to political, governmental, and economic instability and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.


	Any disruption caused by these factors could harm Tellurians business, results of operations, financial condition,
	liquidity and prospects. Risks associated with operations, commitments and investments outside of the United States include but are not limited to risks of:


	 




	 


	


	 



	currency fluctuations;





	 




	 


	


	 



	war or terrorist attack;





	 




	 


	


	 



	expropriation or nationalization of assets;





	 




	 


	


	 



	renegotiation or nullification of existing contracts;





	 




	 


	


	 



	changing political conditions;





	 




	 


	


	 



	changing laws and policies affecting trade, taxation, and investment;





	 




	 


	


	 



	multiple taxation due to different tax structures;





	 




	 


	


	 



	general hazards associated with the assertion of sovereignty over areas in which operations are conducted; and





	 




	 


	


	 



	the unexpected credit rating downgrade of countries in which Tellurians LNG customers are based.





	Because Tellurians reporting currency is the United States dollar, any of the operations
	conducted outside the United States or denominated in foreign currencies would face additional risks of fluctuating currency values and exchange rates, hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange. In addition, Tellurian would be
	subject to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and exchange rate changes on its financial reports when translating its assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses from operations outside of the United States into U.S. dollars at
	then-applicable exchange rates. These translations could result in changes to the results of operations from period to period.


	 


	18








	Tellurian Investments is a defendant in a lawsuit that could result in equitable relief
	and/or monetary damages that could have a material adverse effect on Tellurians operating results and financial condition.




	Tellurian Investments and Tellurian Services, along with Tellurian director Martin Houston and an officer of Tellurian and
	certain entities in which each of them owned membership interests, as applicable, have been named as defendants in a recently initiated lawsuit. Although Tellurian Investments believes the plaintiffs claims are without merit, Tellurian
	Investments may not ultimately be successful and any potential liability Tellurian Investments may incur is not reasonably estimable. Moreover, even if Tellurian Investments is successful in the defense of this litigation, Tellurian Investments
	could incur costs and suffer both an economic loss and an adverse impact on its reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on its business. In addition, any adverse judgment or settlement of the litigation could have an adverse effect on
	our operating results and financial condition.




	Tellurian will be subject to a number of environmental laws and regulations that
	impose significant compliance costs, and existing and future environmental and similar laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs, liabilities or additional operating restrictions.




	Tellurian will be subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental regulations and laws, including regulations and
	restrictions related to discharges and releases to the air, land and water and the handling, storage, generation and disposal of hazardous materials and solid and hazardous wastes in connection with the development, construction and operation of its
	LNG Facilities. These regulations and laws, which include the Clean Air Act (CAA), the Oil Pollution Act, the Clean Water Act (CWA) and the


	Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), and analogous state
	and local laws and regulations will restrict, prohibit or otherwise regulate the types, quantities and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment in connection with the construction and operation of our facilities. These
	laws and regulations, including the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA), will require Tellurian to obtain and maintain permits, prepare environmental impact assessments, provide governmental authorities with access to its
	facilities for inspection and provide reports related to compliance. Federal and state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the lawfulness of the original conduct, for the release of certain types or quantities of hazardous substances
	into the environment. As the owner and operator of the Driftwood Project, Tellurian could be liable for the costs of investigating and cleaning up hazardous substances released into the environment and for damage to natural resources. Violation of
	these laws and regulations could lead to substantial liabilities, fines and penalties, the denial or revocation of permits necessary for our operations, governmental orders to shut down our facilities or capital expenditures related to pollution
	control equipment or remediation measures that could have a material adverse effect on Tellurians business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects.


	In October 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA) published a final rule to implement the Obama
	Administrations Clean Power Plan, which is designed to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from power plants in the United States. In February 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the final rule, effectively suspending the duty to
	comply with the rule until certain legal challenges are resolved. Other federal and state initiatives exist, are being considered or may be considered in the future to address GHG emissions through, for example, U.S. treaty commitments, direct
	regulation, a carbon emissions tax, or cap-and-trade programs. Such initiatives could affect the demand for or cost of natural gas or could increase compliance costs for our operations. The future of the Clean Power Plan and other GHG-related
	initiatives of the federal government may change under the Trump Administration.


	In addition, future federal, state and
	local environmental legislation and regulations may impose unforeseen burdens and increased costs on Tellurians business that could have a material adverse effect on Tellurians financial results, such as regulations regarding the
	transportation of LNG.




	A major health and safety incident relating to our business could be costly in terms of potential
	liabilities and reputational damage.




	Tellurian will be subject to extensive federal, state and local health and
	safety regulations and laws. Health and safety performance is critical to the success of all areas of our business. Any failure in health and safety performance may result in personal harm or injury, penalties for

	non-compliance

	with relevant laws and regulations or litigation, and a failure that results in a significant health and safety incident is likely to be costly in terms of potential liabilities. Such a failure
	could generate public concern and have a corresponding impact on our reputation and our relationships with relevant regulatory agencies and local communities, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial
	condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.


	 


	19








	Failure to retain and attract key executive officers, key advisors such as Tellurians
	Chairman or other skilled professional and technical employees could have an adverse effect on Tellurians business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects.




	The success of Tellurians business relies heavily on its executive officers and key advisors such as its Chairman. Should
	Tellurians executive officers be unable to perform their duties on behalf of Tellurian, or should Tellurian be unable to retain or attract other members of management, Tellurians business, results of operations, financial condition,
	liquidity and prospects could be materially impacted.


	Additionally, we are dependent upon an available labor pool of
	skilled employees. We will compete with other energy companies and other employers to attract and retain qualified personnel with the technical skills and experience required to construct and operate our facilities and to provide our customers with
	the highest quality service. A shortage in the labor pool of skilled workers or other general inflationary pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified personnel and
	could require an increase in the wage and benefits packages that we offer, thereby increasing our operating costs. Any increase in our operating costs could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results,
	liquidity and prospects.




	Our lack of diversification could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating
	results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.




	Due to our lack of asset and geographic diversification, an adverse
	development at the Driftwood Project, or in the LNG industry generally, would have a significantly greater impact on our financial condition and operating results than if we maintained a more diverse asset and geographic profile.



	MARKET FACTORS



	Tellurian expects global gas demand to increase faster than any other fossil fuel, as consumers look for more reliable sources
	of energy with fewer particulate and carbon emissions. The BP Energy Outlook, released in January 2017, predicts natural gas to grow at a rate of 1.7%, compounded annually, between 2015 and 2035, such that the global gas market during this time will
	add approximately 127 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/d) of demand, growing the market to approximately 464 bcf/d in total. Wood Mackenzie expects that the market could require approximately 32% of the growth in global natural gas demand
	to be supplied by LNG and forecasts LNG imports to grow to 551 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) (72 bcf/d) by 2035, from a base of 244 mtpa (32 bcf/d) in 2015, with existing and under construction facilities producing 300 mtpa (39 bcf/d)
	by 2035. As a result, the market could require new liquefaction facilities to supply an additional 251 mtpa of LNG to meet incremental demand. Assuming LNG delivered to the market is 85% of installed liquefaction capacity after taking into account
	planned and unplanned maintenance, operational outages, and fuel used during transport, we believe approximately 296 mtpa of additional liquefaction capacity will need to be constructed to meet this call on LNG, or approximately 21 mtpa per year
	from 2022 to 2035. The schedule of operations for Driftwood LNG, from 2022 to 2025, will only enable Driftwood LNG to provide a portion of the expected need for liquefaction facilities worldwide, and we expect Driftwood LNG will be a competitive
	supplier to the growing global natural gas market.


	 


	20







	REGULATION



	LNG terminal and pipeline facilities are subject to extensive federal, state and local statutes, rules, regulations, and laws
	in the United States that include, but are not limited to, the NGA, the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the Oil Pollution Act, NEPA, the CAA, the CWA, the RCRA, the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (PSIA), and the Coastal Zone
	Management Act (CZMA). These statutes cover areas related to the authorization, construction and operation of the facilities including the facilities discharges and releases to the air, land and water, and the handling, generation,
	storage and disposal of hazardous materials and solid and hazardous wastes due to the development, construction and operation of the facilities. These laws are administered and enforced by governmental agencies including FERC, the EPA, the DOE/FE,
	the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), and the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources. Additionally, the facilities construction and/or operation are subject to consultations and approvals by the Advisory Council on
	Historic Preservation, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Department of Commerce, National Marine Fisheries Services, U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and U.S. Department of Homeland Security.


	Failure to comply with applicable federal, state, and local laws, rules, and regulations could result in substantial
	administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties and/or failure to secure and retain necessary authorizations.




	Federal Energy Regulatory Commission




	The design, construction and operation of our liquefaction facilities, the export of LNG and the transportation of
	natural gas are highly regulated activities. In order to site, construct and operate our LNG Facilities, we are required to obtain authorizations from FERC under Section 3 of the NGA as well as several other material governmental and regulatory
	approvals and permits. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the EPAct) amended Section 3 of the NGA to establish or clarify FERCs exclusive authority to approve or deny an application for the siting, construction, expansion or
	operation of LNG terminals, although except as specifically provided in the EPAct, nothing in the EPAct is intended to affect otherwise applicable law related to any other federal agencys authorities or responsibilities related to LNG
	terminals.


	Several other material governmental and regulatory approvals and permits will be required throughout the life
	of our liquefaction project. Throughout the life of our proposed Driftwood Project, we will be subject to regular reporting requirements to FERC, the DOT Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (the PHMSA) and other
	federal and state regulatory agencies regarding the operation and maintenance of our facilities.


	In 2002, FERC concluded
	that it would apply light-handed regulation over the rates, terms and conditions agreed to by parties for LNG terminalling services, such that LNG terminal owners would not be required to provide open-access service at

	non-discriminatory

	rates or maintain a tariff or rate schedule on file with FERC, as distinguished from the requirements applied to FERC-regulated natural gas pipelines. The EPAct codified FERCs policy,
	but those provisions expired on January 1, 2015. Nonetheless, we see no indication that FERC intends to modify its longstanding policy of light-handed regulation of LNG terminals.


	 


	21






	FERC has authority to approve, and if necessary set, just and reasonable
	rates for the transportation or sale of natural gas in interstate commerce. In addition, under the NGA, our proposed pipeline will not be permitted to unduly discriminate or grant undue preference as to rates or the terms and conditions of
	service to any shipper, including our own marketing affiliate. FERC has the authority to grant certificates allowing construction and operation of facilities used in interstate gas transportation and authorizing the provision of services. Under the
	NGA, FERCs jurisdiction generally extends to the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, to the sale in interstate commerce of natural gas for resale for ultimate consumption for domestic, commercial, industrial or any other use
	and to natural gas companies engaged in such transportation or sale. However, FERCs jurisdiction does not extend to the production, gathering, local distribution or export of natural gas.


	In general, FERCs authority to regulate interstate natural gas pipelines and the services that they provide includes:


	 




	 


	


	 


	rates and charges for natural gas transportation and related services;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the certification and construction of new facilities;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the extension and abandonment of services and facilities;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the maintenance of accounts and records;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the acquisition and disposition of facilities;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the initiation and discontinuation of services; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	various other matters.






	U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Fossil Energy Export License




	Exports of natural gas to FTA countries are deemed to be consistent with the public interest and authorization to
	export LNG to FTA countries shall be granted by the DOE/FE without modification or delay. FTA countries which import LNG now or will do so by the end of 2017 include Canada, Chile, Colombia, Jordan, Mexico, Singapore, South Korea and the
	Dominican Republic. Exports of natural gas to

	non-FTA

	countries are considered by the DOE/FE in the context of a comment period whereby interveners are provided the opportunity to assert that such
	authorization would not be consistent with the public interest.




	Pipelines




	The PSIA, which is administered by the PHMSA Office of Pipeline Safety, governs the areas of testing, education, training and
	communication. The PSIA requires pipeline companies to perform extensive integrity tests on natural gas transportation pipelines that exist in high population density areas designated as high consequence areas. Pipeline companies are
	required to perform the integrity tests on a seven-year cycle. The risk ratings are based on numerous factors, including the population density in the geographic regions served by a particular pipeline, as well as the age and condition of the
	pipeline and its protective coating. Testing consists of hydrostatic testing, internal electronic testing, or direct assessment of the piping. In addition to the pipeline integrity tests, pipeline companies must implement a qualification program to
	make certain that employees are properly trained. Pipeline operators also must develop integrity management programs for gas transportation pipelines, which requires pipeline operators to perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity; identify
	and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a high consequence area; improve data collection, integration and analysis; repair and remediate the pipeline, as necessary; and implement preventive and mitigation actions.


	 


	22






	In 2009, the PHMSA issued a final rule (known as Control Room
	Management/Human Factors Rule) that became effective in 2010 requiring pipeline operators to write and institute certain control room procedures that address human factors and fatigue management.


	In March 2015, the PHMSA issued a final rule amending the pipeline safety regulations to update and clarify certain regulatory
	requirements, including who can perform post-construction inspections on transmission pipelines. In September 2015, the PHMSA issued a rule indefinitely delaying the effective date for the amendment to the regulation regarding post-construction
	inspections.


	In May 2015, the PHMSA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing to amend gas pipeline safety
	regulations regarding plastic piping systems used in gas services, including the installation of plastic pipe used for gas transmission lines.


	In July 2015, the PHMSA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing to add a specific timeframe for operators
	notification of accidents or incidents, as well as amending the safety regulations regarding operator qualification requirements by expanding the requirements to include new construction and certain previously excluded operation and maintenance
	tasks, requiring a program effectiveness review and adding new recordkeeping requirements. In January 2017, the PHMSA issued a final rule adding a specific time frame for operators notification of accidents or incidents but delayed final
	action on the proposed operator qualification requirements until a later date. The final rule will be effective March 24, 2017.


	In April 2016, the PHMSA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking addressing changes to the regulations governing the safety of
	gas transmission pipelines. Specifically, the PHMSA is considering certain integrity management requirements for moderate consequence areas, requiring an integrity verification process for specific categories of pipelines, and mandating
	more explicit requirements for the integration of data from integrity assessments to an operators compliance procedures. The PHMSA is also considering whether to revise requirements for corrosion control issues and to expand the definition of
	regulated gathering lines. These notices of proposed rulemaking are still pending at the PHMSA.




	Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968
	(NGPSA)




	Louisiana administers federal pipeline safety standards under the NGPSA, which requires
	certain pipelines to comply with safety standards in constructing and operating the pipelines and subjects the pipelines to regular inspections. Failure to comply with the NGPSA may result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal
	sanctions.




	Other Governmental Permits, Approvals and Authorizations




	The construction and operation of the Driftwood Project will be subject to additional federal permits, orders, approvals and
	consultations required by other federal agencies, including the DOT, Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), U.S. Department of Commerce, National Marine Fisheries Services, U.S. Department of the
	Interior, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the EPA and U.S. Department of Homeland Security.


	Three significant permits
	that may apply to our Driftwood Project are the USACE Section 404 of the Clean Water Act/Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act Permit, the Clean Air Act Title V Operating Permit and the Prevention of Significant Deterioration Permit, of
	which the latter two permits are issued by the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ). Our Driftwood Project will also have to comply with the requirements of NEPA, including preparation of an environmental impact
	assessment.


	 


	23








	Environmental Regulation




	Our proposed Driftwood Project will be subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the
	protection of the environment and natural resources, and the handling, generation, storage and disposal of hazardous materials and solid and hazardous wastes. These environmental laws and regulations, which can restrict or prohibit impacts to the
	environment or the types, quantities and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment, will require significant expenditures for compliance, can affect the cost and output of operations, may impose substantial
	administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties for non-compliance and can result in substantial liabilities.



	Clean Air Act and Greenhouse Gas
	Requirements



	The CAA and comparable state laws and regulations regulate and restrict the emission of air pollutants
	from many sources and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements, among other requirements. Our proposed Driftwood Project will be subject to the federal CAA and comparable state and local laws. We may be required to incur capital
	expenditures for air pollution control equipment in connection with maintaining or obtaining permits and approvals pursuant to the CAA and comparable state laws and regulations.


	In 2009, the EPA promulgated and finalized the Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule for multiple sections of the economy.
	This rule requires mandatory reporting of GHG emissions from stationary sources, including fuel combustion sources. In 2010, the EPA expanded the rule to include reporting obligations for LNG terminals. In addition, the EPA has defined GHG emissions
	thresholds that would subject GHG emissions from new and modified industrial sources to regulation if the source is subject to Prevention of Significant Development (PSD) permit requirements due to its emissions of

	non-GHG

	criteria pollutants. In June 2013, the Obama Administration issued its Climate Action Plan, which announced a wide-ranging set of executive actions to be implemented to cut carbon emissions in the
	United States. The Obama Administration also issued regulations limiting GHG emissions from new and existing fossil-fuel fired electrical generating stations (the latter is known as the Clean Power Plan). These rules are currently stayed subject to
	a pending court challenge and the timing, extent and impact of these initiatives remain uncertain. In addition, from time to time, Congress has considered proposed legislation directed at reducing GHG emissions and many states have already taken
	regulatory action to monitor and/or reduce emissions of GHGs, primarily through the development of GHG emission inventories or regional GHG cap and trade programs. It is not possible at this time to predict how future regulations or legislation may
	address GHG emissions and impact our business. However, future regulations and laws could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position,
	operating results and cash flows.



	Coastal Zone Management Act



	The siting and construction of our Driftwood Project within the coastal zone may be subject to the requirements of the CZMA.
	The CZMA is administered by the states (in Louisiana, by the Department of Natural Resources). This program is implemented to ensure that impacts to coastal areas are consistent with the intent of the CZMA to manage the coastal areas.

	Clean Water Act



	Our proposed Driftwood Project will be subject to the federal CWA and analogous state and local laws. The CWA and analogous
	state and local laws regulate discharges of pollutants to water of the United States or waters of the state, including discharges of wastewater and storm water runoff and discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States, as
	well as spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements. Permits must be obtained prior to discharging pollutants into state and federal waters. The CWA is administered by the EPA, the USACE and by the states (in Louisiana, by the LDEQ).
	Additionally, the siting and construction of our Driftwood Project may potentially impact jurisdictional wetlands, which would require appropriate federal, state and/or local permits and approval prior to impacting such wetlands. The authorizing
	agency may impose significant direct or indirect mitigation costs to compensate for regulated impacts to wetlands. The approval timeframe may also be extended and could potentially affect project schedules.


	In June 2015, the EPA issued a final rule that attempts to clarify the CWAs jurisdictional reach over waters of the
	United States. The rule was subsequently stayed nationwide by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit during the pendency of several lawsuits challenging the rule in the Sixth Circuit and several federal district courts. In January 2017, the
	U.S. Supreme Court accepted review of the rule to determine whether jurisdiction over challenges to the rule rests with the federal district or appellate courts. On February 28, 2017, President Trump issued an Executive Order directing the EPA
	and USACE to review the rule and publish for notice and comment a proposed rule rescinding or revising the rule, as appropriate and consistent with law. The EPA and USACE have stated that they intend to implement the Executive Order and publish a
	Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to rescind or revise the rule in the near future. The Executive Order directs the EPA and USACE to consider a new rule that reflects Justice Antonin Scalias plurality opinion in the 2006 Supreme Court decision,

	Rapanos v. United States

	, that CWA jurisdiction attaches only to navigable waters and other waters with a relatively permanent flow, such as rivers or lakes. If and when a final rule (as issued or revised) goes into effect, it
	could expand the scope of the CWAs jurisdiction, which could result in increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for discharges or pollutants or dredge and fill activities in waters of the United States, including wetland
	areas.



	Resource Conservation and Recovery Act



	The federal RCRA and comparable state requirements govern the generation, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes
	and require corrective action for releases into the environment. In the event such wastes are generated or used in connection with our facilities, we will be subject to regulatory requirements affecting the handling, transportation, treatment,
	storage and disposal of such wastes and could be required to perform corrective action measures to clean up releases of such wastes.



	Endangered
	Species Act (ESA)



	Our Driftwood Project may be restricted by requirements under the ESA. The ESA
	establishes consultation requirements for and prohibitions on activities that have the potential to result in harm to threatened or endangered species of plants, animals, fish and their designated habitats.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM



	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Tellurian Inc. and Subsidiaries


	Houston, Texas


	We have audited the accompanying
	consolidated balance sheet of Tellurian Investments Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2016, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for the year
	then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.


	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance
	with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material
	misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing
	audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
	includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
	financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.


	In our opinion, the consolidated
	financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Tellurian Investments Inc. and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year
	then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	NOTE 1  ORGANIZATION, DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS, AND SIGNIFICANT EVENTS



	Tellurian Investments Inc., a Delaware corporation based in Houston, Texas (Tellurian Investments), plans to develop, own and
	operate facilities that will produce liquefied natural gas (LNG), along with related storage facilities and loading terminals, and pursue complementary business lines in the energy industry.


	The terms we, our, us, and the Company as used in these notes refer collectively to Tellurian
	Investments and its subsidiaries unless the context suggests otherwise. These terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of any separate legal entity within Tellurian Investments.


	The Company owns a 100% membership interest in Tellurian LNG LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (Tellurian LNG), a 100%
	membership interest in Tellurian Services LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (Tellurian Services), and a 100% ownership interest in Tellurian LNG UK Ltd. Tellurian LNG owns a 100% membership interest in each of Driftwood LNG LLC,
	a Delaware limited liability company (Driftwood LNG) and Driftwood Pipeline LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (Driftwood Pipeline).


	Tellurian Investments is developing, through Tellurian LNG and Tellurian LNGs wholly owned subsidiaries, an LNG facility with
	liquefaction capacity of approximately 26 million tonnes per annum on a single site in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana (the Driftwood LNG Project). On June 6, 2016, Driftwood LNG and Driftwood Pipeline commenced the

	pre-filing

	process required by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions National Environmental Policy Act for the Driftwood LNG Project. Also, on September 27, 2016, Driftwood LNG filed an
	application with the U.S. Department of Energy seeking approval under the Natural Gas Act to export up to 26 million tonnes per year of LNG.


	On December 29, 2015, Tellurian Investments was formed as PLX Holdings LLC (PLX), originally organized under Delaware law as
	a limited liability company, and converted from a limited liability company to a privately-held Delaware corporation on February 23, 2016. The conversion of PLX into Tellurian Investments had no effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements
	as the financial activity prior to the conversion consisted primarily of immaterial formation costs.


	On August 2, 2016, Tellurian
	Investments, Magellan Petroleum Corporation, a Delaware corporation (Magellan), and River Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Magellan (Merger Sub), entered into an Agreement and
	Plan of Merger (as amended, the Merger Agreement). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Tellurian Investments was to be exchanged for 1.300 shares of common stock,
	par value $0.01 per share, of Magellan, and Merger Sub was to merge with and into Tellurian Investments (the Merger), with Tellurian Investments continuing as the surviving corporation and a direct subsidiary of Magellan. The Merger was
	completed on February 10, 2017, and, concurrent with the Merger, Magellan Petroleum Corporation was renamed Tellurian Inc. Immediately following the Merger, the

	pre-Merger

	shareholders of Tellurian
	Investments held or had the right to receive approximately 96.3% of the outstanding Tellurian Inc. common stock. The Merger will be accounted for as a reverse acquisition, with Tellurian Investments presented as the acquirer for
	accounting purposes. For additional information related to the closing of the Merger, see Note 15,

	Subsequent Events.




	NOTE 2 
	LIQUIDITY CONSIDERATIONS



	In periods prior to December 31, 2016, Tellurian Investments management concluded there was substantial
	doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern and sustain development activities for a period of twelve months from its prior assessment. This was due primarily to our cash flow being entirely dependent upon funds received
	from outside investors. Due to the following matters, Tellurian Investments management has concluded that there is no longer substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of twelve months following the
	completion of the Consolidated Financial Statements.


	On December 19, 2016, Tellurian Investments entered into a common stock
	purchase agreement with TOTAL Delaware, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and subsidiary of TOTAL S.A. (TOTAL), pursuant to which TOTAL agreed to purchase 35.4 million shares of Tellurian Investments common stock for an aggregate
	purchase price of $207 million. The transaction closed on January 3, 2017. See also Note 15,

	Subsequent Events

	.


	In addition, concurrent with the Merger, Tellurian Inc. filed an automatically-effective shelf registration statement with the
	U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission enabling it to access capital markets and offer and sell from time to time common stock, preferred stock, and warrants to purchase common stock or preferred stock in one or more transactions to fund the needs
	of Tellurian Inc. and its subsidiaries.

	TELLURIAN INVESTMENTS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES




	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  CONTINUED



	 



	NOTE 3  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES




	Basis of Presentation



	Our Consolidated
	Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Tellurian Investments and its majority owned
	subsidiaries and entities in which it holds a controlling interest. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.



	Use of Estimates



	The preparation of
	financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. Management regularly evaluates its
	estimates and related assumptions, including those related to the value of property, plant and equipment, goodwill, the collectability of financial assets, income taxes including valuation allowances for net deferred tax assets, embedded features in
	our preferred stock, and share-based compensation. Changes in facts and circumstances or additional information may result in revised estimates and are accounted for prospectively, and actual results may differ from these estimates.



	Fair Value



	Fair value is the price that
	would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The Company determines fair value based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability in
	the principal or most advantageous market. When considering market participant assumptions, measurements of fair value are classified according to the following fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to the valuation techniques used to
	measure fair value and distinguishes between observable and unobservable inputs:


	 




	 


	


	 


	Level 1 Inputs: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible to the Company at the measurement date.




	 




	 


	


	 


	Level 2 Inputs: Other than quoted prices included in Level 1, Level 2 inputs are directly or indirectly observable for similar assets or liabilities for substantially the full term of the asset or
	liability.




	 




	 


	


	 


	Level 3 Inputs: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any,
	market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date.




	In determining fair value, we maximize the use of
	observable inputs and minimize our use of unobservable inputs in arriving at fair value estimates. The Companys assessment of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and the consideration of factors
	specific to the asset or liability. In addition to market information, we incorporate transaction-specific details that, in managements judgment, market participants would take into account in measuring fair value.


	The Companys policy is to recognize transfers in or out of a fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting period for which the
	event or change in circumstances caused the transfer. The Company has consistently applied the valuation techniques discussed above for the year ended December 31, 2016 and there have been no transfers in or out of Level 1, Level 2,
	or Level 3.


	The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable reported on the Consolidated
	Balance Sheet approximates fair value. Nonrecurring fair-value measurements are those that require measurement at the transaction date without the need, at inception, to remeasure over subsequent periods. Nonrecurring fair-value measurements have
	been performed for share-based compensation as disclosed in Note 10,

	Share-Based Compensation.


	Non-financial

	assets initially measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include certain
	assets acquired in a business combination and goodwill (see Note 4, Acquisition). Recurring fair-value measurements have been performed for an embedded exchange feature in the Tellurian Investments Series A convertible preferred stock
	(Tellurian Investments Preferred Shares) that required recognition for accounting purposes (see Note 13,

	Stockholders Equity)

	.



	Segments



	Due primarily to the fact that
	we are a development company with no operations, during the year ended December 31, 2016, management allocated resources and assessed financial performance on a consolidated basis. As such, for the purposes of financial reporting under U.S.
	GAAP during 2016, the Company has operated as a single operating segment whose activities are to develop LNG facilities, along with related storage facilities and loading terminals.

	Tellurian Investments routinely reviews outstanding balances, assesses the financial strength of the parties, and records a reserve for amounts not expected to be fully recovered. We have not provided an allowance for doubtful accounts based on
	managements expectations that all receivables will be fully collected. The need for an allowance is determined based upon reviews of individual accounts, historical losses, existing economic conditions and other pertinent factors.



	Transactions with Related Parties



	Tellurian Investments has accounts due from related parties related to agreements with employees to reimburse the Company for certain
	contingent liabilities recognized by the Company and a note receivable for an advance made to an executive officer (see Note 8,

	Commitments and Contingencies

	). Related party payables are the result of balances due to related
	parties assumed in connection with the acquisition of Parallax Services LLC (Parallax Services) which remain unpaid. Tellurian Investments considers the accounts receivable from related parties to be collectible. See also Note 6,

	Transactions with Related Parties

	for further information.



	Concentration of Credit Risk



	Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and
	accounts and a note receivables due from related parties. Tellurian Investments maintains cash balances at financial institutions, which may at times be in excess of federally insured levels. Tellurian Investments has not incurred losses related to
	these balances to date.



	Accounting for LNG Development Activities



	Generally, we will begin capitalizing the costs of our LNG terminals and related pipelines once the individual project meets the following
	criteria: (1) regulatory approval has been received, (2) financing for the project is available and (3) management has committed to commence construction. Prior to meeting these criteria and until the affirmative final investment
	decision (FID) by Tellurian Inc.s Board of Directors to move forward with the project, most of the costs associated with a project are expensed as incurred. These costs primarily include professional fees associated with

	front-end

	engineering and design work, costs of securing necessary regulatory approvals, and other preliminary investigation and development activities related to our LNG terminals and related pipelines.


	Tellurian Investments will begin capitalizing the costs of its LNG terminals and related pipelines once the Driftwood LNG Projects FID
	criteria have been met. Prior to meeting these criteria, most of the costs associated with this project have been expensed as incurred and are classified in the Consolidated Statement of Operations as development expenses.


	Generally, costs that are capitalized prior to a project meeting the criteria otherwise necessary for capitalization include: land costs that
	are capitalized as property, plant and equipment and lease and purchase option payments that have been capitalized in other

	non-current

	assets. Costs of the lease and purchase options will be amortized over
	the life of the lease once obtained, or capitalized into the land if purchased. If no lease or land is obtained, option costs will be expensed.


	Should our projects be funded with debt, we will capitalize interest and other related debt costs during the construction period of our LNG
	terminals and related pipelines. Upon commencement of operations, capitalized interest, as a component of the total cost, will be amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset.



	Property, Plant and Equipment



	Property,
	plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures for construction activities, major renewals and betterments that extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized, while expenditures for maintenance and repairs and general and administrative
	activities are expensed as incurred. Tellurian Investments depreciates property, plant and equipment using the straight-line depreciation method. Upon retirement or other disposition of property, plant and equipment, the cost and related accumulated
	depreciation are removed from the account, and the resulting gains or losses are recorded in operating expenses.


	Management tests
	property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances have indicated that the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment might not be recoverable. Assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are
	identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets for purposes of assessing recoverability. Recoverability generally is determined by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the expected
	undiscounted future cash flows to be generated from the asset. If the carrying value of the asset is not recoverable, the amount of impairment loss is measured as the excess, if any, of the carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value.

	At December 31, 2016, property, plant and equipment consisted primarily of land, buildings, leasehold improvements, office furniture and
	equipment (see Note 7,

	Property, Plant and Equipment

	).



	Income Taxes



	Tellurian Investments accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes.
	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and net operating loss and credit carryforwards using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in
	which the differences are expected to impact taxable income. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.


	The Company recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent that it believes that these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making
	such determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. A valuation
	allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying value of our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will expire before the realization of the benefit or future deductibility is not probable.
	A valuation allowance equal to our federal and state net deferred tax assets has been established due to the uncertainty of realizing such tax benefits.


	Tellurian Investments recognizes the financial statement benefit of an uncertain tax position only after determining that the relevant tax
	authority would more likely than not sustain the position upon examination.


	For further details of matters affecting amounts related to
	income taxes, see Note 12,

	Income Taxes

	.



	Goodwill



	Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of the assets of the business acquired. At December 31, 2016, Tellurian
	Investments had $1.2 million of goodwill associated with the acquisition of Parallax Services (see Note 4,

	Acquisition)

	.


	Tellurian Investments determines its reporting units by identifying each unit that engaged in business activities from which it may earn
	revenues and incur expenses, had operating results regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker for purposes of resource allocation and performance assessment, and had discrete financial information.


	Goodwill is assessed at least annually for impairment and whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment of the carrying value of
	goodwill is likely. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we performed a qualitative assessment of goodwill as of October 1 to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as
	a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the

	two-step

	goodwill impairment test. If we fail a qualitative test, then we must first compare our estimate of the fair value of a reporting unit
	with its carrying value, including goodwill (Step 1). If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be
	recorded, as necessary (Step 2). Step 2 compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill to the carrying value, if any, of that goodwill. We determine the implied fair value of the goodwill in the same manner as
	determining the amount of goodwill to be recognized in a business combination.


	We completed our annual goodwill assessment noted above
	and the tests indicated no impairment. As discussed above regarding Tellurian Investments use of estimates, the Companys judgments and assumptions are inherent in its estimate of future cash flows used to determine the estimate of the
	reporting units fair value. The use of alternate judgments or assumptions could result in the recognition of impairment charges in the financial statements. A lower fair value estimate in the future could result in an impairment of goodwill.
	Factors that could indicate and cause a lower fair value estimate include significant negative industry or economic trends, cost increases, disruptions to our business, the regulatory or political environment or other unanticipated events.



	Share-based Compensation



	Tellurian
	Investments has awarded share-based compensation in the form of stock and restricted stock that are more fully described in Note 10,

	Share-Based Compensation.

	For equity-classified share-based compensation awards, Tellurian
	Investments measures share-based compensation based on the grant-date fair value of Tellurian Investments common stock and not subsequently remeasured. We had no liability-classified awards as of and for the period ended December 31,
	2016.


	For awards containing only service conditions or performance conditions deemed probable of occurring, the fair value is recognized
	as expense over the requisite service period using the straight-line method. Tellurian Investments recognizes compensation cost for awards with performance conditions if and when the Company concludes that it is probable that the performance
	condition will be achieved, net of an estimate of

	pre-vesting

	forfeitures over the requisite service period. For awards where the performance or market condition is not considered probable, compensation cost
	is deferred until the performance or market condition becomes probable. We reassess the probability of vesting at each reporting period for awards with performance conditions and adjust compensation cost based on our probability assessment.

	Loss Contingencies



	A loss contingency is
	recorded if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. We record probable loss contingencies based on the best estimate of the loss. If a range of loss can be reasonably estimated, but no single amount within the range appears to be a
	better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. These estimates are initially developed earlier than when the ultimate loss is known, and the estimates are adjusted if additional information
	becomes known.



	Net Loss Per Share



	Basic net loss per share (EPS) excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of
	common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS reflects potential dilution and is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period increased by the number of additional
	common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and were dilutive. Basic and diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2016 are the same since the potential effect of our unvested restricted stock
	and the Tellurian Investments Preferred Shares (see Note 13,

	Stockholders Equity

	) is anti-dilutive to our net loss per share. See also Note 14,

	Earnings per Common Share

	.



	Recently Adopted Guidance



	In August
	2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU)

	2014-15,


	Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entitys Ability to Continue as a
	Going Concern

	. The update provides guidance in U.S. GAAP about managements responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entitys ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote
	disclosures. The update is effective for financial statements issued for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. The standard did not have a material impact on Tellurian
	Investments Consolidated Financial Statements.


	In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU

	No. 2015-16,


	Business Combinations (Topic 805),

	which simplifies the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date in a business combination by
	eliminating the requirement to retrospectively account for such adjustments for which the accounting is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after
	December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption did not have a material impact on Tellurian Investments Consolidated Financial Statements.


	In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU

	2015-17


	, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet
	Classification of Deferred Taxes

	. The amendments in this ASU eliminate the current requirement for entities to present deferred taxes as a net current asset or liability and net noncurrent asset or liability. Under the new guidance, all deferred
	tax assets and liabilities, along with the related valuation allowances, should be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The amendments in this update may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively and are effective for annual and
	interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption was permitted and did not have a material impact on Tellurian Investments Consolidated Financial Statements.


	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU

	2016-09,


	Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718)

	. This
	ASU simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The amendments
	in this ASU are effective for public entities for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Various transition methods are prescribed depending on the aspect of accounting impacted by the amended guidance. Early adoption was
	permitted. The retroactive adoption to January 1, 2016 of this amendment did not have a material impact on Tellurian Investments Consolidated Financial Statements.


	In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU

	2016-15


	Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) - Classification of
	Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments

	. This update addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. The update is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods
	beginning after December 15, 2017 and for interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments in this update will be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. Early adoption was permitted and did not have a
	material impact on Tellurian Investments Consolidated Financial Statements.



	Accounting Guidance Issued but Not Adopted as of December 31,
	2016



	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU

	2014-09,


	Revenue from Contracts with Customers
	(Topic




	 606)

	. The update provides guidance concerning the recognition and measurement of revenue from contracts with customers. Its objective is to increase the usefulness of information in the financial statements regarding
	the nature, timing, and uncertainty of the use of revenues. The update, after a deferral by one year in August 2015 by the FASB, subsequently issued as ASU

	2015-14


	Revenue from Contracts with Customers
	(Topic




	 606),

	is effective for Tellurian Investments for the annual period beginning after December 15, 2017. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The
	implementation of this new standard will not affect the amounts shown in our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures as the Company currently has no revenues.

	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU

	2016-02,


	Leases

	. The update requires lessees to recognize
	lease assets and lease liabilities on the statement of financial position. The update is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after
	December 15, 2020. Early adoption is permitted. Tellurian Investments is evaluating the potential impact this new standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.


	In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU

	2017-01,


	Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the
	Definition of a Business

	. The amendments in this update clarify the definition of a business to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses by providing a
	screen to determine when an integrated set of assets or activities is not a business. The screen requires that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a
	group of similar identifiable assets, the set is not a business. This screen reduces the number of transactions that need to be further evaluated. If the screen is not met, then the amendments (1) require that to be considered a business, a set
	must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create output and (2) remove the evaluation of whether a market participant could replace missing elements. The amendments
	also provide a framework to assist entities in evaluating whether both an input and a substantive process are present. These amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those
	periods, with early application permitted for transactions that have not been previously reported. These amendments will be evaluated in conjunction with future acquisitions or disposals.


	In January 2017, FASB issued ASU

	2017-04,


	IntangiblesGoodwill and Other (Topic 350):
	Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment

	, which eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Step 2 required entities to compute the implied fair value of goodwill if it was determined that the carrying amount of a reporting unit
	exceeded its fair value. Under the amendments in this update, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and should recognize an impairment
	charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value. The goodwill impairment recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Additionally, an entity should
	consider income tax effects from any

	tax-deductible

	goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. An entity still has the option to perform
	the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. These amendments are effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.
	Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. We expect to apply these amendments for our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2017, or earlier if
	events or changes in circumstances indicate that an interim goodwill impairment test is necessary.



	NOTE 4  ACQUISITION



	On April 9, 2016, Tellurian Investments acquired Parallax Services LLC (Parallax Services), which was renamed Tellurian
	Services, with equity consideration valued at $1 million. Parallax Services primarily engaged in providing general and administrative support services to a related group of companies, Parallax Enterprises LLC (Parallax Enterprises)
	and Parallax Energy LLC (Parallax Energy). The transaction has been accounted for using the acquisition method in accordance with ASC 805,

	April 13, 2016, Tellurian Investments, through its wholly owned subsidiary Driftwood LNG, entered into a ground lease for a port facility adjacent to a tract of land that was acquired in March 2016. The lease provides for a four-year term,
	subject to a

	20-year

	extension and six

	5-year

	renewals and is accounted for as an operating lease, with rental payments accounted for using the straight-line method.
	Where payments exceed or are less than the amount of rent expense recognized, prepaid rent or deferred rent payable, respectively, is recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.


	During 2016, Tellurian Investments, through its wholly owned subsidiary Driftwood LNG, entered into lease and purchase option agreements (the
	Options) for certain tracts of land and associated river frontage. The Options are for land and provide for four or five-year terms. Upon exercise of the Options, leases are subject to maximum terms of 60 years (inclusive of various
	renewals) at the option of Tellurian Investments. Lease and purchase option payments have been capitalized in other

	non-current

	assets. Costs of the lease and purchase options will be amortized over the life
	of the lease once obtained, or capitalized into the land if purchased. If no lease or land is obtained, the Options cost will be expensed.



	Office
	Lease



	The Company holds a

	ten-year

	lease for its corporate headquarters located in Houston,
	Texas as well as a five-year lease for an office located in London, United Kingdom. Rent expense of $598 thousand was recognized in general and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the twelve months ended
	December 31, 2016. The leases are accounted for as operating leases, with rental payments accounted for using the straight-line method. Where payments exceed or are less than the amount of rent expense recognized, prepaid rent or deferred rent
	payable, respectively, is recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

	Employee Accounts Receivable



	In 2016, Tellurian Investments recognized a liability related to U.S. federal income tax withholdings on issued share-based compensation.
	Tellurian Investments entered into agreements with the employees that received share-based compensation to receive payment via wage withholdings if the tax liability is not settled by the employee and recognized receivables due from related parties.



	Other Accounts Receivable or Payable with Related Parties



	Parallax Energy and its subsidiaries are wholly owned entities of Mr. Martin Houston, a shareholder, and Vice Chairman of Tellurian
	Investments. During 2016, Tellurian Investments, as a result of the acquisition of Parallax Services in April 2016, had ongoing agreements with Parallax Energy and its subsidiaries to provide certain general administrative and consulting services
	for a term of one year with automatic yearly extensions (collectively the Service Agreements).


	Pursuant to the Service
	Agreements, Tellurian Services was compensated by each entity for its respective services with a fee equal to $25 thousand, paid annually. The total income recorded under the Service Agreements for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016
	was approximately $12 thousand, recorded within other income, net in in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Any balance remaining for activity conducted under the Service Agreements is included in accounts receivable due from related
	parties and accounts payable due to related parties on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.


	The outstanding balance as of December 31,
	2016, in accounts payable due to related parties is primarily related to Parallax Enterprises and its subsidiaries for activity prior to the acquisition of Parallax Services and was recognized in connection with the acquisition. Parallax Enterprises
	is partially owned by Mr. Houston and Mr. Christopher Daniels, an officer of Tellurian Investments. The amount is due currently; however, payment will occur when certain legal contingencies relative to Parallax Enterprises are settled. See
	Note 8,

	Commitments and Contingencies

	.




	Non-current

	Note Receivable Due from Related Party



	Prior to the acquisition, Parallax Services issued an interest-free $251 thousand note receivable to Mr. Houston, a 50%
	member of Parallax Services. The note was used to provide the collateral required to secure a personal $500 thousand line of credit as part of a covenant related to the office lease.



	Other



	During 2016, the Company incurred
	$629 thousand in legal fees to a law firm for advice associated with the Bonini-Kettlety Lawsuit discussed in Note 8,

	Commitments and Contingencies

	. A member of our Board of Directors is also a partner at the law firm representing the
	Company. Additionally, the Company incurred $1 million in fees associated with the private placements of our equity discussed in Note 13,

	Stockholders Equity.

	A member of our Board of Directors during that time is also a managing
	partner at the firm conducting the placements.

	In March 2016, Tellurian Investments, through its wholly owned subsidiary Driftwood LNG, purchased certain
	tracts of land and buildings in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana in exchange for $10 million in consideration. The purchase price was allocated between land and buildings based upon their relative fair values at the date of acquisition. Fair value
	was determined based on a replacement cost approach which contemplates the cost to construct improvements with equivalent utility to the subject, using modern materials and current standards, design, and layout. Estimates of replacement cost for the
	purpose of developing a market value opinion include three components: direct costs, indirect costs and entrepreneurial profit. In making estimates of fair value, the Company used published results of an appraisal report provided by third-party
	valuation experts. The Company has determined that such fair value measures are classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The allocation between land and buildings was $9.5 million and $0.5 million, respectively.


	Property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line depreciation method. Depreciation expense of $69 thousand for the
	twelve months ended December 31, 2016, is recorded within development expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The estimated useful lives of the assets within property, plant and equipment are between 3 and 30 years, as follows:

	Legal Matters




	Bonini-Kettlety Lawsuit



	On May 23, 2016, Simon Bonini and Paul Kettlety (Bonini and Kettlety) filed a lawsuit against Tellurian Investments and
	Tellurian Services, along with each of Messrs. Houston and Daniels and certain entities in which each of Messrs. Houston and Daniels own membership interests, as applicable, in the District Court of Harris County, Texas, alleging among other things,
	breach of contract, promissory estoppel, quantum meruit, fraud/fraudulent concealment, negligent misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty, usurpation/diversion of corporate opportunity, conversion, civil conspiracy and implied partnership.


	Bonini and Kettlety allege that there was a binding agreement between Bonini and Kettlety and Messrs. Houston and Daniels to sell an interest
	in Parallax Enterprises to Bonini and Kettlety and that the ultimate proposed ownership of Parallax Enterprises which was agreed to by Messrs. Houston, Daniels and two other members of Parallax Enterprises did not reflect the parties
	agreement. Bonini and Kettlety allege that their agreed upon ownership in Parallax Enterprises (14.3% each) exceeded what was ultimately offered to them (9.9% each) and that the ultimate proposal subjected them to certain management, ownership and
	redemption terms to which they had not agreed. Bonini and Kettlety are seeking damages in excess of $168 million.


	Although Tellurian
	Investments believes the claims of Bonini and Kettlety are without merit, and Tellurian Investments intends to engage in a vigorous defense of this litigation, Tellurian Investments may not ultimately be successful, and any potential liability
	Tellurian Investments may incur is not reasonably estimable. Even if Tellurian Investments is successful, however, in the defense of this litigation, Tellurian Investments could incur costs, and suffer both an economic loss and an adverse impact to
	its reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on Tellurian Investments business.



	Contingency Loss



	Certain employees received

	non-cash

	compensation in the form of shares for services during 2016, the
	value of which compensation is not certain for the purpose of determining taxable wages. Tellurian Investments has accrued $2.6 million as wage withholding for these matters and believes the estimated liability is adequate to cover the ultimate
	resolution.

	NOTE 10  SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION



	Tellurian Investments has granted stock and restricted stock to employees under the Tellurian Investments Inc. 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan, as
	amended (the Omnibus Plan). The Omnibus Plan provides for a variety of stock-based and performance-based awards deemed by the Board of Directors or a committee appointed thereby to be consistent with the purpose of the Omnibus Plan.
	Types of awards under the Omnibus Plan may include stock options, restricted stock, phantom stock, vested stock, and other stock-based awards to employees, contract service providers, and outside directors.


	The maximum number of shares of Tellurian Investments common stock issuable under the Omnibus Plan was 30,000,000 shares. As discussed in
	Note 15,

	Subsequent Events

	, the amount of additional shares issuable under the Omnibus Plan was temporarily limited by the terms of the Merger Agreement. As of December 31, 2016, including the Merger Agreement limitation,
	there were 18,997,000 shares remaining available for issuance. Subject to the terms of applicable award agreements, the Omnibus Plan provided for certain methods of vesting and replacement of awards in the event of a change in control, voting and
	participation in dividends, and restrictions on the transferability of awards, and required the forfeiture of the awards for termination of continuous service.


	For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, Tellurian Investments recognized stock-based compensation expense related to restricted
	stock amortization, unrestricted stock and share-based compensation awards of $24.5 million. The estimated fair value of all share-based compensation granted in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 is between $2.00 and $3.91 per
	share.


	Through May 2016, Tellurian Investments determined the fair value of stock compensation using the price paid for private
	placements of stock. Accordingly, we classified this fair-value measurement as a Level 2 input. Beginning in June 2016, the fair value of stock-based compensation was determined through the use of a model which utilizes certain observable
	inputs such as the price of Magellan common stock at various points in time as well as unobservable inputs related to the weighted probabilities of certain Merger-related scenarios at each valuation date. As a private company at the time of
	issuance, the model includes a discount for the lack of marketability of Tellurian Investments common stock as determined through the use of commonly accepted methods. We have therefore classified the fair value measurements used for share-based
	compensation as Level 3 inputs.



	Stock Compensation Granted Under the Omnibus Plan



	As of December 31, 2016, 8,848,000 restricted shares and 2,155,000 shares of unrestricted common stock had been granted and issued under
	the Omnibus Plan. Share-based compensation expense of $6.5 million related to the unrestricted common stock granted under the Omnibus Plan was recognized during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. Certain restricted stock awards
	vest upon either FID (the FID Awards) or the successful closing of the Merger (the Merger Awards). As of December 31, 2016, Tellurian Investments does not believe FID is considered probable of occurring at this time and
	therefore has not recorded share-based compensation expense related to those restricted stock awards. The weighted average grant date fair value per share and the total grant date fair value of the FID Awards granted during 2016 were $3.52 per share
	and $31.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, Tellurian Investments views the closing of the Merger as probable and has recorded share-based compensation expense of $0.3 million related to the Merger Awards. The grant date
	fair value per share and the total grant date fair value of the Merger Awards granted during 2016 were $3.91 per share and $0.4 million, respectively.


	The restrictions on the FID Awards will expire upon the affirmative FID (as described below); provided, however,


	such restrictions will
	expire on such date only if:


	 




	 


	


	 


	the employee maintains continuous service from the date of the grant through the applicable vesting date; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	the employees continuous service is terminated by Tellurian Investments without cause or by the employee for good reason and in either event FID occurs within five years after such termination.




	For purposes of the FID Awards, FID means a decision by Tellurian Inc.s Board of Directors to move forward with a project, the project
	site and construction thereon, following (i) determination by Tellurian Investments that such site has met the appropriate suitability criteria, (ii) Tellurian Investments securing a long-term option on such site, (iii) Tellurian
	Investments securing financing deemed sufficient by Tellurian Inc.s Board of Directors, and (iv) the completion of the

	front-end

	engineering and design process.



	Stock Compensation Granted Outside the Omnibus Plan



	In March 2016, Tellurian Investments Board of Directors granted a total of 1,750,000 shares of vested stock to various employees. The
	vested stock was granted prior to the existence of the Omnibus Plan. The estimated fair value of these awards on the grant date was determined to be $2.00 per share.

	In April 2016, Tellurian Investments Board of Directors approved 1,050,000 shares to be purchased at a discount by two executive officers
	as a form of compensation. The difference between the purchase price of $0.50 and the estimated fair value is recorded as compensation to the officers. The estimated fair value of these awards on the grant date was determined to be $2.00 per share.


	In August 2016, Tellurian Investments Board of Directors approved 4,500,000 shares to be purchased at a discount by an executive
	officer as a form of compensation. The difference between the purchase price of $2.00 and the estimated fair value is recorded as compensation to the officer. The estimated fair value of this award on the grant date was determined to be $3.50 per
	share.


	In September 2016, Tellurian Investments Board of Directors approved 2,000,000 shares to be purchased at a discount by two

	NOTE 11  EMPLOYEE BENEFITS



	The Company has a defined contribution plan (the 401(k) Plan) which allows eligible employees to contribute up to 90% of their
	compensation up to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) maximum. The Company matches each employees salary deferrals at 100% of the first 6% of employee contributions and may make additional contributions at its discretion. Employees
	are immediately vested in the contributions made by us. The Companys contributions to the 401(k) Plan were $159 thousand for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The Company has made no discretionary contributions to the 401(k)

	Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of

	Significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are comprised of the following (in thousands):

	Deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulted principally from capitalized engineering costs,
	capitalized

	start-up

	costs, property, plant and equipment and compensation and benefits accruals. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are classified as

	non-current

	on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.


	At December 31, 2016, we had federal net
	operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of approximately $12.1 million. These NOL carryforwards will expire in 2036.


	We
	reduce our deferred income tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax
	assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable
	income will be generated to permit use of the existing deferred tax assets. As we have not yet begun generating revenues or reached FID, the Company has established a full valuation allowance of $26.4 million in the period ended
	December 31, 2016, against its net deferred tax assets in excess of the deferred tax liabilities.


	The Company is subject to income
	taxes in the U.S. federal and various state jurisdictions and the United Kingdom. Tax regulations within each jurisdiction are subject to the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and require significant judgment to apply. The
	Company reviews income tax positions expected to be taken in income tax returns to determine if there are any income tax uncertainties. We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax

	positions will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the positions. For tax positions meeting the

	more-likely-than-not

	threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax
	authority. Interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions, if any, are recognized in income tax expense in the period in which they occur. The federal, foreign and state tax returns for 2016 remain open for all purposes of examination by the IRS
	and other taxing authorities. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions.



	NOTE 13
	 STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY




	Overview



	Stockholders equity at December 31, 2016 resulted from various private placements of Tellurian Investments common and preferred
	stock, restricted stock awards, and discounted purchases by employees (see also Note 10,

	Share-Based Compensation

	). During the year ended December 31, 2016, proceeds of $59 million and $25 million were received in
	private placements of common stock and preferred stock, respectively. Equity offering costs of $1.8 million were incurred and are included within additional

	paid-in

	capital on the Consolidated Balance
	Sheet. There are no current outstanding equity commitments of the stockholders.



	Tellurian Investments Preferred Shares



	On November 23, 2016, Tellurian Investments entered into a preferred stock purchase agreement (the Preferred SPA) with GE
	Oil & Gas, Inc., a Delaware corporation and subsidiary of General Electric Company (GE), pursuant to which GE purchased 5,467,851 shares of Tellurian Investments Series A convertible preferred stock (the Tellurian
	Investments Preferred Shares) for an aggregate purchase price of $25 million.


	In connection with the Preferred SPA, Tellurian
	Investments amended and restated its certificate of incorporation (as amended and restated, the Tellurian Investments Charter) and Magellan agreed to adopt, upon the closing of the Merger, a certificate of designations of Series B
	convertible preferred stock (the Magellan Certificate of Designations), each of which designate the Tellurian Investments Preferred Shares and the rights, preferences, privileges, and limitations thereof. The Tellurian Investments
	Preferred Shares remained outstanding as preferred stock of the surviving corporation in the Merger, which became a subsidiary of Magellan on February 10, 2017. After the Merger, Magellan Petroleum Corporation was renamed Tellurian Inc.
	Pursuant to the Tellurian Investments Charter and Magellan Certificate of Designations, upon completion of the Merger, each Tellurian Investments Preferred Share became convertible or exchangeable at any time into either (i) one share of
	Tellurian Inc. common stock or (ii) one share of a new class of Tellurian Inc. Series B convertible preferred stock, which has terms substantially similar to those of the Tellurian Investments Preferred Shares as summarized below (each, a
	Tellurian Inc. Preferred Share). Together, the Tellurian Investments Preferred Shares and the Tellurian Inc. Preferred Shares are referred to as the Preferred Shares.


	The general terms of the Preferred Shares are as follows:


	 




	 


	


	 



	Voting Rights.

	Holders of the Preferred Shares are generally entitled to one vote for each Preferred Share held by them, except that GE was not entitled to vote on the approval of the Merger or any other matter
	directly related to the Merger.




	 




	 


	


	 



	Optional and Mandatory Conversion before the Merger.

	Each Tellurian Investments Preferred Share was convertible into Tellurian Investments common stock at a ratio of 0.76923 shares of Tellurian Investments common
	stock per Tellurian Investments Preferred Share in certain circumstances if the Merger was not completed. In addition, if the Merger was not consummated, each Tellurian Investments Preferred Share was mandatorily convertible into Tellurian
	Investments common stock on the sixth anniversary of the issuance at a ratio of 0.76923 shares of Tellurian Investments common stock per Tellurian Investments Preferred Share.




	 




	 


	


	 



	Exchange after the Merger

	. Following the Merger, holders of the Tellurian Investments Preferred Shares may exchange all (but not less than all) of such shares for shares of Tellurian Inc. common stock on a


	one-for-one


	basis. Alternatively, following the Merger, holders of the Tellurian Investments Preferred Shares may exchange all (but not less than all) of such shares for
	Tellurian Inc. Series B convertible preferred stock on a


	one-for-one


	basis, and those shares may be subsequently converted into Tellurian Inc. common stock on the same
	basis.




	 


	21







	TELLURIAN INVESTMENTS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES




	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  CONTINUED



	 


	 




	 


	


	 



	Mandatory Conversion after the Merger.

	If the holders of the Tellurian Investments Preferred Shares (or, following an exchange, holders of the Tellurian Inc. Preferred Shares) have not converted such shares for
	Tellurian Inc. common stock on or before November 23, 2022, such shares will automatically be converted into Tellurian Inc. common stock on a


	one-for-one


	basis.
	Each conversion ratio is subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments.




	 




	 


	


	 



	Dividends.

	The Preferred Shares do not have dividend rights.




	 




	 


	


	 



	Liquidation.

	In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of Tellurian Investments or Tellurian Inc., as applicable, after payment or provision for payment of the debts and other
	liabilities of the relevant company, holders of the Preferred Shares will be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to $4.57218 for each Preferred Share held by it before any distribution is made to holders of shares of Tellurian Inc. common
	stock.




	 




	 


	


	 



	Other.

	In connection with the Preferred SPA, Tellurian Investments and Magellan also agreed (i) to provide GE, as holder of the Preferred Shares, with certain registration rights relating to the Tellurian
	Inc. common stock GE may receive upon conversion or exchange of Preferred Shares and (ii) that Tellurian Investments or Tellurian Inc., as applicable, will consider purchasing certain equipment from GE for use in the development of the
	Driftwood LNG Project.




	Also on November 23, 2016, Magellan and GE entered into a Guaranty and Support Agreement
	pursuant to which Tellurian Inc., contingent on the closing of the Merger, guaranteed to GE the performance of all of the obligations of Tellurian Investments in connection with the Preferred SPA (the GE Guaranty and Support Agreement)
	including with respect to registration rights as noted above.



	Embedded Derivative



	The Tellurian Investments Preferred Shares may be exchanged for preferred or common shares of Magellan (or Tellurian Inc. after the Merger)
	which must be bifurcated from the contract and valued as an embedded derivative. The Company allocated proceeds from the issuance of the Tellurian Investments Preferred Shares to the embedded derivative, with the remainder of the proceeds allocated
	to the Tellurian Investments Preferred Shares in equity. This value represents the value of the holders ability to exchange the instrument into shares of Tellurian Inc. after the Merger.


	The fair value of the embedded derivative is determined through the use of a model which utilizes certain observable inputs such as the price
	of Magellan common stock at various points in time and the volatility of Magellan common stock over an assumed

	one-year

	holding period, as well as unobservable inputs related to the weighted probabilities of
	certain Merger-related scenarios at each valuation date. As Tellurian Investments was a private company at the time of issuance, the model includes a discount for the lack of marketability determined through the use of commonly accepted methods. We
	have therefore classified the fair value measurements of this embedded derivative as Level 3 inputs, and changes in the unobservable inputs may materially impact the fair value measurement in future periods.


	The Company has marked this derivative feature to market as of December 31, 2016, with changes included in the Consolidated Statement of
	Operations as follows (in thousands):

	Basic loss per share is based upon the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during
	the period. Diluted loss per share would include the effect of unvested restricted stock awards and the Tellurian Investments Preferred Shares; however, such items were not considered in the calculation of the diluted weighted average common shares
	outstanding since they would be anti-dilutive. Potentially dilutive securities excluded from the calculation of diluted shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2016, are as follows:

	NOTE 15  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS




	Closing of the TOTAL Stock Purchase Agreement



	On December 19, 2016, Tellurian Investments entered into a common stock purchase agreement (the Common SPA) with TOTAL
	pursuant to which TOTAL agreed to purchase 35.4 million shares of Tellurian Investments common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $207 million. In connection with the Common SPA, Tellurian Investments, Magellan, and Merger Sub
	entered into a second amendment to the Merger Agreement (the TOTAL Merger Agreement Amendment). Among other things, the TOTAL Merger Agreement Amendment (i) permitted Tellurian Investments to enter into the Common SPA and issue the
	Tellurian Investments common stock to TOTAL, (ii) increased the temporary restriction under the Merger Agreement of the maximum number of shares of Tellurian Investments common stock (or its equivalent) issuable to current and prospective
	employees of the Company under the Omnibus Plan between August 2, 2016 and the closing of the Merger from 10,000,000 to 13,000,000, (iii) provided for the appointment of one board designee of TOTAL to the Board of Directors of Tellurian Inc.
	effective upon the closing of the Merger, and (iv) extended the Outside Date (as defined in the Merger Agreement) from January 31, 2017 to February 28, 2017.


	On January 3, 2017, at the closing of the Common SPA, (i) Magellan and TOTAL entered into a guaranty and support agreement, pursuant
	to which Magellan (or Tellurian Inc. after the Merger), contingent on the closing of the Merger, guaranteed to TOTAL the performance of all of the obligations of Tellurian Investments in connection with the Common SPA (the TOTAL Guaranty and
	Support Agreement); and (ii) Tellurian Investments and TOTAL entered into a preemptive rights agreement, pursuant to which TOTAL was granted a right to purchase its

	pro-rata

	portion of any new
	equity securities that Tellurian Investments may issue to a third party on the same terms and conditions as such equity securities are offered and sold to such party, subject to certain excepted offerings.



	Completion of the Merger with Magellan



	On August 2, 2016, Tellurian Investments, Magellan, and Merger Sub entered into a Merger Agreement. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement,
	each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Tellurian Investments was to be exchanged for 1.300 shares of common stock, par value $0.010 per share, of Magellan, and Merger Sub was to merge with and into Tellurian
	Investments , with Tellurian Investments continuing as the surviving corporation and a direct subsidiary of Magellan. The Merger was completed on February 10, 2017, and, concurrent with the Merger, Magellan Petroleum Corporation was renamed
	Tellurian Inc. Immediately following the Merger, the

	pre-Merger

	shareholders of Tellurian Investments held or had the right to receive approximately 96.3% of the outstanding Tellurian Inc. common stock. The
	Merger will be accounted for as a reverse acquisition, with Tellurian Investments presented as the acquirer for accounting purposes.


	Prior to the Merger, Magellan was an independent oil and gas exploration and production company. Historically active internationally, Magellan
	also owned interests in the Horse

	Hill-1

	well and related licenses in the Weald Basin, onshore UK, and an exploration block, NT/P82, in the Bonaparte Basin, offshore Northern Territory, Australia. Magellan
	conducted its operations through two wholly owned subsidiaries corresponding to the geographical areas in which it operated: Magellan Petroleum (UK) Limited and Magellan Petroleum Australia Pty Ltd.


	In connection with the Merger and pursuant to a purchase and sale agreement (the Magellan PSA), Magellan issued 90,350 shares of
	common stock to the former owners of the membership interests in Nautilus Technical Group LLC and Eastern Rider LLC, including an entity controlled by J. Thomas Wilson, former CEO and director of Magellan (collectively, the Sellers).
	Pursuant to the Magellan PSA, Magellan had agreed to issue to the Sellers an aggregate of 90,350 shares of Magellan common stock in exchange for all rights of the Sellers to a contingent production payment of up to $5.0 million potentially
	payable by Magellan to the Sellers relating to production from a field formerly owned by Magellan.

	In addition, in connection with the Merger, Magellan issued 409,800 shares of common stock to Petrie Partners Securities, LLC, Magellans
	financial advisor with respect to the Merger, as part of a fee payable by Magellan in connection with the completion of the Merger.


	Upon
	the completion of the Merger, all Tellurian Investments Preferred Shares held by GE became convertible or exchangeable into either (i) one share of the common stock of Tellurian Inc. or (ii) one Tellurian Inc. Preferred Share, which has
	provisions substantially the same as a Tellurian Investments Preferred Share. The Tellurian Investments Preferred Shares represented 2.7% of the total outstanding shares (common and preferred) of Tellurian Investments immediately following the
	completion of the Merger.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM



	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Tellurian Inc. and Subsidiaries


	Houston, Texas


	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Tellurian Services LLC (the Company) as of April 9, 2016
	and December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related statements of operations, members capital, and cash flows for the period from January 1, 2016 through April 9, 2016, and for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. These
	financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.


	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and
	in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
	misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing
	audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
	includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
	statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.


	In our opinion, the
	financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Tellurian Services LLC as of April 9, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for
	the period from January 1, 2016 through April 9, 2016 and for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	NOTE 1  ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES




	Basis of Presentation



	Tellurian Services LLC (Tellurian Services), organized under Delaware law as a limited liability company, was
	formed on December 18, 2013. Tellurian Services was formerly known as Parallax Services LLC prior to its membership interests being purchased and it being renamed in April 2016. Tellurian Services was formed primarily to engage in liquefied
	natural gas (LNG)-specific consulting services as well as back-office and general and administrative support services to Parallax Enterprises LLC (Parallax Enterprises) and its 100% owned subsidiaries as well as Parallax
	Energy LLC (Parallax Energy) and its 100% owned subsidiaries (see Note 2  Transactions with Related Parties).


	On July 1, 2014, Tellurian Services entered into a contract with Origin Energy to provide quarterly market intelligence
	related to the LNG markets. The contract provided for quarterly payments of approximately $688 thousand for each report. This contract represented the majority of Tellurian Services revenues for both 2014 and 2015. This contract was
	terminated in July 2015. As a result, there were no third party revenues in the period ended April 9, 2016.


	On
	April 9, 2016 Tellurian Investments Inc. acquired Tellurian Services in an all-stock transaction with consideration totaling $1.2 million and acquisition costs of $30 thousand.



	Use of Estimates



	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
	America (GAAP) requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates
	are recorded prospectively.



	Cash and Cash Equivalents



	Tellurian Services considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash
	equivalents and typically exceed federally insured limits.



	Accounts Receivable



	Accounts receivable are primarily from cost reimbursements as a result of back-office and general and administrative support
	services with related parties. Tellurian Services routinely reviews outstanding balances, assesses the financial strength of its customers, and records a reserve for amounts not expected to be fully recovered. The need for an allowance is determined
	based upon reviews of individual accounts, historical losses, existing economic conditions and other pertinent factors. Tellurian Services recognized related party bad debt expense of $102 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2015. No
	bad debt expense was recorded for the period ended April 9, 2016 or the year ended December 31, 2014. See Note 2,

	Transactions with Related Parties,

	for additional information related to bad debt expense recognized.

	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  CONTINUED



	 



	Transactions with Related Parties



	Tellurian Services has receivables with related parties as a result of back-office and general and administrative support
	services provided and payables as a result of timing of deposits made in advance of services to be provided. Tellurian Services does not consider the accounts or notes receivable from related parties to be uncollectible.



	Property, Plant and Equipment



	Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures for construction activities, major renewals and betterments
	that extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized, while expenditures for maintenance and repairs and general and administrative activities are expensed as incurred. Tellurian Services depreciates its property, plant and equipment using the
	straight-line depreciation method. Upon retirement or other disposition of property, plant and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the account, and the resulting gains or losses are recorded in other operating
	costs and expenses.


	Management tests property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in
	circumstances have indicated that the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment might not be recoverable. Assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of
	other groups of assets for purposes of assessing recoverability. Recoverability generally is determined by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the expected undiscounted future cash flows of the asset. If the carrying value of the asset is
	not recoverable, the amount of impairment loss is measured as the excess, if any, of the carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value


	At April 9, 2016, and December 31, 2015 and 2014, property, plant and equipment consisted primarily of leasehold
	improvements related to the Tellurian Services office lease and associated office furniture, fixtures and equipment. The estimated useful lives are 10 years and 5 to 15 years for the leasehold improvements and office furniture, fixtures and
	equipment, respectively. Amounts recorded to depreciation expense for the period ended April 9, 2016 and the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, was $8 thousand, $18 thousand and $4 thousand, respectively. Accumulated
	depreciation as of April 9, 2016, December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014 was $30 thousand, $22 thousand and $4 thousand, respectively. Depreciation expense is recorded within General and administrative on the
	statements of operations.



	Revenue Recognition



	Tellurian Services recognizes consulting-related revenues over the contractual term of the arrangement or the expected period
	during which those specified services will be performed, whichever is longer, unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned or obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern.



	Income Taxes



	Tellurian Services was organized as a Delaware limited liability company and is treated as a flow-through entity for U.S.
	federal income tax purposes. Under U.S. federal income tax law, limited liability companies that elect partnership taxation are not taxable entities. Therefore, a provision for income tax has not been recorded in the accompanying financial
	statements. The owners as of the time of the accompanying financial statements were individually responsible for reporting their share of Tellurian Services income or loss on their income tax returns.

	TELLURIAN SERVICES LLC




	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  CONTINUED



	 


	Although Tellurian Services is a non-taxpaying entity for federal income tax
	purposes, certain states require a tax similar to an income tax. Texas imposes a franchise tax (commonly referred to as the Texas margin tax) on gross revenues less certain deductions, as specifically set forth in the Texas margin tax statute. The
	Texas margin tax applies to corporations and limited liability companies, general and limited partnerships (unless otherwise exempt), limited liability partnerships, trusts (unless otherwise exempt), business trusts, business associations,
	professional associations, joint stock companies, holding companies, joint ventures and certain other business entities having limited liability protection. Tellurian Services Texas margin tax for the period ended April 9,
	2016, December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was insignificant (less than ten thousand dollars in each period presented) and thus was not separately presented in the financial statements. Tax expense is recorded within General and
	administrative on the statements of operations.


	As required by the uncertain tax position guidance in ASC 740,

	Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

	, Tellurian Services recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an
	audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax
	authority. Tellurian Services does not have any uncertain tax positions.


	Tellurian Services files a U.S. Return of
	Partnership Income along with various other state filings. In the normal course of business, Tellurian Services may be audited by any of these taxing authorities. As of April 9, 2016, Tellurian Services is not currently undergoing any tax
	examinations.



	Net Income Per Unit



	Tellurian Services has omitted net income per unit due to no units being issued. In lieu of issuing units, the members
	percentage interest set forth in Tellurian Services operating agreement is a 50% interest to each member as of the time of the accompanying financial statements.



	Comprehensive Income



	Tellurian Services has no elements of comprehensive income other than net income.



	Recently Issued Accounting Standards



	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU)
	2014-09,

	Revenue from Contracts with Customers

	(Topic 606). The update provides guidance concerning the recognition and measurement of revenue from contracts with customers. Its objective is to increase the usefulness of information in
	the financial statements regarding the nature, timing, and uncertainty of the use of revenues. The update, after a deferral by one year in August 2015 by the FASB, subsequently titled ASU 2015-14

	Revenue from Contracts with Customers

	(Topic 606) is effective for Tellurian Services for the annual period ending after December 15, 2017. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. Tellurian Services has not yet
	selected a transition method and is evaluating the potential impact this standard will have on its financial statements and related disclosures.


	In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,

	Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entitys Ability to Continue as a
	Going Concern

	. The update provides guidance in GAAP about managements responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entitys ability to continue as a

	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  CONTINUED



	 


	going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The update is effective for financial statements issued for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual
	periods and interim periods thereafter. Tellurian Services is evaluating the potential impact this new standard will have on its financial statements and related disclosures.


	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,

	Leases

	. The update requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease
	liabilities on the statement of financial position. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for annual and interim periods beginning on or after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. Tellurian Services is evaluating
	the potential impact this new standard will have on its financial statements and related disclosures.


	In August 2016, the
	FASB issued ASU 2016-15

	Statement of Cash Flows

	(Topic 230)

	Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments

	. This update addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in
	practice. The update is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and for interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments in this update will be applied using a retrospective
	transition method to each period presented. Early adoption is permitted. Tellurian Services is evaluating the potential impact this new standard will have on its financial statements and related disclosures.



	NOTE 2  TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES



	As of April 9, 2016, Tellurian Services had entered into agreements with entities to provide certain general
	administrative and management services for a term of one year with automatic yearly extensions, including, without limitation, the sourcing, structuring and negotiation of potential business acquisitions and customer contracts (the
	Agreements).


	All activity conducted under the Agreements are included in Accounts receivable due from related
	parties and Accounts payable due to related parties on the balance sheets. Salary expense allocated to related parties is recorded within Operating expenses on the statements of operations. Salary expense for employees working on behalf of the
	related parties recorded for the period ended April 9, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015 was $52 thousand and $105 thousand, respectively. No salary expense was incurred to related parties for the year ended
	December 31, 2014.


	The outstanding balances in Accounts receivable due from related parties and Accounts payable due
	to related parties are related to general administrative and management services provided to Parallax Enterprises and its 100% owned subsidiaries as well as Parallax Energy and its 100% owned subsidiaries. Two of the four officers of Parallax
	Enterprises, Mr. Martin Houston and Mr. Christopher Daniels, were also members of Tellurian Services until Tellurian Services was acquired by Tellurian Investments Inc. on April 9, 2016. Parallax Energy and its 100% owned subsidiaries
	are wholly owned by Mr. Martin Houston, a member of Tellurian Services.

	The Parallax Enterprises LLC related party payable amounts as of December 31, 2015 and April 9, 2016
	are netted on the balance sheet by the amounts due to the Company. The amounts have been presented gross in the above table.





	In accordance with the netting agreement, effective date September 2016, between Tellurian Services and Parallax Enterprises,
	the outstanding accounts receivable and accounts payable balances related to Parallax Enterprises and its 100% owned subsidiaries are netted on the balance sheet for all period presented. The net position of all the balances as of April 9,
	2016, December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 were a payable balance of $253 thousand and $306 thousand and a receivable balance of $991 thousand, respectively.


	Under each Agreement, Tellurian Services is compensated by each entity for its services with a fee equal to $25 thousand
	paid annually. The total revenue recorded under these Agreements for the period ended April 9, 2016 and for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was approximately $31 thousand, $311 thousand, and $84 thousand,
	respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2015, service revenues receivables for three entities, 100% owned by Mr. Martin Houston, had become deemed uncollectible and charged to bad debt expense in the amount of $102 thousand.


	Tellurian Services transacted on behalf of some of the above noted related parties before the Agreements were effective.
	On behalf of Parallax Enterprises, Tellurian Services paid legal expenses of $68 thousand, LNG project modelling costs of $24 thousand, engineering costs of $14 thousand, insurance costs of $5 thousand and a land option payment
	of $162 thousand. On behalf of Parallax Fund V Investco LLC, Tellurian Services received payments in the amount of $125 thousand that was then later deposited into Parallax Fund V Investco LLCs operating accounts. The transactions on
	behalf of Parallax Enterprises occurred before the effective date of the Agreement and are represented in Accounts receivable due from related parties on the balance sheets. The transactions on behalf of

	In November 2015, Tellurian Services issued an interest free $251 thousand note receivable to Mr. Martin Houston, a
	50% member of Tellurian Services. The note was used to provide the collateral required to secure a $500 thousand line of credit as part of a covenant related to Tellurian Services office lease. See Note 4,

	Contingencies

	, for additional information about the office lease.

	Legal Matters




	Bonini-Kettlety Lawsuit



	On May 23, 2016, Simon Bonini and Paul Kettlety (Bonini and Kettlety) filed a lawsuit against Tellurian
	Investments and Tellurian Services, along with each of Messrs. Houston and Daniels and certain entities in which each of Messrs. Houston and Daniels own membership interests, as applicable, in the District Court of Harris County, Texas,
	alleging among other things, breach of contract, promissory estoppel, quantum meruit, fraud/fraudulent concealment, negligent misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty, usurpation/diversion of corporate opportunity, conversion, civil conspiracy
	and implied partnership.


	Bonini and Kettlety allege that there was a binding agreement between Bonini and Kettlety and
	Messrs. Houston and Daniels to sell an interest in Parallax Enterprises to Bonini and Kettlety and that the ultimate proposed ownership of Parallax Enterprises which was agreed to by Messrs. Houston, Daniels and two other members of
	Parallax Enterprises did not reflect the parties agreement. Bonini and Kettlety allege that their agreed upon ownership in Parallax Enterprises (14.3%, each) exceeded what was ultimately offered to them (9.9%, each) and that the ultimate
	proposal subjected them to certain management, ownership and redemption terms to which they had not agreed. Bonini and Kettlety are seeking damages in excess of $168 million.


	Although Tellurian Services believes the claims of Bonini and Kettlety are without merit, and Tellurian Services intends to
	engage in a vigorous defense of this litigation, Tellurian Services may not ultimately be successful and any potential liability Tellurian Services may incur is not reasonably estimable. Even if Tellurian Services is successful, however, in the
	defense of this litigation, Tellurian Services could incur costs and suffer both an economical loss and an adverse impact on reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on Tellurian Services business.

	value $0.001 per share, of Tellurian Investments was exchanged for 1.300 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Magellan, and Merger Sub was merged with and into Tellurian Investments (the Merger), with Tellurian
	Investments continuing as the surviving corporation and a direct subsidiary of Magellan. Except for adjustments made to reflect stock splits, share issuances and similar changes, this exchange ratio was fixed and was not adjusted to reflect stock
	price changes prior to the closing of the Merger. Immediately following the Merger, the

	pre-Merger

	shareholders of Tellurian Investments held or had the right to receive approximately 96.4% of the outstanding
	Magellan common stock.


	The Merger will be accounted for as a reverse acquisition and recapitalization since Tellurian
	Investments has control over the combined company through the post-Merger ownership of approximately 96.4% of the common stock of Magellan, majority representation on the combined companys board of directors, and control of a majority of
	management positions of the combined company. Parallax Services LLC (Parallax Services) was acquired by Tellurian Investments on April 9, 2016 and renamed Tellurian Services LLC (Tellurian Services); as such, the
	historical financial results of Tellurian Services have been included for the periods prior to April 9, 2016 in the unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of operations.


	The following unaudited pro forma consolidated combined financial statements reflect the combination of the historical consolidated results of
	Magellan, Tellurian Investments, and Parallax Services on a pro forma basis to give effect to the following transactions, which are described in further detail below:


	 




	 


	


	 




	TOTAL Common Stock Investment


	. On December 19, 2016, Tellurian Investments entered into a common stock purchase agreement with TOTAL Delaware, Inc., a Delaware corporation and subsidiary of TOTAL S.A
	(TOTAL). Pursuant to the common stock purchase agreement, Tellurian Investments agreed to issue 35,384,615 shares of its common stock to TOTAL for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $207 million (or $5.85 per share) (the
	TOTAL Common Stock Investment). The TOTAL Common Stock Investment was completed on January 3, 2017.




	 




	 


	


	 




	Merger Adjustments.


	Adjustments reflect the Merger by which Merger Sub merged with and into Tellurian Investments with Tellurian Investments continuing as the surviving corporation and a direct subsidiary
	of Magellan. Although Magellan is the legal acquirer, Tellurian Investments is the accounting acquirer. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of Magellan are recorded at their preliminary estimated fair values. The actual adjustments to the
	consolidated financial statements upon consummation of the Merger and allocation of the final purchase price depends on a number of factors, including additional financial information available at such time, changes in the fair value of Magellan
	common stock transferred at the closing date, and changes in the estimated fair value of Magellans assets and liabilities as of the closing date. Accordingly, the final allocations of the Merger consideration and the effects of such
	allocations on the results of operations may differ materially from the preliminary allocations and unaudited pro forma combined amounts included herein.




	The unaudited pro forma consolidated combined balance sheet of the combined company is based on (i) the unaudited historical consolidated
	balance sheet of Magellan as of December 31, 2016 and (ii) the audited historical consolidated balance sheet of Tellurian Investments as of December 31, 2016, and includes pro forma adjustments to give effect to the Merger Adjustments
	as if they had occurred on December 31, 2016.


	The unaudited pro forma consolidated combined statement of operations of the combined
	company are based on (i) the unaudited historical consolidated statement of operations of Magellan for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, (ii) the audited historical consolidated statement of operations of Tellurian Services for
	the period from January 1, 2016 to April 9, 2016, (iii) the audited historical consolidated statement of operations of Tellurian Investments for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, and (iv) the TOTAL Common Stock
	Investment and Merger Adjustments as if they had occurred on January 1, 2016.

	The unaudited pro forma data presented herein reflects events that are directly attributable to
	the described transactions, factually supportable, and as it relates to the unaudited pro forma consolidated combined statement of operations, expected to have a continuing impact. The unaudited pro forma data presented herein also reflects certain
	assumptions which management believes are reasonable. Such pro forma data is not necessarily indicative of financial results that would have been attained had the described transactions occurred on the dates indicated above, or the results of the
	combined company that may be achieved in the future. The adjustments are based on currently available information and certain estimates and assumptions. Therefore, the actual results may differ from the pro forma results indicated herein. However,
	management believes that the assumptions provide a reasonable basis for presenting the significant effects of the transactions as contemplated and that the pro forma adjustments give appropriate effect to those assumptions and are properly applied
	in the unaudited pro forma consolidated combined financial statements.


	The unaudited pro forma consolidated combined financial statements
	are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to represent or be indicative of the consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial position of the combined company that would have been recorded had the Merger been
	completed as of the dates presented, and they should not be taken as representative of the expected future results of operations or financial position of the combined company. The unaudited pro forma consolidated combined financial statements do not
	reflect the impacts of any potential operational efficiencies, asset dispositions, cost savings or economies of scale that the combined company may achieve with respect to the operations of the combined company. Additionally, the unaudited pro forma
	consolidated combined statement of operations does not include

	non-recurring

	charges or credits, and the related tax effects, which result directly from the Merger.


	The unaudited pro forma consolidated combined financial statements have been derived from, and should be read in conjunction with,
	(i) the historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes of Magellan, as included in Magellans Quarterly Report on Form

	10-Q

	for the six months ended December 31, 2016 filed
	with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on February 9, 2016, (ii) the historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes of Magellan, as included in Magellans Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
	ended June 30, 2016 filed with the SEC on September 14, 2016 and (iii) the historical financial statements and accompanying notes of Tellurian Investments and Tellurian Services, as included in Item 9.01(a) of this report.

	Notes to the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Combined Financial Statements




	1. Basis of Presentation



	The unaudited
	pro forma consolidated combined balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 is based on the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of Magellan and the audited consolidated balance sheet of Tellurian Investments as adjusted to reflect the TOTAL Common
	Stock Investment and the Merger as though it had occurred on December 31, 2016.


	The unaudited pro forma consolidated combined
	statement of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 is based on Magellans historical books and records, Tellurian Investments audited consolidated statement of operations, and Tellurian Services audited
	statement of operations for the period from January 1, 2016 through April 9, 2016, with adjustments made to reflect the TOTAL Common Stock Investment and to present such historical operations as if the Merger had occurred on
	January 1, 2016.



	2. Pro Forma Adjustments



	The following adjustments were made in the preparation of the unaudited pro forma consolidated combined balance sheet and unaudited pro forma
	consolidated combined statements of operations:


	 




	(a)


	The fiscal year end of Magellan, which was June 30, has been conformed to the fiscal year end of Tellurian Investments, which is December 31, for the purpose of presenting pro forma consolidated combined
	financial statements, pursuant to Rule

	11-02(c)(3)

	of Regulation

	S-X,

	because the two fiscal years are separated by more than 93 days. In order to conform
	Magellans fiscal year end to that of Tellurian Investments, Magellans unaudited historical statements of operations presented in the unaudited consolidated combined pro forma financial statements have been derived from the accounting
	records of Magellan. No adjustments were required to conform Magellans audited historical consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016.




	 




	(b)


	Unless otherwise noted, adjustments to reflect the elimination of Magellans total equity, the estimated value of consideration to be paid in the Merger and to adjust, where required, the historical book values of
	Magellans assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2016 to the preliminary estimated fair value, in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting. The preliminary valuations were determined as of February 10, 2017 and, where
	applicable, are based on the closing share price of Magellan common stock on the final day of trading, February 9, 2017. The fair value of the consideration given and assets and liabilities acquired will be determined based on the underlying

	(c)


	Adjustments to reflect transaction fees directly related to the Merger that were not reflected in the historical financial statements. Legal and advisory costs are payable to Petrie Partners Securities, LLC
	(Petrie) in approximately 0.4 million shares as a success fee related to the Merger. As these costs are

	non-recurring

	in nature, they have only been reflected within the pro forma balance

	(d)


	Adjustments to reflect the recapitalization of Magellan upon closing of the Merger, after which, approximately 199.4 million shares of common stock with a par value of $0.01 per share will be outstanding. In
	accordance with the acquisition method of accounting, Tellurian Investments existing common stock and capital in excess of par value, including amounts presented for Tellurian Investments equity offerings, less the par value of the
	combined companys common stock outstanding subsequent to the Merger (excluding shares attributable to the Petrie success fee) will be reclassified to capital in excess of par value of the combined company. The effects of the 0.4 million
	shares attributable to the Petrie success fee have been adjusted for in footnote (c) above. Additionally, Tellurian Investments accumulated deficit and preferred stock will be carried forward to the accumulated deficit and preferred stock
	of the combined company subsequent to the Merger. A reconciliation of the pro forma adjustment to capital in excess of par of the combined company is included below.
