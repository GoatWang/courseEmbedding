Media, Materials, and More














        kWantera's Kyle O'Connor promoted to Chief Executive Officer
      

kWantera Inc., an energy technology company, today announced the promotion of Chief Commercial Officer Kyle O’Connor, 35, to the position of Chief Executive Officer, following Mark DeSantis, who stepped down as CEO. Mr. O’Connor will be responsible for driving kWantera’s growth trajectory and will lead the company’s ongoing product and commercialization journey. 
“The kWantera team is in great hands with Kyle given his extraordinary market orientation and expertise,” Mr. DeSantis stated. “I met Kyle in the spring of 2015 and I knew quickly that he had the ability to take this company to the next level.” 
“This is an exciting time for kWantera.  Our technology is helping more companies than ever make smarter energy choices.” said Mr. O’Connor. “Market deregulation has provided unprecedented transparency to electricity prices, but few tools to comprehend and capture the opportunity.  I’m proud to lead such a talented group of individuals committed to making a difference in the industry.”  
Mr. DeSantis stepped down as CEO in order to dedicate more time to the development of kWantix, LLC, an affiliate investment fund. Mr. DeSantis will continue to serve on the Boards of both kWantera and kWantix.
“We’re indebted to Mark for his tireless work ethic and passion for the company during the past nine years,” said Don Belt, Chairman of the Board of Directors. “We are equally excited that Mark will remain involved in kWantera’s future success.” 
ABOUT kWanterakWantera (www.kwantera.com) is a Pittsburgh-based company that uses advanced predictive analytics and machine learning to identify the optimal price, time and location at which to buy, sell or consume power in deregulated markets across North America and the world.

Mark DeSantis apparently is out at kWantera Inc., the Strip District-based provider of cost-saving energy management software and services that counts General Electric Co. as an investor.
According to the kWantera website, former GE executive Kyle O'Connor has taken the reins of the company as president and CEO. DeSantis, who led kWantera since 2008, is not included among 18 team members featured on its website.

DeSantis, O’Connor and CFO Matt Burlando did not respond to calls seeking comment. Donald Belt, chairman of kWantera's board, declined comment.




O’Connor joined kWantera last September as chief commercial officer, overseeing global sales, marketing, strategic partnerships and product development. He joined from GE (NYSE: GE), where he progressed through a series of business development posts, according to his LinkedIn profile, including managing director of commercial excellence.
GE invested$4.4 million in kWantera in late 2014, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In January 2015, Forbes ranked kWantera among its “10 Companies to Watch in Energy Analytics.”
DeSantis had a varied career prior to joining kWantera. He was an assistant to the late Sen. John Heinz, analyst in the administration of George H.W. Bush, director of government relations for Texas Instruments Inc. and ran for mayor of Pittsburgh as a Republican in 2007. He's also taught at Carnegie Mellon University since 1999.
