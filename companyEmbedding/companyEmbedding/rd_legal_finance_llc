RD Legal Funding, LLC, RD Legal Finance, LLC, and RD Legal Funding Partners, LP, and Roni Dersovitz




The Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the New York Attorney General filed a
lawsuit against RD Legal Funding, LLC, two related entities, and Roni
Dersovitz, the companies’ founder and owner, for allegedly scamming 9/11 heroes
out of money intended to cover medical costs, lost income, and other critical
needs. RD Legal also allegedly conned National Football League (NFL) concussion
victims. The CFPB and New York Attorney General allege that the illegal scheme
deceived 9/11 first responders with cancer and other illnesses and football
players with brain injuries out of millions of dollars by luring them into costly advances on
settlement payouts by lying about the terms of the deals. In the suit filed in federal court, the CFPB and
the New York Attorney General seek to put an end to the company’s illegal
practices, obtain relief for the victims, and impose penalties.Related documentsComplaint Press releaseCFPB and New York Attorney General Sue RD Legal for Scamming 9/11 Heroes Out of Millions of Dollars in Compensation Funds

About RD Legal Funding:
		A unique understanding of your financial needs

	RD Legal Funding was born out of the real world experiences of former litigator Roni Dersovitz. As a practicing plaintiff's attorney, Mr. Dersovitz realized that the key to his firm's success depended not only on how he handled his cases, but also on how he handled his cash. However, he found he was constantly facing cash flow issues that his bank did not understand and could not address with existing products.
    

	Mr. Dersovitz recognized that cash flow challenges were not unique to his practice. He founded RD Legal Funding in 1998, specifically to develop financial programs tailored to meet the needs of plantiff's contingency firms - beginning with the pioneering Fee Acceleration program. Later, a flexible and popular Attorney's Line of Credit product was introduced.
    

	Over more than a decade, our company has grown to become recognized as a nationwide leader in providing financial solutions to the legal industry. We have worked with firms of every size and financed virtually every type of case. RD Legal Funding offers:
    
Financial stability, reliable rates

	While banks and other lenders make it harder and more expensive to get funds, RD Legal Funding is actively financing law firms throughout the U.S. We are ready and able to provide the full funding amounts for which you qualify. Our clients rely on us for stable rates, easy-to-understand terms, and a simple, no-hassle application process.
    
Guidance to maximize success

    We work closely with our clients, providing them with not just funding, but also the knowledge to use it most effectively. Our legal financing experts can offer guidance on "smart leveraging" strategies to expand your caseloads and build your bottom line. For examples, see our Case Studies.
	
Easy, fast application process

    Unlike many legal funding firms, we offer a high level of transparency in our programs and fees. Our application process is fast and hassle-free. Our helpful staff is always happy to answer any questions and quickly respond to any needs. We are proud that clients frequently state that our hands-on service far exceeds what they have experienced with other lenders.

Fee Acceleration Case Study


Fee Acceleration leads to $20 million in new profit opportunities

This client originally came to us because its bank credit line of $100,000 was insufficient to support its case development costs and expansion plans. The firm's bank dealt with trial lawyers only through its executive/professional department, and therefore would provide loans based solely on our client's personal financial strength.

Dramatic growth

The client wanted additional funding to diversify the practice from motor vehicle accident claims into larger, more complex litigation, with a focus on cases involving the diet drug fenfluramine, one half of the Fen-Phen arena. We provided a credit line of $650,000, $500,000 of which was used for advertising. Within a few months, this dramatically increased the firm's caseload from approximately 1,800 to 2,600, including 500 new diet drug cases.

Reinvesting in advertising

While, ultimately, financial results from the diet drug litigation were disappointing, the Fen-Phen national settlement agreement allowed our client to obtain financing through our Fee Acceleration program. This was reinvested in advertising for claims related to damage from the drug Zyprexa, used to treat types of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.


The Zyprexa cases turned out to be extremely successful, generating fees in excess of $6 million. However, the firm would not be able to receive these funds for approximately one year. This put the firm in a cash shortfall position. Rather than wait, the client once again accessed the Fee Acceleration program. We advanced the $6 million, which the firm immediately reinvested into advertising to generate more Zyprexa cases.

The bottom line:

Though the law firm was effectively out of investible cash, it was still able to bring in new cases through Fee Acceleration financing. The result was an additional $12 million in fees. Continuing with this strategy, the firm has built a large inventory of cases related to other prescription drug product liability claims. In total, our client has recognized at least $20 million in fees that would have been unavailable without the financial power of our Fee Acceleration.

Cyber Security, FACTA, & Litigation Funding


 Cyber Security and identity theft are arguably the biggest issues in the world today. Someone’s entire life can be destroyed if their identity is stolen. A person who has their identity stolen can suffer immediate and future ramifications if the matter isn’t handled in a timely manner. It is why we have antivirus software to protect our devices and also why we only shop on websites where the sensitive information we input is secure. As information moved into the digital world, this new kind of security became a necessity. New industries have been created to try to prevent identity theft and catch the individuals engaged in that type of criminal activity. As the internet became a bigger part of how the world works, best practices have been established for consumers and businesses engaged in commerce online.
Some of these steps for consumers include browsing and shopping on safe and secure websites. For businesses, it is protecting their customers’ information when transactions take place. However, recent news stories reported the women’s clothing company Donna Karan fighting its customers over alleged violations of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act. (FACTA) FACTA is an act that contains provisions to assist in the reduction of identity theft. The act enables consumers to take preventative measures to guard their identity. Recently, Law 360 reported Donna Karan is appealing to the Supreme Court about a lawsuit filed by their customers over their alleged lack of diligence allowing full credit card numbers to be displayed on receipts. That mistake can cause severe damage to someone in the wrong hands. The other issue in this matter regarding FACTA could be the culpability of the business and what it may mean for them in terms of lawsuits.
“Consumers have the ability to file litigation against companies that are irresponsible with their personal information” says Roni Dersovitz, Founder of RD Legal Funding. “Litigation Funding allows plaintiffs to pursue lawsuits against well-capitalized defendants that have the ability to overwhelm them in a court of law.”
Huge retailers are currently or have been in litigation for this very issue. Target, Walmart, and others have been sued for reckless endangering their customers’ personal financial information. As the world continues to become digitized, companies may be more susceptible to the possibility of lawsuits from their customers should they not properly protect their sensitive financial information.

The Ohio Innocence Project Receives $15 Million


 The much heralded work done by those in the Ohio Innocence Project received a huge donation in the form of $15 million. The benefactor making this huge donation is Richard “Dick” Rosenthal. Rosenthal and his wife were longtime philanthropists who supported the mission of the organization which is to free every innocent person in Ohio. The Ohio Innocence Project is housed in the University of Cincinnati College of Law at the Lois and Richard Rosenthal Institute for Justice. The Innocence Project has helped free innocent people throughout the country from prison who were falsely accused of crimes by the justice system. They have helped prove the innocence and secure the release of people on death row, rape, and a whole set of other crimes. According to the news reports, it is the biggest donation an innocence project has received to date. Representatives from the organization have said the money will go a long way towards helping them in their mission. According to the University of Cincinnati College of Law, the organization has secured the release of 24 people from prison for crimes they have not committed. It is the only law school based innocence project. While Richard’s wife Lois died, it seems Richard is pushing to uphold the mission of the organization.

Four Car Companies Reach Settlement on Takata Air Bags


 After Japanese automaker Takata pleaded guilty for concealing deadly air bags that killed over ten people, four major car companies have also agreed to pay over $500 million to resolve claims related to exploding air bags in their vehicles. Toyota, Subaru, BMW, and Mazda will contribute the money to help fix the vehicles of people affected in the settlement. If the settlement is finalized later this year, the plaintiffs are going to receive $500 in compensation, a loaner car while the exploding air bags are removed from their cars, and related expenses will be covered under the settlement program. That comes on top of the reported $1 billion Takata has agreed to pay which will compensate automakers, victims and their families, and pay a criminal fine.
According to various news reports, the Takata air bags would explode with too much force sending lethal shrapnel to the drivers and passengers of the vehicle. Once the issue was discovered, there was a massive recall of the air bags which affected an estimated 42 million vehicles. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) published a list of cars that were effected by the Takata air bag scandal. Earlier this month, Senator Bill Nelson from Florida cited a report stating two-thirds of the vehicles with the defective airbags have not been fixed yet. He attributed the delay on fixing the effected vehicles on the lack of staff at the NHTSA due to President Donald Trump’s inability to fill positions at the agency. According to the Senator with summer arriving in a few weeks, it is imperative that the airbag issue gets resolved because more people drive in the summer months.

RD Legal Funding Joins Other Companies Challenging CFPB’s Authority, Seeks To Dismiss Lawsuit


 RD Legal Funding, LLC (RD Legal) and its affiliated companies recently filed a motion to dismiss the joint lawsuit by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the New York State Attorney General’s office (NYAG). The motion seeks the dismissal of the complaint based on, among other things, the unconstitutional structure of the CFPB; the overreach by the CFPB in its attempt to regulate transactions over which it has no jurisdiction; and the improper characterization of RD Legal’s transactions as loans rather than true sales transactions.
During the course of the last several months, multiple media outlets have reported how other companies are pushing back against the CFPB’s overreaching as well as challenging the agency’s unconstitutional structure. In addition to RD Legal, Ocwen Financial Corporation, PHH Corporation, Pathfinder Payment Solutions, Prime Market Holdings, the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges for Schools, and the State National Bank of Big Spring have challenged the CFPB’s overreaching. These companies have also argued the agency over stepped their authority, disregarded the law, and distorted the facts.  The U.S. Department of Justice has also argued that the CFPB’s structure is unconstitutional.

United States Insurance Companies Seeking Justice Against Saudia Arabia & Bin Laden Family Companies


Some insurance companies in the United States are pursuing lawsuits against entities in Saudia Arabia and Bin Laden family controlled companies due to the attacks in the United States that took place on September 11th. The Justice Against Terrorism Act (JASTA) passed in 2016, allowed for this kind of litigation to take place. The insurance companies are seeking over $4 billion in damages and compensation from the defendants. The plaintiffs, who are insurance companies, paid policyholders who suffered personal, business, and property injuries due to the attacks. The direct attacks took place in New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington DC. Of course, there were lingering effects people dealt with that insurance companies ended having to cover.
JASTA was a highly contentious piece of legislation that was debated among the legislators, lobbyists, and advocates on both sides. Some critics of the bill argued that national security was at risk should it pass. They said it would leave U.S. military forces open to litigation from foreign citizens and foreign entities. Supporters of the bill argued that the scope was narrow enough in that they were targeting companies and entities that had something or allowed certain transactions which led to the September 11th attacks. The legislation passed and President Obama vetoed it. Congress then overturned it. The bill became law. While there are plans for the families of the victims to pursue litigation, this lawsuit by the insurance companies is the first since JASTA passed. Osama Bin Laden and his Al Qaeda network were behind the September 11th attacks and many of the effected entities are trying to hold his family responsible. They accuse them of facilitating and helping Osama while he was plotting against the United States. So that is why they are going after the Bin Laden family companies.

Former Employees of Montana University To Receive Compensation Over Medical Insurance Claims


 Former employees who worked for Montana University are set to receive compensation due to a settlement the class of plaintiffs reached with the university. The plaintiffs alleged they were denied medical insurance claims due to a clause the university had in its contract that conflicted with Montana state law. Montana University operated their own health insurance program. Montana has a “made whole” statute that says the person injured has taken care of before the insurance companies hammer out which one is responsible for paying for the treatment. Montana University’s clause stated they were not responsible for paying if another insurance policy was available. As a result, many of the employees who found themselves paying out of pocket for treatment that should have been paid by the university. A group of former employees got together and filed a lawsuit against the university. A settlement was reached where the university will begin compensating the plaintiffs. The university also removed the clause prohibiting spending on their employees. Some news reports state compensation can run from a couple of hundred to $120,000 to some plaintiffs. In December, a hearing has been scheduled to follow up on the compensation proceedings. An estimated 45,000 people may be eligible for compensation.

Inflation, Annuities, Settled Case Fees, Settled Case Awards & Taxes


 Inflation 
The issue of inflation is very important to a settled case award or settled case fee because the purchasing power of either is part of the evaluation of the overall settlement. If there happens to be a settlement that takes place in 2017 and the settled case fee or award is deemed to be $1 million, but it won’t be paid until 2027 that can be a real problem. The uncertainty of the economy in 10 years could have drastic results for the recipients. That 10 year gap between being awarded and actually receiving the fee leaves it susceptible to rising interest rates. Rising interest rates decrease the purchasing power of that $1 million which could lead to a plaintiff or their attorney to determine the settlement as not acceptable. If interest rates rise a percentage or two, that will reduce the amount of money expected.
Settled Case Awards With Annuity Type Payments (Structured Settlements)
Situations where a settlement occurs and the plaintiffs decide to to defer receiving the entire award at once and receive periodic payments over time periodic payments that is a structured settlement. Some of the reasons why a plaintiff would decide to use this option include tax liability, financial stability, and time value of money. A plaintiff may leave themselves exposed to a higher tax rate when they take their award. The plaintiff may already be financially stable and may not need the money until a specific time in the future.
Structured Attorney Fees 
When an attorney gets their fee after a settlement, successful verdict or judgment they have the option to choose to take their fee upfront, where they will be taxed at a higher rate by the government. There are options plaintiffs’ attorneys have where they can structure the fee and invest their fee into different products where they can earn more on their potential investment. Companies like MetLife, Millennium Settlement Consulting, and Pacific Life offer plaintiffs’ attorneys the ability to structure their fees. Some of the benefits for structuring their fees include reducing tax exposure, setting up retirement income, structured income over a period of time instead of a lump sum.
Taxes 
Once a plaintiff receives their settlement after attorney fees have been taken out, the medical costs have been paid, there is only one entity left to get their pay and that is the United States government through the Internal Revenue Service. (IRS) According to the IRS’website a plaintiff does not have to pay taxes if they have not deducted medical expenses in the prior years if the proceeds are from a personal injury lawsuit. In an employment law settlement, the proceeds connected to lost wages are subject to regular wage taxes, social security, and medicare rates in that year. Punitive damages from a settlement are treated as Other Income.
Advice: One should consult with a tax adviser after receiving settlement proceeds to get the best advice.

Former Students Settle With Trump University for $25 Million


 According to various news reports, a federal judge gave final approval to a $25 million settlement agreement former students reached with Trump University. The students, who attended the school to receive specialized education in real estate, accused the university of fraud. Some students allegedly paid between $1,000 to $35,000 to attend classes. They were promised the opportunity to learn the secrets of getting rich in real estate. In addition, the ability to access private financing options. The students said both turned out not to be true. They say they were deceived by the promises of Trump University and were pressured by officials at the school to buy and elevate their package causing them to pay more money.
During the 2016 presidential election, then candidate Donald Trump vowed to keep fighting the lawsuit even insulting the plaintiffs. Days after the election, the trial was set to commence. Instead a settlement between the plaintiffs and the university had been announced. Preliminary approval was given in December and final approval was rendered by a federal judge of the settlement. Trump University and Donald Trump did not admit guilt. The specifics of the settlement include $21 million for the estimated plaintiffs to split among themselves. Most observers expect the plaintiffs will receive at least half of what they spent if they aren’t made whole. $4 million will go to the settle the New York State lawsuits against the university. The plaintiff attorneys’ who litigated the case graciously decided not to take their fees and absorb the costs of pursuing the case.

From Hallucinations to Heart Problems: The Effects of Concerta and Its Generic Equivalents


On October 18, 2016, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proposed withdrawing two generic versions of Concerta. The FDA ran tests on both drugs and it was determined they had insufficient effects on patients. The drug, Concerta, is alleged to have a number of side effects on people who take it including suicide, agitation, convulsions, disturbed sleep, hallucinations, hostility, stroke, anxiety, depression, drug addiction/abuse, heart issues, mania, and psychosis. The two drug manufacturers are Kremers Urban (subsidiary of the Lannett Company), and Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals, which were both given opportunities to request a hearing by the FDA to show why their drugs shouldn’t be withdrawn. Ordinarily, a move like this from the FDA would lead to a flurry of lawsuits.
Patients cannot sue the manufacturers relating to efficacy or labeling of the drug. Also, because they are generic manufacturers, the companies cannot change the formula or labels on their own even if new information about safety and side effects are discovered. The United States Supreme Court upheld this idea in a 5 to 4 decision that overturned a New Hampshire jury verdict; the verdict awarded over $20 million to a woman who took a generic version of a drug. Generic drugs exist to help consumers save money on buying drugs they need to treat illnesses. According to the Congressional Budget Office, generic drugs help consumers save an estimated $8 to $10 billion at retail pharmacies. Institutions like hospitals and clinics save billions when they use generic drugs.
According to the FDA, a generic drug is developed under patent protection when it is first created. This gives the company the sole right to sell the drug while the patent is in effect, essentially giving it a monopoly on the market. Once the patent wears off, generics can enter the market submitting their new drug application for approval. The Orange Book provides a way to look up generic versions of brand name drugs. Concerta is manufactured by Janssen (subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson). It is used to treat Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD).

Link Between Ovarian Cancer and Talc-Based Cosmetic Products


Within the past couple of years, lawsuits have been filed against companies like Johnson & Johnson in regards to products containing talcum powder. Research has shown that talcum powder is an unsafe sterilizing agent that can lead to ovarian cancer in women who use products like Johnson & Johnson’s Baby Powder around their genital area. While Johnson & Johnson’s talc-based powder is labeled as Baby Powder, they market their product for women’s use too.
Studies have been conducted since the 1980s on the negative side effects of talcum powder use in the female genital area, but Johnson & Johnson never informed their consumers about the risk of using their products containing the powder because the results were inconclusive; there was no grounding evidence to support the link between ovarian cancer and talcum powder (though past and recent claims would suggest otherwise).
What exactly is talcum powder?
According to The American Cancer society, talc powder is essentially a mineral comprised of magnesium, silicon, and oxygen. It can be used as a sterilizing agent, and is the first named ingredient in Johnson & Johnson’s Baby Powder.
Where is the link between ovarian cancer and talcum powder?
Women who use talc-based products like Johnson & Johnson’s Baby Powder for feminine hygiene are at risk of forming ovarian cancer due to talc particles getting trapped in their ovarian tissues. Trapped talc particles would eventually cause inflammation in the ovaries and lead to the development of cancerous ovarian cell growth.
A woman from Texas filed a complaint in mid-August alleging that the consistent use of Johnson & Johnson’s Baby Powder caused the death of her daughter, Janel Kuntz. She was diagnosed with ovarian cancer at 43 years old, and was apparently using Johnson & Johnson’s Baby Powder product for at least 23 years. She was unaware of the health complications talc powder has on females who use it to keep their lady parts “fresh” as the powder absorbs moisture and eliminates odor.
But Janel Kuntz was not the first woman to be diagnosed with ovarian cancer due to using Johnson & Johnson’s Baby Powder. The first talcum powder lawsuit filed against Johnson & Johnson was in 2009 by a woman named Diane Berg. And in 2013, Jackie Fox filed a talcum powder lawsuit against Johnson & Johnson. Unfortunately Ms. Fox passed away in 2015 due to ovarian cancer, but the pharmaceutical company was found liable and paid out $72 million to Ms. Fox’s son after her death.
Berg, Kuntz, and Fox are only a few among many women who have filed lawsuits against Johnson & Johnson for their unsafe talc-based powder products. The growing number of talcum powder lawsuits being filed against Johnson & Johnson has sparked “a group of plaintiffs” to file a motion with the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) to consolidate all claims as part of a multi-district ligtigation (MDL).

RD LEGAL FUNDING, LLC FEE’S ACCELERATION PRODUCT HELPS PLAINTIFFS AND PLAINTIFFS’ ATTORNEYS CASH IN NOW
 Mar 18, 2016

 For 19 years, RD Legal Funding, LLC (“RD Legal”) has been helping plaintiffs and their attorneys access capital through their Fee Acceleration product and they are reaffirming their commitment to both communities. RD Legal has provided and will continue to provide assistance to plaintiffs and plaintiff attorneys experiencing payment delays on their settled cases. For plaintiffs’ attorneys that funding can be used for a variety of reasons, including reinvesting in their practice, advertising for new cases, continued financing on existing cases, or expanding their office. For plaintiffs, our funding can be used for a variety of reasons including personal and medical expenses. RD Legal’s Fee Acceleration product was designed by the founder of RD Legal Funding, Roni Dersovitz. As a former litigator, Dersovitz intimately understood the problems plaintiffs’ attorneys and their clients have or can deal with while practicing and intuitively designed the product to their advantage.
“Plaintiffs’ attorneys only survive by a steady cash flow, so when their fees are delayed it can become detrimental to them. I want to see the attorney cash in,” says Dersovitz. “After a settlement is reached plaintiffs may have to wait an extended period of time before they receive compensation, we are able to help them as well.”
A majority of companies in the lawsuit funding space are focused on commercial litigation or pre-settlement funding. RD Legal is an originator of post-settlement funding and remains solely dedicated to it today. With decades of experience working with a variety of cases, they can operate without the restrictions that newer and less experienced companies can sometimes have.
“Many of the companies in the legal funding space can only provide small dollars to a plaintiff or plaintiffs’ attorney who typically needs more than what they can offer. That isn’t a problem at RD Legal, our starting point is $20,000 and it can go over $20 million,” says Dersovitz.

CFPB/NY AG lawsuit against RD Legal Funding may signal greater scrutiny of non-loan financial products such as merchant cash advances

	The CFPB and the New York Attorney General this week filed an action against RD Legal Funding, LLC, two of its affiliates, and their principal (collectively, “RD”), alleging that a litigation settlement advance product offered by RD is a disguised usurious loan that is deceptively marketed and abusive.  In particular, the Complaint alleges that the transactions were falsely marketed as assignments rather than loans, that the transactions violate New York usury laws, and that RD misrepresented when the funding would be provided and falsely claimed that it could “expedite funding and ‘cut through red tape’” associated with the settlements being financed.  The Complaint alleges that the transactions could not be assignments because the underlying settlements expressly prohibit assignment of claimant recoveries.

	In the Complaint, both the CFPB and the AG allege several deception claims and an abusiveness claim under Sections 1031 and 1042 of Dodd-Frank.  The AG also alleges state law claims for civil and criminal usury, fraud, and violation of NY UDAP statutes.  Notably, one of the deception claims alleged by the CFPB is predicated on alleged state usury law violations, implicating one of several issues involved in the pending CashCall appeal.

	The CFPB and the AG issued press releases and prepared remarks trumpeting the RD Legal Funding action as a defense of 9/11 heroes and NFL concussion victims who were “scammed” through “convoluted contracts.”  The public statements also focus on the cost of the financing, providing examples such as a 9/11 first responder who paid $15,000 on an advance of $18,000 when the settlement funds ultimately were received six months after the advance was made.

	Before the lawsuit was filed, on January 4 of this year, two of the RD entities filed separate preemptive actions for declaratory and injunctive relief against the CFPB and the AG.  Among other things, these complaints challenge the CFPB’s jurisdiction over RD and the propriety of the AG’s threatened enforcement activity on the basis that RD does not extend credit, but rather engages in bona fide purchases of receivables.  The complaints quote extensively from the relevant agreements, including the assignment provisions and non-recourse language, neither of which appear to be “convoluted” as the CFPB and AG allege.  The complaint against the CFPB also attaches a prior Civil Investigative Demand served on RD.

	While the action filed this week may have been driven primarily by the sympathetic facts alleged in the Complaint, it may foreshadow a broader enforcement effort by the CFPB, state Attorneys General, and other state regulators directed at litigation funding companies, merchant cash advance providers, and other finance companies whose products are structured as purchases rather than loans.  (While the CFPB’s jurisdiction over small business finance is limited, this is not true of other enforcement authorities, such as state AGs.)  Notably, the CFPB previously has taken action against structured settlement and pension advance companies, in the former case leading to a jurisdictional challenge supported by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.  It therefore is critical for all players in this space to revisit true sale compliance, both in the language of their agreements and in the company’s actual practices.

Litigation finance 101










What is litigation finance?

At its most basic level, litigation finance (also called litigation funding) is the practice where a third party unrelated to the lawsuit provides capital to a plaintiff involved in litigation in return for a portion of any financial recovery from the lawsuit.
Litigation finance unlocks the value of legal claims by providing capital to plaintiffs before their cases are resolved. This type of financing has existed for more than 20 years and is increasingly becoming a mainstream funding solution that helps equalize access to the legal system. Fortune 500 companies, major universities and businesses of all sizes have benefited from litigation funding.
The capital provided by monetizing a legal claim may directly pay for some of the costs of litigation, including attorneys’ fees, expert witness fees and court expenses. Litigation finance may be used to fund working capital for companies involved in litigation or even help business owners pay for personal expenses.







Unequal access to the legal system

In much of the world, access to justice requires abundant capital because litigation is expensive.  Many factors contribute to the cost of litigation: attorney fees, research, depositions, interrogatories, motions, conferences, witness preparation, trials, subpoenas, appeals, as well as expenses associated with court fees, consultants, and investigations.
All too often litigants who seek justice are unable to pursue their claims due to the high costs associated with lawsuits. Many plaintiffs who have a compelling case will choose to defer or ultimately abandon legal recourse. A great imbalance of resources exists between average and wealthy litigants, creating impediments to judicial access and a distortion of legal outcomes for the undercapitalized.  







Parties involved in litigation finance

Generally, there are three principal participants in litigation funding – plaintiffs, investors and attorneys.

Plaintiffs

Plaintiffs are individuals or companies involved in commercial lawsuits that need to fund litigation expenses, working capital 
or personal expenses. For more information about how LexShares benefits plaintiffs click here.

Investors

Investing in legal claims creates a new asset class out of disputes, allowing investors to purchase portions of future proceeds from litigation for an upfront cash payment. LexShares' model helps connect accredited investors with pre-vetted investment opportunities. For more information about how LexShares' model enables investment in legal claims click here.

Attorneys and Law Firms

Attorneys facilitate the case evaluation process by providing investors with information about claims. In most funding transactions, attorneys serve as custodians of funds for all of the lawsuit’s stakeholders and upon resolution distribute those funds to them. For more information about how LexShares benefits attorneys and law firms click here.







Litigation finance and the justice system

As justice systems around the world seek to facilitate access to courts, litigation finance is increasingly viewed as a critical 
tool for equalizing access and preventing distorted outcomes that favor wealthy litigants.
Litigation finance improves the legal system by filtering out frivolous cases. Investors will not take on the risk of investing in 
these types of claims due to their lack of economic value.
In addition, litigation finance can have the effect of encouraging settlement by depriving wealthy defendants of an unfair advantage. Even when cases do proceed in court, the process becomes more streamlined because delay tactics no longer have their intended effect against the plaintiff. This helps plaintiffs and attorneys achieve recoveries which are more closely aligned with the case merits and nature of their damages.







Litigation finance offers a number of benefits

Litigation finance offers a number of important benefits to plaintiffs, attorneys and investors.
Plaintiffs

Helps undercapitalized plaintiffs further meritorious cases by financing litigation expenses 
Provides capital injections for already filed cases that experience funding constraints 
Reduces the risk of premature settlement for less than cases are worth 
Unlocks liquidity for working capital 
Provides  a cushion for personal expenses 
Allows companies to manage how litigation costs affect their balance sheets 
Enables greater access to top legal talent

Attorneys and Law Firms

Allows attorneys to accept cases from plaintiffs who otherwise could not afford their fees 
Provides capital for all litigation expenses, including expert witness fees 
Reduces the risk that clients will run out of money during litigation 
Enables attorneys to offer more flexible payment arrangements to prospective clients 
Increases plaintiffs’ effectiveness by providing funding for working capital and personal expenses 
Helps achieve recoveries that are more in line with case merits and damages 

Investors

Access to new asset class 
Investments in legal claims are uncorrelated to capital markets 
Outsized historical returns compared with other alternative asset classes 
Moderate time to liquidity versus other alternative investments 








Attorneys and litigation finance

Most states have issued bar ethics opinions that permit litigation finance transactions, provided attorneys fulfill 
certain disclosure requirements and avoid conflicts of interest. For example, attorneys are allowed to share information 
about cases with investors after receiving the client’s consent. Moreover, they are allowed to honor a client’s written 
assignment or lien for a portion of the proceeds from a recovery. The New York City Bar Association has recently recognized 
the growth of litigation funding and commented that it is a "valuable means for paying the costs of pursuing a legal claim.” 
So far, twenty-nine jurisdictions have issued ethics opinions relating to litigation finance. We have included ethics opinions from several states below.


California Bar


Florida Bar


Illinois Bar


Los Angeles County Bar


New York State Bar 1994


New York State Bar 2003


New York City Bar 2011









Legal doctrines relating to litigation finance

LexShares respects the legal issues and ethical considerations relating to investments in lawsuits. Several legal doctrines 
are frequently mentioned when discussing litigation finance in the United States. They include the doctrines of maintenance, 
champerty, and barratry, as well as attorney-client privilege and work product immunity. 
Maintenance, Champerty and Barratry
Maintenance involves an arrangement where a party supports another to enable him or her to further a legal claim. Champerty 
is a specific form of maintenance, where an unrelated party strikes a bargain with a litigant to financially support the 
litigation in return for a share of the proceeds from that claim. Finally, barratry entails the encouragement of another to 
bring or continue a claim.
These three medieval English doctrines historically prohibited third-party financing of lawsuits in the United States and most 
other common law countries. Today, the modern view is to permit maintenance, champerty and barratry as these doctrines are 
predominantly viewed by the courts as obsolete.
In medieval England, maintenance and champerty was used by the powerful as a means of settling scores. Feudal lords and other 
privileged members of society would often support legal disputes of others against the supporter’s personal or political enemy. 
Most colonies that imported their laws from England – including many U.S. states – passed laws designed to protect litigants 
from “officious intermeddling” and profiteering from the sale of legal claims to third parties.
Over time, as other means of controlling abuses of the legal system became more effective, the need for the prohibitions on 
maintenance, champerty and barratry became obsolete. The American civil justice system increasingly recognized that access to 
justice depends upon the broad availability of legal representation for all socioeconomic levels. The public policy for 
increasing access to the legal system for those that could least afford it overrode the concerns underlying these doctrines in many states.
According to the modern view, widespread exceptions to these doctrines recognize that financial considerations often 
influence access to justice. Most states now permit maintenance, champerty and barratry as they refuse to void contracts based 
on these outdated doctrines.
Attorney-Client Privilege and Attorney Work Product Immunity
The attorney-client privilege is a legal concept that protects certain communications between attorney and client from disclosure to the opposition. In addition, the work-product immunity protects materials prepared by attorneys and third parties in anticipation of litigation from discovery. These two concepts are actually two separate legal doctrines but frequently cited together.
Recent cases support the view that litigation finance transactions preserve the protections afforded by both doctrines. In Mondis Technology, Ltd., v. LG Electronics, Inc., 2011 WL 1714304 (E.D. Tex.) a court refused to compel production of documents provided to investors. More recently, in Devon IT, Inc., v. IBM Corp., 2012 WL 4748160 (E.D. Pa.), a court held that discussions with litigation
investors are covered by the work-product doctrine. The judge in that case explained that since the investors and Devon shared a 
"common interest" in the outcome of the case and had entered into the confidentiality agreement, their communications were protected.
In a practical sense, issues regarding the waiver of the attorney-client privilege apply to only a small class of information. The 
privilege clearly applies only to communications between a client and the attorney, not just any communication about the lawsuit. 
The client is free to tell a prospective funder anything other than what the client communicated to the attorney, without waiving 
the privilege. An investor can expect to receive substantial information from the plaintiff about the claim without ever creating 
waiver problems.
LexShares' managing member and broker dealer, WealthForge, can evaluate the merits of cases without access to privileged information. The case evaluation process generally focuses on the legal team’s assessment of the case as well as documents that are already subject to discovery.







Additional resources

With litigation finance becoming more pervasive, a growing number of legal scholars have drawn attention to important considerations in this field. We have included the most notable materials below.
