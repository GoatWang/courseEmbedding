History[edit]
Wilmington Trust was founded on July 8, 1903, by T. Coleman du Pont, then the president of DuPont, to manage the growing fortune of the duPont family.[2] DuPont opened the business in the dining room and parlor of a former private residence at 915 Market Street in Wilmington, Delaware, with a handful of investors and $500,000 in market capitalization.[3]
In 1907, the company moved to the DuPont Building at Tenth & Market Streets. It paid its first dividend (2.5%, $1.25 per share) on August 1, 1908. The company’s first merger occurred on July 15, 1912: the acquisitions of the First National Bank and the National Bank of Wilmington and Brandywine made it the largest bank on the East Coast. In 1971, it became one of the founding members of NASDAQ.[3] In 1999, it moved its listing to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).[3]
On November 1, 2010, Wilmington Trust announced a merger with M&T Bank, of Buffalo, New York. The deal valued the 107-year-old company at $3.84 a share, or 46 percent less than its closing price on Oct. 29. Investors received 0.051 shares of Buffalo-based M&T for each Wilmington share.[4]
In 2011, it announced its intention to "voluntarily de-list" from the NYSE upon completion of its merger with M&T Bank.[3]
Wilmington Trust is one of the largest holders of fiduciary assets in the United States.[5]

History[edit]
Wilmington Trust was founded on July 8, 1903, by T. Coleman du Pont, then the president of DuPont, to manage the growing fortune of the duPont family.[2] DuPont opened the business in the dining room and parlor of a former private residence at 915 Market Street in Wilmington, Delaware, with a handful of investors and $500,000 in market capitalization.[3]
In 1907, the company moved to the DuPont Building at Tenth & Market Streets. It paid its first dividend (2.5%, $1.25 per share) on August 1, 1908. The company’s first merger occurred on July 15, 1912: the acquisitions of the First National Bank and the National Bank of Wilmington and Brandywine made it the largest bank on the East Coast. In 1971, it became one of the founding members of NASDAQ.[3] In 1999, it moved its listing to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).[3]
On November 1, 2010, Wilmington Trust announced a merger with M&T Bank, of Buffalo, New York. The deal valued the 107-year-old company at $3.84 a share, or 46 percent less than its closing price on Oct. 29. Investors received 0.051 shares of Buffalo-based M&T for each Wilmington share.[4]
In 2011, it announced its intention to "voluntarily de-list" from the NYSE upon completion of its merger with M&T Bank.[3]
Wilmington Trust is one of the largest holders of fiduciary assets in the United States.[5]
Offices[edit]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Is a Limited Liability Company Right for You?

 









There are many ways to structure your company, and an LLC may offer the features and benefits you need.

An LLC is a legal entity regulated by law, and must be registered with the Department of State in which it’s established.
Instead of owning stock, each member owns an interest in the LLC, much like a partnership.
LLCs offer flexibility in the structure of the company’s members, potential tax advantages, and the ability to minimize the personal risk and liability of the company’s owners.

Once you have decided to go into business with someone (or several people), the next decision you must make is how to structure your new company. A Limited Liability Company (LLC) may offer you some benefits. LLCs are widely accepted as a means of structuring a business.
What is an LLC?
Is an LLC a partnership? Yes and no. The LLC is formed when the owners, or members of the company, enter into an Operating Agreement. For the LLC to be recognized by the state, like a corporation or partnership, the LLC must be registered with the Department of State. In this way, the LLC is more than just a handshake; it is a legal entity and, as such, is regulated by law. Following are general characteristics governing LLCs:

A creditor may only reach a member’s interest in the LLC by means of a charging order, as determined by state law, regardless of whether the member is the manager of the LLC. Likewise, an LLC’s creditor may only reach assets of the LLC and not those of the member
The LLC may be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes when it is owned by two or more members. Should the LLC elect to be taxed as a partnership, transferability of the membership interests may be affected
Control of the LLC may be retained by a select few by utilizing different classes of voting interests among the members

Interests in the LLC can be transferred at discounted values, much like Family Limited Partnerships, thereby saving estate and gift taxes.
Generally, the owners of the LLC are referred to as “members of the company,” rather than as “partners.” Instead of owning stock, each member owns an interest in the LLC, much like a partnership. Most states require that at least two members enter into an operating agreement that dictates the structure of the LLC. An LLC has no restrictions on the number of members who hold an interest in the company or where the members live.
How do they differ from general partnerships?
One major difference between general partnerships and LLCs is the exposure to risk and liability. In general partnerships, each partner has a personal and unrestricted liability for the debts and obligations of the partnership. With an LLC, each member is liable only to the extent of what he or she has put into the company (the capital contributed). In this way, the members of the LLC enjoy the benefit of limited liability for the LLC’s debts. Furthermore, because the LLC is taxed as a partnership, members are ensured that most of the profits are paid to them at their individual tax rates.
When to use an LLC
There are a myriad of uses for Limited Liability Companies and they can be utilized for a vast number of transactions. For instance, the LLC may be used as a means to raise funds, whether it is to fund a research project, or to attract investors for the development of a new tech company. Using an LLC for such purposes is attractive since it would provide limited liability for the investors while providing special allocations of research and development deductions and credits. An LLC could also afford the structuring of preferred returns to the investors. LLCs can also be used as vehicles for a leveraged buy-out, or to serve as a general partner in a limited partnership. LLCs offer tax advantages as well. LLCs can be taxed either as a corporation, or as a partnership. Choosing to be taxed as a partnership can avoid the double taxation that occurs with a “C” Corporation.
Potential downside of using an LLC
While LLCs offer significant advantages over general partnerships, there are potential pitfalls to consider. For example, while LLCs are recognized in all 50 states, each state has adopted different LLC statutes, thereby creating potential confusion when conflicts arise over which state’s laws apply. This lack of uniformity does not exist with partnerships, which are governed by the Uniform Limited Partnership Act.
Despite this potential downside, the Limited Liability Company offers flexibility in the structure of the company’s members, potential tax advantages, and the ability to minimize the personal risk and liability of the company’s owners.

As we have argued for quite some time, the slowdown is fully expected given the tightening of the labor market and lack of available workers.
