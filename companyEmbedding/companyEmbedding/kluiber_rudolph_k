INVESTING WITH -- Rudolph K. Kluiber; State Street Research Aurora Fund

By CAROLE GOULDOCT. 31, 1999

FOR managers of most small-capitalization value funds, it has been a brutal few years. But Rudolph K. Kluiber, portfolio manager of the $393.2 million State Street Research Aurora Fund, has had little trouble maintaining an upbeat attitude, even as investors have shunned the kinds of stocks he likes and flocked to large growth equities.''We don't believe the negativity on our stocks is warranted,'' he said from his office, overlooking Boston Harbor. ''Or it's already built into the price of the stock. And we think good things will help propel the stock prices upward in the future.''Then again, looking at his fund's performance, you would expect Mr. Kluiber (pronounced KLOO-Ber) to fairly radiate optimism. Aurora returned 14.7 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Oct. 22, compared with 6.4 percent for its small-value peers, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher. (That compares with 24.9 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500 Index over that period, with dividends reinvested weekly.)Aurora returned 23 percent in the 12 months through Oct. 22, more than double its peer group's 5.5 percent return, Morningstar said. (The S. & P. 500 Index returned 22.3 percent annually over that time.)

Unlike many money managers, Mr. Kluiber, 40, doesn't rely on computer programs to identify his small-cap picks. He reads a lot of quarterly 10-Q's, annual reports, Wall Street research and the usual range of business periodicals like Forbes and Business Week. And he listens to investment ideas floated by the two analysts working on the fund as well as the 24 stock analysts employed by State Street Research and Management, among others. He's the first to admit that his selection contains no neat formulaic discipline. ''It's a constant peeling of the onion,'' he said, ''an iterative process.'' Continue reading the main story

There are a number of ways, Mr. Kluiber said, in which companies can increase shareholder value: new products, new management, revampings, mergers or acquisitions, stock buybacks or paying down debt. So, in general, he looks for inexpensive stocks, he said, ''with a number of different ways to win,'' adding that ''ideally, you'd like to have a number of these variables.''Mr. Kluiber identifies cheap stocks using some traditional measures of value such as ratios of price to earnings and price to book. In September, the fund's 224 stocks sold for an average of 17.2 times 1999 earnings and a price to book ratio of 1.7.But he pays special attention to a company's cash: ''Cash flow is king,'' he said, ''and free cash flow is even better.'' Strong cash flow gives management flexibility to build the business and provide good returns to company shareholders, Mr. Kluiber explained. He defines free cash flow as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, minus working capital, capital spending and cash taxes. Sometimes, he'll look at a company's enterprise value -- the market value of a company's equity and debt -- in relationship to its free cash flow. There's no firm multiple that he looks for, but the lower the better.The companies he says he tends to buy are industry leaders, companies that usually have more pricing power and are often the lowest-cost producers. That means they often weather downturns better than their rivals, he said.He recently added to an existing position in Transportation Technologies Industries, a leading Chicago manufacturer of truck parts. The company's enterprise value is just about four times its free cash flow, an historically low ratio that resulted from a slowdown in the truck manufacturing business. But the multiple is also below those of its rivals.

Still, the company should have $30 million in free cash flow this year, or $3 a share, he said, adding that the money is being used to make acquisitions and to pay down its debt of about $180 million.The company also has been improving profit margins by restructuring some of its operations, he said. It has made several acquisitions, most recently buying a foundry in Kentucky to add capacity, he added.He first bought shares in October 1996, at $3.28 a share. The stock closed Friday at $14.75, or 8.7 times his earnings estimate for 1999 of $1.70 a share.

Mr. Kluiber also likes Agrium, a fertilizer maker in Calgary, Alberta. ''I'd characterize it as a cyclical company, hopefully at the bottom of the cycle,'' he said. Agrium is the low-cost producer of its mostly nitrogen-based products, and nitrogen prices are near a 20-year low, he said.Nonetheless, the company still earns money, 88 cents a share in 1998 versus $1.43 in 1997, generates plenty of cash flow and is buying back shares. ''It's the type of company that I buy with the idea that when supply and demand get more in balance, and as earnings increase, the stock price will follow,'' he said. ''In the meantime, they continued to improve their plants and business to position the company for a potential rebound in the nitrogen market.''HE originally bought shares on the New York Stock Exchange in October 1997 for $11.75 each, and expects per share earnings to rise as high as $3 when the nitrogen cycle peaks. The stock closed Friday at $8.4375.Mr. Kluiber added recently to Specialty Equipment, in Aurora, Ill., which makes food service equipment like milkshake machines and grills for McDonald's. The company generates ''a fair amount of free cash flow, which it is using to buy back shares and make judicious acquisitions that are accretive to earnings,'' he said.Specialty Equipment is the industry leader in a relatively mature industry, he said. Its stock price is down by more than 20 percent this year, Mr. Kluiber said, because one of the company's biggest customers recently reduced its order.He began buying shares in February 1995 for $10.25 each. He forecasts a three-year earnings growth rate of 10 to 15 percent. The stock closed Friday at $20.875, or 10.4 times his 1999 earnings forecast of $2 a share. Continue reading the main story
