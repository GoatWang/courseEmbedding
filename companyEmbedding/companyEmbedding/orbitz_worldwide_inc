2013 and Earlier:
Orbitz Worldwide, Inc. is an Internet travel company headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. Through its primary web site Orbitz.com, Orbitz Worldwide enables travelers to research, plan and book a broad range of travel products, facilitating 1.5 million flight searches and one million hotel searches every day.

The company's Chief Technology Officer oversees day-to-day IT operations and executive level strategy and governance from Orbitz Worldwide's Chicago, IL headquarters.

In 2013, the company is going through a period of layoffs and cost cutting efforts, which have resulted in staffing reductions, project delays, and pain points across all segments of the IT department.

Personnel in the department oversees development and support for solutions Orbitz uses for content management, marketing and web applications, and systems used by the company's customer facing business units. The applications and software engineering team is responsible for the management of database administration, data architecture, and the data warehouse, and assists other groups in managing business intelligence and eLearning operations.

The Technology Operations team handles the company's infrastructure engineering, security, server, and data storage solutions.  The group also includes management responsible for the retail and supply information systems for the company's hotel group.

A unit is also responsible for supporting the company's Private Label and Hosting operations. This is a business unit within Orbitz that partners with its business associates to develop and host travel-related websites underneath the business company's name.

In early 2013 Orbitz completed a five-year year $145 million dollar platform consolidation initiative to migrate its and the operating platforms of its subsidiary brands onto a single platform instance. The company also completed data mining 3000 terabytes of stored consumer data from this consolidated platform.

Orbitz outsources its data center and infrastructure operations to SAVVIS, Inc. and maintains a backup agreement with Verizon Business.

In 2012, Orbitz Worldwide, Inc. began to deploy data analysis solutions. The company also began investing heavily in expanding Hadoop usage, identifying a good solution for data visualization, and identifying data storage mechanism for different business units solutions.

Orbitz outsourced its analytical infrastructure to the cloud, through Kognitio in October 2011. Orbitz Worldwide, Inc.'s organization-wide data volume is approximately >5 pb and is growing at an annual rate of 6-10%. Its data environment consists of highly fragmented data that is primarily deployed on-premises in a “roll-your-own” appliance. The company uses Hadoop-based store (e.g. HBase) to store data primarily sourced from enterprise applications and other machine generated data (web logs, sensor logs, systems logs etc).

IT Intelligence Snippets
2013:
• Less than 30% of IT staff is dedicated to the sustenance of its ERP platform, and more than 50% of ERP support is outsourced to a third party.
• Expects around 1000 releases/updates a year with its current ERP solution.
• The budget is typically finalized in Q4.

Expedia Cuts Staff from Recently Acquired Orbitz
Nov 21 15
Expedia has laid off an undisclosed number of employees in the wake of its acquisition of Orbitz. Expedia said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that employees will be cut from Orbitz as part of a restructuring resulting from a merger of the two companies. Expedia expects severance and benefits costs from the layoffs to total between $130 million and $150 million. Much of that, $70 million, was recorded in Expedia's third-quarter financial report last month. The layoffs took place within the Orbitz ranks, meaning it's likely that few, if any, local Expedia employees were affected. Orbitz had 1,530 employees globally at the end of 2014. Orbitz employees were notified of the layoffs. The company is trying to find new positions for some of them within Expedia. Expedia will record the remaining costs related to severances in the fourth quarter and into 2016.

Background[edit]
Originally established through a partnership of major airlines, and subsequently owned by various entities, Orbitz.com – the flagship brand of Orbitz Worldwide – has been in operation since 2001. Other Orbitz Worldwide online travel companies include CheapTickets in the Americas; ebookers in Europe; and HotelClub and RatestoGo, based in Sydney. Orbitz Worldwide also owns and operates Orbitz for Business, a corporate travel company.
Orbitz was the airline industry's response to the rise of online travel agencies such as Expedia and Travelocity, as well as a solution to lower airline distribution costs. Continental Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines, and United Airlines, subsequently joined by American Airlines, invested a combined $145 million to start the project in November 1999. It was code-named T2 — some claimed, meaning "Travelocity Terminator" - but adopted the brand name Orbitz when it commenced corporate operations as DUNC, LLC (the initials of its first four founding airlines) in February 2000. The company began Beta testing early the next year, and Orbitz.com officially launched in June 2001.[3][1]
Pre-launch government review[edit]





This section relies largely or entirely on a single source. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please help improve this article by introducing citations to additional sources. (August 2015)


Even before the site began operating, the company faced intense antitrust scrutiny because five of the six "major" airlines were collaborating on the project. Collectively, they controlled 80 percent of the US air travel market. Several consumer organizations, as well as Orbitz's primary competitors at the time (Expedia, Sabre, Travelocity, Galileo) spent significant amounts of money lobbying the United States Department of Transportation to block the project from the outset, and some 23 state attorneys general also voiced concerns due to the complaints of local competitors. When the DOT permitted the company to move ahead in April 2001, the competitive lobbying effort was switched to the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice and the U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce.[citation needed]
Among the concerns raised were these:

above all, the so-called Most Favored Nation provision, by which the airlines agreed not to cut deals with competing sites under more favorable terms than with Orbitz
the airlines' agreement to release certain discount fares only to Orbitz or other entities at Orbitz low distribution cost, at the expense of its online and offline competitors
that Computer Reservation System fee discounts extended to partner airlines would undermine competitors and damage the fledgling online travel industry
that the airlines would coordinate efforts secretly to reduce discounts
Orbitz was breaking out the service fee from the ticket price, not making the total price clear

In July 2003, two years after the Orbitz launch, the Department of Justice ruled that Orbitz was not a cartel and did not pose a threat to competition. Orbitz's rapid growth had not impeded its online competitors' businesses which had continued to grow apace, and no evidence was found of price fixing. Additionally, changes in the marketplace had eroded both the advantages of the Most Favored Nation clause and the webfares that Orbitz had due to its low supplier cost. The efforts by its competitors to generate government scrutiny and the corresponding media attention only heightened consumer interest in Orbitz and the new ways it would allow travelers to shop. Nielsen's Net Ratings division reported in July 2001 that the Orbitz launch in June 2001 was the biggest e-commerce launch ever.[4]
Ownership history[edit]
In November 2003, Orbitz filed paperwork to sell shares at between $22 and $24 each in an initial public offering.[5] The company went public on December 18, 2003 at a price per share of $26. After the IPO, the airlines held 70% of the outstanding stock and over 90% of the voting power.[6]
On September 29, 2004, Orbitz was acquired for $1.25 billion by New York City-based Cendant Corporation. Cendant paid $27.50 per share.[7]
In 2006, The Blackstone Group acquired Travelport, the travel distribution services business of Cendant, for $4.3 billion in cash. At the time, Travelport included the Orbitz travel reservation website used by consumers, the Galileo computer reservations system used by airlines and thousands of travel agents, Gulliver's Travels and Associates wholesale travel business, and other travel related software brands and solutions.[8]
Travelport announced in May 2007 that it had filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to sell a portion of Orbitz Worldwide in an initial public offering (IPO). Travelport said it planned to use a portion of the proceeds to pay down its debt. Trading began on July 20, 2007, and the IPO transaction closed on July 25, 2007. Travelport owned approximately 48 percent of Orbitz Worldwide following the IPO.[9]
In February 2015, Expedia announced that it would acquire Orbitz for $1.2 billion in cash, to better compete with Priceline.com. The deal was announced a few days after Expedia agreed to purchase Travelocity.[10][11]
Technologies[edit]
Orbitz runs on a mixed Red Hat Linux[12] and Solaris based platform and was an early adopter of Sun Microsystems' Jini[13] platform in a clustered Java environment. JBoss is used as application servers within their environment along with various other proprietary and open source software.[14] Orbitz licenses ITA Software's Lisp-powered QPX software to power their site. Orbitz Worldwide brands have been migrated to a common technology platform, which enables the same platform to service multiple travel brands in multiple languages in different markets and currencies as well. Orbitz has released parts of its Complex Event Processing infrastructure as Open Source.[15]
Controversies[edit]
Southwest Airlines[edit]
Southwest Airlines filed a lawsuit against Orbitz for trademark infringement and false advertising in May 2001. Southwest, which had opposed the project from the outset,[clarification needed] claimed Orbitz misrepresented its prices and used its trademarks without permission. In July, it withdrew its fares from Airline Tariff Publishing Company, the entity that distributes fare information to Orbitz and others, and dropped its case against Orbitz. Southwest went on to remove themselves from every other online outlet except their own. In June 2008, Orbitz For Business became one of the first Online Travel Agents to offer Southwest flights on the Orbitz For Business website.[16]
WebLoyalty[edit]
In July 2009, CNET revealed that Orbitz, along with other popular consumer websites Buy.com and Fandango, have been routinely giving post-transaction marketers access to their customers' credit cards. The Senate Commerce Committee investigating these companies has described their services as a "scam".[17] The scam works by charging a monthly fee (many users report a $12 charge from Reservation Rewards or Webloyalty showing up on their credit card statements) that is piggybacked[clarification needed] with the Orbitz sale (as it stands, Orbitz Terms of Service agreement currently allows them to share customers' credit card information with third parties for their own uses). Orbitz ended its affiliation with the controversial marketer and does not share consumer credit card information with third parties.[citation needed]
Milgram v. Orbitz[edit]
In 2009, the state of New Jersey filed a lawsuit against the company alleging violation of their Consumer Fraud Act surrounding events with a Bruce Springsteen concert, where tickets were allegedly offered for sale on their website which did not actually exist. The court in Milgram v. Orbitz granted summary judgment for Orbitz, finding that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act preempted the state law consumer fraud claims.[18]
American Airlines[edit]
In December 2010, American Airlines temporarily ceased offering fares through Orbitz following pressure from American to convince Orbitz to use its AA Direct Connect electronic transaction system.[19] AA tried to establish that Direct Connect would have full control over the distribution of its products and reduce GDS segment fees. Furthermore, Direct Connect enables AA to sell ancillary services to its customers.[20] American was later ordered by an Illinois Court to resume offering fares and flight schedules.[21] The court order came only days after American released a video jabbing Orbitz on YouTube.[22]
Media Matters' "War on Fox"[edit]
Media Matters runs a website called DropFox.com, aiming to get advertisers to boycott Fox News. Orbitz initially referred to Media Matters' efforts as a "smear campaign",[23] but agreed, on June 9, 2011, following a three-week campaign by prominent LGBT organizations, to "review the policies and process used to evaluate where advertising is placed".[24]
Skiplagged lawsuit[edit]
In 2014, Orbitz and United Airlines initiated a Federal lawsuit against 22-year-old skiplagged.com founder Aktarer Zaman.[25][26][27] The complaint alleges that Zaman "intentionally and maliciously" interfered with airline industry business relationships “by promoting prohibited forms of travel.”[28] The complaint is centered on airline policies against "hidden city tickets." Although the hidden-city practice itself is not illegal,[29] the complaint alleges that Zaman's website is disruptive to their business.

Background[edit]
Originally established through a partnership of major airlines, and subsequently owned by various entities, Orbitz.com – the flagship brand of Orbitz Worldwide – has been in operation since 2001. Other Orbitz Worldwide online travel companies include CheapTickets in the Americas; ebookers in Europe; and HotelClub and RatestoGo, based in Sydney. Orbitz Worldwide also owns and operates Orbitz for Business, a corporate travel company.
Orbitz was the airline industry's response to the rise of online travel agencies such as Expedia and Travelocity, as well as a solution to lower airline distribution costs. Continental Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines, and United Airlines, subsequently joined by American Airlines, invested a combined $145 million to start the project in November 1999. It was code-named T2 — some claimed, meaning "Travelocity Terminator" - but adopted the brand name Orbitz when it commenced corporate operations as DUNC, LLC (the initials of its first four founding airlines) in February 2000. The company began Beta testing early the next year, and Orbitz.com officially launched in June 2001.[3][1]
Pre-launch government review[edit]





This section relies largely or entirely on a single source. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please help improve this article by introducing citations to additional sources. (August 2015)


Even before the site began operating, the company faced intense antitrust scrutiny because five of the six "major" airlines were collaborating on the project. Collectively, they controlled 80 percent of the US air travel market. Several consumer organizations, as well as Orbitz's primary competitors at the time (Expedia, Sabre, Travelocity, Galileo) spent significant amounts of money lobbying the United States Department of Transportation to block the project from the outset, and some 23 state attorneys general also voiced concerns due to the complaints of local competitors. When the DOT permitted the company to move ahead in April 2001, the competitive lobbying effort was switched to the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice and the U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce.[citation needed]
Among the concerns raised were these:

above all, the so-called Most Favored Nation provision, by which the airlines agreed not to cut deals with competing sites under more favorable terms than with Orbitz
the airlines' agreement to release certain discount fares only to Orbitz or other entities at Orbitz low distribution cost, at the expense of its online and offline competitors
that Computer Reservation System fee discounts extended to partner airlines would undermine competitors and damage the fledgling online travel industry
that the airlines would coordinate efforts secretly to reduce discounts
Orbitz was breaking out the service fee from the ticket price, not making the total price clear

In July 2003, two years after the Orbitz launch, the Department of Justice ruled that Orbitz was not a cartel and did not pose a threat to competition. Orbitz's rapid growth had not impeded its online competitors' businesses which had continued to grow apace, and no evidence was found of price fixing. Additionally, changes in the marketplace had eroded both the advantages of the Most Favored Nation clause and the webfares that Orbitz had due to its low supplier cost. The efforts by its competitors to generate government scrutiny and the corresponding media attention only heightened consumer interest in Orbitz and the new ways it would allow travelers to shop. Nielsen's Net Ratings division reported in July 2001 that the Orbitz launch in June 2001 was the biggest e-commerce launch ever.[4]
Ownership history[edit]
In November 2003, Orbitz filed paperwork to sell shares at between $22 and $24 each in an initial public offering.[5] The company went public on December 18, 2003 at a price per share of $26. After the IPO, the airlines held 70% of the outstanding stock and over 90% of the voting power.[6]
On September 29, 2004, Orbitz was acquired for $1.25 billion by New York City-based Cendant Corporation. Cendant paid $27.50 per share.[7]
In 2006, The Blackstone Group acquired Travelport, the travel distribution services business of Cendant, for $4.3 billion in cash. At the time, Travelport included the Orbitz travel reservation website used by consumers, the Galileo computer reservations system used by airlines and thousands of travel agents, Gulliver's Travels and Associates wholesale travel business, and other travel related software brands and solutions.[8]
Travelport announced in May 2007 that it had filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to sell a portion of Orbitz Worldwide in an initial public offering (IPO). Travelport said it planned to use a portion of the proceeds to pay down its debt. Trading began on July 20, 2007, and the IPO transaction closed on July 25, 2007. Travelport owned approximately 48 percent of Orbitz Worldwide following the IPO.[9]
In February 2015, Expedia announced that it would acquire Orbitz for $1.2 billion in cash, to better compete with Priceline.com. The deal was announced a few days after Expedia agreed to purchase Travelocity.[10][11]
Technologies[edit]
Orbitz runs on a mixed Red Hat Linux[12] and Solaris based platform and was an early adopter of Sun Microsystems' Jini[13] platform in a clustered Java environment. JBoss is used as application servers within their environment along with various other proprietary and open source software.[14] Orbitz licenses ITA Software's Lisp-powered QPX software to power their site. Orbitz Worldwide brands have been migrated to a common technology platform, which enables the same platform to service multiple travel brands in multiple languages in different markets and currencies as well. Orbitz has released parts of its Complex Event Processing infrastructure as Open Source.[15]
Controversies[edit]
Southwest Airlines[edit]
Southwest Airlines filed a lawsuit against Orbitz for trademark infringement and false advertising in May 2001. Southwest, which had opposed the project from the outset,[clarification needed] claimed Orbitz misrepresented its prices and used its trademarks without permission. In July, it withdrew its fares from Airline Tariff Publishing Company, the entity that distributes fare information to Orbitz and others, and dropped its case against Orbitz. Southwest went on to remove themselves from every other online outlet except their own. In June 2008, Orbitz For Business became one of the first Online Travel Agents to offer Southwest flights on the Orbitz For Business website.[16]
WebLoyalty[edit]
In July 2009, CNET revealed that Orbitz, along with other popular consumer websites Buy.com and Fandango, have been routinely giving post-transaction marketers access to their customers' credit cards. The Senate Commerce Committee investigating these companies has described their services as a "scam".[17] The scam works by charging a monthly fee (many users report a $12 charge from Reservation Rewards or Webloyalty showing up on their credit card statements) that is piggybacked[clarification needed] with the Orbitz sale (as it stands, Orbitz Terms of Service agreement currently allows them to share customers' credit card information with third parties for their own uses). Orbitz ended its affiliation with the controversial marketer and does not share consumer credit card information with third parties.[citation needed]
Milgram v. Orbitz[edit]
In 2009, the state of New Jersey filed a lawsuit against the company alleging violation of their Consumer Fraud Act surrounding events with a Bruce Springsteen concert, where tickets were allegedly offered for sale on their website which did not actually exist. The court in Milgram v. Orbitz granted summary judgment for Orbitz, finding that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act preempted the state law consumer fraud claims.[18]
American Airlines[edit]
In December 2010, American Airlines temporarily ceased offering fares through Orbitz following pressure from American to convince Orbitz to use its AA Direct Connect electronic transaction system.[19] AA tried to establish that Direct Connect would have full control over the distribution of its products and reduce GDS segment fees. Furthermore, Direct Connect enables AA to sell ancillary services to its customers.[20] American was later ordered by an Illinois Court to resume offering fares and flight schedules.[21] The court order came only days after American released a video jabbing Orbitz on YouTube.[22]
Media Matters' "War on Fox"[edit]
Media Matters runs a website called DropFox.com, aiming to get advertisers to boycott Fox News. Orbitz initially referred to Media Matters' efforts as a "smear campaign",[23] but agreed, on June 9, 2011, following a three-week campaign by prominent LGBT organizations, to "review the policies and process used to evaluate where advertising is placed".[24]
Skiplagged lawsuit[edit]
In 2014, Orbitz and United Airlines initiated a Federal lawsuit against 22-year-old skiplagged.com founder Aktarer Zaman.[25][26][27] The complaint alleges that Zaman "intentionally and maliciously" interfered with airline industry business relationships “by promoting prohibited forms of travel.”[28] The complaint is centered on airline policies against "hidden city tickets." Although the hidden-city practice itself is not illegal,[29] the complaint alleges that Zaman's website is disruptive to their business.

Southwest Airlines filed a lawsuit against Orbitz for trademark infringement and false advertising in May 2001. Southwest, which had opposed the project from the outset,[clarification needed] claimed Orbitz misrepresented its prices and used its trademarks without permission. In July, it withdrew its fares from Airline Tariff Publishing Company, the entity that distributes fare information to Orbitz and others, and dropped its case against Orbitz. Southwest went on to remove themselves from every other online outlet except their own. In June 2008, Orbitz For Business became one of the first Online Travel Agents to offer Southwest flights on the Orbitz For Business website.[16]
WebLoyalty[edit]
In July 2009, CNET revealed that Orbitz, along with other popular consumer websites Buy.com and Fandango, have been routinely giving post-transaction marketers access to their customers' credit cards. The Senate Commerce Committee investigating these companies has described their services as a "scam".[17] The scam works by charging a monthly fee (many users report a $12 charge from Reservation Rewards or Webloyalty showing up on their credit card statements) that is piggybacked[clarification needed] with the Orbitz sale (as it stands, Orbitz Terms of Service agreement currently allows them to share customers' credit card information with third parties for their own uses). Orbitz ended its affiliation with the controversial marketer and does not share consumer credit card information with third parties.[citation needed]
Milgram v. Orbitz[edit]
In 2009, the state of New Jersey filed a lawsuit against the company alleging violation of their Consumer Fraud Act surrounding events with a Bruce Springsteen concert, where tickets were allegedly offered for sale on their website which did not actually exist. The court in Milgram v. Orbitz granted summary judgment for Orbitz, finding that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act preempted the state law consumer fraud claims.[18]
American Airlines[edit]
In December 2010, American Airlines temporarily ceased offering fares through Orbitz following pressure from American to convince Orbitz to use its AA Direct Connect electronic transaction system.[19] AA tried to establish that Direct Connect would have full control over the distribution of its products and reduce GDS segment fees. Furthermore, Direct Connect enables AA to sell ancillary services to its customers.[20] American was later ordered by an Illinois Court to resume offering fares and flight schedules.[21] The court order came only days after American released a video jabbing Orbitz on YouTube.[22]
Media Matters' "War on Fox"[edit]
Media Matters runs a website called DropFox.com, aiming to get advertisers to boycott Fox News. Orbitz initially referred to Media Matters' efforts as a "smear campaign",[23] but agreed, on June 9, 2011, following a three-week campaign by prominent LGBT organizations, to "review the policies and process used to evaluate where advertising is placed".[24]
Skiplagged lawsuit[edit]
In 2014, Orbitz and United Airlines initiated a Federal lawsuit against 22-year-old skiplagged.com founder Aktarer Zaman.[25][26][27] The complaint alleges that Zaman "intentionally and maliciously" interfered with airline industry business relationships “by promoting prohibited forms of travel.”[28] The complaint is centered on airline policies against "hidden city tickets." Although the hidden-city practice itself is not illegal,[29] the complaint alleges that Zaman's website is disruptive to their business.

Background[edit]
Originally established through a partnership of major airlines, and subsequently owned by various entities, Orbitz.com – the flagship brand of Orbitz Worldwide – has been in operation since 2001. Other Orbitz Worldwide online travel companies include CheapTickets in the Americas; ebookers in Europe; and HotelClub and RatestoGo, based in Sydney. Orbitz Worldwide also owns and operates Orbitz for Business, a corporate travel company.
Orbitz was the airline industry's response to the rise of online travel agencies such as Expedia and Travelocity, as well as a solution to lower airline distribution costs. Continental Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines, and United Airlines, subsequently joined by American Airlines, invested a combined $145 million to start the project in November 1999. It was code-named T2 — some claimed, meaning "Travelocity Terminator" - but adopted the brand name Orbitz when it commenced corporate operations as DUNC, LLC (the initials of its first four founding airlines) in February 2000. The company began Beta testing early the next year, and Orbitz.com officially launched in June 2001.[3][1]
Pre-launch government review[edit]





This section relies largely or entirely on a single source. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please help improve this article by introducing citations to additional sources. (August 2015)


Even before the site began operating, the company faced intense antitrust scrutiny because five of the six "major" airlines were collaborating on the project. Collectively, they controlled 80 percent of the US air travel market. Several consumer organizations, as well as Orbitz's primary competitors at the time (Expedia, Sabre, Travelocity, Galileo) spent significant amounts of money lobbying the United States Department of Transportation to block the project from the outset, and some 23 state attorneys general also voiced concerns due to the complaints of local competitors. When the DOT permitted the company to move ahead in April 2001, the competitive lobbying effort was switched to the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice and the U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce.[citation needed]
Among the concerns raised were these:

above all, the so-called Most Favored Nation provision, by which the airlines agreed not to cut deals with competing sites under more favorable terms than with Orbitz
the airlines' agreement to release certain discount fares only to Orbitz or other entities at Orbitz low distribution cost, at the expense of its online and offline competitors
that Computer Reservation System fee discounts extended to partner airlines would undermine competitors and damage the fledgling online travel industry
that the airlines would coordinate efforts secretly to reduce discounts
Orbitz was breaking out the service fee from the ticket price, not making the total price clear

In July 2003, two years after the Orbitz launch, the Department of Justice ruled that Orbitz was not a cartel and did not pose a threat to competition. Orbitz's rapid growth had not impeded its online competitors' businesses which had continued to grow apace, and no evidence was found of price fixing. Additionally, changes in the marketplace had eroded both the advantages of the Most Favored Nation clause and the webfares that Orbitz had due to its low supplier cost. The efforts by its competitors to generate government scrutiny and the corresponding media attention only heightened consumer interest in Orbitz and the new ways it would allow travelers to shop. Nielsen's Net Ratings division reported in July 2001 that the Orbitz launch in June 2001 was the biggest e-commerce launch ever.[4]
Ownership history[edit]
In November 2003, Orbitz filed paperwork to sell shares at between $22 and $24 each in an initial public offering.[5] The company went public on December 18, 2003 at a price per share of $26. After the IPO, the airlines held 70% of the outstanding stock and over 90% of the voting power.[6]
On September 29, 2004, Orbitz was acquired for $1.25 billion by New York City-based Cendant Corporation. Cendant paid $27.50 per share.[7]
In 2006, The Blackstone Group acquired Travelport, the travel distribution services business of Cendant, for $4.3 billion in cash. At the time, Travelport included the Orbitz travel reservation website used by consumers, the Galileo computer reservations system used by airlines and thousands of travel agents, Gulliver's Travels and Associates wholesale travel business, and other travel related software brands and solutions.[8]
Travelport announced in May 2007 that it had filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to sell a portion of Orbitz Worldwide in an initial public offering (IPO). Travelport said it planned to use a portion of the proceeds to pay down its debt. Trading began on July 20, 2007, and the IPO transaction closed on July 25, 2007. Travelport owned approximately 48 percent of Orbitz Worldwide following the IPO.[9]
In February 2015, Expedia announced that it would acquire Orbitz for $1.2 billion in cash, to better compete with Priceline.com. The deal was announced a few days after Expedia agreed to purchase Travelocity.[10][11]
Technologies[edit]
Orbitz runs on a mixed Red Hat Linux[12] and Solaris based platform and was an early adopter of Sun Microsystems' Jini[13] platform in a clustered Java environment. JBoss is used as application servers within their environment along with various other proprietary and open source software.[14] Orbitz licenses ITA Software's Lisp-powered QPX software to power their site. Orbitz Worldwide brands have been migrated to a common technology platform, which enables the same platform to service multiple travel brands in multiple languages in different markets and currencies as well. Orbitz has released parts of its Complex Event Processing infrastructure as Open Source.[15]
Controversies[edit]
Southwest Airlines[edit]
Southwest Airlines filed a lawsuit against Orbitz for trademark infringement and false advertising in May 2001. Southwest, which had opposed the project from the outset,[clarification needed] claimed Orbitz misrepresented its prices and used its trademarks without permission. In July, it withdrew its fares from Airline Tariff Publishing Company, the entity that distributes fare information to Orbitz and others, and dropped its case against Orbitz. Southwest went on to remove themselves from every other online outlet except their own. In June 2008, Orbitz For Business became one of the first Online Travel Agents to offer Southwest flights on the Orbitz For Business website.[16]
WebLoyalty[edit]
In July 2009, CNET revealed that Orbitz, along with other popular consumer websites Buy.com and Fandango, have been routinely giving post-transaction marketers access to their customers' credit cards. The Senate Commerce Committee investigating these companies has described their services as a "scam".[17] The scam works by charging a monthly fee (many users report a $12 charge from Reservation Rewards or Webloyalty showing up on their credit card statements) that is piggybacked[clarification needed] with the Orbitz sale (as it stands, Orbitz Terms of Service agreement currently allows them to share customers' credit card information with third parties for their own uses). Orbitz ended its affiliation with the controversial marketer and does not share consumer credit card information with third parties.[citation needed]
Milgram v. Orbitz[edit]
In 2009, the state of New Jersey filed a lawsuit against the company alleging violation of their Consumer Fraud Act surrounding events with a Bruce Springsteen concert, where tickets were allegedly offered for sale on their website which did not actually exist. The court in Milgram v. Orbitz granted summary judgment for Orbitz, finding that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act preempted the state law consumer fraud claims.[18]
American Airlines[edit]
In December 2010, American Airlines temporarily ceased offering fares through Orbitz following pressure from American to convince Orbitz to use its AA Direct Connect electronic transaction system.[19] AA tried to establish that Direct Connect would have full control over the distribution of its products and reduce GDS segment fees. Furthermore, Direct Connect enables AA to sell ancillary services to its customers.[20] American was later ordered by an Illinois Court to resume offering fares and flight schedules.[21] The court order came only days after American released a video jabbing Orbitz on YouTube.[22]
Media Matters' "War on Fox"[edit]
Media Matters runs a website called DropFox.com, aiming to get advertisers to boycott Fox News. Orbitz initially referred to Media Matters' efforts as a "smear campaign",[23] but agreed, on June 9, 2011, following a three-week campaign by prominent LGBT organizations, to "review the policies and process used to evaluate where advertising is placed".[24]
Skiplagged lawsuit[edit]
In 2014, Orbitz and United Airlines initiated a Federal lawsuit against 22-year-old skiplagged.com founder Aktarer Zaman.[25][26][27] The complaint alleges that Zaman "intentionally and maliciously" interfered with airline industry business relationships “by promoting prohibited forms of travel.”[28] The complaint is centered on airline policies against "hidden city tickets." Although the hidden-city practice itself is not illegal,[29] the complaint alleges that Zaman's website is disruptive to their business.

It was code-named T2 — some claimed, meaning "Travelocity Terminator" - but adopted the brand name Orbitz when it commenced corporate operations as DUNC, LLC (the initials of its first four founding airlines) in February 2000. The company began Beta testing early the next year, and Orbitz.com officially launched in June 2001.[3][1]
Pre-launch government review[edit]

Even before the site began operating, the company faced intense antitrust scrutiny because five of the six "major" airlines were collaborating on the project. Collectively, they controlled 80 percent of the US air travel market. Several consumer organizations, as well as Orbitz's primary competitors at the time (Expedia, Sabre, Travelocity, Galileo) spent significant amounts of money lobbying the United States Department of Transportation to block the project from the outset, and some 23 state attorneys general also voiced concerns due to the complaints of local competitors. When the DOT permitted the company to move ahead in April 2001, the competitive lobbying effort was switched to the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice and the U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce.[citation needed]
Among the concerns raised were these:

above all, the so-called Most Favored Nation provision, by which the airlines agreed not to cut deals with competing sites under more favorable terms than with Orbitz
the airlines' agreement to release certain discount fares only to Orbitz or other entities at Orbitz low distribution cost, at the expense of its online and offline competitors
that Computer Reservation System fee discounts extended to partner airlines would undermine competitors and damage the fledgling online travel industry
that the airlines would coordinate efforts secretly to reduce discounts
Orbitz was breaking out the service fee from the ticket price, not making the total price clear

In July 2003, two years after the Orbitz launch, the Department of Justice ruled that Orbitz was not a cartel and did not pose a threat to competition. Orbitz's rapid growth had not impeded its online competitors' businesses which had continued to grow apace, and no evidence was found of price fixing. Additionally, changes in the marketplace had eroded both the advantages of the Most Favored Nation clause and the webfares that Orbitz had due to its low supplier cost. The efforts by its competitors to generate government scrutiny and the corresponding media attention only heightened consumer interest in Orbitz and the new ways it would allow travelers to shop. Nielsen's Net Ratings division reported in July 2001 that the Orbitz launch in June 2001 was the biggest e-commerce launch ever.[4]
Ownership history[edit]
In November 2003, Orbitz filed paperwork to sell shares at between $22 and $24 each in an initial public offering.[5] The company went public on December 18, 2003 at a price per share of $26. After the IPO, the airlines held 70% of the outstanding stock and over 90% of the voting power.[6]
On September 29, 2004, Orbitz was acquired for $1.25 billion by New York City-based Cendant Corporation. Cendant paid $27.50 per share.[7]
In 2006, The Blackstone Group acquired Travelport, the travel distribution services business of Cendant, for $4.3 billion in cash. At the time, Travelport included the Orbitz travel reservation website used by consumers, the Galileo computer reservations system used by airlines and thousands of travel agents, Gulliver's Travels and Associates wholesale travel business, and other travel related software brands and solutions.[8]
Travelport announced in May 2007 that it had filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to sell a portion of Orbitz Worldwide in an initial public offering (IPO). Travelport said it planned to use a portion of the proceeds to pay down its debt. Trading began on July 20, 2007, and the IPO transaction closed on July 25, 2007. Travelport owned approximately 48 percent of Orbitz Worldwide following the IPO.[9]
In February 2015, Expedia announced that it would acquire Orbitz for $1.2 billion in cash, to better compete with Priceline.com. The deal was announced a few days after Expedia agreed to purchase Travelocity.[10][11]
Technologies[edit]
Orbitz runs on a mixed Red Hat Linux[12] and Solaris based platform and was an early adopter of Sun Microsystems' Jini[13] platform in a clustered Java environment. JBoss is used as application servers within their environment along with various other proprietary and open source software.[14] Orbitz licenses ITA Software's Lisp-powered QPX software to power their site. Orbitz Worldwide brands have been migrated to a common technology platform, which enables the same platform to service multiple travel brands in multiple languages in different markets and currencies as well. Orbitz has released parts of its Complex Event Processing infrastructure as Open Source.[15]
Controversies[edit]
Southwest Airlines[edit]
Southwest Airlines filed a lawsuit against Orbitz for trademark infringement and false advertising in May 2001. Southwest, which had opposed the project from the outset,[clarification needed] claimed Orbitz misrepresented its prices and used its trademarks without permission. In July, it withdrew its fares from Airline Tariff Publishing Company, the entity that distributes fare information to Orbitz and others, and dropped its case against Orbitz. Southwest went on to remove themselves from every other online outlet except their own. In June 2008, Orbitz For Business became one of the first Online Travel Agents to offer Southwest flights on the Orbitz For Business website.[16]
WebLoyalty[edit]
In July 2009, CNET revealed that Orbitz, along with other popular consumer websites Buy.com and Fandango, have been routinely giving post-transaction marketers access to their customers' credit cards. The Senate Commerce Committee investigating these companies has described their services as a "scam".[17] The scam works by charging a monthly fee (many users report a $12 charge from Reservation Rewards or Webloyalty showing up on their credit card statements) that is piggybacked[clarification needed] with the Orbitz sale (as it stands, Orbitz Terms of Service agreement currently allows them to share customers' credit card information with third parties for their own uses). Orbitz ended its affiliation with the controversial marketer and does not share consumer credit card information with third parties.[citation needed]
Milgram v. Orbitz[edit]
In 2009, the state of New Jersey filed a lawsuit against the company alleging violation of their Consumer Fraud Act surrounding events with a Bruce Springsteen concert, where tickets were allegedly offered for sale on their website which did not actually exist. The court in Milgram v. Orbitz granted summary judgment for Orbitz, finding that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act preempted the state law consumer fraud claims.[18]
American Airlines[edit]
In December 2010, American Airlines temporarily ceased offering fares through Orbitz following pressure from American to convince Orbitz to use its AA Direct Connect electronic transaction system.[19] AA tried to establish that Direct Connect would have full control over the distribution of its products and reduce GDS segment fees. Furthermore, Direct Connect enables AA to sell ancillary services to its customers.[20] American was later ordered by an Illinois Court to resume offering fares and flight schedules.[21] The court order came only days after American released a video jabbing Orbitz on YouTube.[22]
Media Matters' "War on Fox"[edit]
Media Matters runs a website called DropFox.com, aiming to get advertisers to boycott Fox News. Orbitz initially referred to Media Matters' efforts as a "smear campaign",[23] but agreed, on June 9, 2011, following a three-week campaign by prominent LGBT organizations, to "review the policies and process used to evaluate where advertising is placed".[24]
Skiplagged lawsuit[edit]
In 2014, Orbitz and United Airlines initiated a Federal lawsuit against 22-year-old skiplagged.com founder Aktarer Zaman.[25][26][27] The complaint alleges that Zaman "intentionally and maliciously" interfered with airline industry business relationships “by promoting prohibited forms of travel.”[28] The complaint is centered on airline policies against "hidden city tickets." Although the hidden-city practice itself is not illegal,[29] the complaint alleges that Zaman's website is disruptive to their business.
