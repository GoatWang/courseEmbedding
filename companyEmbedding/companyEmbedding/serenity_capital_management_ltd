Posted by SerenityCapital ⋅ October 21, 2015 ⋅ Leave a comment

When I took Uber in San Francisco early this year, the driver upon hearing that I am from Australia, asked: “Are there lots of chocolate women?” Me: “Do you mean the indigenous Australians?” That was hilarious, but it was also funny later on when he was extremely excited to hear that a few of my … Continue reading →

Posted by SerenityCapital ⋅ July 15, 2015 ⋅ Leave a comment

Position: $3 million Short @ $704.06  Warren Buffet: The key to investing is not assessing how much an industry is going to affect society, or how much it will grow, but rather determining the competitive advantage of any given company and, above all, the durability of that advantage.

							Graham Valuation						


Posted by SerenityCapital ⋅ August 19, 2015 ⋅ Leave a comment

An interesting new valuation method that should be added to your investment metrics. The technique looks at value investing in particular, utilised on equities that offer stable and measurable future growth. This valuation is great in its simplicity offering a no-growth P/E of 8.5 which is then adjusted for the company’s sustainable growth rate. It would … Continue reading →

							ASX200						


Posted by SerenityCapital ⋅ January 1, 2017 ⋅ Leave a comment

16/03 At this point with the ASX at 5800 a recap from the morning has seen a dovish (compared to expectations) March hike which weighed on financials. In addition, Australia has come up with a 5.9% (+0.2% from expectation) unemployment print which should keep the RBA’s upward bias at bay for now. Ultimately both of … Continue reading →




							Oil- XTIUSD						


Posted by SerenityCapital ⋅ December 29, 2016 ⋅ Leave a comment

29/12/16 Most recently the OPEC deal reached in early December has boosted the price of oil and the energy sector. With production cuts expected by both OPEC and non-OPEC members, prices will be supported as long as there are no signs of supply side ‘cheating’ on the commitments made. This is something that will be … Continue reading →

28/12/16 Since the election of Trump equity markets have reached all-time highs, supported by strong earnings performances and speculative plays based on potential regulatory and fiscal changes as Trump moves into office. Since November, Financials and Industrials have been moved by expected Trump regulation that would seek to deregulate financial markets and enhanced fiscal policy … Continue reading →

A quick quiz: If bacteria in a glass bottle doubles once every minute and the glass is full of bacteria at 12pm. At what exact time is the glass bottle half full of bacteria? If you answered 11:59am, then you are a smart cookie. I believe this would be the most accurate analogy to the … Continue reading →

7/03 Sparking our first shift in sentiment in the bullion market over the past couple of months, a string of Fed speakers preparing markets for a March hike is pressuring gold. Of significance is a break of the 3-month trendline which signals further weakness as markets prepare for a potentially rapid set of hikes that … Continue reading →

Posted by SerenityCapital ⋅ August 19, 2015 ⋅ Leave a comment

Since 2013, the Aussie dollar went from above parity conditions to the current 0.73282 per USD as a result of Global interest rate differentials, a slow down in Chinese economic growth and the resulting slide in iron ore prices.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60) 

DAYS





      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
Starting Quarter

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.

                          Stock prices used are the "total returns" stock price and will include
                          dividends, spinoffs, splits, and other adjustments.  Because of this, stock
                          prices shown here will likely not
                          match a stock's actual closing stock price on the same date.
