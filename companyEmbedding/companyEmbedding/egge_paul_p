Small Block Chevy Blowout!Egge at SEMA
After
a short break, Egge Machine Company made a triumphant return to the SEMA Show.Ernie Silvers, CEO, with Dave McClelland at SEMA. 
Dave was a NHRA announcer from 1961 to 2003 and is the voice of our
hold message.              Electric Cars Are Not New—So Now What
Can you imagine how
blacksmiths reacted to the “horseless carriage” at the turn of the
century?  I’m sure some saw the “new
fangled” things as just a passing fancy, and thought they would never replace
the horse for transportation—so why worry. 
Some probably saw the horseless carriage as the wave of the future and
began looking for ways to adapt their business. 
And there were obviously those who decided the trend to horseless
carriages was real, but there would always be a need for blacksmiths and kept
doing business as usual.
Here we are at a
similar point in time a hundred years later. 
For years we have heard predictions that the internal combustion engine
(ICE) was doomed and would be replaced. 
The recent past has seen great strides in improving the ICE, making it
more efficient, less polluting and more powerful.  Most recently we’ve seen various types of ICEs
combined with electric motors to form hybrid vehicles.  
Now like the
blacksmiths of a hundred years ago we are faced with a decision.  If the trend toward electric vehicles is
real, how will we respond?  The evidence
is mounting that ready or not, electric cars are poised to make a comeback.  That’s correct, a comeback.  Early in the history of the car industry electric
cars were outselling gasoline powered cars.In the late 1890s electric cars
outsold gasoline cars ten to one. As a result, electric cars dominated the
roads and dealer showrooms. In fact, the first car dealerships were exclusively
for electric cars.  Some automobile
companies, like Oldsmobile and Studebaker actually started out as successful manufacturers
of electric cars, only later did they transition to gasoline-powered vehicles. 
 Did you know that 
        
an
electric car won the world’s first dirt track race in 1896?         
an
electric car took the world land speed record in 1899?         
the
first vehicle ever to go 60 mph was an electric car?         
the
first car to ever receive a speeding ticket was an electric car?
Early production electric cars
were all hand assembled. In 1910, volume production of gasoline powered cars
was achieved with the motorized assembly line. This breakthrough manufacturing
process killed off all but the most well-financed car builders. Independents,
unable to buy components in volume died off. On top of that, the infrastructure
for electricity was almost non-existent outside of city boundaries – limiting electric
cars to travel within their home city.

Another contributing factor to
the decline of electric cars was the addition of an electric motor (called the
starter) to gasoline powered cars – finally removing the need for the difficult
and dangerous crank to start the engine. Due to these factors, by the end of
World War I, production of electric cars stopped and they became niche vehicles
– serving as taxis, trucks, delivery vans, and freight handlers.In 1912 there were 33,842
electric cars were registered in the U.S.  More than 20 companies offered well over 100
models.  By 1924 there were no electric
vehicles displayed in the New York auto show, and only 3 models remained on the
market: Milburn, Rauch & Lang and Detroit Electric.In the late 1960s and early
1970s, there was a rebirth of interest in electric cars prompted by concerns
about air pollution and the OPEC oil embargo. Later, in the early 1990s, a few
major automakers resumed production of electric cars. Those electric cars were
produced in very low volumes—essentially hand-built like their early
predecessors. Today, there are more than 20 models offered by more than 12
makes.  These electric cars range from
basic transportation to luxury status promoting machines.


The horse still has
its enthusiasts, the internal combustion engine will probably be around for a
good while yet—so will you change your business model to take advantage of the
electric car trend?

Classic Car Market
Hagerty Insurance has announced the creation of the Hagerty
Market Rating, a new tool to gauge the status of the classic car market.
Hagerty publishes The Hagerty Price Guide and also developed and maintains
Hagerty Valuation Tools, the country's leading online classic car valuation
tool.
The Hagerty Market Rating is a numerical rating that reports
the status of the classic car market by applying a weighted algorithm to
fifteen data points in eight categories. This results in a proprietary data set
that includes the volume and directional momentum of public auction and private
sale activity, insured values, price guide values, the Hagerty Indexes and
expert sentiment. The January 2015 rating is 70.22, which indicates an overall
expanding and healthy market. The rating will be updated on a monthly basis.
"The key differentiator is that the Hagerty Market
Rating isn't based simply on public data like auction sales, which only make up
three percent of the annual transactions in the classic car world," said
McKeel Hagerty, CEO of Hagerty. "A large component of this rating is based
on private-owner-to-private-owner sales, which is the most elusive and difficult
data to obtain. We developed this as a tool to allow anyone who is serious
about treating collector cars as investments to immediately take the
temperature of the classic car market and truly understand the factors that
cause the classic car market to move up or down."
The Hagerty Market Rating uses a 0-100 scale based on a traditional
bell curve. Ratings at or near zero or 100, while theoretically possible, are
not likely. Ratings in the 40-50 range indicate a flat or relatively inactive
market, while below 35 is a deflationary market, becoming more strongly
deflationary the closer it is to zero. Ratings in the 60-75 range indicate a
peak performing market, and above 80 indicates a market that is approaching a
state of hyper-demand, marked by rapidly increasing prices and volume that
could indicate of a bubble market in the making.
"Despite a Scottsdale auction season that saw sales
increase 18% over 2014, the overall market is actually in a very healthy place
right now," McKeel Hagerty said. "Yes, some segments are overheated
and some have recently cooled. However, on the whole, the current market rating
is a healthy, expanding market through January."
Based on auction sales, the classic car market in the US for
2014 was $1.3 billion.

Lincolns in LA Auto Show	     This year, Lincoln featured some really cool vintage cars in their display during the LA Auto Show.  Pictured here is the 1929 Lincoln Dietrich.  One of only 75 produced, it originally sold for $6,200.  That's a lot of money for the average American consumer of that day.This is a 1932 Lincoln KB LeBaron.  This coachbuilder car is based on the first V12 platform offered by Lincoln (Ford).  Built to compete with Dusenberg and Cadillac, the Lincoln KB was only offered for two years.  A total of 125 of the LeBaron bodied KBs were produced.Next is a 1937 Lincoln Derham--the only one in existance today.  The design features the height of streamlining in the 1930s.  After spending years in a mid-west barn this car was completely restored and took first-in-show at Pebble Beach in 2004.The car below is the 1937 Lincoln Zephyr, a model that was introduced at the 1936 New York Auto Show.  It was the first vehicle offered by Ford Motor Company that had unibody construction.In 1940 Lincoln introduced a replacement for the Zephyr, the Continental.  Considered by many as the most elegant car of the time, it was also the first of the new era of cars to offer an external spare tire.  The spare tire option carried the model's name from then on.It's nice seeing the classics featured with the latest and greatest being offered by the car companies.

News Item	       Join the Good Fight to Protect Our Automotive Rights!By Colby Martin, SEMA Action Network (SAN) Director The SEMA Action Network (SAN) represents the united voice of “car guys and gals.”  This group is a nationwide partnership between enthusiasts, vehicle clubs and members of the automotive specialty-equipment industry who have joined forces to promote hobby-friendly legislation and oppose unfair legislation. With more than 61,000 members from all 50 states and Canada, the SAN is the premier organization defending the rights of vehicle enthusiasts"the same enthusiasts who comprise the U.S. and Canadian customers that drive industry sales.  The SAN has a proven record for achieving legislative successes  to the hundreds of federal and state bills each year that directly affect all aspects of the automotive hobby, including the ability to purchase, install and operate vehicles with aftermarket parts. The SAN reaches out to millions of enthusiasts through regular Action Alerts, ads in magazines, websites, Internet forums, social media sites and its own monthly newsletter, Driving Force. Over 15-plus years, the effect of the SAN on shaping government policy has been enormous.  Among other successes, the SAN has successfully:Enacted street rod and custom vehicle (including kit cars and replicas) registration and titling laws in 22 states.Protected classic vehicles waiting to be restored on private property from confiscation.Safeguarded legal off-road nitrous oxide use with SAN model legislation.Defended enthusiast’s right to use more durable aftermarket exhaust systems.Junked state level “Cash for Clunkers” legislation.Enacted legislation to lower taxes and fees for hobbyist vehicles.Secured U.S. Senate Resolutions to honor the second Friday in July as “Collector Car Appreciation Day.”Supported other hobby-related efforts such as the Save The Salt Coalition for the legendary Bonneville Salt Flats.Based on the current economic and legislative environment, the road ahead will continue to be challenging.  States are seeking new avenues for generating revenue and new ways of dictating what you can and cannot do with your vehicles. The message government is sending is clear"the hobby and industry need the SEMA Action Network now more than ever.  All car enthusiasts, automotive associations, media, museums, event promoters, businesses, car clubs and other interested groups should contact the SAN to join the cause.  If you haven’t already, get involved free of charge at www.SEMAsan.com.  Your voice, and those of your friends, will help our automotive family take action and continue fighting the good fight! SAN Members Speak Up: ”The SAN is a great network to be a part of. They let you know what’s going on withyour legislature and all the hobby bills,” states Ashley Grubermann of Richton Park,Illinois. “You get the chance to speak up and have your voice heard.” She proudly wearsa SAN T-shirt while posing with her ’71 Pontiac Grand Ville. Byron Fulbright of Tulsa, Oklahoma, shows off the SAN decal on his ’73 ChevroletChevelle Malibu. Christian and Keith Gonzales of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, say, “We truly appreciate whatyou do for our hobby!”     			E135 and EP1110 Pistons	     To order, enter E135 or EP1110 in the "SEARCH BY" section at the top of the page.Egge Machine manufactures cast aluminum replacement pistons for the much loved 239 Ford flathead. Made with some of the molds used for the original production engines, and expertly machined using modern state-of-the art equipment, these slightly domed pistons are as close as you can get to the originals. Egge produces two pistons for this application, E135-8 and EP1110-8. The E135-8 is normal replacement piston, and the EP1110-8 is a performance version of the same piston. Egge offers these pistons in oversizes up to 0.125 over  standard, knowing that these thickwall blocks are quite often  overbored.Ford did not invent the V8, but the flathead design was definitely a Ford innovation.  The Ford design was simpler than its predecessors without giving up power, making it less expensive to mass-produce.  Ultimately, much like the Model T, it changed the automotive industry. Ford introduced the 239.4 CID V8 engine in 1939.  The move was made to provide a more powerful engine for the newly introduced Mercury cars.  Collectively all 239 engines are referred to as "100 horse" engines, even though the horsepower started out at 95 and was increased in 1952 to 110 horsepower in cars and 106 horsepower in trucks. This engine was used in Ford's transit buses during their short stint in the transit bus business from the late 1930s to the early 1950s.From 1943 to 1945 Ford did not produce any civilian vehicles, but concentrated on production for the war effort.  After the war, for 3 years (1946, 1947, 1948) Ford used the same engine in both the Ford and Mercury models.  Then in 1949, the Mercury engine was stroked to 4 inches resulting in 255.4 CID.  Ford models continued with the same 239 CID engine until 1954 when it was changed to a "Y" block. In 1949 the bellhousing changed to a completely removable unit. The cylinder heads were changed moving the water outlets to the front of the engine.  The method of attaching the heads to the block also changed, going from studs and nuts to bolts. The crankshaft counterweights were modified and rod bearings were changed to non-floating inserts.The Ford 239 V8 is and engine loved by restorers and hot rodders alike.  Along with this piston Egge provides a complete engine rebuilding kit that consists of the following items:    			EP1091 and L991 Pistons	     To order, enter L991 or EP1091 in the "SEARCH BY" section at the top of the page.For the 1949 to 1953 Mercury 255.4 CID V8, Egge Machine produces two replacement pistons.  One is the EP1091-8 and the other is L991-8.  The EP1091-8 is a more high performance piston, while the L991-8 is a straight stock replacement.  Egge Machine manufacturers these pistons in oversizes up to 0.125.The 1949 Mercury Division was actually the savior of the Ford Motor Company as its Sport Coupe brought buyers back in the mid-price range.  Mercury did have a full line, a convertible, two-door hardtop, conventional sedan and conventional coupe and they all did well. However, it's the Sports Coupe that people remember.Starting with Ford's flathead V-8, the engine was stroked so that it cranked out 110 horsepower for the Sport Coupe, which was about as much as you'll get from any vehicle whose V-8 engine only runs with roughly a 6.8-to-one compression ratio. At the time, it could be mated to a three-speed manual or an automatic, and dual downdraft Holley carburetors.The 1949 Mercury, as typified by the Sports Coupe, was a very modern-looking car for that era. Rounded, the front end featured a minimal amount of chrome. The rounded hood worked nicely with the bulbous and rounded front fenders to give the front end a nicely completed, smooth look that flowed into a rounded body that carried the lines of the finders through the sloping rear quarters. The rounded hood also flowed into the body panels and windshield and the slightly sloped windshield carried the line to the roof which sloped sharply back to a small, rounded trunk lid. The body also sported wheelwell covers to complete the look.The other memorable '49 Merc was the woodie wagon, also known as an Estate Wagon, that featured Mercury's revamped styling. Interestingly, the woodie featured a distinct set of front fenders that were low on the vehicle and above which the rather noticeable hood was visible. The woodie did sport its own rather stylish road lamp/turn signals that were nicely integrated into the single round headlights that were fared into the fenders. The fenders on this and other lines that features similar styling, such as the convertible, also established the beltline about midway on the vehicle.The Mercury lineup proved to be a hit with buyers and validated the marketing insight of Edsel Ford.  For 1949, total sales figures of all vehicles were nearly 300,000 vehicles. These sales alone established Mercury as a serious contender in the marketplace.The Mercury lineup proved to be a hit with buyers and validated the marketing insight of Edsel Ford.

It began on February 12, 1908, and was witnessed by an estimated crowd of more than 250,000.  It was billed as a race around the world, and expected to cover 22,000 miles from start to finish.  Keep in mind, there were extremely few paved roads at that time.The "Great Race" was sponsored by the New York Times and La Matin, a French newspaper based in Paris, and therefore was planned to finish outside the offices of La Matin.  The route began as a line drawn on a globe with major stops in Albany, NY, Chicago, Seattle, Valdez, Alaska, Japan, the Russian cities of Vladivostok, Omsk, Moscow and St. Peterburg, then Berlin and finally Paris.The plan was to send the cars from Chicago to San Francisco, from there by steamer to Valdez, Alaska. They would drive from there to the Yukon river. To be sure of ice on the river, the race had to be in winter. Though no car then had been driven across the U.S. in winter (and only seven in the summer) the start from New York vas set for February 12, 1908. There were six entrants in the race.  The competitors represented most of the world superpowers of the day; Germany, Italy, France and the United States. There was much at stake, and the eyes of the world would focus on the racers daily with front page newspaper news. The race would become an epic test of machines as well as human endurance and ingenuity in a world that for most had never seen a car.For Germany the car chosen was a Protos, for Italy the car was a Zust, there were 3 cars representing France (De Dion-Bouton, MotoBloc and Sizair-Naudin), and a Thomas Flyer for the US.  All but the Sizair-Naudin were 4-cylinder powered.  And all were right hand drive.The German team turned to the small Berlin-based German company of Protos after Benz and Daimler politely bowed out. Amazingly, they designed a custom built car in only 16 days, the Protos racing car was an impressive 16 feet long, 6.5 feet wide, and when loaded with three men, an extensive spare parts kit, food and 176 gallons of gas weighed some three tons. The car was powered by a 40hp engine that made it possible for the car to reach speeds of up to 70mph. There was no enclosed passenger cabin and the trip across the United States and Siberia would be under cover of nothing more than canvas. The Protos was roughly the same size as a modern Chevrolet Suburban built with steam-era technology. The French fielded 3 teams.  The first chose a De-Dion for its car.  The De-Dion model 1908 came with a 4-cyclinder engine, 4-speed transmission and had a top speed of 50 mph.  The second team chose a Motobloc.  The Motobloc was noted for an innovative engine design which combined the engine, clutch and gearbox in a single main casing.The Motobloc was powered by a monobloc engine which had cylinders that were not individual, but cast as a single unit. (Seems normal today, but was quite an innovation back then.) The engine was inclined at 30 degrees from the horizontal and the gearbox was made as part of the same unit with the crankcase. It also had a fly wheel mounted in the center of the crankshaft. This in turn was mounted on four main bearings which significantly reduced engine vibration. . The engine had overhead inlet valves and side exhaust with hemispherical combustion chambers. Lubrication was by an oil pump and cooling by a water pump.  This combined assembly was mounted transversely in the chassis and drove the rear axle by chain.The third French team chose a Sizaire-Naudin for their car.  A much smaller car than the rest of the competitors, it was a two-seater powered by a 1-cylinder engine.  The car had an independent front suspension and combined with the 15 hp engine won a number of early races.The Italian team chose a Zust for their car.  The Zust Model 1908 had a 7,432cc 4-cyclinder engine, 4-speed transmission, and had a top speed of 60 mph.The US team drove a Thomas Flyer Model 35.  It had a 4-cyclinder engine, 4-speed transmission, weighed 5,000 pounds, and had a top speed of 60 mph.The Zust led at first, then the Thomas. These and the De Dion made the 116 miles to Hudson through snow drifts and stopped for the night. The Protos was at Poughkeepsie. Mishaps stopped the Motobloc at Peekskill. It never caught up and eventually dropped out of the race.The Sizaire-Naudin dropped out of the race two hours after the start. The rear axle of the little car collapsed climbing Spitlock Hill and replacement parts didn't work.The Thomas increased its lead in the mud of Iowa and it was at Carroll, Iowa, that the Motobloc finally quit the race.At San Francisco, after repairs the Thomas Flyer was shipped by steamer to Seattle, then in a second steamer to Valdez, Alaska. There, snowdrifts as high as houses prevented it being driven off the dock, and it was shipped back to Seattle.Back in Seattle, the US team learned that the race was to be resumed in Vladivostok; that the Zust and De Dion which followed them into San Francisco, were already enroute to Russia by way of Japan; that the Protos, which had been shipped by rail to Seattle from its last breakdown near Pocatello, Idaho, was being sent direct to Vladivostok. The US team chose to go by way of Japan. At this point, the Race Committee gave the Thomas Flyer a 15-day advantage for going to Alaska and penalized the Protos 15 days for not driving to San Francisco.As all four cars reached Vladivostok, three of them after 350 tortuous miles across Japan, the Marquise de Dion, maker of the De Dion car withdrew it from the race.  That left half of the original entrants in the race-Zust, Protos and the Thomas Flyer.The Protos was the first car to cross the finish line, but its team was penalized 15 days for using railroad transport to meet a critical North American deadline (meeting the other surviving racers to catch a ship to Russia).  That combined with the 15 day advantage given to the Thomas Flyer, brought the Protos in second.   The Thomas Flyer crossed the finish line on June 30th, 169 days and 13,341 miles from the start in New York.  The Zust reached Paris on September 17th, and took third place.In early 1910, the trophy for the New York to Paris race was awarded to the Thomas Flyer team in New York. It is over 6 feet high and weighs in excess of 1,600 pounds. The base is a combination of green Italian and pink French marble. There are medallions of German bronze depicting the coats of arms of the competing countries and the trophy is topped by an American eagle. It is now in the National Automobile Museum in Reno, Nevada with the Thomas Flyer, as restored by William Harrah. The Protos was restored by the Siemens family and is in the Deutsches Museum in Munich. The Zust is on Vancouver Island as part of a collection assembled by Buck Rogers.  Therefore, the only finishers of the longest automobile race ever sanctioned all still exist.In 1988, as part of the Great American Race from Disneyland to Boston, the Thomas Flyer was put on the road again.  Ginni and Newt Withers were entering the record holding car in the cross country event sponsored by Interstate Batteries.  In preparation, the engine was rebuilt and Egge Machine was commissioned to cast new pistons for the car.  The 5+ inch pistons were some of the largest ever cast by Egge up to that time. April 14 - July 11, 2011: A Race combining the future with the past.  Plans are now being made for  World Race 2011 to commemorate the 1908 epic, and make history of its own!  With a start in New York City, participants will circle the globe with their automobiles to the finish line in Paris.

According to reports from Haggerty, the collector car auctions in Scottsdale the end of January 2011 generated $157 million.  The total number of vehicles changing hands was 2,325.  Believe it or not, the top seller was a 2006 Ferrari FXX Evoluzione that sold for $2.09 million.  The number two and three top sellers in Scottsdale were a 1949 Ferrari 166MM Barchetta ($1.87 million) and a 1933 Packard Twelve Sport Phaeton ($1.76 million).Less than 6 months ago, in August 2010, during a week-long series of classic-car auctions in Pebble Beach, Calif., about $178 million of collectible automobiles were sold, up from $118 million in 2009. The top seller was a 1959 Ferrari 250 GT LWB California Spider Competizione, which sold for a world record price of $7.26 million.Obviously, there is money out there, and investors are ready to spend when it comes to collectible cars.  So what has happened to the market during the recession?  Everyone has seen a pull back in the marketplace.  Many think that the majority of the pull back was on the part of vehicle owners.  During the trying times of the past few years, sellers decided to just hang on their cars until the economy improved.As we look at the results of the five January auctions in Scottsdale, we find some very encouraging signs.Gooding & Company's Scottsdale Auctions resulted in 11 world records, listed as follows:- A world auction record for a Ferrari FXX, the 2006 Ferrari FXX Evoluzione at $2,090,000- A world auction record for a Fiat 8V, the 1953 Fiat 8V Supersonic at $1,705,000- A world auction record for a Porsche 904, the 1964 Porsche 904 Carrera GTS at $1,045,000- A world auction record for a Chrysler Newport Dual Cowl Phaeton, the 1941 Chrysler Newport Dual Cowl Phaeton at $1,017,500- A world auction record for a 300 SL Roadster, the 1962 Mercedes-Benz 300 SL Roadster at $951,500- A world auction record for a Rolls-Royce Henley Roadster, the 1931 Rolls-Royce Phantom II Henley Roadster at $935,000- A world auction record for a Mercedes-Benz 300 Sc, the 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300 Sc Roadster at $660,000- A world auction record for a Nash, the 1956 Nash Rambler "Palm Beach" Coupe Speciale at $528,000- A world auction record for a Bowlus trailer, the 1935 Bowlus Road Chief at $187,000- A world auction record for a MG SA, the 1937 MG SA Tourer at $209,000 - A world auction record for an Autobianchi, the 1959 Autobianchi Bianchina Transformabile at $82,500Barrett Jackson had a 100% sell-through rate that generated nearly $70 million for collector car sellers.  Notable among the sales were: 1956 De Soto Fireflite Convertible that sold for $368,500, 1967 Chevrolet Corvette L71 427/435 Convertible that sold for $242,000, a 1958 Chevrolet Impala Convertible that went for $198,000.Russo & Steele highlights of the 2011 Scottsdale auction were the sales of a 1970 Plymouth Hemi Cuda Convertible that sold for $1,705,000, 1955 Mercedes Benz 300 SL Gullwing $704,000, a 1965 Shelby Cobra CSX 1001 $335,500, a 1970 Plymouth Cuda 440/6 4-spd $236,500, and the 1957 Cadillac Eldorado Biarritz $194,700.RM Auctions sold 172 vehicles including two of the top three-the 1949 Ferrari 166 MM Barchetta and the 1933 Packard Twelve Sport Phaeton.  The average price of cars changing hands at the RM Auctions was $177,859.  Meanwhile, Silver Auctions sold 193 vehicles for a total of $3.4 million.The multi-day auctions in Scotsdale saw a total of 2,325 vehicles change hands, which isn't too bad at a time when the US economy is coming out of the worst recession in memory.  That tells us that the collector car market is definitely alive and well.

 HOUSTON, Dec. 06, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Allegiance Bancshares, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABTX), the holding company of Allegiance Bank (collectively, "Allegiance"), today announced Paul P. Egge has been appointed Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of both Allegiance Bank and Allegiance Bancshares, Inc., effective December 19, 2016.  Steven F. Retzloff, Chairman of Allegiance Bank and President of Allegiance Bancshares, Inc., will relinquish his interim Chief Financial Officer position. Mr. Egge, 38, brings more than 13 years of financial services experience to Allegiance, predominantly as an investment banker focused on strategic and capital markets advisory services.  Most recently, Mr. Egge served as Senior Vice President, Director of Capital Planning and Corporate Development at Cadence Bank, a $9.4 billion asset regional bank. Prior to joining Cadence, Mr. Egge served in various roles of increasing responsibility at Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated ("Baird"), Ryan Beck & Company, and FBR & Co. (formerly Friedman, Billings, Ramsey Group, Inc.).  He graduated Cum Laude with a bachelor's degree in Economics and Finance from The College of William & Mary and holds a Master of Business Administration from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. "I am extremely pleased to welcome Paul to Allegiance as our Chief Financial Officer," said George Martinez, Allegiance's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "His financial and capital markets expertise, as was evidenced in his work with Allegiance with our 2015 IPO, will be a great asset to Allegiance and a strong addition to our leadership team. We believe Paul's extensive experience not only complements our existing talented accounting and financial reporting staff but will serve us strongly as we continue to grow and execute on our long-term strategic plan to deliver profitable growth and increased shareholder value." "I am honored to join Allegiance's executive team," said Egge. "Allegiance is committed to continued growth while maintaining its super-community bank strategy. It's a pleasure to be a part of an organization with that type of reputation and commitment.  Allegiance has many accomplishments and I look forward to helping guide them on a path to continued success."

Fuel Direct - Call MY customers, they'll tell you the truth about xp3- IT Works!




                                    It's unfortunate that some people may misrepresent a product, any product, with any company. If that happens, they should be denied distributor rights and or employment with said company. However, as a certified  commercial sales rep for xp3, I can tell you that my...

N1H1L9 Alright mate, so why's your 3.4 billion dollar product so hard to get hold of? Evaluating the demonstration, you might actually have something I can use but can I get my hands...

FUEL DIRECT - JAMES EGGE

 









 Saint Paul, Minnesota 




        Jul 08, 2013    


        0 comments    

 


 
James reported via phone and e-commerce his household savings 
for a Fiscal year using XP3 Fuel Additive per vehicle per household. 
What he LIES about is the FACT he only had one vehicle; AND, 
that one vehicle was seized by the bank making him months short of his FISCAL reporting. 
James EGGE is part of Sapphire Summit Training group . 
Smith encourages "inducement" by men like himself boasting of 6.5 million a year in former mlm and cnstruction companies. 
Just fails to speak truth in those ventures being shut down by the General's OFFICE (i.e. AMEN ROOFING - for those that care to GOOGLE).    Another distributor by the name of Jon Thompson goes so far as to report his mpg results for 2 years on a vehicle he never owned; yet speaks, "I'm driving a ..."
Thompson has the brilliance to post his mpg on his imaginary vehicle via blogspots. 
The good news is this - I thank God for our FIRST AMMENDMENT Right to speak up and protect ourselves and others from 
those men that prey on others by "inducement and lies". 
God Bless. 
If you have been victim to their lies, call the BBB as well as the GENERAL'S OFFICE immediately.  
 




 


        Review #360617 is a subjective opinion of
