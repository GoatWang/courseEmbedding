2015 Lisa Roberts & David Seltzer IPD Lecture: Richard Saul WurmanMonday, Feb. 2, 2015, 06:30pmAdd to CalendariCalendarOutlookGoogleYahooMeyerson HallLower Gallery210 South 34th StreetPhiladelphia, PARichard Saul Wurman2015 Lisa Roberts & David Seltzer Integrated Product Design LectureMonday, February 2 | 6:30PMMeyerson Hall, Lower GalleryRegistration is encouraged. To register, please click here.Described by Fortune magazine as an "intellectual hedonist" with a "hummingbird mind," Richard Saul Wurman seeks ways to make the complex clear. Recognizing at an early age that his ignorance is his greatest asset, he has made it his mission to sort through the abundance of information that is available on every topic, and design the techniques to make it understandable. In doing so he has continually sought to put himself in the presence of extraordinary people, including (all now all deceased), in the sciences Francis Crick, Richard Feynman and Jonas Salk; in the arts Eva Zeisel, Louis I. Kahn and Charles Eames; in communications Steve Jobs and Frank Stanton; in history and archaeology Schuyler van Renssalaer Cammann, and Arnold Toynbee. There are many others. The only two bosses he ever had who didn't fire him were Lou Kahn and Charlie Eames.As a result, Wurman has had many lives: as an author (83 books); FAIA Architect, 13-year partner in Murphy Levy Wurman Architects; cartographer (mapped 1/3 of the Mayan city of Tikal and current project 19.20.21.); teacher (Cambridge University, England; Princeton; Washington University, St. Louis; University of Southern California; University of California Los Angeles; City College of New York, and Dean, Cal Poly School of Design); urban designer (recipient of MIT's Kevin Lynch award in urban design); graphic designer (AIGA Gold Medal, membership in AGI and inducted into the Art Directors Hall of Fame); information theorist (Information Anxiety, Follow the Yellow Brick Road); in medicine (6 books and creator of TEDMED), and as a conference convener. The path of this journey has been paved by one surface: his curiosity.The acknowledged father of Information Architecture, Wurman has written, designed and published 83 books on a range of topics, while creating conferences and new mapping projects. All contribute to a greater understanding of complex information. They spring from his particular brand of innovation: doing the opposite of what is rote or expected. Of these characteristics, Nancye Green wrote: "â€¦as an architect, [RSW] has been responsible for building a community addicted to curiosity. He continues to put himself out there inventing and reinventing the ways we see and experience anything and everything that interests him. He has influenced so many of us, even if this was not his intention."Wurman published his first two books in 1962. The first featured models of 50 world cities all constructed on a uniform scale, the other was the first book to be written on Louis Kahn. In 1967 he co-authored the first comparative statistical atlas of major American cities. His latest book is called 33: Understanding Change & the Change in Understanding. It chronicles the adventures and musings of the eccentric main character, the Commissioner of Curiosity and Imagination.Wurman created the ACCESS city guides, using graphics and logical editorial organization to make places such as New York, Tokyo, Rome, Paris and London understandable to visitors. Other volumes he created focus on topics such as baseball, football and the 1984 Olympics, the latter with over with 3.2 million copies sold. His road atlases employed similar techniques that elucidate U.S. geography and transportation networks. In addition he completed many one-off projects, such as his book Twin Peaks Access, which he co-authored with David Lynch. Of his written work, designer Massimo Vignelli notes: "the design of his guides has been a landmark in the definition and development of this form of communication."Several of his books are in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York. The extraordinary graphic designer Milton Glaser wrote: "Richard Saul Wurman's impact on the design community and the public at large has been profound. Through his books and his instructional manuals, he has been exceedingly exceptional in informing the public about critical issues."Wurman began his career in conferences in 1972 when he chaired the International Design Conference in Aspen. He then co-chaired the first Federal Design Assembly in 1973 and the annual AIA Conference in 1976. With each of these he changed the fundamentals of how gatherings were run. All these helped his creative molding of TED, TEDMED, eg, and the upcoming WWW Conference, now in development. Says acclaimed architect Frank Gehry, "The programs, conferences and books that he has developed have created an interactive dialogue between art/design and many of the disciplines in all fields on a wide range of all topics from technology, education, entertainment, medicine and science to name a few."Wurman created the TED conference in 1984, which he chaired through the 2002 meeting. TED brings together many of America's clearest thinkers in the fields of technology, entertainment and design. He created the eg conference in 2006 and the TEDMED conference in 1995, which he chaired through 2010. Other conferences he created and chaired include California 101, TEDSELL, TEDNYC, TED4Kobe in Japan and TEDCity in Toronto. Noted graphic designer and typographer Stefan Sagmeister said that "â€¦he has had the most profound influence on our industry: he pioneered and basically invented the field of information architecture. He created and chaired TED Conferences, which might have become the single most important communication platform for our own field and many others, and thereby connecting design effectively to science, technology, education, politics and entertainment."Now in his 77th year, Wurman continues to quell his restless intellect with a series of new projects. The WWW Conference will be an active gathering of some of the brightest thinkers of our time discussing the complexity of emerging patterns on our planet in improvised conversation â€“ intellectual jazz. In partnership with ESRI and @radical.media, 19.20.21. is a major cartographic initiative that endeavors to standardize a methodology for comparative urban data. His Urban Observatory project aims to establish, for the first time ever, a series of live and changing electronically connected urban observatories around the world.Wurman received both his B.Arch. and M.Arch. degrees with highest honors from the University of Pennsylvania in 1959. While there, he was awarded the Arthur Spayd Brooks Gold Medal, 2 Chandler grants and two graduate fellowships. He has also been awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in Architecture and Design, three honorary doctorates, two Graham Fellowships and numerous grants from the National Endowment for the Arts.Wurman was named the Lifetime Achievement Award recipient by Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum. This top honor recognizes an individual who has made a long-term contribution to the practice of design.

Description
David Roberts was the first British painter to make an artistic expedition to Egypt and the Holy Land. The result of his travels was a picturesque vision of the Near East that has been hugely influential ever since. Nearly 200 years later, his work is held in institutions such as the Library of Congress in Washington and London’s Victoria and Albert Museum.
The Folio Society limited edition of The Holy Land and Egypt and Nubia, which replicated the size of the original edition, was enormously popular and quickly sold out.
David Roberts was an artist with ambition. Born in relative poverty outside Edinburgh, he spent years developing his skills as an apprentice and a jobbing artisan, graduating to a career painting backdrops for the theatre, ﬁrst in Edinburgh and then in London’s Covent Garden and Drury Lane. By 1837, he had achieved renown for his landscape paintings of the Rhine and Spain. Unlike most artists, who relied on sketches brought back by other travellers, Roberts had visited these countries himself. His adventurous approach and his technical brilliance would serve him well on the journey of a lifetime – an artistic pilgrimage to Egypt and the Holy Land, the ﬁrst ever undertaken by a British artist.
Roberts set oﬀ in August 1838, travelling from London to Marseilles and on to Alexandria. From there he began his journey up the Nile with a crew of six men. In Cairo, he determined to record modern buildings as well as ancient, and made sketches of minarets, alleys and marketplaces. His observations remain among the few records we have of the early 19th-century city. Ultimately continuing as far south as Abu Simbel, Roberts produced over 100 sketches on his journey through Egypt, saying: ‘We shall see what impression they make in England.’
Roberts next set his sights on Palestine. He travelled across the Sinai desert along the route thought to have been taken by the Israelites when they left Egypt for the Promised Land. He and his team slept in tents under the stars and took shelter in the Monastery of St Catherine, where Roberts produced some of his most famous vistas of the Holy Land. Jerusalem was closed to visitors because of plague, but Roberts’s luck held and he was able to enter during Holy Week. It was the memorable culmination of an extraordinary voyage. As well as having visited biblical sites from the Mount of Olives to Jericho, he had assembled, as he put it, ‘one of the richest folios that ever left the East’.
On his return to London, Roberts sought a publisher for his work, eventually signing a contract with Francis G. Moon for £3,000 – a vast sum, equivalent to over £200,000 today. Critics and the public lined up to praise Roberts’s works when they were ﬁrst exhibited. The press lauded the aesthetic quality of his art, its historical and topographical accuracy, and the grandeur of its subject matter. Publication of the ﬁrst edition was a slow and enormously expensive process. It was printed in sections, each one containing six hand-coloured lithographs created from the original drawings. But Moon’s investment paid oﬀ. There was no shortage of subscribers, with Queen Victoria (to whom the Holy Landseries is dedicated) and Charles Dickens among those reserving a set. Roberts’s pictures had caught the imagination of the British public and set a trend for Orientalism in art that would continue to shape the way in which the West perceived the East.
