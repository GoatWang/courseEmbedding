PRODUCT DETAILS:

The Whitehaven apron-front kitchen sink features a streamlined and versatile farmhouse style to complement any decor. Perfect for remodeling projects, it has a shortened apron that allows for installation on most new or existing 36-inch standard cabinetry. The Self-Trimming(R) design requires only a simple rough cut, overlapping the cabinet face for beautiful results and easy installation. A low barrier divides the two compartments, making it easy to wash and rinse large items while still keeping the two basins separate. Crafted from enameled cast iron, this sink resists chipping, cracking, or burning for years of beauty and reliable performance.

Tips For Shopping Online1. Be cautious where you submit your credit card information. When you are shopping online, always employ secure sites. These are sites that have taken steps to guard your valuable information. A secured website will begin with HTTPS rather than the standard HTTP. There may also be a locked icon, either in your address or status bar, based on which browser you use.2. When shopping online, it is essential that you spend a little time looking into the site that you will be considering buying from. You can find information about the web page from other sites and the Better Business Bureau. Not researching them could lead to you obtaining the products you probably did not order or getting billed greater than you should have.3. When shopping online, choose the best shipping policy. Often times companies offer expedited shipping. However, often times getting the product one day earlier can cost you as much as twice the normal shipping price. Therefore, if you can wait on the product to arrive using normal shipping instead of expedited shipping, choose standard shipping to save money.4. When shopping online, most places only accept debit or credit cards. Take this into account when you are choosing a site to shop from. In the event you don't feel relaxed providing the company with your credit card information, try to look for another site. Try to find a site that offers a secure page when you're adding your charge card information.5. Before you make a purchase, make a price comparison on several websites. Try to find special coupons and offers on these websites to successfully are getting the best offer possible. Also look into what it really will cost for the shipping on your own items and in case there are free shipping options available to you.

6426 Devonshire is the ideal location to enjoy St. Louis Hills, one of St. Louis most beloved neighborhoods. This stately 2-story brick offers 3 bedrooms and 1.5 baths, an impeccable level of care and so much more. Spacious living room features a gorgeous fireplace and large windows with views of both the front and back yards. Fantastic updated kitchen means lots of counter space, updated appliances and beautiful wood cabinetry. So many simple details ~ elegant 9 panel wood doors, stained glass windows and arched openings, all of which maintain the architectural integrity that makes this neighborhood so special. The staircase winds to 3 bedrooms, including a master with his/her closets and a shared hall bath. The finished LL rec. room adds valuable living space and plenty of storage. The patio was recently enlarged to take full advantage of outdoor entertaining possibilities! All of this just blocks from Francis Park and Ted Drewes. Please note: fenced yard and 2-car garage.

About KOHLER

The brand name KOHLER is synonymous with the world's finest plumbing products in the world. From cutting-edge designs and the industry's most notable materials to flawless functionality, KOHLER manufactures everything you need for the kitchen and bathroom, and it's all available at Faucet.com. KOHLER's history of providing customers with amazing faucets and fixtures goes back over a century. Since then, the company has combined advanced technology with an artist's eye to create perfection. Today, KOHLER offers products like kitchen faucets, kitchen sinks, kitchen accessories, bathroom sink faucets, bathroom sinks, bathroom accessories, toilets, bathtubs, everything for the tub and shower, vanities, medicine cabinets, and even bathroom lighting.KOHLER Kitchen FixturesKOHLER kitchen faucets are designed with style, simplification, and perfect functionality in mind. While the main kitchen faucet is certainly one of the fixtures it makes, it's certainly not the only one. KOHLER also provides bar faucets and pot fillers designed to help with food prep and clean up in the kitchen. KOHLER laundry faucets and utility faucets are available as well.Kitchen sinks absorb a lot of daily use, and KOHLER kitchen sinks are more than worthy to take on this task. KOHLER uses the plumbing industry's finest materials for its kitchen sinks, like cast iron, vitreous china, and stainless steel. From self-rimming to apron front sinks (also called Farmhouse sinks), KOHLER has a sink for every kitchen. And pair up a main kitchen sink with a KOHLER bar sink for an extra workspace.As you might expect, KOHLER also helps to round out the kitchen with a helpful host of kitchen accessories. Choose from deck-mounted soap dispensers to basin racks and colanders for the kitchen sink. Cutting boards and wire rinse baskets also make valuable kitchen accessories. KOHLER Bathroom FixturesThe bathroom is where KOHLER truly shines, and it starts with KOHLER bathroom sink faucets. Within its selection of single handle and double handle bathroom faucets, KOHLER has some of the best-selling fixtures in the entire plumbing industry. Choose from a number of different configurations, as well, including single-hole, widespread, the unique wall-mount faucet, and the beautiful and striking vessel bathroom faucet.Select the perfect KOHLER bathroom sink to go with your bathroom faucet. You'll not find a selection better suited for today's bathroom demands than the one KOHLER offers. Any bathroom will benefit from a KOHLER bathroom sink, whether it's a self-rimming sink (also called drop in) or undermount sink. The wall-mount sink provides a truly unique look, a pedestal sink adds a stylish look to a bathroom of any size, and a vessel sink doubles as a striking design element poised to be a focal point. KOHLER Toilets, Bathtubs, and ShowersKOHLER toilets are some of the most efficient and versatile in the entire plumbing industry. KOHLER offers toilets in every size and shape you can imagine, from round to elongated. Comfort height toilets are designed to make sitting down and standing up easier for our aging population. And when it comes to water-efficient toilets, KOHLER is at the top of the list.KOHLER bathtubs are designed for comfort—as well as getting you clean. From the relaxing soaking tub to the rejuvenating air tubs and whirlpool tubs, KOHLER bathtubs come in a number of shapes, sizes, and installation types. And they're made using the plumbing industry's most trusted materials, like, cast iron, acrylic, and vitreous china.The tub and shower is an area designed for relaxation and rejuvenation, and KOHLER has everything you might need. From Rainshower showerheads and tub and shower faucets to Roman tub faucets, KOHLER fixtures will fit seamlessly into any bathroom décor. KOHLER tub and shower faucets are also equipped with leading-edge technologies, like thermostatic valve trim with volume controls, and pressure balanced trim with diverters.Don't forget about KOHLER tub and shower accessories, either. Showerheads and hand showers offer versatility; body sprays help rejuvenate the mind, body, and spirit; grab bars aid accessibility; and KOHLER tub wastes are purely functional and round out the overall look of your tub.Shower fixtures must be in place even before you ever turn the water on. KOHLER shower receptors include the drain; KOHLER shower doors can provide an unlimited amount to the bathroom décor; and shower walls and shower modules can include a number of features like shelves, seating, and accessibility. KOHLER Bathroom AccessoriesWhat bathroom would be complete without its share of KOHLER bathroom accessories? Think of how your bathroom would function without a towel bar, towel ring, or robe hook. KOHLER also has bathroom accessories like toilet paper holders, storage shelves, and soap dishes.Medicine cabinets are one of the most important additions to a bathroom, and KOHLER gives them a look all their own. KOHLER medicine cabinets include plenty of storage for toiletries and other bathroom necessities, and choose from framed or frameless mirrors.KOHLER vanities are ideal for the smaller bathroom that needs storage, a bathroom sink, and yet is still concerned with creating a beautiful bathroom environment. KOHLER vanities are available with or without the bathroom sink, and you can even add a sink separately.Just when you thought KOHLER already had everything for the bathroom, it surprises with a gorgeous selection of bathroom lighting. These are mostly wall-mounted fixtures with one, two, and three lights. Much of KOHLER bathroom lighting is also reversible, adding further versatility.When shopping KOHLER kitchen and bathroom products, you can also do so by its popular collections. This ensures you have access to perfectly coordinated fixtures and can stretch out the theme to the kitchen and every bathroom in the home.KOHLER Popular Collections The KOHLER Devonshire collection features KOHLER's top-selling selection of bathroom faucets and fixtures. This traditional-themed family boasts fixtures for the entire bathroom, from the bathroom faucet and bathroom sink to the toilet and tub/shower elements. KOHLER's Bancroft collection is defined by classic design elements, like subtle scrolling at the base of the handles and spouts of the bathroom faucets. The bathroom sinks are produced from vitreous china, and the bathroom lighting helps to round out this very complete collection. The KOHLER Purist collection is one of the most striking contemporary-themed families. Design elements are kept to a minimum here, as bold lines and the cylindrical form help create a stunning contrast. KOHLER's Forte collection is a fun family with lots of character. The double handle bathroom faucet is one of KOHLER's most popular fixtures. This family provides everything for a smooth-running bathroom, while adding amazingly good looks.Shop KOHLER at Faucet.com for everything your home needs in the kitchen and bathroom.

Product Features:Double basin sink with a 70/30 split provides increased versatility for any taskCovered under Kohler's limited lifetime warrantyStreamlined and versatile farmhouse style to complement any décorPerfect for remodeling projectsConstructed of enameled cast-iron which combines strength, durability and insulation benefitsUndermount installation delivers a clean look and easy mountabilityCenter drain location provides optimal drainage capabilityAll hardware needed for installation includedProduct Technologies / Benefits:Apron Front:  Once known as “farmhouse sinks” because they evoke images of traditional kitchens, Kohler apron-front sinks have a stylish panel in front and are available in both tile-in and under-mount models. Self-Trimming installation lets you install an apron-front sink with most conventional cabinetry.Self Trimming:  An Apron Front design that overlaps the “Apron” down over a portion of existing cabinetry. This allows the installation of an Apron Front sink with only minor countertop modification.Smart Divide:  The basin divider is set to a lower height than perimeter of the sink; you gain the convenience of a single basin sink completely filled, without losing the functionality of a double basin sink. The lower divider also gives more room for working with larger pots and pans providing more access for filling and cleaning.Enameled Cast-Iron:  Kohler Enameled Cast-Iron combines the strength, durability, and insulation benefits of cast-iron with the scratch, chip, and burn resistance of a baked, powder coat finish and comes with an exceptional Lifetime Limited Warranty. When these materials are combined it gives the sink or tub the strength to last a lifetime of use. Kohler Enameled Cast-Iron is also available in a wide variety of specialty colors allowing you to truly customize your home.Product Specifications:Height: 9-5/8" (measured from the bottom of sink to the top of the rim)Overall Width: 21-9/16" (measured from the back outer rim to the front outer rim)Overall Length: 35-1/2" (measured from the left outer rim to the right outer rim)Basin Width (Left): 18-1/16" (measured from the back inner rim to the front inner rim)Basin Width (Right): 18-1/16" (measured from the back inner rim to the front inner rim)Basin Length (Left): 17" (measured from the left inner rim to the right inner rim)Basin Length (Right): 11" (measured from the left inner rim to the right inner rim)Basin Depth (Left): 9" (measured from the center of basin to the rim)Basin Depth (Right): 9" (measured from the center of basin to the rim)Installation Type: UndermountNumber of Faucet Holes: 0Drain Outlet Connection: 3-5/8"Minimum Base Cabinet Width: 36"
