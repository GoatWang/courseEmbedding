ultimately to own and/or operate or sell the Properties.                        

2.7 Cost recovery method to be used. The Manager intends to use the straight*   
line cost recovery method on the appropriate useful life schedule available*

2.8 Amount of leverage to be used. The Manager anticipates using debt*          
financing to purchase, develop and construct the Properties. The maximum*       
loan amount is anticipated to be seventy-five percent (75%) of the value*       
of the Properties, once completed; however, the Manager reserves the right*     
to exceed that percentage.                                                      

2.9 Capital Reserve. The Fund Manager will provide a Capital Reserve for*

ITEM 3                                                                          
RISK FACTORS 

An investment in the Units offered hereby involves a number of risks.*          
Prospective investors should carefully consider the following*                  
information about these risks, together with the other information*             
in this Offering Circular, before investing in the Units.                       

The Fund is engaged in a business that involves a number of risks*              
and an investment in the Units is speculative in nature*                        
Prospective investors should make an investment in the Units only after*        
consulting with independent, qualified sources of investment and tax*           
advice and only if their financial condition will permit them to bear*          
the risk of a total loss of their investment. Prospective*                      
investors should consider an investment in the Units only as a long-term*       
investment.                                                                   

Prospective investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties *   
described below, as well as all of the other information included in this *     
Offering Circular, before deciding whether to purchase any Units. Any of the *  
following risks and uncertainties could materially, adversely affect the Fund * 
and its overall financial condition and, therefore, could negatively impact *   
the value of an investment. Prospective investors should not invest in the *    
Units unless they can afford to lose the investment made with the Fund.         

RISKS RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND BUSINESS MODEL                      

3.1 Tuscan Gardens Design Concept. The design concept upon which Tuscan*        
Gardens is premised includes, as the centerpiece of the residence, an*          
open, community kitchen, accessible to all residents.*                          
There can be no assurance that the Fund will be able to bring that*             
design concept to fruition to its fullest, based on health, safety,*            
and other laws, rules, regulations and standards applicable to*                 
the structure and its intended use.                                             

3.2 Lack of operating history. The Fund and its affiliated entities*            
have no operating history. The Fund is using an unproven business*              
model and cannot guarantee that the business model is*                          
appropriate to the implementation of its business plan.                         

3.3 Unproven revenue and profit potential of our business model.*               
Because the business model is unproven as to the sizes of the*                  
assisted living and memory care units and the combination of the two*           
of them, both the revenue and profit potential of the Fund are*                 
uncertain. If the Fund meets its revenue expectations, there is no*             
guarantee that the Fund will be profitable or that costs will not *             
continue to exceed revenue.                                                     

3.4 The revenue is dependent upon one tenant. The Properties will*              
have one tenant. There is a risk that tenant will not be able to*               
maintain necessary occupancy levels in one or more of the*                      
Properties and there is no guarantee that tenant will be profitable*            
There is a risk that tenant will be unable to pay the rent as it*               
comes due. If the rent is not paid as it comes due, the Fund*                   
may not be able to pay the normal, recurring operating expenses*                
of the Properties and/or the required monthly loan payments. The*               
risk of being unable to pay the recurring operating expenses and the*           
required monthly loan payment is that the Fund, at the extreme,*                
could face foreclosure on one or more of the Properties or in a*                
lesser case, the projected cash distributions will not be able to be*           
made.                                                                           

3.5 Lack of tenant operational history for Properties.*                         
The Properties have not yet been identified, purchased, developed*              
or constructed, and are not in operation at this time, and it is *              
not possible to determine if the Properties will be profitable.*                
If the Properties are not profitable, the tenant could cease*                   
operating the locations and cease rent payments. If the rents*                  
are not paid as they come due, the Fund may not be able to pay*                 
the normal, recurring operating expenses of the Properties,*                    
as are required, and/or the required monthly loan payments.*                    
The risk of being unable to pay the recurring operating expenses*               
and the required monthly loan payment is that the Fund, at the*                 
extreme, could face foreclosure on one or more of the Properties*               
or in a lesser case, the projected cash distributions will not be*              
able to be made.                                                                

3.6 Licensing Requirements. The assisted living component of*                   
Tuscan Gardens, as well as the memory care component, each*                     
requires a license from various states to operate.*                             
While the Fund Manager believes that it will obtain those*                      
licenses, there can be no assurances that the licenses will*                    
either be issued or be issued on a timely basis.                                

3.7 Risks of having no control in management.*                                  
Under the Operating Agreement, Preferred Members do not have*                   
a right to participate in the management of the Fund's affairs.*                
Preferred Members cannot propose changes to the Manager or to the*              
Operating Agreement.                                                            

Under the Operating Agreement, it may also be difficult for*                    
Preferred Members to enforce claims against the Manager, which*                 
means that Preferred Members may not be able to recover any losses*             
they may suffer through their ownership of Units arising from acts*             
of the Manager that harm the Fund's business.                                   

The Manager and its management must discharge their duties with*                
reasonable care, in good faith and in the best interest of the Fund*            
Despite this obligation, the Operating Agreement limits*                        
management's liability to the Fund and all Members. The Manager*                
is not liable for monetary damages unless it involves receipt of*               
an improper personal financial benefit, a willful failure to deal*              
fairly with the Fund on matters where there is a material conflict*             
of interest, a knowing violation of law, or willful misconduct.*                
Any Member's ability to bring legal action against the Manager for*             
these actions is also limited. Members may only bring a legal action*           
on behalf of the Fund if it has refused to bring the action or an*              
effort to cause the Manager to bring the action is not likely*                  
to succeed.                                                                     

3.8 Members must rely on the Manager for management of the business.*           
The Manager will make all decisions with respect to the management*             
of the Fund. Preferred Members will have no right or power to take*             
part in the management of the Fund. Therefore, they will be*                    
relying entirely on the Manager for management of the Fund and the*             
operation of its business.  The Manager may not be removed under*               
the Operating Agreement.                                                        

3.9 Certain affiliates of the Manager shall determine what is in*               
the best interests of the Fund and its Members. Certain individuals*            
control the majority of the membership interests of the Manager.*               
Therefore, these individuals will have a dominant role in*                      
determining what is in the best interests of the Fund. Since*                   
no person other than these individuals has any direct control over*             
management of the Fund, it does not have the benefit of independent*            
consideration of issues affecting its operations. Therefore, these*             
individuals will determine the propriety of their own actions, which*           
could result in a conflict of interest and a risk to the viability*             
and success of the Fund when they are faced with any significant*               
decisions relating to the affairs of the Fund.                                  

3.10 Voting rights are limited under the Operating Agreement as *               
well as under the Florida Revised Limited Liability Company Act. *              
The Manager only may take the following significant actions:                    

(a) to amend the Operating Agreement;                                           

(b) to change the Fund's business purpose or the investment objectives;         

(c) to sell the Fund's Properties;                                              

(d) to authorize a merger of the Fund; or                                       

(e) to authorize the dissolution of the Fund.                                   

Preferred Members will not have the right to vote on any matters*               
that the current Members may vote on other than those which*                    
attempt to change or modify the rights and privileges as a Preferred*           
Member. In addition, the Florida Revised Limited Liability Company*             
Act does not grant Preferred Members any other specific voting rights.          

3.11 Indemnification of Manager and Management Corporation.  The *              
Operating Agreement provides indemnification of the Manager and *               
the Management Corporation. The Fund is bound to indemnify and *                
hold the Manager and the Management Corporation harmless for any *              
acts done or omitted to be done, under the authority granted to *               
the Manager and the Management Corporation, except in the case of *             
bad faith, willful or intentional misconduct, gross negligence, *               
reckless conduct or a knowing violation of law. This *                          
indemnification will provide the Members with a more limited *                  
right of action against the Manager and the Management Corporation *            
than they would have if the indemnification were not in the *                   
Operating Agreement.                                                            

RISKS RELATED TO THE OFFERING                                                   

3.12 Arbitrary Determination of the Offering Price. The offering*               
price has been arbitrarily determined by the Manager and may not*               
bear any relationship to assets acquired or to be acquired or the*              
book value of the Company or any other established criteria or*                 
quantifiable indicia for valuing a business. Neither the Company*               
nor the Manager represents that the Units have or will have a market*           
value equal to their offering price or that the Units could be resold*          
(if at all) at their original offering price.                                   

3.13 Breaking Escrow. The Fund may break escrow when Twenty-five (25)*          
Units have been sold and the Fund has received investment funds*                
therefor of Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars($250,000.00).*               
There can be no assurance that the Fund will be able to sell the*               
remaining offered Units at any price.                                           

3.14 No Market for Units. There is a risk that no market for the*               
Units will ever exist and as a result, the investment in the Fund*              
is illiquid in the event the Member desires to liquidate their*                 
interest. If a Member attempts to sell their Units, prior to the*               
dissolution of the Fund, there is no certainty that they can be*                
sold for full market value or that the Units may be sold at any*                
price.                                                                          

3.15 Investment Risk. There can be no assurance that the Fund*                  
will be able to achieve its investment objectives or that*                      
Members will receive any return of their capital. Investment*                   
results may vary substantially over time and as a result,*                      
investors should understand that the results of a particular*                   
period will not necessarily be indicative of results in future*                 
periods.                                                                        

3.16 Risk of inability to obtain financing. There is no*                        
guarantee that the Fund will be able to obtain financing under*                 
these terms for the acquisition, development and/or construction*               
of the Properties or that any such financing will not exceed*                   
seventy-five percent (75%) of the value of the completed Properties.*           

3.17 Fund intends to use leverage. The Fund's objectives include*               
the use of leverage in the acquisition, development, construction,*             
and operation of the Properties. If the Fund does obtain*                       
financing, the use of leverage increases the risk of an investment*             
in the Units, as it is possible that the rental income from the*                
Properties, in any month, will be inadequate to make the monthly*               
debt service required on the financing obtained. A result of being*             
unable to make the required financing payments could be that the*               
lender could complete a foreclosure and all of the investment in*               
the Units will be lost. There is also the risk that at the time*                
of the sale of the Properties, the sales proceeds will not be*                  
greater than the amount needed to pay off the remaining balance*                
of the financing and, as a result, no cash will be available*                   
for distribution to the Members.                                                

3.18 Lack of capital. There is a risk that the amount of capital*               
to be raised by the Fund will be insufficient to meet the investment*           
objectives of the Fund. If there is a shortage of capital, the*                 
Manager will use best efforts to obtain funds from a third party.*              
Obtaining funds from a third party may require an increase in the*              
amount of financing the Fund will be obligated to repay. In*                    
addition, there is no certainty that funds from a third party will*             
be available at a reasonable cost, if available at all.                         

3.19 General economic conditions may affect the value and the*                  
timing of sales of Fund Properties or the ability to finance*                   
the Properties. The real estate market is affected by many factors,*            
such as general economic conditions, the availability of financing,*            
interest rates and other factors, including the supply and demand*              
for real estate investments, all of which are beyond the control of*            
the Fund. The Fund cannot predict whether it will be able to sell*              
its Properties for a price or on terms which are acceptable.*                   
Further, the Fund cannot predict its ability to obtain adequate*                
funding from a third party lender to purchase any Property. There*              
are no assurances that the Fund can successfully achieve its*                   
investment goals and therefore, investors may have to hold their*               
Units for an indefinite period of time, or have their Units sold*               
or redeemed for less than the Preferred Members' Capital Investment.            

3.20 Environmentally hazardous property. Under various federal, *               
state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a *             
current or previous owner or operator of real property may be *                 
liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic *           
substances on, under or in such property. Such laws often impose *              
liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was *                
responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. *          
Environmental laws also may impose restrictions on the manner in *              
which property may be used or businesses may be operated, and these *           
restrictions may require expenditures. Environmental laws provide for *         
sanctions in the event of noncompliance and may be enforced by *                
governmental agencies or, in certain circumstances, by private parties. *       
In connection with the ownership of the Properties, the Fund may be *           
potentially liable for such costs. The cost of defending against claims *       
of liability, complying with environmental regulatory requirements or *         
remediating any contaminated property could materially adversely affect *       
the value of the Fund's Properties and the Units.                               

3.21 Real estate investments are long-term investments and may be *             
difficult to sell in response to changing economic conditions.*                 
Virtually all real property investments are subject to certain *              
inherent risks. Real estate investments are generally long-term *               
investments which cannot be quickly be converted to cash. Real *                
property investments are also subject to adverse changes in general *           
economic conditions or local conditions which may reduce the demand *           
for commercial property.                                                        

3.22 Limited operating reserves. The Fund intends to establish an *             
operating reserve account with a portion of the proceeds raised from *          
this Offering to pay anticipated operating, administrative and other *          
expenses that shall be incurred following the Closing Date of this *            
Offering. If future expenses increase by unanticipated amounts, the *           
Fund may not have sufficient reserves to pay these obligations. The *           
Fund does not currently have any commitment or arrangement in place *           
to obtain additional funding, and there are no assurances that *                
additional funding can be obtained, if necessary, or that such *                
additional funding, if obtained, will be adequate for its financial *           
needs.                                                                          

3.23 Legal, tax and regulatory risks. Legal, tax and regulatory *               
changes could occur during the lifetime of the Fund that may *                  
adversely impact the Fund, its taxation status and any distributions *          
to Members.                                                                     

3.24 Tax liability may exceed cash distribution from the disposition.  *        
There is a risk that on the disposition of the Properties the tax *             
liability may exceed the distributable cash available. In the event of *        
a foreclosure, or other involuntary disposition of the Properties, *            
there is the possibility that a Member may have a larger tax liability *        
than the amount of cash available for distribution at the time of the *         
event, or at any time in the future.                                            

3.25 Risk of audit of Member's returns. There is a risk that an audit *         
of the Fund's records could trigger an audit of the individual Member's *       
tax records.                                                                    

RISK RELATED TO CONFLICTS OF INTEREST                                           

3.26 Manager or Management Corporation May be Involved in Similar *             
Investments.  The Manager or the Management Corporation, or their *             
affiliates, may act as Managers in other limited liability companies *          
engaged in making similar investments and intend to act as the Managers *       
of new limited liability companies to be formed.                                

3.27 Manager or Management Corporation May Have Interests in Similar *          
Properties.  The Manager or the Management Corporation, or their affiliates, *  
own or may come to own an interest in properties that may compete with the *    
Properties of the Fund.                                                         

3.28 Manager or Management Corporation May Act on Behalf of Others. The *       
Manager or the Management Corporation, or their affiliates, who may act as *    
managers for the Fund, may act in such capacities for other investors, *        
companies, partnerships or entities that may compete with the Properties *      
of the Fund.                                                                    

3.29 Manager or Management Corporation May Raise Capital for Others.  *         
The Manager or the Management Corporation, or their affiliates, who will *      
raise investment funds, may act in the same capacity for other investors, *     
companies, partnerships or entities that may compete with the Properties *      
of the Fund.                                                                    

3.30 Manager's or Management Corporation's Compensation May be a Conflict.  *   
The compensation plan for the Manager or the Management Corporation may *       
create a conflict between the interests of the Manager, the Management *        
Corporation, and the interests of the Fund. Capital from the Fund will be *     
used to fund the start-up and operation of Tuscan Gardens until stabilization * 
has occurred.                                                                   

3.31 Members of Manager or Management Corporation Allocating Time and *         
Resources to Affiliated Entities. Members of the Manager or the Management *    
Corporation may have a conflict in allocating their time and resources *        
between the Fund and other business activities they are involved with. *        
The Operating Agreement does not specify any minimum amount of time or *        
attention that the Manager or the Management Corporation or their Members *     
must devote to the Fund.

SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS                               

This Offering Circular, as well as other documents connected herewith, *        
contain "forward-looking statements," such as statements related to *           
financial condition and prospects, lending risks, plans for future business *   
development and marketing activities, capital spending and financing *          
sources, capital structure, the effects of regulation and competition, *        
and the prospective business of the Fund. In some cases you can identify *      
these statements by forward-looking words such as "anticipate," "believe," *    
"estimate," "expect," "intend," "may," "will," "continue," "anticipate," *      
"could," "would," "project," "plan," or the negative or plural of these *       
words as well as other or similar words and expressions.                        

You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of *         
future events. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number *       
of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those described in *         
"Risk Factors." In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, *       
the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this Offering *       
Circular may not occur and actual results could differ materially and *

ITEM 6                                                                          
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS                                                         

The Fund intends to acquire (1) to ten (10) parcels of real estate in the *     
United States, developing and constructing on each parcel a luxurious senior *  
housing community consisting of independent living, assisted living and/or *    
memory care for approximately sixty (60) to two-hundred and forty (240) *       
residents (collectively the "Properties"), and ultimately to own and/or *       
operate or sell the Properties.                                                 

In addition, the Fund also contemplates, from time to time, the acquiring *     
existing senior housing communities offering some combination of independent *  
living, assisted living and/or memory care where a substantial value addition * 
can be made by the management team resulting in favorable economic benefits *   
to the Fund. Those opportunities may or may not be in the luxurious senior *    
housing segment, but would incorporate mid-market to upper core senior housing *
community facilities.                                                           

The Manager may employ a Licensed Real Estate Broker, which may be an *         
affiliate, to manage the Properties under an appropriate property management *  
agreement and will pay a reasonable monthly management fee for services *       
provided. The Manager will manage the Fund so as to provide for the generation *
of distributable income through the operations of the Properties. The Manager * 
shall make monthly distributions of the funds available through the leasehold * 
of the Properties on a monthly basis and from operations annually, subject *    
to retention of reasonable working capital reserves, determined by and in *     
the discretion of the Manager. There will be no pro rata distribution for *     
partial months. No revenue and, therefore, no distributable income, will be *   
generated, if at all, until the properties are identified, purchased, *         
developed, constructed, and operating. There will be a lapse in time between *  
the date of any investment in the Fund until the Properties are completed and * 
operating.                                                                      

The Manager will attempt to minimize operating expenses, while keeping the *    
Properties well maintained. Throughout the term, the Manager will attempt *     
to maximize value of the Properties through the maximization of the net *       
operating income generated from operations of the Properties.

The properties that will be acquired and/or developed by the Fund are *         
intended to consist of properties which are primarily located in primary *      
market areas which reflect mid to upper income demographics within an *         
age cohort of 75 and above which are under-served by existing senior *          
housing facilities. The senior housing communities will have approximately *    
130,000 to 210,000 square feet located on parcels of approximately 5 to *       
12 acres.

accrue for ninety (90) days from the Date of Investment on all Properties *     
for Class A Preferred Members, or on a particular Property for each of *        
the additional Preferred Class Members, payable monthly thereafter; and,        

(b) Twenty percent (20%) of the Net Distributable Cash Flow on all *            
Properties for Class A Preferred Members or on a particular Property *          
for each of the additional Preferred Class Members, payable annually; and       

(c) A Premium Preference of five percent (5%) of the Liquidity Proceeds *       
upon a Liquidity Event or such additional amount which may be required if *     
greater than five percent (5%), payable as a premium, to provide a *            
Preferred Member a non-compounded annual cumulative rate of return of at *      
least fifteen percent (15%).                                                    

12.3.2 Lump-Sum Method. The Lump-Sum Method shall represent *     
distribution on all Properties for Class A Preferred Members or on a *          
particular Property for each of the additional Preferred Class Members *        
equal to sixty percent (60%) of the Liquidity Proceeds.                         

12.4 Fixed Rates of Return on Threshold Invested Capital.                       

(a) A Fixed Rate of Return of eight percent (8%)of Invested Capital per *       
annum payable on a monthly basis commencing ninety (90) days after receipt *    
of funds for those Preferred Members who have invested up to Ninety-Nine *      
Thousand Nine Hundred and Ninety-Nine Dollars ($99,999) and elected the *       
Growth & Income Method of distribution.                                         

(b) A Fixed Rate of Return of nine percent (9%) of Invested Capital per *       
annum payable on a monthly basis commencing ninety (90) days after receipt *    
of funds for those Preferred Members who have invested One Hundred Thousand *   
Dollars ($100,000) to Two Hundred Forty-Nine Thousand Nine Hundred and *        
Ninety-Nine Dollars ($249,999) and elected the Growth & Income Method of *      
distribution.                                                                   

(c) A Fixed Rate of Return of ten percent (10%) of Invested Capital per annum * 
payable on a monthly basis commencing ninety (90) days after receipt of funds * 
for those Preferred Members who have invested Two Hundred Fifty Thousand *      
Dollars ($250,000) or more and elected the Growth & Income Method of *          
distribution.                                                                   

(d) If, in the discretion of the Manager, it is in the best interest of the *   
Fund, the Fixed Rate of Return may be accrued to the Preferred Member's *       
Capital Account rather than distributed in cash.                                

12.5 Redemption of Preferred Units. The Manager's business model anticipates *  
a series of Liquidity Events on one or more Properties of the Fund within a *   
five to seven year time frame from any particular investment by a Preferred *   
Member. Liquidity Events may provide for an ongoing series of redemptions *     
as more specifically set out herein.                                            

(a) Any Preferred Member may request a redemption of the Preferred Member's *   
Preferred Units commencing on the sixtieth (60th) month of the Preferred *      
Member's Investment Date and continuing thereafter (Redemption Request). *      
Upon receipt of the Preferred Member's Redemption Request, Manager shall *      
provide for a redemption of the Preferred Member's Membership Interest *        
within six (6) months thereof based upon the most recent Valuation Event *      
on all properties for Class A Preferred Members, or on a particular *           
Property for each of the additional Preferred Class Members.                    

(b) For such purpose, the Manager will provide a Valuation Event within the *   
first quarter of each year to establish the value of Properties owned by the *  
Fund, individually and cumulatively, as of December 31 of the prior year.       

(c) In the event that the Manager, in its reasonable discretion, determines *   
that a redemption pursuant to a Redemption Request hereinabove would not *      
optimize the value of the Preferred Member's Preferred Units, the Manager *     
shall have the right to extend redemption of the Redemption Request by an *     
additional period of six (6) months.                                            

(d) The Manager may redeem all or any portion of the Preferred Units at *       
the Manager's sole and exclusive discretion at any time after thirty-six *      
(36) months from the date which the Certificate of Occupancy is issued; *       
provided, however, that such redemption shall be for a Unit Value not *         
less than an amount which reflects a fifteen percent (15%) annual *             
non-compounded cumulative return to the Preferred Members, or on the *          
value of all Properties for Class A Preferred Members or on a specific *        
Property for the other Preferred Class Members, whichever is higher.
