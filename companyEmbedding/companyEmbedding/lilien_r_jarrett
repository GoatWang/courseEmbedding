			Mr. Lilien is the Managing Partner of Bendigo Partners, LLC, which he founded in 2008. Bendigo Partners engages in venture capital investing and advisory services within the financial services industry. Bendigo's investment model is for one or more of its partners to be employed within its investments. From September 2012 to July 2014, Mr. Lilien served as the Chief Executive Officer of Kapitall Inc., an online investing platform. From 2003 to 2008, he served as President and Chief Operating Officer of E*TRADE Financial Corporation. In this role, he was responsible for the tactical execution of all of E*TRADE's global business strategies. Previously, he served as the President and Chief Brokerage Officer at E*TRADE Securities. In this capacity, Mr. Lilien reorganized the business, adding new product lines and providing innovative brokerage capabilities to its retail, institutional, and corporate clients around the world. With experience in more than 40 global markets, he was instrumental in developing a flexible infrastructure for E*TRADE's brokerage units designed to provide retail and institutional clients with seamless execution, clearing, and settlement. Prior to joining E*TRADE, Mr. Lilien spent 10 years as Chief Executive Officer at TIR (Holdings) Limited, a global institutional broker, which E*TRADE acquired in 1999. Mr. Lilien currently serves as President of the Jazz Foundation of America, is on the Board of Directors of Barton Mines Corporation, the Baryshnikov Arts Center and Tradier, Inc., and is on the Advisory Board of WFUV FM Radio. In April 2015, he joined the Board of Directors of ITG (NYSE: ITG), an independent execution broker and research provider, and served as interim CEO from August 2015 until January 2016. Mr. Lilien received his B.A. in Economics from the University of Vermont. We believe Mr. Lilien's qualifications to serve on the Board of Directors include his experience in founding and building financial services companies. The Board also benefits from his extensive leadership experience and his ability to provide strategic guidance.
