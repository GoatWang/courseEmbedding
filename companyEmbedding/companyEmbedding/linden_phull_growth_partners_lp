Mark began his post-graduate legal career as Counsel to the United States Securities Exchange Commission in the Division of Corporation Finance. He was responsible for the primary legal services of  domestic and international corporate financings associated with public/private securities offerings, changes in control, complex recapitalizations, tender and exchange offers, and “roll-up” transactions.
After leaving the SEC in 1991, Mark joined the legal team at Columbia Energy Group, Inc. – a large multinational vertically integrated energy company.

He structured, negotiated and financed dozens of acquisitions in the retail propane and oil and gas exploration and production industries ranging in value from just under one million to over $250 million.  During his tenure at Columbia Propane/Columbia Petroleum, these subsidiaries combined represented a revenue stream of $320 million, employing about 2,000 employees.  At the time of its sale, Columbia Propane was the fourth largest LP company in the U.S.
Most recently, Mark was Chief Executive Officer of and counsel to North American Propane, a holding company, and its three operating subsidiaries which were engaged in the diversified retail energy markets whose principal businesses were the retail and wholesale distribution of propane, heating oil, petroleum distillates, packaged gases and related products and services (plumbing, HVAC, etc.) in nine (9) northeastern U.S. states.

Paul J. Coviello of Philadelphia, PA has been elected to the Board of Directors of U.S. Preventive Medicine.








Paul’s wealth management complements the wellness, clinical and business acumen of other board members.


Jacksonville, FL (PRWEB)
November 21, 2013
 Paul J. Coviello, CFP of Philadelphia, PA has been elected to the Board of Directors of U.S. Preventive Medicine (http://www.uspm.com), headquartered in Northeast Florida. The announcement was made by Chairman of the Board, David Gee.  Coviello is the Managing Partner of Linden Phull Growth Partners, LP.

“USPM is very pleased to have Paul Coviello as an addition to our board of directors,” stated Gee. “His experience in wealth management complements the wellness experience, clinical expertise and business acumen of other board members in representing USPM shareholders.”
U.S. Preventive Medicine has created a comprehensive clinical practice of preventive medicine with primary, secondary and tertiary prevention services. Primary prevention consists of a health risk assessment to determine a participant’s wellness and risk status. Secondary prevention addresses risk factors and signs of impending conditions to employ action plans that promote pragmatic behaviors and activities. Tertiary prevention employs initiatives using evidence-based guidelines for management of chronic conditions for individuals with a known condition to prevent incapacity or recurrences.
Gee explains, “The wellness programs of U.S. Preventive Medicine employ an evidence-based health assessment as well as biometric screening. Each member receives his or her own personal Prevention Score™. Technology then allows members to access their information on the web or on a mobile device. The systems used have created a very high level of participation among users.”
