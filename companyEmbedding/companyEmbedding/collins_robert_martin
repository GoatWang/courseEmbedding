Collins, Robert Martin (1843–1913)
from Brisbane Courier




Robert Collins, n.d.from Pastoral Review, 15 September 1913

	Hon. Robert Martin Collins, M.L.C., died at Tamrookum at 5 minutes past 1 p.m. to-day, after a short illness. Deceased was 70 years of age. Extreme regret is felt throughout the whole district.

	The death of the Hon. Robert Collins, M.L.C., removes one of the best known figures in the pastoral world of Queensland, and one who will be much missed. It is stated that he was the second grazier on the Logan, and for many years the name of Collins has been a household word in that portion of the State. The late Mr. Robert Collins was born in Sydney on December 17, 1848, and received his education in Brisbane and Sydney. His scholastic career came to a close when he was 18 years of age, and early in life he was associated with his father (the late Mr. John Collins) and his two brothers (Messrs. George and William Collins) in pastoral enterprises. In 1875 Morney Plains and Whitula stations, in the South Gregory district, were taken up by the late Mr. Robert Collins and his younger brother, these two being the pioneers of that country, and the young men were the first to take sheep west of Cooper's Creek. In the same year Mount Leonard, on the Lower Diamantina, was taken up and stocked, and in 1877, on the sale of some of the stations, Warenda, in the North Gregory, was purchased, and Mount Merlin taken up. In 1883 the Eulolo run in the Flinders district was taken up and stocked. The late Mr. Collins also took up country elsewhere in Queensland, and also in the Northern Territory, his runs being stocked with both sheep and cattle. In all the outside work Mr. Robert Collins took an active part, and his experiences were almost always severe and somewhat dramatic. Mr. Collins had made his home at Tamrookum, on the Upper Logan, and he took a close interest in local affairs. For six years he was a member of the Tabragalba Divisional Board, and at the general election of 1896 he successfully contested the Albert as an independent supporter of the Government led by Sir Hugh Nelson. As a member of the Lower House he took an independent stand in many matters. He seldom spoke but when he did he commanded attention. In June of this year he was appointed to a seat in the Legislative Council. He was accepted as one of the best authorities on stock matters in the State. He was a member of the Select Committee appointed by Parliament to report on the 'brands' system and attended many conferences on kindred subjects, and took a prominent part in all their deliberations. He was the author of a very elaborate scheme for branding and ear-marking cattle. In the various scientific societies and public institutions of the State Mr. Collins took a deep interest, and was at one time president of the Queensland Royal Geographical Society in recognition of his services in Australian exploration.

	In business circles the late Mr. Collins was a director of Messrs Moreheads Limited and a director of the Q.M.E. and A. Company. He was of a retiring disposition but was generous to a fault, and his loss will be keenly felt by many. He was very fond of home life, and was a well read man, Carlyle being one of his favourite writers. He made two visits to the old land, travelling through America on one trip. He is survived by his widow and seven children—six daughters and a son (Mr. Christopher Collins). Five of the daughters are married, their respective husbands being Messrs. H. Bruxner, Colin Philp, J. Ralston (manager of the Q. N. Bank, Beaudesert), de Burgh Persse, jun., and Captain Douglas Harris. The youngest daughter, Miss M. Collins, lives at Tamrookum. The funeral will take place tomorrow (Wednesday) and for the convenience of sympathising friends in the city a special train will leave South Brisbane at 10:30 a.m., and will reach Brisbane on the return journey at 9.50.

Robert Martin Collins (17 December 1843 – 18 August 1913) was an explorer, grazier, member of both the Queensland Legislative Council and the Queensland Legislative Assembly.[1]

Early life[edit]
Collins was born in December 1843 at Sydney, New South Wales, to John Collins and his wife Anne (née Martin).[2] A year after he was born, his family moved to the Logan district of Queensland to take shares in Mundoolun, a property that a friend of his father had taken up.[2] Collins was educated at St John's School in Brisbane and later boarded at Calder House School, Sydney.[1]
In 1863, Collins joined his father and brother, William to form John Collins & Sons and for the next ten years he divided his time between Mundoolun and Westgrove, another property his father had purchased in 1863. In 1873, and hearing accounts of the country out west, he set out to inspect it for himself, the trip taking three months and taking him as far as Diamantina. This was but the first of many expeditions he made out west, making him known as an authority on Western Queensland.
In 1877, his family, along with Thomas McIlwraith, William Forrest, and Englishman, Sir William Ingram joined together to form the North Australian Pastoral Company. The company owned large tracts of land in both Queensland and South Australia as well as Alexandria Station in the Northern Territory and Collins and his brother made regular trips to inspect and purchase land.
Political career[edit]
Collins turned to politics and in 1896, standing as an independent[1] in the seat of Albert, he defeated the sitting member, Thomas Plunkett, Sr. by a narrow margin.[3][3] He served the electorate for three years before Plunkett regained the seat at the 1899 election.[4]
In June 1913, Premier Digby Denham[5] appointed Collins to the Legislative Council but he served only two months before his death in August of that year.[1]
While in America, Collins heard stories of Yellowstone National Park and for many years kept closely with that park's progress. From the 1880s onwards, he fought for the preservation of the McPherson Range, and was a founder of the Queensland system of National Parks, convincing the state government to bring in to legislation laws to protect them.[2]
Personal life[edit]
in 1879, Collins married Arabella Clotilda Smyth in Ireland and together had seven children.[1] As well as his pastoral interests, he was a director of the Bank of North Queensland and the Queensland Meat Export Co. and in 1896 was president of the Queensland Royal Geographical Society.[2]
Collins died at Tamrookum and was buried in the Tamrookum Anglican Cemetery.[6] A sign of his importance and the respect he held with the public was that a special train was engaged to take the hundreds of mourners from Brisbane to his funeral, returning home late that evening.[7]

In June 1913, Premier Digby Denham[5] appointed Collins to the Legislative Council but he served only two months before his death in August of that year.[1]
While in America, Collins heard stories of Yellowstone National Park and for many years kept closely with that park's progress. From the 1880s onwards, he fought for the preservation of the McPherson Range, and was a founder of the Queensland system of National Parks, convincing the state government to bring in to legislation laws to protect them.[2]
Personal life[edit]
in 1879, Collins married Arabella Clotilda Smyth in Ireland and together had seven children.[1] As well as his pastoral interests, he was a director of the Bank of North Queensland and the Queensland Meat Export Co. and in 1896 was president of the Queensland Royal Geographical Society.[2]
Collins died at Tamrookum and was buried in the Tamrookum Anglican Cemetery.[6] A sign of his importance and the respect he held with the public was that a special train was engaged to take the hundreds of mourners from Brisbane to his funeral, returning home late that evening.[7]

Collins, Robert Martin (1843–1913)
by Sally O'Neill
This article was published in Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 3, (MUP), 1969
This is a shared entry with William Collins





Robert Collins, n.d.State Library of Queensland, 68167
Robert Martin Collins (1843-1913) and William Collins (1846-1909) were the first and second sons of the five children of John Collins, pastoralist of Mundoolun, Queensland, and his wife Anne, née Martin. Robert Martin was born on 17 December 1843 in Sydney, four years after his parents had arrived there from Queenstown, Ireland. In June 1844 they left Sydney to take shares in Mundoolun, a new run taken up by a friend in the Logan district south of Brisbane. William was born at Mundoolun on 26 April 1846.
Robert and William were educated at St John's School in Brisbane and later at Calder House School, Sydney, as boarders. In 1863 they joined their father, beginning the close working relationship that was later given legal form as John Collins & Sons. For the next ten years Robert and William divided their time between Mundoolun and Westgrove on the Dawson River, which John Collins had bought in 1863 to carry the sheep sickening in the wetter southern district. In 1873 Robert decided that the sheep should be taken still further west; fascinated by accounts of the country west of Cooper's Creek pioneered by John Costello and Patrick Durack during drought seasons, he rode out to inspect it for himself. His explorations took him three months and as far west as the Diamantina. This was the first of many expeditions which won him repute in pastoral circles as an authority on Western Queensland. In January 1874 John Collins & Sons bought Whitula on Cooper's Creek from Costello and also blocks on the Morney Plains. By 1878 these and additional blocks had been stocked and sold. Robert and his brothers made several westward trips to examine the country, to accompany the movement of stock and to supervise the siting or sale of the stations. In 1877 they were among the organizers of the North Australian Pastoral Co., of which (Sir) Thomas McIlwraith, William Forrest and Sir William Ingram, proprietor of the Illustrated London News, were also members. The company's land included nine thousand sq. miles (23,309 km²) in South Australia, properties in the North Gregory district of Queensland, Alexandria station in the Northern Territory and land west of Bowen. The Collins brothers played a major part in the company's transactions, one or the other travelling out to inspect or take possession of land.
By 1878 Robert told his family that these expeditions were hindering 'more rational, if not more profitable' employment, and in May 1878 he and William left on a long-postponed tour which took them across North America to Europe. While in Britain they watched experiments with the Bell-Coleman system of refrigeration; later they took part in the purchase of a machine and in the successful shipment of frozen meat from Australia to England. In Ireland Robert met Arabella Clotilda, daughter of Christopher Smyth of Ballyroe near Cloyne, County Cork. They were married in Cork on 13 February 1879, left Ireland in March and arrived at Brisbane in May, at the same time as William who had travelled separately.
Both brothers were members of the Queensland branch of the Royal Geographical Society, Robert being its president in 1896. He represented Albert in the Legislative Assembly in 1896-98. In June 1913 he was nominated to the Legislative Council, but he died on 18 August at Tamrookum, near Beaudesert. He was survived by his wife, six daughters and a son. Six hundred people attended the funeral, many coming from Brisbane in a special train. An Anglican church was erected to his memory at Tamrookum. William died in Brisbane after a heart attack on 22 January 1909. He was survived by his wife, Mary Adelaide Gwendoline, daughter of Fitzclarence Roberts of Dunedin, New Zealand, whom he had married about 1900, and by three daughters and a son.
As experts in stock and land both brothers were active in efforts to improve conditions in the Queensland pastoral industry. Robert's suggestion in May 1893 that meatworks would help the export trade led to the passing of the Meat and Dairy Encouragement Act in September. He was active in forming the Queensland Meat Export Co. and became a director. As chairman of the select committee in 1897 on the branding of cattle he devised a new method of earmarking and branding which was incorporated into the Brands Act of 1898. William was a member of the board responsible for handling the funds established under the Meat and Dairy Encouragement Act, one of the commissioners who visited the United States in 1896 to inquire into Texas fever, and a director of the Bank of North Queensland.
Robert Collins was one of the founders of the National Park system in Queensland. Impressed by accounts of the Yellowstone National Park on his visit to America, he had kept closely in touch with the developments there. From the 1880s he campaigned for the reservation of the wild and beautiful McPherson Range south of his home and although only partly successful he had awakened public interest in the concept of national parks and had persuaded the government to legislate for such reservations. The Act was passed in 1906 but the Lamington National Park was not proclaimed until 1915.
Robert and William were modest, thoughtful and inclined to be shy, but always generous. They were well read; Carlyle was a favourite author and Charles Kingsley a childhood hero. They were very fond of home life and always maintained close ties with the family.
