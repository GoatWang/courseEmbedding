 Autodesk Taps Mark J. Hawkins As CFO 
 Thu, 04/02/2009 - 5:05am 
 Comments 
 by  

 



SAN RAFAEL, Calif. (AP) -- Design and engineering software maker Autodesk Inc. said Thursday that it named Mark J. Hawkins its chief financial officer, effective April 27.
Autodesk had been searching for a new CFO since the company said last year that Alfred Castino would resign to spend more time with his family.
Hawkins, 50, previously worked as CFO of Logitech International.
Also Thursday, the company said that it will add to previously announced plans to cut $130 million in expenses by slashing $100 million to $150 million from its operating expenses. The company reiterated its fiscal first-quarter outlook as well.
Autodesk is set to hold its annual analyst day meeting on Thursday.
