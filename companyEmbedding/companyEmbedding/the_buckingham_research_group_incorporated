Research | Buckingham Research Group























































Research


On average each analyst has over 15 years of industry experience. Our analysts are recognized for their in-depth knowledge of their industries and companies, as well as having a keen grasp of the financials. We strive for a balanced approach that focuses on both long and short ideas. On the long side, we seek well-managed companies undergoing fundamental changes not yet reflected in the stock price. These companies typically have strong underlying value determined by various valuation methodologies. They should be able to demonstrate a sustainable competitive advantage, an above average return on capital, and improving cash flow generation to fund growth internally as well as the potential to return capital to shareholders. On the short side, we try to determine inflection points that demonstrate a deterioration in fundamentals and increased competition. We rely heavily on balance sheet analysis and cash flow trends in identifying negative trends within businesses/industries.

The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated Deploys Array Networks DesktopDirect for Tablet Access to Business Applications




        Posted: Tue Feb 21, 2012 02:05:09 PM
    



         
    



MILPITAS, CA  February 21, 2012  Array Networks Inc., a global leader in application, desktop and cloud service delivery, today announced that The Buckingham Research Group Incorportated has deployed DesktopDirect to enable employees to access all corporate applications from iPads and remote PCs while eliminating data leakage and maintaining full regulatory compliance.DesktopDirect meets all of my needs and continues to scale, said Michael Marrano, CTO for The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated. Our employees wanted to use their iPads to access all of our corporate applications. DesktopDirect was in production in a matter of weeks. Without DesktopDirect, I was looking at a very expensive project spanning several months. With DesktopDirect I was able to enable full iPad access that was fully secure at a fraction of the cost of alternative solutions.Tablets are simple, light and portable, and are becoming increasingly affordable; as a result, many more employees are bringing their personal tablets to worka trend referred to as bring your own device (BYOD). As a consequence, IT management is presented with the challenges of maintaining corporate security and providing invisible, seamless access to applications while supporting the broad range of tablet devices on the market .Using an encrypted SSL connection, DesktopDirect provides secure access from tablets such as iPads to a users office PC via a low bandwidth connection that maintains corporate security protocols and prevents data leakage. The DesktopDirect mobile application opens a secure window to office desktops that allows only for control of secure remote environments  with business and personal data never mixing. And because the DesktopDirect mobile app can be downloaded to and launched from any iOS or Android device, IT can avoid providing support for specific mobile devices. With DesktopDirect, IT maintains full control of corporate data while employees can choose the best device to fit their personal requirements.The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated is a perfect example of the benefits provided by DesktopDirect, said Lior Rapaport, director of product management for Array Networks. Like many industries, Financial Services is heavily dependent on maintaining compliance and ensuring that confidential data does not leak outside the corporate network. DesktopDirect provides a solution that eliminates the possibility of data leakage and simultaneously enables remote access for any employee looking to access corporate applications using an Apple iPad, Android tablet or remote PC .DesktopDirect is available now directly from Array Networks and through authorized Array Total Value partners. The DesktopDirect mobile app is now available in the Apple App Store and the Android Marketplace.
