SAR Information








On June 1, 2002, a law was enacted that establishes a new system*1 for radio wave emissions by wireless mobile phones. It sets a local exposure limit to radio frequency energy for certain parts of the human body (mainly the head). It employs a unit of measurement known as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR)*2. The maximum value for this limit is set at 2 W/kg. With the enactment of this law, a variety of new standard values and a new measurement method*3 have been defined. Through our website, The DOCOMO is making available to anyone interested the SAR values measured for all our handsets and the SAR values measured abroad for all our international roaming handsets. This information is being provided in order to...

Help the public better understand the intent of the law.
Assure the public of the safety of our mobile phones.

*1 Determined by regulations for enforcing the Radio Law.
*2 Specific Absorption Rate (SAR):
The electrical power absorbed by the unit mass of the human body as a result of exposure to an electromagnetic field. Whole-body SAR averages SAR over whole body, while partial-body SAR averages SAR of any 1g or 10g tissues of the human body.
*3 Clarification of standard values and measurement methods:
A variety of measurement methods were proposed in the past. The local SAR measurement method for the head was finally standardized. This method was established based on recommendations from standardization organizations around the world including Japan.









About SAR of Individual Products



The SAR information documents that are made available in English on this page relate exclusively to NTT DOCOMO’s handsets for International Roaming. These handsets fully comply with the government requirements* regarding exposure to radio waves. * As set by the Japanese Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, and the Council of the European Union.

For information on other terminals, please refer to the Japanese version of the SAR page.

                    NTT DoCoMo Says Profit Declined 6% In First Half                
NTT DoCoMo reported today that its profit fell 6 percent for the most recent six-month period from a year earlier as price-cutting rivals lured customers away from the company, Japan's top provider of mobile phone service. In a market with nearly every potential mobile phone user already seeming to own one, DoCoMo is trying to fend off an assault by smaller rivals that are eager to capture a piece of its dominant market share.











                    One Bid Is In; Cell Company Awaits Others                
Cingular Wireless submitted a $35 billion bid yesterday for AT&T Wireless, according to people close to the auction, while Vodafone was putting the final touches on its offer and Nextel was said to be considering one. But NTT DoComo, which owns about a 17 percent stake in AT&T Wireless and had indicated that it was exploring a bid, has decided against participating in the auction, these people said.















                    NTT DoCoMo Earnings Aided By Sales of New Wireless Gear                
NTT DoCoMo Inc., the world's second-largest wireless carrier after Vodafone, said today that it earned 197 billion yen ($1.6 billion) in the three months to June, thanks to a new lineup of handsets with cameras and growing demand for high-speed phone service. DoCoMo is trying to regain its footing this year after two rough years in which new subscriptions to its mobile phone service slowed and investments overseas soured. The company has been badly outflanked by rivals who were quicker to offer phones with cameras and cheaper high-speed Internet connections, trends that have hurt DoCoMo's third-generation phone service.

Helped by sales of its popular camera phones, NTT DoCoMo Inc. of Japan said yesterday that it earned 213 billion yen ($1.8 billion) in the fiscal year that ended March 31, exceeding analysts' expectations. The company said it expected profit to nearly triple but revenue to grow just 1.9 percent this year. Ken Belson (NYT)











                    NTT DoCoMo Reports a Slight Profit                
NTT DoCoMo Inc. barely returned to profitability in the half-year to September, it said today, but it slashed its full-year forecasts. Its overseas investments soured, and its latest phones failed to catch on with finicky consumers. The dismal numbers cast a shadow over DoCoMo's ambitious introduction a year ago of what it hoped would be the world's first full-fledged third-generation phone network. The company, Japan's largest mobile phone carrier, hoped that by rolling out the technology ahead of competitors, it could corner the market on phones that offer video services, global roaming and higher speeds for sending data.











                    World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Nippon Considers Write-Offs                
The Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation will discuss with third parties whether it needs to book losses on the overseas investments of NTT DoCoMo Inc.in the six-month period ending Monday, the president of NTT, Norio Wada, left, said. His comment came after The Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported that DoCoMo is expected to book 500 billion yen ($4.07 billion) in valuation losses on its shareholdings in overseas companies. The NTT group will discuss the matter with third parties including auditing and consulting companies and investment banks, Mr. Wada said. DoCoMo said earlier that it would carry out any write-downs if necessary after it conducts an overall study of its businesses, including the value of overseas partners' shares and other factors.











                    World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Cellphone Shipments Plunge                
Shipments of mobile phones plunged in May as the Japanese market approached the saturation point. Japanese handset makers shipped 3.24 million units in May, 28 percent fewer than in May 2001. It was the 12th consecutive decline. NTT DoCoMo Inc. remains Japan's largest carrier with more than half of the market, but the company's third-generation phone technology has yet to catch on.

                    World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Loss For Telecom Concern                
Japan's leading mobile phone operator, NTT DoCoMo Inc., will probably post a loss for the fiscal year ending today, because of larger-than-expected losses on overseas investments. DoCoMo, the largest stock by capitalization on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, will lose 100 billion yen ($758 million), the company's first full-year loss, according to a report in Nihon Keizai Shimbun. DoCoMo is expected to take a one trillion yen ($7.6 billion) one-time loss, including a write-down of its $9.8 billion investment in AT&T Wireless Services. A decision on a write-down may be made today, the company's president, Keiji Tachikawa, said. Ken Belson (NYT)











                    World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Faster Cellphones                
A leading operator of mobile phones, NTT DoCoMo Inc., expects to begin faster cellphone service in Europe in the second half of 2002, said its president, Keiji Tachikawa. DoCoMo expects Hutchison 3G UK Holdings Ltd., the British-based telecommunications unit of Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., led by the the Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing, to start the services. DoCoMo owns 20 percent of Hutchison 3G. DoCoMo, based in Tokyo, has spent about 600 billion yen ($5 billion) for stakes in European cellphone companies.











                    Japan Plan On Wireless To Be Delayed                
NTT DoCoMo Inc. said today that it would delay plans for the full commercial introduction of its next-generation wireless service, dealing a setback to the mobile communications industry. The company said it would miss the May 30 starting date for its much-anticipated third-generation, or 3G, wireless service. While the delay is expected to have little effect on DoCoMo's finances, it raises questions about when such services might be profitable.










WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING: ASIA

                    BANK LOANS TO FINANCE AT&T STAKE                
NTT DoCoMo Inc., Japan's dominant cellular phone company, said it was borrowing 1.2 trillion yen ($10.3 billion) from five Japanese banks to pay for the 16 percent stake it is acquiring in AT&T Wireless Group. According to regulatory filings in the United States, the company plans to repay the loans in part with cash raised from the sale of 460,000 new shares of stock, which analysts expect the company to begin marketing to global investors today. DoCoMo turned to the banks after a 40 percent plunge in its stock price last fall limited its ability to sell new stock.

                    RAISING CASH FOR GROWTH                
NTT DoCoMo Inc., the Japanese mobile phone giant, has approached bankers about a possible sale of as much as 1 trillion yen ($9 billion) worth of new shares as it seeks ways to finance global expansion. The company is also considering listing its shares in the United States. Speculation about a big NTT DoCoMo offering has helped depress the Japanese stock market because of fears that there is not enough investor appetite to absorb all the new shares.

NTT Docomo, Inc. has been providing mobile communication services, primarily for mobile phones, under the slogan of “Creating New Communications Culture” as Japan’s largest mobile communications carrier. In 2015, NTT DoCoMo revamped their “traffic data warehouse” that handles traffic data for the billing/settlement system using Microsoft SQL Server. As a result, quick analysis and usage of billing data was enabled for more than 66 million subscriber lines to further improve customer service.
Further cost structure reforms and improvements in a flexible data platform to cope with ever-changing managerial needs have also been promoted.
Decision on fundamental overhaul of data warehouse processing to cut costs and improve usability
While terminals – such as mobile phones, smartphones, and tablets – become ever more diverse, and new services are introduced one after another, it is essential for mobile carriers to handle new services and customer needs, and quickly and appropriately develop infrastructure to support them. In order to do so, a data analysis and usage system to understand and reflect ever-changing user needs in real time is indispensable.
Under such circumstances, a “traffic data warehouse (hereafter, Traffic DWH)” that aggregates usage data for all subscriber lines which is situated at the back-end of “MoBills”, a billing system for accounting and settlement of subscribers has been renewed using SQL Server. NTT Docomo, Inc. (hereafter, NTT Docomo) implemented reliable security measures, established secure, flexible, and quick traffic data analysis platform, and significantly curtailed system costs.
“NTT Docomo introduced reform measures to provide greater value from last fiscal year. One of their policies is to accelerate our business using data from Docomo account’s settlement platform. The recent renewal of the Traffic DWH is a part of the trials to create new services and value using that settlement data,” commented Yuki Shimamura [General Manager, Billing System, Information Systems Division, NTT Docomo, Inc.].
MoBills is the billing and settlement platform for all of the more than 66 million subscriber lines for NTT Docomo, and SQL Server has recently been introduced for the Traffic DWH that handles the data analysis platform for MoBills. For this Traffic DWH, different companies’ database and business intelligence (BI) products were combined, and business applications were constructed on it for operation before renewal. However, Shinichi Shimamoto [Assistant Manager, Billing System, Information Systems Division, NTT Docomo, Inc.] disclosed that many issues have recently arisen.
“Firstly, convenience-related issues, such as slow search and download, were mentioned by the User Division. The system capability was not able to keep up with the current pace of business. A more important point was the efficiency and cost of periodic development. For example, if an output form for ledger data is changed, the overall application needs to be modified, but although the change looks small, the development and modification costs were kept high.”
In the case of the former Traffic DWH, the necessary data was extracted from the enormous traffic data of MoBills via multiple summary processes due to the IT technology specifications and restrictions at the construction stage. Therefore, the final output ledger was modified and the application that handles the intermediate processing needs to be changed, so the cost for their development, man-hours, and testing, etc. increased significantly.
“It was evident that it would be difficult to achieve meaningful cost reductions, which was the main management issue, as long as a multi-layered application structure exists. Thus, efforts were made to fundamentally revamp the Traffic DWH processing method in order to cut costs while simultaneously improving user convenience, which was the purpose of this project,” commented Mr. Shimamoto.
Decision to adopt SQL Server based on powerful search function and cost effectivess
The Traffic DWH renewal project started in January 2014. Masaki Inoue [Manager, Billing System, Information Systems Division, NTT Docomo, Inc.], who organized the initial grand design at the beginning of the project, commented that he thought this was a unique opportunity to revamp the system to enable it to contribute further to business growth and expansion by flexibly coping with future changes in the business environment rather than simply controlling billing information, as had been the case when the project started.
“If the existing system had simply been updated as it was, it would certainly have been safer and easier. However, the system itself must be flexible enough to be changed in the face of future business opportunities, otherwise new value would never be gained. Those of us who were in charge of the system had to take on the challenge of constructing a new flexible system that could quickly cope with a variety of data analysis demands from top management and the work front in order to achieve the mid-term goals.”
Accordingly, a product comparison of platforms for new information analysis and usage was promoted, and we decided to adopt SQL Server in April 2014. Kenshiro Kitayama [Billing System, Information Systems Division, NTT Docomo, Inc.] mentioned the powerful search function as a deciding factor.
“We had built up our expectations about the columnstore index that could achieve dramatically superior query performance compared to conventional general row tables, and enable SQL Server to perform update processing. This function has fewer practical restrictions, and we evaluated that it enables flexible and quick data search in accordance with our requirements”.
Another deciding factor was its superior cost performance. In the case of SQL Server, the license for the main database engine includes everything, such as Integration Services, which is an ETL tool, Analysis Services and Reporting Services.
“This is suitable for DWH system processing including batch processing because those tools are included at no extra charge. In particular, we expected that the OLAP tool, which can use an in-memory database function, would enable significant cost improvements in analysis and search system processing. Moreover, all necessary tools are included in the main product, so it was judged to also be beneficial in terms of compatibility between database and tools,” commented Mr. Kitayama.
A flexible support contract that is unique to Microsoft Japan whereby a pay-as-you-go plan could be selected, not just a fixed amount from a maintenance fee menu, was also highly evaluated.
After deciding to adopt it, the design, development, and testing, etc. were quickly promoted, and tests on a head-to-head comparison between the old and new systems were conducted in December 2014. After confirming that quality is reliable, operation started in February 2015. Masanori Morita [Manager, Billing System, Information Systems Division, NTT Docomo, Inc.], who was in charge of application migration, explained that one reason for the quick migration of an enormous DWH that handles the traffic for all subscriber lines while safeguarding the high quality and safe operation was careful verification.
“The most important theme during the construction process was ensuring quality. Specifically, head-to-head comparisons were conducted on the processing results between the former and new systems, and it took two months of verification until the results matched perfectly in terms of the ledger. Even though the development period was short, sufficient time was set aside for verification, which was how we managed to realize such high quality.”
Mr. Inoue also commented, “The main reason we could complete the project with such high quality within such a short time was that all of the project members positively shared the sense of a “new challenge”, and promoted it with motivation and empathy until the end. Promoting the project in close cooperation with Microsoft Japan was also a big factor.”
In addition to significant cost savings for periodic development, 75% cut in software maintenance costs
As a system that introduces SQL Server at both scale and mission-critical levels, the new Traffic DWH that has recently been renewed using SQL Server can reasonably be considered Japan’s leading DWH. Norio Kawaguchi [Billing System, Information Systems Division, NTT Docomo, Inc.] revealed its scale by presenting its main numeric values.
“About 20 divisions of NTT Docomo in Japan use the Traffic DWH. As one index of the scale of the Traffic DWH, it handles over one billion items of traffic data per day. A minimum number is set for the right to access the ledger data per user, which is a maximum of about 2,000 cases a month. Various analysis axes are also provided, and about 160 types of screens are used. All traffic data is covered, so a couple of thousand records comprise a ledger as a large example.”
The principal advantage provided through the recent renewal is reduced costs for periodic development. SQL Server’s columnstore index enables a high performance search through a large amount of data, which was not possible with the former Traffic DWH, so multi-layered processing that used to be needed is no longer required, and most applications that were needed to create interim tables are also unnecessary.
“As a result, the number of interim tables and application materials have been reduced by thirty to forty percent compared to the existing version,” said Mr. Inoue.
Since the number of tables has been reduced, their maintenance costs have also been reduced by about twenty percent. In addition, the overall development scale has been reduced, and the number of tables created has also been reduced, so hidden maintenance costs, such as related failures caused by bug and setting errors are also reduced. This has been confirmed with the first periodic material release since the renewal in May 2015.
Software maintenance costs have been significantly reduced (by about 75%) compared to the previous ratio. As a result of integrating a combination of the old DWH database and analysis tools to SQL Server, additional expenses for analysis tools, etc. are no longer incurred. Also, most of the fixed costs are no longer needed because support can be used only in as necessary using the “premier support contract” based on a pay-as-you-go plan.
“Aside from the cost, some skills have been transferred thanks to support from Microsoft Japan during the development process, so the foundations for future development and troubleshooting have been laid within the project system, which is another gain,” noted Mr. Shimamoto.
The Information Systems Division expects a significant contribution will be made upon realization of the theme, i.e. cost cutting, which was the original intent as the system stabilizes further as time passes because the maintenance costs based on the pay-as-you-go plan will further reduce.
On the other hand, Mr. Morita pointed out that a remarkable effect has naturally been seen in terms of improved user convenience.
“The Traffic DWH receives and accumulates data once an hour from switching equipment and MoBills, and starts processing that data from midnight every day. It renews all ledgers with the latest data by 8:00 a.m. on the same day. In order to process over a billion traffic items a day, sufficient size has been prepared, but a further allowance has been received for the processing cycle to be completed by 8:00 a.m. on the same day as a result of improved data processing efficiency thanks to SQL Server”.
Aiming to create a real-time analysis platform to provide new added value
Mr. Inoue described his vision of further growth of MoBills as a platform to analyze and use data in real-time based on the experience of the new Traffic DWH that has been revamped by SQL Server.
“Batch processing used to be the standard as analysis systems for data usage, but analyzing each item of data as it is generated and reacting in response to trends will be more important in current conditions as the IoT market expands. For example, analyzing customers’ billing/settlement data in real-time, and quickly providing optimal additional value and services to each customer bolsters customer satisfaction, and helps to expand our business. In order to achieve that, we would like to advance the data analysis platform, such as Traffic DWH, to enable it to analyze and use enormous amounts of data in real-time.”
On the other hand, Mr. Kawaguchi noted that he anticipates the potential for improvements in in-house user convenience. Currently, Microsoft® SharePoint® is used as the front screen for Traffic DWH users, so Microsoft® Excel®-based UIs can easily be developed.
“We have also used Microsoft® Office in many cases internally, so we received very few inquiries from users regarding the user interface after the recent system renewal. One of the factors in selecting SQL Server is its inherent compatibility with MS Office, and we hope to provide more advanced functions and improve ease of use for end users while maintaining security.”
Mr. Shimamura emphasized the importance of MoBills and Traffic DWH again regarding NTT Docomo’s future business development, stating, “Promoting collaboration with all types of partner companies in order to react to ever-diversifying customer needs is specified as a mid-term goal. In other words, stepping up from the former “competition” to “cooperation and creation”. At the Information Systems Division and MoBills, we handle tasks to support the data platform for that, and Traffic DWH is a platform to collect and analyze the direct usage trends of users.”
“Currently, NTT Docomo is also promoting the renewal of the data warehouse of “ALADIN”, a customer management system, using SQL Server in the path of MoBills with a mid-term goal, “Cooperation and creation with partners in the smart life area and reinforcing competitiveness for communication business”, with further improvements in the platform for usage of customer data expected. SQL Server provides ongoing support for NTT Docomo’s future challenges.

NTT DOCOMO, Inc.[3][4] (株式会社NTTドコモ, Kabushiki Gaisha Enu Ti Ti Dokomo) is the predominant mobile phone operator in Japan. The name is officially an abbreviation of the phrase, "do communications over the mobile network", and is also from a compound word dokomo, meaning "everywhere" in Japanese.[5] Docomo provides phone, video phone (FOMA and Some PHS), i-mode (internet), and mail (i-mode mail, Short Mail, and SMS) services. The company's headquarters are in the Sanno Park Tower, Nagatachō, Chiyoda, Tokyo.[6] At the beginning of 2015, it was the fourth largest public company in Japan when measured by market capitalization.[7]
Docomo was spun off from Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) in August 1991 to take over the mobile cellular operations. It provides 2G (mova) PDC cellular services on the 800 MHz band, and 3G FOMA W-CDMA services on the 2 GHz (UMTS2100) and 800 MHz (UMTS800 (Band VI)) and 1700 MHz (UMTS1700 (Band IX)) bands, and 4G LTE services. Its businesses also included PHS (Paldio), paging, and satellite. Docomo ceased offering a PHS service on January 7, 2008.

Customers[edit]
NTT Docomo is a subsidiary of Japan's incumbent telephone operator, NTT. The majority of NTT Docomo's shares are owned by NTT (which is 33.71% government-owned). While some NTT shares are publicly traded, control of the company by Japanese interests (government and civilian) is guaranteed by the number of shares available to buyers. It provides wireless voice and data communications to subscribers in Japan. NTT Docomo is the creator of W-CDMA technology as well as mobile i-mode service. In late 1995, Docomo CEO hired the consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers for strategy development, and at that time worked on the first design of data services on mobile for NTT Docomo CEO.[citation needed]
NTT Docomo has more than 53 million customers (as of March 2008), which is more than half of Japan's cellular market. The company provides a wide variety of mobile multimedia services. These include i-mode which provides e-mail and internet access to over 50 million subscribers, FOMA, which was launched in 2001 as the world's first 3G mobile service based on W-CDMA, Xi, a 4G LTE mobile service which was launched on December 24, 2010, and Premium 4G, a LTE Advanced service which was launched on March 27, 2015.
In addition to wholly owned subsidiaries in Europe and North America, the company is expanding its global reach through strategic alliances with mobile and multimedia service providers in Asia-Pacific and Europe. NTT Docomo is listed on the Tokyo (9437), London (NDCM), and New York (DCM) stock exchanges.
On April 19, 2008, it was announced that Ryuji Yamada, the current co-president of NTT Docomo, will be promoted as the president of NTT Docomo in June 2008. Masao Nakamura will stay in NTT Docomo as a director and also the senior adviser. Since October 2006, when the introduction to the service which allows the user to carry their original phone number with a new provider was made, NTT Docomo has lost many users to KDDI and SoftBank. This promotion was made in order to get more users for NTT Docomo.[8] The company was the last major global mobile carrier to offer Apple's iPhone, which it finally did with the release of the iPhone 5s and 5c. This has been cited as one of the reasons for the steady stream of its customers switching for competing networks.[9]
In June 2011, the company announced that they were teaming up with McAfee to provide McAfee VirusScan Mobile for its Android mobile users.[10] In July 2012, NTT Docomo acquired Italy's Buongiorno in a deal worth 209 million euros.[11]
Research and development[edit]

On October 2007, the prototype Wellness mobile phone of Japan's NTT Docomo Inc. and Mitsubishi Electric Corp. was launched at CEATEC. It checks health with a motion sensor that detects body movement and measures calories, and includes a breathalyzer.[12]
On January 24, 2008, NTT Docomo announced a partnership with Google, which allowed all models after the FOMA904i models to view YouTube videos.[13][14]
NTT Docomo is a founding member of the Symbian Foundation.[15]
Earthquake warning system[edit]
From 2008, Docomo began offering a service called the "Area Mail Disaster Information Service" which broadcasts Earthquake Early Warning messages produced by the Japan Meteorological Agency to its subscribers with compatible handsets.[16] This service is provided free of charge and messages are limited to those areas affected by each particular alert. These alerts have a unique ring tone so they can be easily distinguished from incoming calls or messages.
Civil protection system[edit]
From 2014, under Civil Protection Law of Japan, Docomo began offering a service called the "Area Mail Disaster and Evacuation Information Service" which broadcasts J-Alert messages (including Earthquake Early Warning) produced by the Japan Fire and Disaster Management Agency to its subscribers with compatible handsets (e.g. Sony XPERIA, iPhone 5s, Samsung Galaxy).[17]
The message is broadcast when the military threat is imminent (e.g. North Korea's ballistic missile launching, terrorist attack to nuclear power plant), volcanic eruptions, or approaching tsunami.
Mascot[edit]

The company's mascot is Docomodake, a mushroom, which is quite a celebrity in Japan. He even is the hero of a Nintendo DS puzzle and platforming video game, Boing! Docomodake DS, which was also released in North America and Europe.[18] He also has a wide variety of merchandising such as cell phone straps, keychains, and plush dolls. As one type of advertising method, there are many types of Docomodakes such as mother and father, which symbolizes the plans that NTT Docomo offers.
Emoji[edit]
Emoji, a pictographic language being adopted around the world was first created by NTT DoCoMo. The first emoji was created in 1998 or 1999 by Shigetaka Kurita, who was part of the team working on NTT DoCoMo's i-mode mobile Internet platform. The first set of 176 12×12 pixel emoji was created as part of i-mode's messaging features to help facilitate electronic communication, and to serve as a distinguishing feature from other services.[19]
Investments outside Japan[edit]




GSMA Mobile World Congress, Barcelona 2008 99. Note the new logo.


NTT Docomo has a wide range of foreign investments. However, NTT Docomo was not successful in investing in foreign carriers. Docomo had invested very large multibillion-dollar amounts in KPN, KT Freetel, AT&T Wireless, and had to write-off sell all these investments in foreign carriers. As a result, Docomo booked a total of about US$10 billion in losses, while during the same time Docomo's Japan operations were profitable.
In December 2007, NTT Docomo and KT Freetel jointly invested 200 million USD for a total of 33% stake in U Mobile Malaysia.
In June 2008 NTT Docomo joined the non-profit Symbian Foundation led by Nokia to co-develop a new Symbian smartphone operating system based on the S60 platform, which resulted in Symbian^2 for the Japanese market.[20]
In November 2008, NTT Docomo bought a 26% stake in Tata Teleservices for 2.7 billion USD, the number 6 in Indian telecom industry and owned by the Tata group. India is the world's fastest-growing cellular market, adding as many as 9 million new customers a month. Tata Teleservices (which sells under the brand Tata Indicom and Virgin Mobile India) has 80 million subscribers as of October 2010. Though Tata Indicom is a CDMA based operator, they won GSM licenses as well, and the NTT Docomo-Tata venture is focused on GSM operation (called Tata DOCOMO). The Tata DOCOMO service was commercially launched in India in June 2009. Tata DOCOMO had about 32.82 million users at the end of June 2010.
They have also taken over Guamcell, among others, and so are now the main wireless operator in Guam.
Docomo is working on implementing its FeliCa-based payment system, called iD, overseas. It has already launched the system in Guam, as well as Shanghai and Beijing, China (however, as of November 2010, it has withdrawn iD terminals from all merchants in China).
Docomo Capital[edit]
Working closely with NTT Docomo's business and R&D divisions, Docomo Capital is in charge of NTT Docomo's venture investments in mobile related start-up companies, mainly in the United States and has committed $100M in capital. It has invested in Cooliris, Couchbase, Evernote, Fab.com, HighlightCam, Swype, TuneWiki, and Sigfox.[21]
DOCOMO Digital[edit]
DOCOMO Digital is the holding company for the global digital ecosystem platform business operations of NTT DOCOMO.

NTT DOCOMO, Inc.[3][4] (株式会社NTTドコモ, Kabushiki Gaisha Enu Ti Ti Dokomo) is the predominant mobile phone operator in Japan. The name is officially an abbreviation of the phrase, "do communications over the mobile network", and is also from a compound word dokomo, meaning "everywhere" in Japanese.[5] Docomo provides phone, video phone (FOMA and Some PHS), i-mode (internet), and mail (i-mode mail, Short Mail, and SMS) services. The company's headquarters are in the Sanno Park Tower, Nagatachō, Chiyoda, Tokyo.[6] At the beginning of 2015, it was the fourth largest public company in Japan when measured by market capitalization.[7]
Docomo was spun off from Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) in August 1991 to take over the mobile cellular operations. It provides 2G (mova) PDC cellular services on the 800 MHz band, and 3G FOMA W-CDMA services on the 2 GHz (UMTS2100) and 800 MHz (UMTS800 (Band VI)) and 1700 MHz (UMTS1700 (Band IX)) bands, and 4G LTE services. Its businesses also included PHS (Paldio), paging, and satellite. Docomo ceased offering a PHS service on January 7, 2008.

Customers[edit]
NTT Docomo is a subsidiary of Japan's incumbent telephone operator, NTT. The majority of NTT Docomo's shares are owned by NTT (which is 33.71% government-owned). While some NTT shares are publicly traded, control of the company by Japanese interests (government and civilian) is guaranteed by the number of shares available to buyers. It provides wireless voice and data communications to subscribers in Japan. NTT Docomo is the creator of W-CDMA technology as well as mobile i-mode service. In late 1995, Docomo CEO hired the consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers for strategy development, and at that time worked on the first design of data services on mobile for NTT Docomo CEO.[citation needed]
NTT Docomo has more than 53 million customers (as of March 2008), which is more than half of Japan's cellular market. The company provides a wide variety of mobile multimedia services. These include i-mode which provides e-mail and internet access to over 50 million subscribers, FOMA, which was launched in 2001 as the world's first 3G mobile service based on W-CDMA, Xi, a 4G LTE mobile service which was launched on December 24, 2010, and Premium 4G, a LTE Advanced service which was launched on March 27, 2015.
In addition to wholly owned subsidiaries in Europe and North America, the company is expanding its global reach through strategic alliances with mobile and multimedia service providers in Asia-Pacific and Europe. NTT Docomo is listed on the Tokyo (9437), London (NDCM), and New York (DCM) stock exchanges.
On April 19, 2008, it was announced that Ryuji Yamada, the current co-president of NTT Docomo, will be promoted as the president of NTT Docomo in June 2008. Masao Nakamura will stay in NTT Docomo as a director and also the senior adviser. Since October 2006, when the introduction to the service which allows the user to carry their original phone number with a new provider was made, NTT Docomo has lost many users to KDDI and SoftBank. This promotion was made in order to get more users for NTT Docomo.[8] The company was the last major global mobile carrier to offer Apple's iPhone, which it finally did with the release of the iPhone 5s and 5c. This has been cited as one of the reasons for the steady stream of its customers switching for competing networks.[9]
In June 2011, the company announced that they were teaming up with McAfee to provide McAfee VirusScan Mobile for its Android mobile users.[10] In July 2012, NTT Docomo acquired Italy's Buongiorno in a deal worth 209 million euros.[11]
Research and development[edit]

On October 2007, the prototype Wellness mobile phone of Japan's NTT Docomo Inc. and Mitsubishi Electric Corp. was launched at CEATEC. It checks health with a motion sensor that detects body movement and measures calories, and includes a breathalyzer.[12]
On January 24, 2008, NTT Docomo announced a partnership with Google, which allowed all models after the FOMA904i models to view YouTube videos.[13][14]
NTT Docomo is a founding member of the Symbian Foundation.[15]
Earthquake warning system[edit]
From 2008, Docomo began offering a service called the "Area Mail Disaster Information Service" which broadcasts Earthquake Early Warning messages produced by the Japan Meteorological Agency to its subscribers with compatible handsets.[16] This service is provided free of charge and messages are limited to those areas affected by each particular alert. These alerts have a unique ring tone so they can be easily distinguished from incoming calls or messages.
Civil protection system[edit]
From 2014, under Civil Protection Law of Japan, Docomo began offering a service called the "Area Mail Disaster and Evacuation Information Service" which broadcasts J-Alert messages (including Earthquake Early Warning) produced by the Japan Fire and Disaster Management Agency to its subscribers with compatible handsets (e.g. Sony XPERIA, iPhone 5s, Samsung Galaxy).[17]
The message is broadcast when the military threat is imminent (e.g. North Korea's ballistic missile launching, terrorist attack to nuclear power plant), volcanic eruptions, or approaching tsunami.
Mascot[edit]

The company's mascot is Docomodake, a mushroom, which is quite a celebrity in Japan. He even is the hero of a Nintendo DS puzzle and platforming video game, Boing! Docomodake DS, which was also released in North America and Europe.[18] He also has a wide variety of merchandising such as cell phone straps, keychains, and plush dolls. As one type of advertising method, there are many types of Docomodakes such as mother and father, which symbolizes the plans that NTT Docomo offers.
Emoji[edit]
Emoji, a pictographic language being adopted around the world was first created by NTT DoCoMo. The first emoji was created in 1998 or 1999 by Shigetaka Kurita, who was part of the team working on NTT DoCoMo's i-mode mobile Internet platform. The first set of 176 12×12 pixel emoji was created as part of i-mode's messaging features to help facilitate electronic communication, and to serve as a distinguishing feature from other services.[19]
Investments outside Japan[edit]




GSMA Mobile World Congress, Barcelona 2008 99. Note the new logo.


NTT Docomo has a wide range of foreign investments. However, NTT Docomo was not successful in investing in foreign carriers. Docomo had invested very large multibillion-dollar amounts in KPN, KT Freetel, AT&T Wireless, and had to write-off sell all these investments in foreign carriers. As a result, Docomo booked a total of about US$10 billion in losses, while during the same time Docomo's Japan operations were profitable.
In December 2007, NTT Docomo and KT Freetel jointly invested 200 million USD for a total of 33% stake in U Mobile Malaysia.
In June 2008 NTT Docomo joined the non-profit Symbian Foundation led by Nokia to co-develop a new Symbian smartphone operating system based on the S60 platform, which resulted in Symbian^2 for the Japanese market.[20]
In November 2008, NTT Docomo bought a 26% stake in Tata Teleservices for 2.7 billion USD, the number 6 in Indian telecom industry and owned by the Tata group. India is the world's fastest-growing cellular market, adding as many as 9 million new customers a month. Tata Teleservices (which sells under the brand Tata Indicom and Virgin Mobile India) has 80 million subscribers as of October 2010. Though Tata Indicom is a CDMA based operator, they won GSM licenses as well, and the NTT Docomo-Tata venture is focused on GSM operation (called Tata DOCOMO). The Tata DOCOMO service was commercially launched in India in June 2009. Tata DOCOMO had about 32.82 million users at the end of June 2010.
They have also taken over Guamcell, among others, and so are now the main wireless operator in Guam.
Docomo is working on implementing its FeliCa-based payment system, called iD, overseas. It has already launched the system in Guam, as well as Shanghai and Beijing, China (however, as of November 2010, it has withdrawn iD terminals from all merchants in China).
Docomo Capital[edit]
Working closely with NTT Docomo's business and R&D divisions, Docomo Capital is in charge of NTT Docomo's venture investments in mobile related start-up companies, mainly in the United States and has committed $100M in capital. It has invested in Cooliris, Couchbase, Evernote, Fab.com, HighlightCam, Swype, TuneWiki, and Sigfox.[21]
DOCOMO Digital[edit]
DOCOMO Digital is the holding company for the global digital ecosystem platform business operations of NTT DOCOMO.

NTT DOCOMO, Inc.[3][4] (株式会社NTTドコモ, Kabushiki Gaisha Enu Ti Ti Dokomo) is the predominant mobile phone operator in Japan. The name is officially an abbreviation of the phrase, "do communications over the mobile network", and is also from a compound word dokomo, meaning "everywhere" in Japanese.[5] Docomo provides phone, video phone (FOMA and Some PHS), i-mode (internet), and mail (i-mode mail, Short Mail, and SMS) services. The company's headquarters are in the Sanno Park Tower, Nagatachō, Chiyoda, Tokyo.[6] At the beginning of 2015, it was the fourth largest public company in Japan when measured by market capitalization.[7]
Docomo was spun off from Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) in August 1991 to take over the mobile cellular operations. It provides 2G (mova) PDC cellular services on the 800 MHz band, and 3G FOMA W-CDMA services on the 2 GHz (UMTS2100) and 800 MHz (UMTS800 (Band VI)) and 1700 MHz (UMTS1700 (Band IX)) bands, and 4G LTE services. Its businesses also included PHS (Paldio), paging, and satellite. Docomo ceased offering a PHS service on January 7, 2008.

Customers[edit]
NTT Docomo is a subsidiary of Japan's incumbent telephone operator, NTT. The majority of NTT Docomo's shares are owned by NTT (which is 33.71% government-owned). While some NTT shares are publicly traded, control of the company by Japanese interests (government and civilian) is guaranteed by the number of shares available to buyers. It provides wireless voice and data communications to subscribers in Japan. NTT Docomo is the creator of W-CDMA technology as well as mobile i-mode service. In late 1995, Docomo CEO hired the consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers for strategy development, and at that time worked on the first design of data services on mobile for NTT Docomo CEO.[citation needed]
NTT Docomo has more than 53 million customers (as of March 2008), which is more than half of Japan's cellular market. The company provides a wide variety of mobile multimedia services. These include i-mode which provides e-mail and internet access to over 50 million subscribers, FOMA, which was launched in 2001 as the world's first 3G mobile service based on W-CDMA, Xi, a 4G LTE mobile service which was launched on December 24, 2010, and Premium 4G, a LTE Advanced service which was launched on March 27, 2015.
In addition to wholly owned subsidiaries in Europe and North America, the company is expanding its global reach through strategic alliances with mobile and multimedia service providers in Asia-Pacific and Europe. NTT Docomo is listed on the Tokyo (9437), London (NDCM), and New York (DCM) stock exchanges.
On April 19, 2008, it was announced that Ryuji Yamada, the current co-president of NTT Docomo, will be promoted as the president of NTT Docomo in June 2008. Masao Nakamura will stay in NTT Docomo as a director and also the senior adviser. Since October 2006, when the introduction to the service which allows the user to carry their original phone number with a new provider was made, NTT Docomo has lost many users to KDDI and SoftBank. This promotion was made in order to get more users for NTT Docomo.[8] The company was the last major global mobile carrier to offer Apple's iPhone, which it finally did with the release of the iPhone 5s and 5c. This has been cited as one of the reasons for the steady stream of its customers switching for competing networks.[9]
In June 2011, the company announced that they were teaming up with McAfee to provide McAfee VirusScan Mobile for its Android mobile users.[10] In July 2012, NTT Docomo acquired Italy's Buongiorno in a deal worth 209 million euros.[11]
Research and development[edit]

On October 2007, the prototype Wellness mobile phone of Japan's NTT Docomo Inc. and Mitsubishi Electric Corp. was launched at CEATEC. It checks health with a motion sensor that detects body movement and measures calories, and includes a breathalyzer.[12]
On January 24, 2008, NTT Docomo announced a partnership with Google, which allowed all models after the FOMA904i models to view YouTube videos.[13][14]
NTT Docomo is a founding member of the Symbian Foundation.[15]
Earthquake warning system[edit]
From 2008, Docomo began offering a service called the "Area Mail Disaster Information Service" which broadcasts Earthquake Early Warning messages produced by the Japan Meteorological Agency to its subscribers with compatible handsets.[16] This service is provided free of charge and messages are limited to those areas affected by each particular alert. These alerts have a unique ring tone so they can be easily distinguished from incoming calls or messages.
Civil protection system[edit]
From 2014, under Civil Protection Law of Japan, Docomo began offering a service called the "Area Mail Disaster and Evacuation Information Service" which broadcasts J-Alert messages (including Earthquake Early Warning) produced by the Japan Fire and Disaster Management Agency to its subscribers with compatible handsets (e.g. Sony XPERIA, iPhone 5s, Samsung Galaxy).[17]
The message is broadcast when the military threat is imminent (e.g. North Korea's ballistic missile launching, terrorist attack to nuclear power plant), volcanic eruptions, or approaching tsunami.
Mascot[edit]

The company's mascot is Docomodake, a mushroom, which is quite a celebrity in Japan. He even is the hero of a Nintendo DS puzzle and platforming video game, Boing! Docomodake DS, which was also released in North America and Europe.[18] He also has a wide variety of merchandising such as cell phone straps, keychains, and plush dolls. As one type of advertising method, there are many types of Docomodakes such as mother and father, which symbolizes the plans that NTT Docomo offers.
Emoji[edit]
Emoji, a pictographic language being adopted around the world was first created by NTT DoCoMo. The first emoji was created in 1998 or 1999 by Shigetaka Kurita, who was part of the team working on NTT DoCoMo's i-mode mobile Internet platform. The first set of 176 12×12 pixel emoji was created as part of i-mode's messaging features to help facilitate electronic communication, and to serve as a distinguishing feature from other services.[19]
Investments outside Japan[edit]




GSMA Mobile World Congress, Barcelona 2008 99. Note the new logo.


NTT Docomo has a wide range of foreign investments. However, NTT Docomo was not successful in investing in foreign carriers. Docomo had invested very large multibillion-dollar amounts in KPN, KT Freetel, AT&T Wireless, and had to write-off sell all these investments in foreign carriers. As a result, Docomo booked a total of about US$10 billion in losses, while during the same time Docomo's Japan operations were profitable.
In December 2007, NTT Docomo and KT Freetel jointly invested 200 million USD for a total of 33% stake in U Mobile Malaysia.
In June 2008 NTT Docomo joined the non-profit Symbian Foundation led by Nokia to co-develop a new Symbian smartphone operating system based on the S60 platform, which resulted in Symbian^2 for the Japanese market.[20]
In November 2008, NTT Docomo bought a 26% stake in Tata Teleservices for 2.7 billion USD, the number 6 in Indian telecom industry and owned by the Tata group. India is the world's fastest-growing cellular market, adding as many as 9 million new customers a month. Tata Teleservices (which sells under the brand Tata Indicom and Virgin Mobile India) has 80 million subscribers as of October 2010. Though Tata Indicom is a CDMA based operator, they won GSM licenses as well, and the NTT Docomo-Tata venture is focused on GSM operation (called Tata DOCOMO). The Tata DOCOMO service was commercially launched in India in June 2009. Tata DOCOMO had about 32.82 million users at the end of June 2010.
They have also taken over Guamcell, among others, and so are now the main wireless operator in Guam.
Docomo is working on implementing its FeliCa-based payment system, called iD, overseas. It has already launched the system in Guam, as well as Shanghai and Beijing, China (however, as of November 2010, it has withdrawn iD terminals from all merchants in China).
Docomo Capital[edit]
Working closely with NTT Docomo's business and R&D divisions, Docomo Capital is in charge of NTT Docomo's venture investments in mobile related start-up companies, mainly in the United States and has committed $100M in capital. It has invested in Cooliris, Couchbase, Evernote, Fab.com, HighlightCam, Swype, TuneWiki, and Sigfox.[21]
DOCOMO Digital[edit]
DOCOMO Digital is the holding company for the global digital ecosystem platform business operations of NTT DOCOMO.

NTT DOCOMO, Inc.[3][4] (株式会社NTTドコモ, Kabushiki Gaisha Enu Ti Ti Dokomo) is the predominant mobile phone operator in Japan. The name is officially an abbreviation of the phrase, "do communications over the mobile network", and is also from a compound word dokomo, meaning "everywhere" in Japanese.[5] Docomo provides phone, video phone (FOMA and Some PHS), i-mode (internet), and mail (i-mode mail, Short Mail, and SMS) services. The company's headquarters are in the Sanno Park Tower, Nagatachō, Chiyoda, Tokyo.[6] At the beginning of 2015, it was the fourth largest public company in Japan when measured by market capitalization.[7]
Docomo was spun off from Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) in August 1991 to take over the mobile cellular operations. It provides 2G (mova) PDC cellular services on the 800 MHz band, and 3G FOMA W-CDMA services on the 2 GHz (UMTS2100) and 800 MHz (UMTS800 (Band VI)) and 1700 MHz (UMTS1700 (Band IX)) bands, and 4G LTE services. Its businesses also included PHS (Paldio), paging, and satellite. Docomo ceased offering a PHS service on January 7, 2008.

Customers[edit]
NTT Docomo is a subsidiary of Japan's incumbent telephone operator, NTT. The majority of NTT Docomo's shares are owned by NTT (which is 33.71% government-owned). While some NTT shares are publicly traded, control of the company by Japanese interests (government and civilian) is guaranteed by the number of shares available to buyers. It provides wireless voice and data communications to subscribers in Japan. NTT Docomo is the creator of W-CDMA technology as well as mobile i-mode service. In late 1995, Docomo CEO hired the consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers for strategy development, and at that time worked on the first design of data services on mobile for NTT Docomo CEO.[citation needed]
NTT Docomo has more than 53 million customers (as of March 2008), which is more than half of Japan's cellular market. The company provides a wide variety of mobile multimedia services. These include i-mode which provides e-mail and internet access to over 50 million subscribers, FOMA, which was launched in 2001 as the world's first 3G mobile service based on W-CDMA, Xi, a 4G LTE mobile service which was launched on December 24, 2010, and Premium 4G, a LTE Advanced service which was launched on March 27, 2015.
In addition to wholly owned subsidiaries in Europe and North America, the company is expanding its global reach through strategic alliances with mobile and multimedia service providers in Asia-Pacific and Europe. NTT Docomo is listed on the Tokyo (9437), London (NDCM), and New York (DCM) stock exchanges.
On April 19, 2008, it was announced that Ryuji Yamada, the current co-president of NTT Docomo, will be promoted as the president of NTT Docomo in June 2008. Masao Nakamura will stay in NTT Docomo as a director and also the senior adviser. Since October 2006, when the introduction to the service which allows the user to carry their original phone number with a new provider was made, NTT Docomo has lost many users to KDDI and SoftBank. This promotion was made in order to get more users for NTT Docomo.[8] The company was the last major global mobile carrier to offer Apple's iPhone, which it finally did with the release of the iPhone 5s and 5c. This has been cited as one of the reasons for the steady stream of its customers switching for competing networks.[9]
In June 2011, the company announced that they were teaming up with McAfee to provide McAfee VirusScan Mobile for its Android mobile users.[10] In July 2012, NTT Docomo acquired Italy's Buongiorno in a deal worth 209 million euros.[11]
Research and development[edit]

On October 2007, the prototype Wellness mobile phone of Japan's NTT Docomo Inc. and Mitsubishi Electric Corp. was launched at CEATEC. It checks health with a motion sensor that detects body movement and measures calories, and includes a breathalyzer.[12]
On January 24, 2008, NTT Docomo announced a partnership with Google, which allowed all models after the FOMA904i models to view YouTube videos.[13][14]
NTT Docomo is a founding member of the Symbian Foundation.[15]
Earthquake warning system[edit]
From 2008, Docomo began offering a service called the "Area Mail Disaster Information Service" which broadcasts Earthquake Early Warning messages produced by the Japan Meteorological Agency to its subscribers with compatible handsets.[16] This service is provided free of charge and messages are limited to those areas affected by each particular alert. These alerts have a unique ring tone so they can be easily distinguished from incoming calls or messages.
Civil protection system[edit]
From 2014, under Civil Protection Law of Japan, Docomo began offering a service called the "Area Mail Disaster and Evacuation Information Service" which broadcasts J-Alert messages (including Earthquake Early Warning) produced by the Japan Fire and Disaster Management Agency to its subscribers with compatible handsets (e.g. Sony XPERIA, iPhone 5s, Samsung Galaxy).[17]
The message is broadcast when the military threat is imminent (e.g. North Korea's ballistic missile launching, terrorist attack to nuclear power plant), volcanic eruptions, or approaching tsunami.
Mascot[edit]

The company's mascot is Docomodake, a mushroom, which is quite a celebrity in Japan. He even is the hero of a Nintendo DS puzzle and platforming video game, Boing! Docomodake DS, which was also released in North America and Europe.[18] He also has a wide variety of merchandising such as cell phone straps, keychains, and plush dolls. As one type of advertising method, there are many types of Docomodakes such as mother and father, which symbolizes the plans that NTT Docomo offers.
Emoji[edit]
Emoji, a pictographic language being adopted around the world was first created by NTT DoCoMo. The first emoji was created in 1998 or 1999 by Shigetaka Kurita, who was part of the team working on NTT DoCoMo's i-mode mobile Internet platform. The first set of 176 12×12 pixel emoji was created as part of i-mode's messaging features to help facilitate electronic communication, and to serve as a distinguishing feature from other services.[19]
Investments outside Japan[edit]




GSMA Mobile World Congress, Barcelona 2008 99. Note the new logo.


NTT Docomo has a wide range of foreign investments. However, NTT Docomo was not successful in investing in foreign carriers. Docomo had invested very large multibillion-dollar amounts in KPN, KT Freetel, AT&T Wireless, and had to write-off sell all these investments in foreign carriers. As a result, Docomo booked a total of about US$10 billion in losses, while during the same time Docomo's Japan operations were profitable.
In December 2007, NTT Docomo and KT Freetel jointly invested 200 million USD for a total of 33% stake in U Mobile Malaysia.
In June 2008 NTT Docomo joined the non-profit Symbian Foundation led by Nokia to co-develop a new Symbian smartphone operating system based on the S60 platform, which resulted in Symbian^2 for the Japanese market.[20]
In November 2008, NTT Docomo bought a 26% stake in Tata Teleservices for 2.7 billion USD, the number 6 in Indian telecom industry and owned by the Tata group. India is the world's fastest-growing cellular market, adding as many as 9 million new customers a month. Tata Teleservices (which sells under the brand Tata Indicom and Virgin Mobile India) has 80 million subscribers as of October 2010. Though Tata Indicom is a CDMA based operator, they won GSM licenses as well, and the NTT Docomo-Tata venture is focused on GSM operation (called Tata DOCOMO). The Tata DOCOMO service was commercially launched in India in June 2009. Tata DOCOMO had about 32.82 million users at the end of June 2010.
They have also taken over Guamcell, among others, and so are now the main wireless operator in Guam.
Docomo is working on implementing its FeliCa-based payment system, called iD, overseas. It has already launched the system in Guam, as well as Shanghai and Beijing, China (however, as of November 2010, it has withdrawn iD terminals from all merchants in China).
Docomo Capital[edit]
Working closely with NTT Docomo's business and R&D divisions, Docomo Capital is in charge of NTT Docomo's venture investments in mobile related start-up companies, mainly in the United States and has committed $100M in capital. It has invested in Cooliris, Couchbase, Evernote, Fab.com, HighlightCam, Swype, TuneWiki, and Sigfox.[21]
DOCOMO Digital[edit]
DOCOMO Digital is the holding company for the global digital ecosystem platform business operations of NTT DOCOMO.

NTT DOCOMO, Inc.[3][4] (株式会社NTTドコモ, Kabushiki Gaisha Enu Ti Ti Dokomo) is the predominant mobile phone operator in Japan. The name is officially an abbreviation of the phrase, "do communications over the mobile network", and is also from a compound word dokomo, meaning "everywhere" in Japanese.[5] Docomo provides phone, video phone (FOMA and Some PHS), i-mode (internet), and mail (i-mode mail, Short Mail, and SMS) services. The company's headquarters are in the Sanno Park Tower, Nagatachō, Chiyoda, Tokyo.[6] At the beginning of 2015, it was the fourth largest public company in Japan when measured by market capitalization.[7]
Docomo was spun off from Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) in August 1991 to take over the mobile cellular operations. It provides 2G (mova) PDC cellular services on the 800 MHz band, and 3G FOMA W-CDMA services on the 2 GHz (UMTS2100) and 800 MHz (UMTS800 (Band VI)) and 1700 MHz (UMTS1700 (Band IX)) bands, and 4G LTE services. Its businesses also included PHS (Paldio), paging, and satellite. Docomo ceased offering a PHS service on January 7, 2008.

Customers[edit]
NTT Docomo is a subsidiary of Japan's incumbent telephone operator, NTT. The majority of NTT Docomo's shares are owned by NTT (which is 33.71% government-owned). While some NTT shares are publicly traded, control of the company by Japanese interests (government and civilian) is guaranteed by the number of shares available to buyers. It provides wireless voice and data communications to subscribers in Japan. NTT Docomo is the creator of W-CDMA technology as well as mobile i-mode service. In late 1995, Docomo CEO hired the consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers for strategy development, and at that time worked on the first design of data services on mobile for NTT Docomo CEO.[citation needed]
NTT Docomo has more than 53 million customers (as of March 2008), which is more than half of Japan's cellular market. The company provides a wide variety of mobile multimedia services. These include i-mode which provides e-mail and internet access to over 50 million subscribers, FOMA, which was launched in 2001 as the world's first 3G mobile service based on W-CDMA, Xi, a 4G LTE mobile service which was launched on December 24, 2010, and Premium 4G, a LTE Advanced service which was launched on March 27, 2015.
In addition to wholly owned subsidiaries in Europe and North America, the company is expanding its global reach through strategic alliances with mobile and multimedia service providers in Asia-Pacific and Europe. NTT Docomo is listed on the Tokyo (9437), London (NDCM), and New York (DCM) stock exchanges.
On April 19, 2008, it was announced that Ryuji Yamada, the current co-president of NTT Docomo, will be promoted as the president of NTT Docomo in June 2008. Masao Nakamura will stay in NTT Docomo as a director and also the senior adviser. Since October 2006, when the introduction to the service which allows the user to carry their original phone number with a new provider was made, NTT Docomo has lost many users to KDDI and SoftBank. This promotion was made in order to get more users for NTT Docomo.[8] The company was the last major global mobile carrier to offer Apple's iPhone, which it finally did with the release of the iPhone 5s and 5c. This has been cited as one of the reasons for the steady stream of its customers switching for competing networks.[9]
In June 2011, the company announced that they were teaming up with McAfee to provide McAfee VirusScan Mobile for its Android mobile users.[10] In July 2012, NTT Docomo acquired Italy's Buongiorno in a deal worth 209 million euros.[11]
Research and development[edit]

On October 2007, the prototype Wellness mobile phone of Japan's NTT Docomo Inc. and Mitsubishi Electric Corp. was launched at CEATEC. It checks health with a motion sensor that detects body movement and measures calories, and includes a breathalyzer.[12]
On January 24, 2008, NTT Docomo announced a partnership with Google, which allowed all models after the FOMA904i models to view YouTube videos.[13][14]
NTT Docomo is a founding member of the Symbian Foundation.[15]
Earthquake warning system[edit]
From 2008, Docomo began offering a service called the "Area Mail Disaster Information Service" which broadcasts Earthquake Early Warning messages produced by the Japan Meteorological Agency to its subscribers with compatible handsets.[16] This service is provided free of charge and messages are limited to those areas affected by each particular alert. These alerts have a unique ring tone so they can be easily distinguished from incoming calls or messages.
Civil protection system[edit]
From 2014, under Civil Protection Law of Japan, Docomo began offering a service called the "Area Mail Disaster and Evacuation Information Service" which broadcasts J-Alert messages (including Earthquake Early Warning) produced by the Japan Fire and Disaster Management Agency to its subscribers with compatible handsets (e.g. Sony XPERIA, iPhone 5s, Samsung Galaxy).[17]
The message is broadcast when the military threat is imminent (e.g. North Korea's ballistic missile launching, terrorist attack to nuclear power plant), volcanic eruptions, or approaching tsunami.
Mascot[edit]

The company's mascot is Docomodake, a mushroom, which is quite a celebrity in Japan. He even is the hero of a Nintendo DS puzzle and platforming video game, Boing! Docomodake DS, which was also released in North America and Europe.[18] He also has a wide variety of merchandising such as cell phone straps, keychains, and plush dolls. As one type of advertising method, there are many types of Docomodakes such as mother and father, which symbolizes the plans that NTT Docomo offers.
Emoji[edit]
Emoji, a pictographic language being adopted around the world was first created by NTT DoCoMo. The first emoji was created in 1998 or 1999 by Shigetaka Kurita, who was part of the team working on NTT DoCoMo's i-mode mobile Internet platform. The first set of 176 12×12 pixel emoji was created as part of i-mode's messaging features to help facilitate electronic communication, and to serve as a distinguishing feature from other services.[19]
Investments outside Japan[edit]




GSMA Mobile World Congress, Barcelona 2008 99. Note the new logo.


NTT Docomo has a wide range of foreign investments. However, NTT Docomo was not successful in investing in foreign carriers. Docomo had invested very large multibillion-dollar amounts in KPN, KT Freetel, AT&T Wireless, and had to write-off sell all these investments in foreign carriers. As a result, Docomo booked a total of about US$10 billion in losses, while during the same time Docomo's Japan operations were profitable.
In December 2007, NTT Docomo and KT Freetel jointly invested 200 million USD for a total of 33% stake in U Mobile Malaysia.
In June 2008 NTT Docomo joined the non-profit Symbian Foundation led by Nokia to co-develop a new Symbian smartphone operating system based on the S60 platform, which resulted in Symbian^2 for the Japanese market.[20]
In November 2008, NTT Docomo bought a 26% stake in Tata Teleservices for 2.7 billion USD, the number 6 in Indian telecom industry and owned by the Tata group. India is the world's fastest-growing cellular market, adding as many as 9 million new customers a month. Tata Teleservices (which sells under the brand Tata Indicom and Virgin Mobile India) has 80 million subscribers as of October 2010. Though Tata Indicom is a CDMA based operator, they won GSM licenses as well, and the NTT Docomo-Tata venture is focused on GSM operation (called Tata DOCOMO). The Tata DOCOMO service was commercially launched in India in June 2009. Tata DOCOMO had about 32.82 million users at the end of June 2010.
They have also taken over Guamcell, among others, and so are now the main wireless operator in Guam.
Docomo is working on implementing its FeliCa-based payment system, called iD, overseas. It has already launched the system in Guam, as well as Shanghai and Beijing, China (however, as of November 2010, it has withdrawn iD terminals from all merchants in China).
Docomo Capital[edit]
Working closely with NTT Docomo's business and R&D divisions, Docomo Capital is in charge of NTT Docomo's venture investments in mobile related start-up companies, mainly in the United States and has committed $100M in capital. It has invested in Cooliris, Couchbase, Evernote, Fab.com, HighlightCam, Swype, TuneWiki, and Sigfox.[21]
DOCOMO Digital[edit]
DOCOMO Digital is the holding company for the global digital ecosystem platform business operations of NTT DOCOMO.

Description



Access to case studies expires six months after purchase date.



Publication Date: April 13, 2005

 Managers of DoCoMo, Japan's largest mobile phone company, are formulating a strategy for mobile FeliCa: contactless integrated circuits that will be built into DoCoMo phones, allowing them to be used for quick and convenient retail or commuter fare payments, building entry, airline boarding passes, and other applications. DoCoMo's managers must determine how best to profit from mobile FeliCa. The options, which are not mutually exclusive, include: increasing mobile phone subscriber acquisition and retention rates by offering "sticky" differentiated new services; extracting monopoly rents from a joint venture (with Sony, FeliCa's inventor) that will license FeliCa technology to other mobile phone companies and application providers; and profiting from eMoney (retail payments) either through partnerships with incumbent financial services firms or by offering payment services directly.

NTT DoCoMo, Inc.




In addition to the "i-mode Filter," a filtering service that restricts access to harmful sites such as dating sites and adult sites so as to allow children to use mobile phones with peace of mind, NTT DoCoMo offers a "URL-containing e-mail rejection setting" as a countermeasure against unwanted e-mail. These two services are supported by NetSTAR's URL database, which encompass not just PC sites but also mobile phone sites.




NTT DoCoMo Inc. (hereafter referred to as "DoCoMo") is an industry pioneer, for example commercializing mobile phone services equipped with i-mode, an internet access function, before any of its competitors. The increase in the number of minor users of mobile phone services such as i-mode increases has been accompanied by a rise in the number of crime victims and incidents triggered by browsing of dating sites and adult sites. As a countermeasure, starting in 2003, DoCoMo began offering Kid's i-mode (currently, "Kid's i-mode Filter), an optional service for minors that restricts access to sites other than i-mode menu sites, as part of efforts to address social needs for security. However, these days elementary schools increasingly put up their own websites, and in the case of filtering with blanket denial of access to sites other than i-mode menu sites, customer needs are not served, so URL filtering is now gathering attention as a new countermeasure. Starting in 2005, DoCoMo has been offering Kid's i-mode Plus (currently named "i-mode Filter"), a service for restricting access to sites falling under specific categories such as dating sites and adult sites.

This service blocks access to sites such as dating sites and adult sites that are considered harmful to the sound development of minors, through filtering that uses NetSTAR's URL databases, while allowing access to sites offering useful information for life such as school websites. Moreover, as changes such as the cancellation of access restriction services or lowering the restriction level require parental consent, this service is highly praised and trusted by all quarters as a revolutionary service that can drastically restrict misuse of mobile phone sites by minors. Further, starting in 2007, DoCoMo changed the name of its "Kid's i-mode Plus" service to "i-mode Filter" to reflect further evolution of this service to answer a wider range of filtering needs including for example corporate customers wishing to reduce communication costs caused by unnecessary access by others in addition to minors. This new service is enjoying a very favorable reception.
"Business needs for access management are greater than anticipated, and the majority of corporate contracts for the batch introduction of mobile phones elect to use the i-mode Filter." (Ito) 


Along with dating sites and adult sites, unwanted e-mail is a major annoyance for mobile phone services. At DoCoMo, in addition to original unwanted e-mail countermeasures, we started in 2007 to apply filtering using NetSTAR's URL databases, which we had used thus far for the i-mode Filter, to unwanted e-mails. This resulted in the addition of the URL-containing e-mail rejection setting to our service menu. 
Although initially we just thought about providing the URL-containing e-mail rejection setting as one of our unwanted e-mail countermeasure setting menu items, upon actual introduction, the effectiveness of this service was very clear to see, and since it was easy to set, we find it to be effective for promotion to customers who are not comfortable with handling devices, whose number is on the rise," says Inoue, attesting to a favorable reception of this service that went beyond DoCoMo's expectations. 

The reasons why DoCoMo chose to use NetSTAR are the quality and track record of its databases. Since before the i-mode Filter, DoCoMo used NetSTAR for blocking specific sites for its "mopera U" Internet service for FOMA, and the quality of NetSTAR's databases had been demonstrated. Regarding the provision of the URL-containing e-mail rejection setting, Ito says, "we selected NetSTAR based on its trustworthiness for mopera U and i-mode Filter. However, since there are unwanted e-mail specific URLs, we newly established the category of 'unwanted e-mail links'," describing selection and determination of categories according to the purpose of a service.


The "i-mode Filter" and "URL-containing e-mail rejection setting" are both provided free of charge due to the wish for "peace of mind" striving to avoid having DoCoMo mobile phones be the cause of experiences with harm. However, "before, during consultations regarding unwanted e-mail countermeasures, we would have to provide guidance regarding setting contents such as individual reception/blocking setting, after having heard how the customer uses e-mail, now, we can just recommend the URL-containing e-mail rejection setting, says Yamada, expressing high regard for the effect on raising customer satisfaction. For DoCoMo, which attaches great importance to the "peace of mind" of its customers, both the i-mode Filter and URL-containing e-mail rejection setting services will see their importance grow in the future.







"We conducted thorough testing to ensure that top items appearing on multiple search sites can be 100% guarded," says Takashi Ito (Platform Development Manager, Platform Department, Product & Service Division). 





"Since we make 'peace of mind' one of our sales points, i-mode Filter and URL-containing e-mail rejection setting are both important services," says Akiko Inoue (First Security Promotion In-Charge, Contents & Customer Department).





"Demand for the URL-containing e-mail rejection setting has been steadily increasing since its introduction," says Megumi Yamada (First Security Promotion In-Charge, Contents & Customer Department).














In order to maintain and improve filtering accuracy, NetSTAR operates the industry's first dedicated mobile phone site URL collection team. Full-time researchers working year round classify links included in e-mails through visual check at a URL Research Center equipped with mobile phones for monitoring purposes. Along with information sharing with the High-Tech Crime Fighting General Center of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, the Nippon Information Communication Association, and other organizations, high filtering accuracy is realized by updating the database day by day, moment by moment.












 



Established in August 1991 as NTT Mobile Communications Planning Co., Ltd., the company currently deploys a wide range of businesses centered on a mobile phone business and PHS business. Based on the corporate principle of "creating a new age communication culture," DoCoMo actively promotes the shift of mobile phones from "communication infrastructure" to "life infrastructure," aims to further increase customer satisfaction through the provision of communication services based on the spread and growth of the FOMA service.

NTT Docomo Yoyogi Building in Shibuya, Tokyo


NTT DOCOMO, Inc.[3][4] (株式会社NTTドコモ, Kabushiki Gaisha Enu Ti Ti Dokomo) is the predominant mobile phone operator in Japan. The name is officially an abbreviation of the phrase, "do communications over the mobile network", and is also from a compound word dokomo, meaning "everywhere" in Japanese.[5] Docomo provides phone, video phone (FOMA and Some PHS), i-mode (internet), and mail (i-mode mail, Short Mail, and SMS) services. The company's headquarters are in the Sanno Park Tower, Nagatachō, Chiyoda, Tokyo.[6] At the beginning of 2015, it was the fourth largest public company in Japan when measured by market capitalization.[7]
Docomo was spun off from Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) in August 1991 to take over the mobile cellular operations. It provides 2G (mova) PDC cellular services on the 800 MHz band, and 3G FOMA W-CDMA services on the 2 GHz (UMTS2100) and 800 MHz (UMTS800 (Band VI)) and 1700 MHz (UMTS1700 (Band IX)) bands, and 4G LTE services. Its businesses also included PHS (Paldio), paging, and satellite. Docomo ceased offering a PHS service on January 7, 2008.

Customers[edit]
NTT Docomo is a subsidiary of Japan's incumbent telephone operator, NTT. The majority of NTT Docomo's shares are owned by NTT (which is 33.71% government-owned). While some NTT shares are publicly traded, control of the company by Japanese interests (government and civilian) is guaranteed by the number of shares available to buyers. It provides wireless voice and data communications to subscribers in Japan. NTT Docomo is the creator of W-CDMA technology as well as mobile i-mode service. In late 1995, Docomo CEO hired the consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers for strategy development, and at that time worked on the first design of data services on mobile for NTT Docomo CEO.[citation needed]
NTT Docomo has more than 53 million customers (as of March 2008), which is more than half of Japan's cellular market. The company provides a wide variety of mobile multimedia services. These include i-mode which provides e-mail and internet access to over 50 million subscribers, FOMA, which was launched in 2001 as the world's first 3G mobile service based on W-CDMA, Xi, a 4G LTE mobile service which was launched on December 24, 2010, and Premium 4G, a LTE Advanced service which was launched on March 27, 2015.
In addition to wholly owned subsidiaries in Europe and North America, the company is expanding its global reach through strategic alliances with mobile and multimedia service providers in Asia-Pacific and Europe. NTT Docomo is listed on the Tokyo (9437), London (NDCM), and New York (DCM) stock exchanges.
On April 19, 2008, it was announced that Ryuji Yamada, the current co-president of NTT Docomo, will be promoted as the president of NTT Docomo in June 2008. Masao Nakamura will stay in NTT Docomo as a director and also the senior adviser. Since October 2006, when the introduction to the service which allows the user to carry their original phone number with a new provider was made, NTT Docomo has lost many users to KDDI and SoftBank. This promotion was made in order to get more users for NTT Docomo.[8] The company was the last major global mobile carrier to offer Apple's iPhone, which it finally did with the release of the iPhone 5s and 5c. This has been cited as one of the reasons for the steady stream of its customers switching for competing networks.[9]
In June 2011, the company announced that they were teaming up with McAfee to provide McAfee VirusScan Mobile for its Android mobile users.[10] In July 2012, NTT Docomo acquired Italy's Buongiorno in a deal worth 209 million euros.[11]
Research and development[edit]





This section's tone or style may not reflect the encyclopedic tone used on Wikipedia. See Wikipedia's guide to writing better articles for suggestions. (May 2010) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


On October 2007, the prototype Wellness mobile phone of Japan's NTT Docomo Inc. and Mitsubishi Electric Corp. was launched at CEATEC. It checks health with a motion sensor that detects body movement and measures calories, and includes a breathalyzer.[12]
On January 24, 2008, NTT Docomo announced a partnership with Google, which allowed all models after the FOMA904i models to view YouTube videos.[13][14]
NTT Docomo is a founding member of the Symbian Foundation.[15]
Earthquake warning system[edit]
From 2008, Docomo began offering a service called the "Area Mail Disaster Information Service" which broadcasts Earthquake Early Warning messages produced by the Japan Meteorological Agency to its subscribers with compatible handsets.[16] This service is provided free of charge and messages are limited to those areas affected by each particular alert. These alerts have a unique ring tone so they can be easily distinguished from incoming calls or messages.
Civil protection system[edit]
From 2014, under Civil Protection Law of Japan, Docomo began offering a service called the "Area Mail Disaster and Evacuation Information Service" which broadcasts J-Alert messages (including Earthquake Early Warning) produced by the Japan Fire and Disaster Management Agency to its subscribers with compatible handsets (e.g. Sony XPERIA, iPhone 5s, Samsung Galaxy).[17]
The message is broadcast when the military threat is imminent (e.g. North Korea's ballistic missile launching, terrorist attack to nuclear power plant), volcanic eruptions, or approaching tsunami.
Mascot[edit]




A large pile of Docomodake merchandise.


The company's mascot is Docomodake, a mushroom, which is quite a celebrity in Japan. He even is the hero of a Nintendo DS puzzle and platforming video game, Boing! Docomodake DS, which was also released in North America and Europe.[18] He also has a wide variety of merchandising such as cell phone straps, keychains, and plush dolls. As one type of advertising method, there are many types of Docomodakes such as mother and father, which symbolizes the plans that NTT Docomo offers.
Emoji[edit]
Emoji, a pictographic language being adopted around the world was first created by NTT DoCoMo. The first emoji was created in 1998 or 1999 by Shigetaka Kurita, who was part of the team working on NTT DoCoMo's i-mode mobile Internet platform. The first set of 176 12×12 pixel emoji was created as part of i-mode's messaging features to help facilitate electronic communication, and to serve as a distinguishing feature from other services.[19]
Investments outside Japan[edit]




GSMA Mobile World Congress, Barcelona 2008 99. Note the new logo.


NTT Docomo has a wide range of foreign investments. However, NTT Docomo was not successful in investing in foreign carriers. Docomo had invested very large multibillion-dollar amounts in KPN, KT Freetel, AT&T Wireless, and had to write-off sell all these investments in foreign carriers. As a result, Docomo booked a total of about US$10 billion in losses, while during the same time Docomo's Japan operations were profitable.
In December 2007, NTT Docomo and KT Freetel jointly invested 200 million USD for a total of 33% stake in U Mobile Malaysia.
In June 2008 NTT Docomo joined the non-profit Symbian Foundation led by Nokia to co-develop a new Symbian smartphone operating system based on the S60 platform, which resulted in Symbian^2 for the Japanese market.[20]
In November 2008, NTT Docomo bought a 26% stake in Tata Teleservices for 2.7 billion USD, the number 6 in Indian telecom industry and owned by the Tata group. India is the world's fastest-growing cellular market, adding as many as 9 million new customers a month. Tata Teleservices (which sells under the brand Tata Indicom and Virgin Mobile India) has 80 million subscribers as of October 2010. Though Tata Indicom is a CDMA based operator, they won GSM licenses as well, and the NTT Docomo-Tata venture is focused on GSM operation (called Tata DOCOMO). The Tata DOCOMO service was commercially launched in India in June 2009. Tata DOCOMO had about 32.82 million users at the end of June 2010.
They have also taken over Guamcell, among others, and so are now the main wireless operator in Guam.
Docomo is working on implementing its FeliCa-based payment system, called iD, overseas. It has already launched the system in Guam, as well as Shanghai and Beijing, China (however, as of November 2010, it has withdrawn iD terminals from all merchants in China).

The name is officially an abbreviation of the phrase, "do communications over the mobile network", and is also from a compound word dokomo, meaning "everywhere" in Japanese.[5] Docomo provides phone, video phone (FOMA and Some PHS), i-mode (internet), and mail (i-mode mail, Short Mail, and SMS) services. The company's headquarters are in the Sanno Park Tower, Nagatachō, Chiyoda, Tokyo.[6] At the beginning of 2015, it was the fourth largest public company in Japan when measured by market capitalization.[7]
Docomo was spun off from Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) in August 1991 to take over the mobile cellular operations. It provides 2G (mova) PDC cellular services on the 800 MHz band, and 3G FOMA W-CDMA services on the 2 GHz (UMTS2100) and 800 MHz (UMTS800 (Band VI)) and 1700 MHz (UMTS1700 (Band IX)) bands, and 4G LTE services. Its businesses also included PHS (Paldio), paging, and satellite. Docomo ceased offering a PHS service on January 7, 2008.

Customers[edit]
NTT Docomo is a subsidiary of Japan's incumbent telephone operator, NTT. The majority of NTT Docomo's shares are owned by NTT (which is 33.71% government-owned). While some NTT shares are publicly traded, control of the company by Japanese interests (government and civilian) is guaranteed by the number of shares available to buyers. It provides wireless voice and data communications to subscribers in Japan. NTT Docomo is the creator of W-CDMA technology as well as mobile i-mode service. In late 1995, Docomo CEO hired the consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers for strategy development, and at that time worked on the first design of data services on mobile for NTT Docomo CEO.[citation needed]
NTT Docomo has more than 53 million customers (as of March 2008), which is more than half of Japan's cellular market. The company provides a wide variety of mobile multimedia services. These include i-mode which provides e-mail and internet access to over 50 million subscribers, FOMA, which was launched in 2001 as the world's first 3G mobile service based on W-CDMA, Xi, a 4G LTE mobile service which was launched on December 24, 2010, and Premium 4G, a LTE Advanced service which was launched on March 27, 2015.
In addition to wholly owned subsidiaries in Europe and North America, the company is expanding its global reach through strategic alliances with mobile and multimedia service providers in Asia-Pacific and Europe. NTT Docomo is listed on the Tokyo (9437), London (NDCM), and New York (DCM) stock exchanges.
On April 19, 2008, it was announced that Ryuji Yamada, the current co-president of NTT Docomo, will be promoted as the president of NTT Docomo in June 2008. Masao Nakamura will stay in NTT Docomo as a director and also the senior adviser. Since October 2006, when the introduction to the service which allows the user to carry their original phone number with a new provider was made, NTT Docomo has lost many users to KDDI and SoftBank. This promotion was made in order to get more users for NTT Docomo.[8] The company was the last major global mobile carrier to offer Apple's iPhone, which it finally did with the release of the iPhone 5s and 5c. This has been cited as one of the reasons for the steady stream of its customers switching for competing networks.[9]
In June 2011, the company announced that they were teaming up with McAfee to provide McAfee VirusScan Mobile for its Android mobile users.[10] In July 2012, NTT Docomo acquired Italy's Buongiorno in a deal worth 209 million euros.[11]
Research and development[edit]





This section's tone or style may not reflect the encyclopedic tone used on Wikipedia. See Wikipedia's guide to writing better articles for suggestions. (May 2010) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


On October 2007, the prototype Wellness mobile phone of Japan's NTT Docomo Inc. and Mitsubishi Electric Corp. was launched at CEATEC. It checks health with a motion sensor that detects body movement and measures calories, and includes a breathalyzer.[12]
On January 24, 2008, NTT Docomo announced a partnership with Google, which allowed all models after the FOMA904i models to view YouTube videos.[13][14]
NTT Docomo is a founding member of the Symbian Foundation.[15]
Earthquake warning system[edit]
From 2008, Docomo began offering a service called the "Area Mail Disaster Information Service" which broadcasts Earthquake Early Warning messages produced by the Japan Meteorological Agency to its subscribers with compatible handsets.[16] This service is provided free of charge and messages are limited to those areas affected by each particular alert. These alerts have a unique ring tone so they can be easily distinguished from incoming calls or messages.
Civil protection system[edit]
From 2014, under Civil Protection Law of Japan, Docomo began offering a service called the "Area Mail Disaster and Evacuation Information Service" which broadcasts J-Alert messages (including Earthquake Early Warning) produced by the Japan Fire and Disaster Management Agency to its subscribers with compatible handsets (e.g. Sony XPERIA, iPhone 5s, Samsung Galaxy).[17]
The message is broadcast when the military threat is imminent (e.g. North Korea's ballistic missile launching, terrorist attack to nuclear power plant), volcanic eruptions, or approaching tsunami.
Mascot[edit]

The company's mascot is Docomodake, a mushroom, which is quite a celebrity in Japan. He even is the hero of a Nintendo DS puzzle and platforming video game, Boing! Docomodake DS, which was also released in North America and Europe.[18] He also has a wide variety of merchandising such as cell phone straps, keychains, and plush dolls. As one type of advertising method, there are many types of Docomodakes such as mother and father, which symbolizes the plans that NTT Docomo offers.
Emoji[edit]
Emoji, a pictographic language being adopted around the world was first created by NTT DoCoMo. The first emoji was created in 1998 or 1999 by Shigetaka Kurita, who was part of the team working on NTT DoCoMo's i-mode mobile Internet platform. The first set of 176 12×12 pixel emoji was created as part of i-mode's messaging features to help facilitate electronic communication, and to serve as a distinguishing feature from other services.[19]
Investments outside Japan[edit]




GSMA Mobile World Congress, Barcelona 2008 99. Note the new logo.


NTT Docomo has a wide range of foreign investments. However, NTT Docomo was not successful in investing in foreign carriers. Docomo had invested very large multibillion-dollar amounts in KPN, KT Freetel, AT&T Wireless, and had to write-off sell all these investments in foreign carriers. As a result, Docomo booked a total of about US$10 billion in losses, while during the same time Docomo's Japan operations were profitable.
In December 2007, NTT Docomo and KT Freetel jointly invested 200 million USD for a total of 33% stake in U Mobile Malaysia.
In June 2008 NTT Docomo joined the non-profit Symbian Foundation led by Nokia to co-develop a new Symbian smartphone operating system based on the S60 platform, which resulted in Symbian^2 for the Japanese market.[20]
In November 2008, NTT Docomo bought a 26% stake in Tata Teleservices for 2.7 billion USD, the number 6 in Indian telecom industry and owned by the Tata group. India is the world's fastest-growing cellular market, adding as many as 9 million new customers a month. Tata Teleservices (which sells under the brand Tata Indicom and Virgin Mobile India) has 80 million subscribers as of October 2010. Though Tata Indicom is a CDMA based operator, they won GSM licenses as well, and the NTT Docomo-Tata venture is focused on GSM operation (called Tata DOCOMO). The Tata DOCOMO service was commercially launched in India in June 2009. Tata DOCOMO had about 32.82 million users at the end of June 2010.
They have also taken over Guamcell, among others, and so are now the main wireless operator in Guam.
Docomo is working on implementing its FeliCa-based payment system, called iD, overseas. It has already launched the system in Guam, as well as Shanghai and Beijing, China (however, as of November 2010, it has withdrawn iD terminals from all merchants in China).
Docomo Capital[edit]
Working closely with NTT Docomo's business and R&D divisions, Docomo Capital is in charge of NTT Docomo's venture investments in mobile related start-up companies, mainly in the United States and has committed $100M in capital. It has invested in Cooliris, Couchbase, Evernote, Fab.com, HighlightCam, Swype, TuneWiki, and Sigfox.[21]
DOCOMO Digital[edit]
DOCOMO Digital is the holding company for the global digital ecosystem platform business operations of NTT DOCOMO.

NTT DOCOMO, Inc.[3][4] (株式会社NTTドコモ, Kabushiki Gaisha Enu Ti Ti Dokomo) is the predominant mobile phone operator in Japan. The name is officially an abbreviation of the phrase, "do communications over the mobile network", and is also from a compound word dokomo, meaning "everywhere" in Japanese.[5] Docomo provides phone, video phone (FOMA and Some PHS), i-mode (internet), and mail (i-mode mail, Short Mail, and SMS) services. The company's headquarters are in the Sanno Park Tower, Nagatachō, Chiyoda, Tokyo.[6] At the beginning of 2015, it was the fourth largest public company in Japan when measured by market capitalization.[7]
Docomo was spun off from Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) in August 1991 to take over the mobile cellular operations. It provides 2G (mova) PDC cellular services on the 800 MHz band, and 3G FOMA W-CDMA services on the 2 GHz (UMTS2100) and 800 MHz (UMTS800 (Band VI)) and 1700 MHz (UMTS1700 (Band IX)) bands, and 4G LTE services. Its businesses also included PHS (Paldio), paging, and satellite. Docomo ceased offering a PHS service on January 7, 2008.

Customers[edit]
NTT Docomo is a subsidiary of Japan's incumbent telephone operator, NTT. The majority of NTT Docomo's shares are owned by NTT (which is 33.71% government-owned). While some NTT shares are publicly traded, control of the company by Japanese interests (government and civilian) is guaranteed by the number of shares available to buyers. It provides wireless voice and data communications to subscribers in Japan. NTT Docomo is the creator of W-CDMA technology as well as mobile i-mode service. In late 1995, Docomo CEO hired the consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers for strategy development, and at that time worked on the first design of data services on mobile for NTT Docomo CEO.[citation needed]
NTT Docomo has more than 53 million customers (as of March 2008), which is more than half of Japan's cellular market. The company provides a wide variety of mobile multimedia services. These include i-mode which provides e-mail and internet access to over 50 million subscribers, FOMA, which was launched in 2001 as the world's first 3G mobile service based on W-CDMA, Xi, a 4G LTE mobile service which was launched on December 24, 2010, and Premium 4G, a LTE Advanced service which was launched on March 27, 2015.
In addition to wholly owned subsidiaries in Europe and North America, the company is expanding its global reach through strategic alliances with mobile and multimedia service providers in Asia-Pacific and Europe. NTT Docomo is listed on the Tokyo (9437), London (NDCM), and New York (DCM) stock exchanges.
On April 19, 2008, it was announced that Ryuji Yamada, the current co-president of NTT Docomo, will be promoted as the president of NTT Docomo in June 2008. Masao Nakamura will stay in NTT Docomo as a director and also the senior adviser. Since October 2006, when the introduction to the service which allows the user to carry their original phone number with a new provider was made, NTT Docomo has lost many users to KDDI and SoftBank. This promotion was made in order to get more users for NTT Docomo.[8] The company was the last major global mobile carrier to offer Apple's iPhone, which it finally did with the release of the iPhone 5s and 5c. This has been cited as one of the reasons for the steady stream of its customers switching for competing networks.[9]
In June 2011, the company announced that they were teaming up with McAfee to provide McAfee VirusScan Mobile for its Android mobile users.[10] In July 2012, NTT Docomo acquired Italy's Buongiorno in a deal worth 209 million euros.[11]
Research and development[edit]





This section's tone or style may not reflect the encyclopedic tone used on Wikipedia. See Wikipedia's guide to writing better articles for suggestions. (May 2010) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


On October 2007, the prototype Wellness mobile phone of Japan's NTT Docomo Inc. and Mitsubishi Electric Corp. was launched at CEATEC. It checks health with a motion sensor that detects body movement and measures calories, and includes a breathalyzer.[12]
On January 24, 2008, NTT Docomo announced a partnership with Google, which allowed all models after the FOMA904i models to view YouTube videos.[13][14]
NTT Docomo is a founding member of the Symbian Foundation.[15]
Earthquake warning system[edit]
From 2008, Docomo began offering a service called the "Area Mail Disaster Information Service" which broadcasts Earthquake Early Warning messages produced by the Japan Meteorological Agency to its subscribers with compatible handsets.[16] This service is provided free of charge and messages are limited to those areas affected by each particular alert. These alerts have a unique ring tone so they can be easily distinguished from incoming calls or messages.
Civil protection system[edit]
From 2014, under Civil Protection Law of Japan, Docomo began offering a service called the "Area Mail Disaster and Evacuation Information Service" which broadcasts J-Alert messages (including Earthquake Early Warning) produced by the Japan Fire and Disaster Management Agency to its subscribers with compatible handsets (e.g. Sony XPERIA, iPhone 5s, Samsung Galaxy).[17]
The message is broadcast when the military threat is imminent (e.g. North Korea's ballistic missile launching, terrorist attack to nuclear power plant), volcanic eruptions, or approaching tsunami.
Mascot[edit]




A large pile of Docomodake merchandise.


The company's mascot is Docomodake, a mushroom, which is quite a celebrity in Japan. He even is the hero of a Nintendo DS puzzle and platforming video game, Boing! Docomodake DS, which was also released in North America and Europe.[18] He also has a wide variety of merchandising such as cell phone straps, keychains, and plush dolls. As one type of advertising method, there are many types of Docomodakes such as mother and father, which symbolizes the plans that NTT Docomo offers.
Emoji[edit]
Emoji, a pictographic language being adopted around the world was first created by NTT DoCoMo. The first emoji was created in 1998 or 1999 by Shigetaka Kurita, who was part of the team working on NTT DoCoMo's i-mode mobile Internet platform. The first set of 176 12×12 pixel emoji was created as part of i-mode's messaging features to help facilitate electronic communication, and to serve as a distinguishing feature from other services.[19]
Investments outside Japan[edit]




GSMA Mobile World Congress, Barcelona 2008 99. Note the new logo.


NTT Docomo has a wide range of foreign investments. However, NTT Docomo was not successful in investing in foreign carriers. Docomo had invested very large multibillion-dollar amounts in KPN, KT Freetel, AT&T Wireless, and had to write-off sell all these investments in foreign carriers. As a result, Docomo booked a total of about US$10 billion in losses, while during the same time Docomo's Japan operations were profitable.
In December 2007, NTT Docomo and KT Freetel jointly invested 200 million USD for a total of 33% stake in U Mobile Malaysia.
In June 2008 NTT Docomo joined the non-profit Symbian Foundation led by Nokia to co-develop a new Symbian smartphone operating system based on the S60 platform, which resulted in Symbian^2 for the Japanese market.[20]
In November 2008, NTT Docomo bought a 26% stake in Tata Teleservices for 2.7 billion USD, the number 6 in Indian telecom industry and owned by the Tata group. India is the world's fastest-growing cellular market, adding as many as 9 million new customers a month. Tata Teleservices (which sells under the brand Tata Indicom and Virgin Mobile India) has 80 million subscribers as of October 2010. Though Tata Indicom is a CDMA based operator, they won GSM licenses as well, and the NTT Docomo-Tata venture is focused on GSM operation (called Tata DOCOMO). The Tata DOCOMO service was commercially launched in India in June 2009. Tata DOCOMO had about 32.82 million users at the end of June 2010.
They have also taken over Guamcell, among others, and so are now the main wireless operator in Guam.
Docomo is working on implementing its FeliCa-based payment system, called iD, overseas. It has already launched the system in Guam, as well as Shanghai and Beijing, China (however, as of November 2010, it has withdrawn iD terminals from all merchants in China).
Docomo Capital[edit]
Working closely with NTT Docomo's business and R&D divisions, Docomo Capital is in charge of NTT Docomo's venture investments in mobile related start-up companies, mainly in the United States and has committed $100M in capital. It has invested in Cooliris, Couchbase, Evernote, Fab.com, HighlightCam, Swype, TuneWiki, and Sigfox.[21]
DOCOMO Digital[edit]
DOCOMO Digital is the holding company for the global digital ecosystem platform business operations of NTT DOCOMO.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
