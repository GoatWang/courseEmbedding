Agilent Technologies Inc.. (9/19/13). "Press Release: Agilent Technologies Combines Its Life Sciences and Diagnostics Businesses, Lars Holmkvist Named Group President. Company Creates New Order-fulfillment Organization". Santa Clara, CA.
Henrik Ancher-Jensen Named President


Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE: A) today announced it has combined its Life Sciences Group with its Diagnostics and Genomics business, naming Lars Holmkvist the new group's president and senior vice president of Agilent, effective immediately. Holmkvist was previously president of the Diagnostics and Genomics Group and senior vice president of Agilent.

This organizational decision follows Agilent's announcement earlier today that it plans to separate the company into two independent publicly traded companies - one focused on life sciences, diagnostics and applied markets, retaining the Agilent name, and the other focused on electronic measurement, which will be named later.

Agilent, the life sciences, diagnostics and applied markets company, will be comprised of two businesses - the Chemical Analysis Group, led by Mike McMullen, current group president and Agilent senior vice president, and the new Life Sciences and Diagnostics Group, under Holmkvist as its president. Nick Roelofs, who has been president of the Life Sciences Group, will leave Agilent to pursue other business opportunities.

"We are creating a new Agilent with a simplified structure that can move quickly to develop and deliver industry-leading total workflow solutions for our customers," said William (Bill) Sullivan, Agilent president and CEO. "Lars is the ideal leader for the new group with his years of experience, depth of market knowledge and superb leadership style."

Agilent also announced that with the spinoff of its electronic measurement business, it has created a new Agilent Order Fulfillment organization. Henrik Ancher-Jensen has been named president of Agilent Order Fulfillment and senior vice president of Agilent. He replaces Gooi Soon Chai, who is joining the electronic measurement spinoff company. Ancher-Jensen was previously vice president, Global Product Supply, for Agilent's Diagnostics and Genomics Group, and corporate vice president, Global Operations, for Dako.

"Henrik understands the priority of customer satisfaction while at the same time contributing to margin expansion goals. His experience and drive for excellence makes him a great match for this important position," Sullivan said.

"The new simplified organization positions an already strong set of businesses for greater growth and shareholder return," Sullivan said.


Lars Holmkvist

Holmkvist joined Agilent in June 2012, when Agilent acquired Dako. He had been president and CEO of Dako since 2009. Before joining Dako, Holmkvist served as president, Europe, for Applied Biosystems, where he was later promoted to president, International, with responsibilities for all commercial operations outside the U.S.

Holmkvist brings more than 25 years' experience within the medical device and pharmaceutical industries, where he has held increasingly significant roles in marketing, sales and business management. He holds a degree in economics from Handelshogskolan Sundsvall in Sweden.


Henrik Ancher-Jensen

Ancher-Jensen came to Agilent in June 2012 with the acquisition of Dako. He joined Dako in 2006 as vice president, Supply Chain, and chief information officer, and was subsequently promoted to corporate vice president, Global Operations. Prior to joining Dako, he spent more than 15 years in senior management roles and management consulting with Chr. Hansen, Deloitte Consulting and NVE. Ancher-Jensen holds a degree in economics from Aarhus University in Denmark.
