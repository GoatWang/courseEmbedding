Large Blend







The investment seeks growth of capital.
 The fund's Adviser seeks to meet the fund's investment objective of growth of capital by employing a value investment strategy to its selection of predominantly Large Cap and Mid Cap common stocks for the portfolio. That investment strategy is built upon three components: Disciplined Approach, Risk Aversion and Long-Term Orientation. While most of the fund's assets will be invested in domestic common stock, it may also invest in U.S. traded Large Cap and Mid Cap securities issued by companies organized outside the United States including American Depositary Receipts.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

                    For the period ending June 30, 2017, the Fund's (Investor Class) 1-, 5-, and 10-year average annual returns were 21.29%, 15.25%, and 6.27%, respectively.
                    
                    Performance data 
                              quoted represents past performance and is no 
                              guarantee of future results.   Current 
                              performance may be lower or higher than the 
                              performance quoted.  Investment return and 
                              principal value of an investment will fluctuate so 
                              that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be 
                              worth more or less than the original 
                  cost. As stated in the current prospectus, the total annual fund operating expense ratio (gross) is 0.91% for the Investor Class and 0.82% for the Institutional Class.  The Institutional Class' net expense ratio is 0.75% since the Fund Adviser agreed to reimburse all of the ordinary expenses.  This agreement is in effect until at least May 1, 2018. Returns greater than one year are annualized.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the Fund's future  performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, Fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes.



This chart illustrates the perfomance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in the Sound Shore Fund (Investor Class) on May 17, 1985 (the Investor Class inception) through June 30, 2017
. Figures include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends. This chart is not Intended to imply future perfomance of the Fund.

The inception date for the Investor Class (SSHFX) is May 17, 1985. The inception date for the Institutional Class
is December 9, 2013. The performance for the Institutional Class prior to its inception on 12/9/13 is based on the performance of the Investor Class, adjusted to reflect the Institutional Class' lower expense ratio (net of expense reimbursements).

MORNINGSTAR OVERALL RATING TM : 
The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and ten-year Morningstar Rating metrics.
To learn more about the Fund through Morningstar, please click here

* Market volatility can significantly impact short-term performance. Total return figures reflect reinvestment of all dividend and capital gain distributions. Returns over 1 year are annualized. During the period, some of the Fund's fees and expenses were waived; had these fees and expenses not been waived, the Fund's performance would be lower.

                    Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. The Morningstar Rating is for the share class specified only; ratings for other share classes will vary.  Sound Shore Fund (Investor Class) was rated against the following numbers of U.S. domiciled Large Value funds over the following time periods: 1,091 funds in the last three years, 936 funds in the last five years, and 681 funds in the last ten years. With respect to these Large Value funds, Sound Shore Fund (Investor Class) received a Morningstar Rating of 3, 5, 3 stars for the three-, five- and ten-year periods, respectively.
