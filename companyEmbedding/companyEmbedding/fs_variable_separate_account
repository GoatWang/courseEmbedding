Separate Accounts

Last Updated 7/11/17
A “separate account” is a fund held by a life insurance  company that   is maintained separately from the insurer's general assets.  Separate   accounts were originally established in response to federal securities    laws for investment-linked variable annuities.   Although it took many years, the  application of separate accounts has   dramatically expanded beyond this simple  product design. Product   development has resulted with an array of “hybrid”  products—products   that overlay traditional insurance company guarantees (e.g.,  mortality,   morbidity, etc.) being allocated to the separate account investment    portfolio.
The use of separate accounts by insurers has evolved rapidly  over the   past 20 years. In response to recommendations to clarify information    pertaining to separate account products, and related separate account   assets,  detailed information is available in the statutory financial   statements:

Distinct filings for       separate products that are   “insulated” or “not insulated” from the general       account creditors.   When completing the insulated separate account filing,       the   reporting entity is only to include those assets that are legally         insulated by state law or statute, in which the state law provides legal         protection to the separate account contract holder from the   general       account liabilities. 
Detailed information on       the characteristics of   separate account assets, specifically categorizing       separate   account assets in accordance with the following characteristics: 
          
Identification of        separate account assets   legally insulated and those which are not legally        insulated.   Identification is also required for all separate account        assets   not reported at fair value, and the measurement basis used for          those separate account assets. 
Amount of separate        account assets that   represent seed money, other fees and expenses due to        the general   account and additional required surplus amounts. (Additional          required surplus is defined as additional or permanent surplus that is          required to be retained in the separate account in accordance with   state        law or regulations.) Information is reported on any   current year        transfers to the separate account for seed money, as   well as the duration        in which seed money, other fees and   expenses, and additional required        surplus amounts due to the   general account have been held in the separate        account. 
Identification of        separate account assets in   which the investment directive is not        determined by the contract   holder. Situations in which the investment        directive is not   determined by the contract holder also require        disclosure on   whether the investments, if included in the general        account,   would have resulted with the reporting entity exceeding any          general account investment limitations. 
Identification of        separate account assets in   which less than 100% of investment proceeds        are attributed to the   contract holder. This also includes identification        of the   separate account investment income attributed to the reporting          entity during the reporting period, and whether the income was          transferred to the general account or reinvested within the separate          account. 
Identification of all        products reported as a   separate account product under statutory        accounting principles,   and whether the product was classified differently        under U.S.   GAAP. For products with different classifications between          statutory accounting and U.S. GAAP, identification of the   characteristics        that resulted with a different classification   under U.S. GAAP.


Information on separate account products with general    accounting guarantees, including the amount of guarantees paid by the   general  account for the current reporting year, and for the previous   four reporting  years. This information also details the risk charges   paid from the separate  account to the general account related to these   guarantees, and whether the  risk charges are reviewed and opined upon.

behalf of each separate account of the Company set forth on Schedules A-1 and A-2, as may be
amended from time to time (the “Separate Accounts”) which Amendment is dated as of October ____,
2014 and effective as of October 1, 2014 (the “Effective Date”).

     WHEREAS, the parties hereto entered into the Amended and Restated Fund Participation
Agreement, which was executed as of August 26, 2013 and effective as of October 1, 2010 (the

Company;

     WHEREAS, the parties desire to amend the Agreement to revise the allocation of expenses for

     WHEREAS, the parties wish to update provisions in the Agreement relating to representations

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and mutual covenants hereinafter contained,

2.2
 
(a) At least annually, the Underwriter or its designee shall provide the

electronic version of the prospectus suitable for duplication by the Company and other
assistance as is reasonably necessary in order for the Company once each year (or more

(d) The Underwriter or its designee shall provide the Company, free of charge, with
copies, if and to the extent applicable to the Shares, of the Fund’s reports to

for which the Company requests reimbursement. The Company agrees to use its best
efforts to minimize any such expenses. The Company agrees that any printer it selects
shall be a reputable printer within the industry.

2.3 With respect to any prospectus, shareholder report, shareholder communication or proxy
solicitation materials that concern solely the Fund and no other investment vehicle funding

its designee with supporting documentation which is sufficient in the reasonable
opinion of the Underwriter or its designee to enable the Underwriter or its
designee to verify the expenses for which the Company requests reimbursement
pursuant to the formula described above. For clarity, the Underwriter or its
designee will only pay the costs described above with respect to printing the
materials described above for existing Contract owners whose Contracts are

best efforts to minimize any such expenses. The Company agrees that any printer
it selects shall be a reputable printer within the industry.

number of pages of the Combined Report and “C” represents the total usual,
customary and reasonable costs of printing the Combined Report. The Company will
provide the Underwriter or its designee with supporting documentation which is
sufficient in the reasonable opinion of the Underwriter or its designee to
enable the Underwriter or its designee to verify the expenses for which the
Company requests reimbursement pursuant to the formula described above. For
clarity, the Underwriter or its designee will only pay the costs described above
with respect to printing the materials described above for existing Contract
owners whose Contracts are funded by Shares and will not pay any costs in
connection with printing such materials for existing Contract owners whose
Contracts are not funded by such Shares or prospective purchasers of Contracts.
The Company agrees to use its best efforts to minimize any such expenses. The
Company agrees that any printer it selects shall be a reputable printer within
the industry.


 

 
(c)
 
The usual, customary and reasonable postage and mailing expenses
for distributing the Combined Prospectus and the Combined Report to existing
Contract owners whose Contracts are funded by Shares will be proportionally
borne by the Underwriter or its designee by applying the following formula:
[A/B] x C where “A” equals the number of prospectus/reports in the Combined
Prospectus/Combined Report that is distributed on behalf of the Fund, “B” equals
the total number of prospectuses/reports in the Combined Prospectus/Combined
Report and “C” represents the total usual, customary and reasonable costs of
distributing the Combined Prospectus/Combined Report. The Company will provide
the Underwriter or its designee with supporting documentation which is
sufficient in the reasonable opinion of the Underwriter or its designee to
enable the Underwriter or its designee to verify the expenses for which the
Company requests reimbursement pursuant to the formula described above. For
clarity, the Underwriter or its designee will only pay the costs described above
with respect to providing the materials described above to existing Contract
owners whose Contracts are funded by Shares and will not pay any costs in
connection with providing such materials to existing Contract owners whose
Contracts are not funded by such Shares or prospective purchasers of Contracts.

2.5
 
(a) In the event that an electronic version of the materials is provided, the
Underwriter or its designee shall be responsible solely for providing the materials in
the format in which it is accustomed to formatting such materials and shall bear the
expense of providing the materials in such format, and the Company shall bear the
expense of adjusting or changing the format to conform with any of its Contract
materials.



(b) The provision of such documents shall not be required to be made any sooner than
promptly after the filing of such document(s) with the SEC or other regulatory
authorities.

(c) Except as specified above, the Underwriter and its designee shall bear no
expenses for preparing and filing with regulatory authorities all disclosure and
other materials regarding the Separate Accounts and/or Contracts, including, but not
limited to, prospectuses, periodic reports to shareholders and other shareholder
communications, the responsibilities for such materials and the expenses therefor to
be borne by the Company.

2.6
The Company shall furnish, or cause to be furnished, to the Fund or its designee, a
copy of language that would be used in any prospectus or private placement memorandum
(“PPM”) for the Contracts or statement of additional information for the Contracts in which
the Fund, the Underwriter or BAL (“Fund Parties”) is named prior to the filing of such
document with the SEC. The Company shall furnish, or shall cause to be furnished, to the
Fund or its designee, each piece of sales literature or other promotional material in which
the Fund, the Underwriter or BAL is named, at least ten Business Days prior to its use. No
such prospectus or PPM, statement of additional information or material shall be used if any
of the Fund Parties reasonably objects to such use.
4.
Section 3.5 of the Agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced by the revised
Section 3.5 as follows:
     3.5 The Fund represents and warrants that: (i) it does and will comply in all material
respects with the 1940 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder; (ii) the Fund’s 1940
Act registration statement has been filed with the SEC in accordance with the provisions of
the 1940 Act and the Fund is duly registered as an open-end management investment company
thereunder; (iii) the Fund’s registration statement has been declared effective by the SEC;
(iv) the Fund shares will be issued in compliance in all material respects with all
applicable federal laws; (v) the Fund will remain registered under and will comply in all
material respects with the 1940 Act during the term of this Agreement; (vi) the Fund shall
register and qualify its shares for sale in accordance with the laws of the various states
only if and to the extent deemed advisable by the Fund; (vii) the Fund shall not take any
action which would impact the treatment of the Contracts as annuities under Section 72 of
the Code; and (viii) income earned by the Portfolios, whether from the ownership of a wholly
owned subsidiary that is a controlled foreign corporation or from other investments, shall
constitute qualifying income to the Portfolios for purposes of section 851(b)(2) of the
Code.

5.
Section 3.6 of the Agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced by the revised
Section 3.6 as follows:
     3.6 The Fund has adopted a Distribution Plan (the “Plan”) with regard to the Class II
and Class III shares of each Portfolio, pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the Investment Company
Act. The Plan permits the Underwriter to pay to each Insurance Company that enters into an
agreement with the Underwriter to provide distribution related services to Contract owners,
a

4



 

fee, at the end of each month, of up to 0.15% of the net asset value of the Class II
shares and up to 0.25% of the net asset value of Class III shares of each Portfolio held by
such Insurance Company. The Company agrees to waive the payment of any such distribution
fee unless and until the Underwriter has received such fees from the Fund. The Fund shall
provide notice of any modification or termination of such payments under the Plan. If the
Plan is no longer effective or is no longer applicable to the Portfolios in the Contracts
(the “12b-1 Termination”), the parties shall discuss, in good faith, alternate fee
arrangements. If no new agreement is reached within thirty (30) days after the 12b-1
Termination (or at such later date mutually acceptable to all parties), the Company, at its
option, may elect to immediately terminate this Agreement, and/or may elect to obtain an
order of exemption pursuant to Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act (a “Substitution Order”) for
the Portfolio(s).

6.
A new Section 3.12 is hereby added to the Agreement as follows:
     3.12 BAL represents and warrants that: (i) BAL is a limited liability company duly
organized and in good standing under Delaware law; (ii) BAL is registered as an investment
adviser under federal securities laws; (iii) the Fund shares offered and sold pursuant to
this Agreement will be registered under the 1933 Act and each Fund shall be registered under
the 1940 Act (iv) each Portfolio is currently qualified as a regulated investment company
(“RIC”) under Subchapter M of the Code, and represents that it will use its best efforts to
qualify and to maintain qualification of each Portfolio as a RIC. BAL will notify the
Company immediately in writing upon having a reasonable basis for believing that a Portfolio
has ceased to so qualify or that it might not so qualify in the future; (v) it will comply
and maintain each Portfolio’s compliance with the diversification requirements set forth in
Section 817(h) of the Code and Section 1.817-5 of the regulations under the Code. BAL will
notify the Company immediately upon having a reasonable basis for believing that a Portfolio
has ceased to so comply or that a Portfolio might not so comply in the future. In the event
of a breach of this Section 3.12 by the Portfolio, it will take all reasonable steps to
adequately diversify the Portfolio so as to achieve compliance within the grace period
afforded by Section 1.817-5 of the regulations under the Code; (vi) BAL shall not take any
action which would impact the treatment of the Contracts as annuities under Section 72 of
the Code; and (vii) income earned by the Portfolios, whether from the ownership of a wholly
owned subsidiary that is a controlled foreign corporation or from other investments, shall
constitute qualifying income to the Portfolios for purposes of section 851(b)(2) of the
Code.

7. Section 5.2 is amended with the addition of a new Section 5.2A as found below. Sections 5.3
and 5.4 are hereby deleted in their entirety and replaced by the revised Sections 5.3 and 5.4 as
found below:

5.2A BAL agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and each of its directors,
officers, employees and agents and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the
meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act (collectively, the “Indemnified Parties” for purposes
of this Article 5) against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities (including
amounts paid in settlement with the written consent of BAL and the Underwriter) or expenses
(including the reasonable costs of investigating or defending any alleged loss, claim,
damage liability or expense and reasonable legal counsel fees incurred in connection
therewith) (collectively, “Losses”), to which the Indemnified Parties may become subject
under any statute or regulation, or at common law or otherwise, insofar as such Losses:

(a) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statements of a material fact contained
in the registration statement or prospectus for the Fund (or any amendments or
supplements thereto) (collectively, “Fund Documents” for the purposes of this Article
5), or arise out of or are based upon the omission to state therein a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, provided that this indemnity shall not apply as to any Indemnified Party
if such statement or

5



 

omission was made in reliance upon and was accurately derived
from written information furnished to BAL and/or the Underwriter by or on behalf of
the Company for use in Fund Documents or otherwise for use in connection with the
sale of the Contracts or Shares; or

(b) arise out of or result from statements or representations (other than statements
or representations contained in and accurately derived from Company Documents) or
wrongful conduct of BAL or persons under BAL’s control, with respect to the sale or
acquisition of the Contracts or Shares; or

(c) arise out of or result from any untrue statement of a material fact contained in
the Company Documents or the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading if such statement or omission was made in reliance upon and accurately
derived from written information furnished to the Company by BAL; or

(d) arise out of or result from any failure by BAL to provide the services or furnish
the materials required under the terms of this Agreement; or

(e) arise out of or result from any material breach of any representation and/or
warranty made by BAL in this Agreement or arise out of or result from any other
material breach of this Agreement by BAL.

It being understood that in no way shall BAL, the Funds or the Underwriter be liable to the
Company with respect to any violation of insurance law, compliance with which is a
responsibility of the Company under this Agreement or otherwise or as to which the Company
failed to inform BAL and the Underwriter in accordance with Section 3.10 hereof.

5.3 Neither the Company nor the Fund Parties shall be liable under the indemnification
provisions of Section 5.1, 5.2 or 5.2A, as applicable, with respect to any Losses incurred
or assessed against any Indemnified Party to the extent such Losses arise out of or result
from such Indemnified Party’s willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the
performance of such Indemnified Party’s duties or by reason of such Indemnified Party’s
reckless disregard of obligations or duties under this Agreement.

5.4 Neither the Company nor the Fund Parties shall be liable under the indemnification
provisions of Section 5.1, 5.2 or 5.2A, as applicable, with respect to any claim made
against an Indemnified Party unless such Indemnified Party shall have notified the other
party in writing within a reasonable time after the summons, or other first written
notification, giving information of the nature of the claim shall have been served upon or
otherwise received by such Indemnified Party (or after such Indemnified Party shall have
received notice of service upon or other notification to any designated agent), but failure
to notify the party against whom indemnification is sought of any such claim shall not
relieve that party from any liability which it may have to the Indemnified Party in the
absence of Sections 5.1, 5.2 and 5.2A.

In case any such action is brought against the Indemnified Parties, the indemnifying party
shall be entitled to participate, at its own expense, in the defense of such action. The
indemnifying party also shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof, with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the party named in such action. After notice from the
indemnifying party to the Indemnified Party of an election to assume such defense, the
Indemnified Party shall bear the fees and expenses of any additional counsel retained by it,
and the indemnifying party will not be liable to the Indemnified Party under this Agreement
for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such party independently in
connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.

9. A new Article 9 is being added to the Agreement as follows:
Article 9
Confidentiality

     9 Confidentiality; Privacy. 

     (a) “Confidential Information” is defined as: information, including a formula, pattern,
compilation, program, device, method or process, that derives independent economic value (actual or
potential) from not being generally known to or readily ascertainable through appropriate means by
other persons who might obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, and is the subject of
efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its confidentiality. Subject to
the foregoing, confidential information includes, without limitation, information relating to
computer systems, participant data, customer lists and business plans. Except as expressly
permitted by this Agreement, each party hereto will: (i) keep and maintain all Confidential
Information of the other party in strict confidence, using such degree of care as is appropriate to
avoid unauthorized use or disclosure; and (ii) not, directly or indirectly, disclose any
Confidential Information of the other party to any third party, except with the other party’s prior
written consent or as permitted by this Agreement.

     (b) Each party will be permitted to disclose the other’s Confidential Information only to its
employees, legal counsel, auditors and agents (collectively, “Recipients”) having a need to know
the Confidential Information in connection with or related to the performance of its obligations
under this Agreement. In addition, Fund Parties will be permitted to disclose the Company’s
Confidential Information to their employees, affiliates, and third parties (also, “Recipients”) for
marketing, distribution strategy, analytical, trade attribution, scrubbing, processing, customer
relationship management, regulatory and/or other similar purposes. Despite any contrary provision
in this Agreement, any party may disclose the other’s Confidential Information to the extent
required to comply with law, regulatory request or a court order; provided, however, that each
party must promptly notify the other party of receipt of a request for Confidential Information
made pursuant to law, regulatory request or court order, give the other party a reasonable
opportunity to prevent the disclosure of the Confidential Information, and reasonably cooperate
with the other party in any efforts they make to prevent the disclosure of the Confidential
Information.

     (c) The fee terms in the attendant Administrative Services Agreement (including basis point
rates) shall be deemed Confidential Information of Fund Parties.

     (d) Despite any contrary provision in this Agreement, Confidential Information of a party
will not include information that: (i) is or becomes generally known to the public not as a result
of a disclosure by the other party, (ii) is rightfully in the possession of the other party before
disclosure by the first party, (iii) is independently developed by the other party without reliance
on the Confidential Information, or

7



 

(iv) is received by the other party in good faith and without
restriction from a third party not under a confidentiality obligation to the first party and having
the right to make such disclosure. Each party acknowledges that the disclosure of the others’
Confidential Information may cause irreparable injury to the other party and damages which may be
difficult to ascertain. Therefore, each party will be entitled to injunctive relief upon a
disclosure or threatened disclosure of any of its Confidential Information that would violate the
terms of this Agreement. Without limitation of the foregoing, each party will advise the other
party immediately in the event that it learns or has reason to believe that any person or entity
which has had access to Confidential Information has violated or intends to violate the terms of
this Agreement.

     (e) For purposes of this Article 9, the Fund Parties shall be considered to be a “party,” and
the Company shall be considered a “party”.

     (f) Each party has adopted policies and practices related to the protection of non-public
personal information pursuant to SEC Regulation S-P. These policies and practices are designed to
comply with Regulation S-P in all material respects, including, but not limited to, the obligation
to provide appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards reasonably designed to (i)
provide for the security and confidentiality of customer records and information; (ii) protect
against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of customer records and
information; and (iii) protect against unauthorized access to or use of customer records or
information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer.

10. Unless otherwise defined in this Amendment, terms used herein will have the same meanings
they have in the Agreement.

11. Except as set forth above, the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance
with its terms.

12. This Amendment may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an
original.

ITEM 28.  INDEMNIFICATION 

Insofar as indemnification for liability arising under the Securities Act of    
1933 ("Act") may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of 
the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the          
Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange  
Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act
and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification 
against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses  
incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the Registrant 
in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such
director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being 
registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter
has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate     
jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public  
policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of
such issue.                                                                     

FIRST SUNAMERICA LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY                                         

Section 719 of the Business Corporation Law of the State of New York permits the
indemnification of directors, officers, employees and agents of New York        
corporations. Section 10 of the Third Article of the Company's Amended and      
Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Article Fifteen of the Company's      
parent, AIG Retirement Services, Inc., By-Laws provide for the indemnification  
of directors and officers to the full extent required or permitted by the law,  
including the advance of expenses under the procedures set forth herein. In     
addition, the Company's officers and directors are covered by certain directors'
and officers' liability insurance policies maintained by the Company's parent.  

Additionally, pursuant to the Distribution Agreement filed as Exhibit 3(a) to   
this Registration Statement, Depositor has agreed to indemnify and hold harmless
AIG SunAmerica Capital Services, Inc. ("Distributor") for damages and expenses  
arising out of (1) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a        
material fact contained in materials prepared by Depositor in conjunction with  
the offer and sale of the contracts, or Depositor's failure to comply with      
applicable law or other material breach of the Distribution Agreement. Likewise,
the Distributor has agreed to indemnify and hold harmless Depositor and its     
affiliates, including its officers, directors and the separate account, for     
damages and expenses arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue      
statement of a material fact contained in materials prepared by Distributor in  
conjunction with the offer and sale of the contracts, or Distributor's failure  
to comply with applicable law or other material breach of the Distribution      
Agreement.                                                                      

Pursuant to the Selling Agreement, a form of which is filed as Exhibit 3(b) to  
this Registration Statement, Depositor and Distributor are generally indemnified
by selling broker/dealers firms from wrongful conduct or omissions in           
conjunction with the sale of the contracts.

HIGHLIGHTS





The Seasons Elite Variable Annuity is a contract between you and First
SunAmerica Life. It is designed to help you invest on a tax-deferred basis and
meet long-term financial goals. There are minimum Purchase Payment amounts
required to purchase a contract. Purchase Payments may be invested in a variety
of Variable Portfolios and Fixed Accounts. Like all deferred annuities, the
contract has an Accumulation Phase and an Income Phase. During the Accumulation
Phase, you invest money in your contract. The Income Phase begins when you start
receiving annuity income payments from your annuity to provide for your
retirement.


RIGHT TO EXAMINE:  You may cancel your contract within 10 days after receiving
it, and not be charged a withdrawal charge. You will receive the greater of
Purchase Payments or the value of your contract on the day that we receive your
request. The amount may be more or less than your original Purchase Payment.

PLEASE SEE PURCHASING A SEASONS ELITE VARIABLE ANNUITY AND RIGHT TO EXAMINE IN
THE PROSPECTUS.


EXPENSES: There are fees and charges associated with the contract. Each year, we
deduct a $35 contract maintenance fee from your contract, which is currently
waived for contracts of $50,000 or more. We also deduct separate account
charges, which equal 1.55% annually of the average daily value of your contract
allocated to the Variable Portfolios. There are investment charges on amounts
invested in the Variable Portfolios, including 12b-1 fees of 0.25%. If you elect
optional features available under the contract, we may charge additional fees
for those features. A separate withdrawal charge schedule applies to each
Purchase Payment. Withdrawal charges no longer apply to a Purchase Payment that
has been in the contract for four complete years. PLEASE SEE THE FEE TABLE,
PURCHASING A SEASONS ELITE VARIABLE ANNUITY AND EXPENSES IN THE PROSPECTUS.


ACCESS TO YOUR MONEY:  You may withdraw money from your contract during the
Accumulation Phase. If you make a withdrawal, earnings are deemed to be
withdrawn first. You will pay income taxes on earnings and untaxed contributions
when you withdraw them. Annuity income payments received during the Income Phase
are considered partly a return of your original investment. A federal tax
penalty may apply if you make withdrawals before age 59 1/2. As noted above, a
withdrawal charge may apply. PLEASE SEE ACCESS TO YOUR MONEY AND TAXES IN THE
PROSPECTUS.


OPTIONAL LIVING BENEFITS:  You may elect one of the optional living benefits
available under your contract for an additional fee. These living benefits are
designed to protect a portion of your investment in the event your contract
value declines due to unfavorable investment performance during the Accumulation
Phase and before a death benefit is payable. In addition, some of these benefits
can provide a guaranteed income stream that may last as long as you live. PLEASE
SEE OPTIONAL LIVING BENEFITS IN THE PROSPECTUS.


DEATH BENEFIT:  A death benefit feature is available under the contract to
protect your Beneficiaries in the event of your death during the Accumulation
Phase. PLEASE SEE DEATH BENEFITS IN THE PROSPECTUS.


ANNUITY INCOME OPTIONS:  When you are ready to begin taking annuity income
payments, you can choose to receive annuity income payments on a variable basis,
fixed basis or a combination of both. You may also choose from five different
annuity income options, including an option for annuity income that you cannot
outlive. PLEASE SEE ANNUITY INCOME OPTIONS IN THE PROSPECTUS.


INQUIRIES:  If you have questions about your contract, call your financial
representative or contact us at First SunAmerica Life Insurance Company, Annuity
Service Center P.O. Box 54299, Los Angeles, California 90054-0299. Telephone

(4) MarketLock Income Plus is an optional guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit.
The initial Income Base is equal to the first Purchase Payment. The Income
Base is increased by subsequent Purchase Payments received in years 1-5,
capped at the first contract year's Purchase Payments, adjusted for Excess
Withdrawals during the applicable period. On each contract anniversary
during the first 5 years, the Income Base is increased to the greater of (a)
or (b), where (a) is the highest contract anniversary value (less Purchase
Payments in excess of the annual cap in contract years 2-5 and all Purchase
Payments after the first 5 contract years) and (b) is the current Income
Base plus an additional amount, if eligible; and adjusted for Excess
Withdrawals during the applicable period. On the 10th contract anniversary,
the Income Base will be increased to at least 200% of the Purchase Payments
made in the first contract year, provided no withdrawals are taken prior to
that anniversary. The annualized fee is deducted from the portion of your
contract value allocated to the Variable Portfolios at the end of the first
quarter following election and quarterly thereafter. The fee is deducted
proportionately from your contract value by redeeming the number of
Accumulation Units invested in Variable Portfolios which equals the amount
of the fee. Excess Withdrawals refer to amounts exceeding the maximum annual
amount available at the time of withdrawal under this feature.


(5) MarketLock For Life Plus is an optional guaranteed minimum withdrawal
benefit. The initial Income Base is equal to the first Purchase Payment. The
Income Base is increased by subsequent Purchase Payments received in years
1-5, capped at the first contract year's Purchase Payments, adjusted for
Excess Withdrawals during the applicable period. On each contract
anniversary during the first 10 years, the Income Base is increased to the
greater of (a) or (b), where (a) is the highest contract anniversary value
(less Purchase Payments in excess of the annual cap in contract years 2-5
and all Purchase Payments after the first 5 contract years) and (b) is the
current Income Base plus an additional amount, if eligible; and adjusted for
Excess Withdrawals during the applicable period. If you elect the +7%
option, on the 10th contract anniversary, the Income Base will be increased
to at least 200% of the Purchase Payments made in the first contract year,
provided no withdrawals are taken prior to that anniversary. The annualized
fee is deducted from the portion of your contract value allocated to the
Variable Portfolios at the end of the first quarter following election and
quarterly thereafter. The fee is deducted proportionately from your contract
value by redeeming the number of Accumulation Units invested in Variable
Portfolios which equals the amount of the fee. Excess Withdrawals refer to
amounts exceeding the maximum annual amount available at the time of
withdrawal under this feature.


(6) MarketLock is an optional guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit. The MAV
Benefit Base equals the greater of (a) Purchase Payments made in the first
two years, or (b) the highest contract anniversary value (less Purchase
Payments made after the first two years) during the period in which
anniversary values are being considered, each adjusted for withdrawals
during the applicable period. The applicable annualized fee is deducted from
the portion of your contract value allocated to the Variable Portfolios at
the end of the first quarter following election and quarterly thereafter.
The fee is deducted proportionately from your contract value by redeeming
Accumulation Units invested in Variable Portfolios which equal the amount of
the fee.


(7) Seasons Promise is an optional guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit. The
annualized fee is deducted from the portion of your contract value allocated
to the Variable Portfolios at the end of the first quarter following
election and quarterly thereafter. The fee is deducted proportionately from
contract value by redeeming Accumulation Units invested in Variable
Portfolios which equal the amount of the fee.


(8) The maximum expense is for an Underlying Fund of Seasons Series Trust, as of
its fiscal year ended March 31, 2008. The minimum expense is for an
Underlying Fund of Fidelity Variable Insurance Products Trust, as of its
fiscal year ended December 31, 2007.

MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM EXPENSE EXAMPLES





These examples are intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the
contract with the cost of investing in other variable annuity contracts. These
costs include owner transaction expenses, the contract maintenance fee if any,
separate account annual expenses, available optional feature fees and Underlying
Fund expenses.


The examples assume that you invest $10,000 in the contract for the time periods
indicated; that your investment has a 5% return each year; and you incur the
maximum and minimum fees and expenses of the Underlying Fund. Although your
actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions, your costs at
the end of the stated period would be:





MAXIMUM EXPENSE EXAMPLES


(assuming maximum separate account annual expenses of 1.75%, including the
optional enhanced death benefit, the optional MarketLock Income Plus feature

(1.20%) and investment in an Underlying Fund with total expenses of 1.75%)


(1) If you surrender your contract at the end of the applicable time period:






1 YEAR   3 YEARS   5 YEARS   10 YEARS
------   -------   -------   --------
$1,176   $2,030    $2,390     $4,810

 $476    $1,430    $2,390     $4,810











MINIMUM EXPENSE EXAMPLES


(assuming minimum separate account annual expenses of 1.55%, no election of
optional features and investment in an Underlying Fund with total expenses of
0.68%)

EXPLANATION OF FEE TABLE AND EXAMPLES



1. The purpose of the Fee Table and Expense Examples is to show you the various
fees and expenses you would incur directly and indirectly by investing in
this variable annuity contract. The Fee Table and Expense Examples represent
both fees of the separate account as well as the maximum and minimum total
annual Underlying Fund operating expenses. We converted the contract
maintenance fee to a percentage (0.05%). The actual impact of the contract
maintenance fee may differ from this percentage and may be waived for
contract values over $50,000. Additional information on the Underlying Fund
fees can be found in the Trust prospectuses.


2. In addition to the stated assumptions, the Expense Examples also assume that
no transfer fees were imposed.


3. If you elected other optional features, your expenses would be lower than
those shown in these Maximum Expense Examples. The Maximum Expense Examples
assume that the Income Base, which is used to calculate the MarketLock Income
Plus fee, equals contract value and that no withdrawals are taken during the
stated period.


4. You do not pay fees for optional features once you begin the Income Phase
(annuitize your contract); therefore, your expenses will be lower than those
shown here. PLEASE SEE ANNUITY INCOME OPTIONS BELOW.



THESE EXAMPLES SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A REPRESENTATION OF PAST OR FUTURE







EXPENSES. ACTUAL EXPENSES MAY BE GREATER OR LESSER THAN THOSE SHOWN.

THE SEASONS ELITE VARIABLE ANNUITY





When you purchase a variable annuity, a contract exists between you and an
insurance company. You are the owner of the contract. The contract provides
several main benefits:


- OPTIONAL LIVING BENEFIT: If you elect an optional living benefit, the
insurance company guarantees to protect a portion of your investment in
the event your contract value declines due to unfavorable investment
performance and may provide a guaranteed income stream or other benefits.


- DEATH BENEFIT: If you die during the Accumulation Phase, the insurance
company pays a death benefit to your Beneficiary.


- GUARANTEED INCOME: Once you begin the Income Phase, you receive a stream
of annuity income payments for your lifetime, or another available period
you select.


- TAX DEFERRAL: This means that you do not pay taxes on your earnings from
the contract until you withdraw them.


Tax-qualified retirement plans (e.g., IRAs, 401(k) or 403(b) plans) defer
payment of taxes on earnings until withdrawal. If you are considering funding a
tax-qualified retirement plan with an annuity, you should know that an annuity
does not provide any additional tax deferral treatment of earnings beyond the
treatment provided by the tax-qualified retirement plan itself. However,
annuities do provide other features and benefits, which may be valuable to you.
You should fully discuss this decision with your financial representative.


This variable annuity was developed to help you contribute to your retirement
savings. This variable annuity works in two stages: the Accumulation Phase and
the Income Phase. Your contract is in the Accumulation Phase during the period
when you make Purchase Payments into the contract. The Income Phase begins after
the specified waiting period when you start taking annuity income payments.


The contract is called a "variable" annuity because it allows you to invest in
Variable Portfolios which, like mutual funds, have different investment
objectives and performance. You can gain or lose money if you invest in these
Variable Portfolios. The amount of money you accumulate in your contract depends
on the performance of the Variable Portfolios in which you invest.


Fixed Accounts, if available, earn interest at a rate set and guaranteed by the
Company. If you allocate money to a Fixed Account, the amount of money that
accumulates in the contract depends on the total interest credited to the
particular Fixed Account in which you invest.


For more information on investment options available under this contract, PLEASE


SEE INVESTMENT OPTIONS BELOW.



This annuity is designed to assist in contributing to retirement savings of
investors whose personal circumstances allow for a long-term investment horizon.
As a function of the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC"), you may be assessed a 10%
federal tax penalty on any withdrawal made prior to your reaching age 59 1/2.
PLEASE SEE TAXES BELOW. Additionally, you will be charged a withdrawal charge on
each Purchase Payment withdrawn prior to the end of the applicable withdrawal
charge period, PLEASE SEE FEE TABLE ABOVE. Because of these potential penalties,
you should fully discuss all of the benefits and risks of this contract with
your financial representative prior to purchase.

PURCHASING A SEASONS ELITE VARIABLE ANNUITY





An initial Purchase Payment is the money you give us to buy a contract. Any
additional money you give us to invest in the contract after purchase is a
subsequent Purchase Payment.


The following chart shows the minimum initial and subsequent Purchase Payments
permitted under your contract. These amounts depend upon whether a contract is
Qualified or Non-qualified for tax purposes. FOR FURTHER EXPLANATION, SEE TAXES
BELOW.








                                      MINIMUM        MINIMUM AUTOMATIC
               MINIMUM INITIAL       SUBSEQUENT         SUBSEQUENT
               PURCHASE PAYMENT   PURCHASE PAYMENT   PURCHASE PAYMENT
               ----------------   ----------------   -----------------
Qualified          $ 4,000            $   250              $100
Non-Qualified      $10,000            $   500              $100








Once you have contributed at least the minimum initial Purchase Payment, you can
establish an automatic payment plan that allows you to make subsequent Purchase
Payments of as little as $100.

We reserve the right to refuse any Purchase Payment. Furthermore, we reserve the
right to require Company approval prior to accepting Purchase Payments greater
than $1,500,000. For contracts owned by a non-natural owner, we reserve the
right to require prior Company approval to accept Purchase Payments greater than
$250,000. Purchase Payments that would cause total Purchase Payments in all
contracts issued by the Company or its affiliate, AIG SunAmerica Life Assurance
Company, to the same owner and/or Annuitant to exceed these limits may also be
subject to Company pre-approval. For any contracts that meet or exceed these
dollar amount limitations, we further reserve the right to limit the death
benefit amount payable in excess of contract value at the time we receive all
required paperwork and satisfactory proof of death. In addition, for any
contracts that meet or exceed these dollar amount limitations, we further
reserve the right to impose certain limitations on available living benefits
under the contract. The terms creating any limit on the maximum death or living
benefit payable would be mutually agreed upon in writing by you and the Company
prior to purchasing the contract.



NON-NATURAL OWNERSHIP



A trust, corporation or other non-natural entity may only purchase this contract
if such entity has sufficiently demonstrated an Insurable Interest in the
Annuitant selected. For more information on non-natural ownership, please see
TAXES below.



MAXIMUM ISSUE AGE



We may not issue a contract to anyone age 86 or older on the contract issue
date. We may not accept subsequent Purchase Payments from contract owners age 86
or older. In general, we will not issue a Qualified contract to anyone who is
age 70 1/2 or older, unless it is shown that the minimum distribution required
by the IRS is being made. If we learn of a misstatement of age, we reserve the
right to fully pursue our remedies including termination of the contract and/or
revocation of any age-driven benefits.



TERMINATION FOR FRAUD



The Company reserves the right to terminate the contract at any time if it
discovers a misstatement or fraudulent representation of any information
provided in connection with the issuance of the contract.



JOINT OWNERSHIP AND ASSIGNMENT OF THE CONTRACT



We allow this contract to be jointly owned. We require that the joint owners be
spouses. The age of the older owner is used to determine the availability of
most age driven benefits. The addition of a joint owner after the contract has
been issued is contingent upon prior review and approval by the Company.


You may assign this contract before beginning the Income Phase by sending a
written request to us at the Annuity Service Center for an assignment. Your
rights and those of any other person with rights under this contract will be
subject to the assignment. We reserve the right not to recognize assignments if
it changes the risk profile of the owner of the contract, as determined in our
sole discretion. Please see the Statement of Additional Information for


12





details on the tax consequences of an assignment. You should consult a qualified
tax advisor before assigning the contract.



ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE PAYMENTS



In order to issue your contract, we must receive your initial Purchase Payment
and all required paperwork in Good Order, including Purchase Payment allocation
instructions at our Annuity Service Center. We will accept initial and
subsequent Purchase Payments by electronic transmission from certain
broker-dealer firms. In connection with arrangements we have to transact
business electronically, we may have agreements in place whereby your broker-
dealer may be deemed our agent for receipt of your Purchase Payments. Thus, if
we have an agreement with a broker-dealer deeming them our agent, Purchase
Payments received by the broker-dealer will be priced as of the time they are
received by the broker-dealer. However, if we do not have an agreement with a
broker-dealer deeming them our agent, Purchase Payments received by the
broker-dealer will not be priced until they are received by us.


An initial Purchase Payment will be priced within two business days after it is
received by us in Good Order if the Purchase Payment is received before Market
Close. If the initial Purchase Payment is received in Good Order after Market
Close, the initial Purchase Payment will be priced within two business days
after the next business day. We allocate your initial Purchase Payments as of
the date such Purchase Payments are priced. If we do not have complete
information necessary to issue your contract, we will contact you. If we do not
have the information necessary to issue your contract within 5 business days, we
will send your money back to you, or ask your permission to keep your money
until we get the information necessary to issue the contract.


Any subsequent Purchase Payment will be priced as of the day it is received by
us in Good Order if the request is received before Market Close. If the
subsequent Purchase Payment is received in Good Order after Market Close, it
will be priced as of the next business day. We invest your subsequent Purchase
Payments in the Variable Portfolios and Fixed Accounts according to any
allocation instructions that accompany the subsequent Purchase Payment. If we
receive a Purchase Payment without allocation instructions, we will invest the
money according to your allocation instructions on file.


Purchase Payments submitted by check can only be accepted by the Company at the
following Payment Centers with the following address:


First SunAmerica Life Insurance Company

P.O. Box 100357

Pasadena, CA 91189-0357


Purchase payments sent to the Annuity Service Center will be forwarded and
priced when received at the Payment Center.


Overnight deliveries of Purchase Payments can only be accepted at the following
address:


JP Morgan Chase National Processing Center
Lock Box 100357

Building #6, Suite 120

2710 Media Center Drive

Los Angeles, CA 90065-0357


Delivery of Purchase Payments to any other address will result in a delay in
crediting your contract until the Purchase Payment is received at the Payment
Center.



ACCUMULATION UNITS



When you allocate a Purchase Payment to the Variable Portfolios, we credit your
contract with Accumulation Units of the Separate Account. We base the number of
Accumulation Units you receive on the unit value of the Variable Portfolio as of
the day we receive your money if we receive it before that day's Market Close,
or on the next business day's unit value if we receive your money after that
day's Market Close. The value of an Accumulation Unit goes up and down based on
the performance of the Variable Portfolios.


13





We calculate the value of an Accumulation Unit each day that the NYSE is open as
follows:


1. We determine the total value of money invested in a particular Variable
Portfolio;


2. We subtract from that amount all applicable daily asset based charges;
and


3. We divide this amount by the number of outstanding Accumulation Units.


We determine the number of Accumulation Units credited to your contract by
dividing the Purchase Payment by the Accumulation Unit value for the specific
Variable Portfolio.



EXAMPLE:



We receive a $25,000 Purchase Payment from you on Wednesday. You allocate
the money to Variable Portfolio A. We determine that the value of an
Accumulation Unit for Variable Portfolio A is $11.10 at Market Close on
Wednesday. We then divide $25,000 by $11.10 and credit your contract on
Wednesday night with 2,252.2523 Accumulation Units for Variable Portfolio

A.


Performance of the Variable Portfolios and the insurance charges under your
contract affect Accumulation Unit values. These factors cause the value of your
contract to go up and down.



RIGHT TO EXAMINE



You may cancel your contract within ten days after receiving it ("free look").
To cancel, you must mail the contract along with your free look request to our
Annuity Service Center at P.O. Box 54299, Los Angeles, California 90054-0299.


If you decide to cancel your contract during the free look period, generally we
will refund the greater of: (1) the contract value on the day we receive your
request or (2) your Purchase Payment.


All contracts issued as an IRA require the full return of Purchase Payments upon
a free look. With respect to those contracts, we reserve the right to invest
your money in the Cash Management Variable Portfolio during the free look period
and will allocate your money according to your instructions at the end of the
applicable free look period. Currently, we do not put your money in the Cash
Management Variable Portfolio during the free look period unless you allocate
your money to it. If your contract was issued as an IRA and you cancel your
contract during the free look period, we return the greater of (1) your Purchase
Payments; or (2) the value of your contract.



EXCHANGE OFFERS



From time to time, we allow you to exchange an older variable annuity issued by
the Company or one of its affiliates, for a newer product with different
features and benefits issued by the Company or one of its affiliates. Such an
exchange offer will be made in accordance with applicable federal securities
laws and state insurance rules and regulations. We will provide the specific
terms and conditions of any such exchange offer at the time the offer is made.



IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR MILITARY SERVICEMEMBERS



If you are an active duty full-time servicemember, and are considering the
purchase of this contract, please read the following important information
before investing. Subsidized life insurance is available to members of the Armed
Forces from the Federal Government under the Servicemembers' Group Life
Insurance program (also referred to as "SGLI"). More details may be obtained
on-line at the following website: www.insurance.va.gov. This contract is not
offered or provided by the Federal Government and the Federal Government has in
no way sanctioned, recommended, or encouraged the sale of this contract. No
entity has received any referral fee or incentive compensation in connection
with the offer or sale of this contract, unless that entity has a selling
agreement with the Company.


14






INVESTMENT OPTIONS





The contract offers Variable Portfolios and, if available, Fixed Accounts. We
designed the contract to meet your varying investment needs over time. You can
achieve this by using the Variable Portfolios alone or in concert with the Fixed
Accounts. The Variable Portfolios are only available through the purchase of
certain variable annuities. A mixture of your investment in the Variable
Portfolios and Fixed Accounts may lower the risk associated with investing only
in a Variable Portfolio.

The Variable Portfolios offered through this contract are selected by us and we
may consider various factors in the selection process, including but not limited
to: asset class coverage, the strength of the investment advisers and/or
subadviser's reputation and tenure, brand recognition, performance and the
capability and qualification of each investment firm. Another factor we may
consider is whether the Underlying Fund or its service providers (i.e., the
investment advisers and/or subadviser(s)) or their affiliates will make payments
to us or our affiliates in connection with certain administrative, marketing and
support services, or whether the Underlying Fund's service providers have
affiliates that can provide marketing and distribution support for sales of the
contract. PLEASE SEE PAYMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH DISTRIBUTION OF THE CONTRACT
BELOW.


We review the Variable Portfolios periodically and may make changes if we
determine that a Variable Portfolio no longer satisfies one or more of the
selection criteria and/or if the Variable Portfolio has not attracted
significant allocations from contract owners. We offer Underlying Funds of the
Seasons Series Trust and SunAmerica Series Trust at least in part because they
are managed by AIG SunAmerica Asset Management Corp., our affiliate.


You are responsible for allocating Purchase Payments to the Variable Portfolios
as is appropriate for your own individual circumstances, investment goals,
financial situation and risk tolerance. You should periodically review your
allocations and values to ensure they continue to suit your needs. You bear the
risk of any decline in contract value resulting from the performance of the
Variable Portfolios you have selected. In making your investment selections, you
should investigate all information available to you including the Underlying
Fund's prospectus, statement of additional information and annual and
semi-annual reports.


We do not provide investment advice, nor do we recommend or endorse any
particular Variable Portfolio. The Variable Portfolios along with their
respective advisers are listed below.



VARIABLE PORTFOLIOS



The Variable Portfolios invest in the Underlying Funds of the Trusts. Additional
Variable Portfolios may be available in the future.


The Trusts serve as the underlying investment vehicles for other variable
annuity contracts issued by the Company and other affiliated and non-affiliated
insurance companies. Neither the Company nor the Trusts believe that offering
shares of the Trusts in this manner disadvantages you. The Trusts are monitored
for potential conflicts. The Trusts may have other Underlying Funds, in addition
to those listed here, that are not available for investment under this contract.



FIDELITY VARIABLE INSURANCE PRODUCTS TRUST -- SERVICE CLASS 2



The following Variable Portfolios are part of the Fidelity Variable Insurance
Products Trust: Fidelity VIP Equity Income, Fidelity VIP Contrafund(R), Fidelity
VIP Mid Cap, Fidelity VIP Overseas and Fidelity VIP Investment Grade Bond.
Fidelity Management and Research Company is the investment advisor for these
funds.



SEASONS SERIES TRUST -- CLASS 3 SHARES



The Select Portfolios, Focused Portfolios, Seasons Managed Allocation Portfolios
and Seasons Strategies listed below are part of Seasons Series Trust. AIG
SunAmerica Asset Management Corp. ("AIG SAAMCo"), an affiliate of the Company,
manages this Trust and engages subadvisers to provide investment advice for
certain of the Underlying Funds.


Special note should be taken of the similarities and differences between the
Seasons Managed Allocation Portfolios and the Seasons Strategies, described in
detail below. Each alternative reflects an allocation model. The Seasons Managed
Allocation Portfolios differ from the Seasons Strategies in the following
respects. The Seasons Managed


15





Allocation Portfolios are Fund-of-Funds; a professional manager actively manages
the Seasons Managed Allocation Portfolios' investments in the Select and Focused
Portfolios. The Seasons Strategies are not Fund-of-Funds and are limited to
investment in the specified funds of the Seasons Series Trust with a
pre-determined target asset allocation mix that does not change over the life of
the contract. Thus, the Seasons Managed Allocation Portfolios are responsive to
changing market conditions, and current judgments of professional management,
while the Seasons Strategies assume that the pre-determined asset allocation mix
will continue to be consistent with its risk objective. Please read the
descriptions of each alternative carefully for more details.



SUNAMERICA SERIES TRUST -- CLASS 3 SHARES



The following Variable Portfolios are part of SunAmerica Series Trust: American
Funds Global Growth SAST, American Funds Growth SAST and American Funds
Growth-Income SAST. These Underlying Funds have a Master-Feeder structure.
Capital Research and Management Company is the investment adviser of the Master
Funds in which the Feeder Funds invest. AIG SAAMCo manages the Feeder Funds.


Unlike other Underlying Funds, the Feeder Funds do not buy individual securities
directly. Rather, each Feeder Fund invests all of its investment assets in a
corresponding Master Fund of American Funds Insurance Series ("AFIS"), which
invests directly in individual securities. Because each Feeder Funds invests all
its assets in a Master Fund, the Feeder Funds do not pay investment management
fees to their investment adviser, AIG SAAMCo.


Under the Master-Feeder structure, you pay the fees and expenses of both the
Feeder Fund and the Master Fund, which include a 12b-1 fee of 0.25% of the
average daily net asset value allocated to the Feeder Funds. As a result, you
will pay higher fees and expenses under a Master-Feeder structure than if you
invested in an Underlying Fund that invests directly in the same individual
securities as the Master Fund. You should know that we offer other variable
annuity contracts which include Variable Portfolios that invest directly in the
Master Funds without investing through a Feeder Fund and they currently assess
lower fees and expenses than the Master-Feeder Funds.


Each Feeder Fund may withdraw all its assets from a Master Fund if the Board of
Directors ("Board") of the Feeder Fund determines that it is in the best
interest of the Feeder Fund and its shareholders to do so. If a Feeder Fund
withdraws its assets from a Master Fund and the Board of the Feeder Fund
approved AIG SAAMCo as investment adviser to the Feeder Fund, AIG SAAMCo would
be fully compensated for its portfolio management services. PLEASE SEE THE
SUNAMERICA SERIES TRUST PROSPECTUS AND THE STATEMENT OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
FOR THIS PRODUCT FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE MASTER-FEEDER STRUCTURE.



T. ROWE PRICE EQUITY SERIES, INC. -- CLASS 2



The following Variable Portfolios are part of the T. Rowe Price Equity Series,
Inc. Trust: T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth II and T. Rowe Price Equity Income

PREMIER PORTFOLIOS



The Premier Portfolios reflect the investment expertise of a single investment
manager and offer a broad range of investment categories.


17






SELECT PORTFOLIOS



The Select Portfolios each have a distinct investment objective, utilizing a
disciplined investing style to achieve its objective. Each Select Portfolio
invests in an Underlying Fund of the Seasons Series Trust. Except for the Cash
Management Variable Portfolio, each Select Portfolio is multi-managed by a team
of three subadvisers. One component of each Select Portfolio invests in a
passively managed component that tracks a particular target index or subset of
an index. The other two components are actively managed with the exception of
the Diversified Fixed Income and Strategic Fixed Income Portfolios which do not
have a passively managed component but three components which are all actively
managed. The passively managed component of each Select Portfolio is intended to
balance some of the risks associated with an actively traded portfolio. Please
see the Seasons Series Trust prospectus for additional information regarding the
management of the Select Portfolios.



FOCUSED PORTFOLIOS



Each multi-managed Focused Portfolio offers you at least three different
managers. Each manager advises a separate portion of the Focused Portfolio. Each
manager actively selects a limited number of stocks that represent their best
stock selections. This approach to investing results in a more concentrated
portfolio, which will be less diversified than other Variable Portfolios, and
may be subject to greater market risks.



SEASONS MANAGED ALLOCATION PORTFOLIOS



Each Seasons Managed Allocation Portfolio has a different investment goal and is
structured as a Fund-of-Funds, investing its assets in a combination of the
Select Portfolios and the Focused Portfolios. A Fund-of-Funds generally offers
investors an efficient means of diversification among a number of mutual funds
while obtaining professional management in determining which funds to select,
how much of their assets to commit to each fund, and when to make that
selection.


Each Seasons Managed Allocation Portfolio is managed by Ibbotson Associates
Advisors, LLC ("Ibbotson"). Ibbotson creates a target allocation annually for
each Seasons Managed Allocation Portfolio. The target allocation will reflect
the percentage in which a Seasons Managed Allocation Portfolio should invest in
the Select and Focused Portfolios. Due to market movements, portfolio management
decisions or cash flow consideration, Ibbotson may determine that a Seasons
Managed Allocation Portfolio's investments in the Select and Focused Portfolios
require adjustments in order to meet its target allocation. Generally, Ibbotson
will manage the investments among the Select and Focused Portfolios for each
Seasons Managed Allocation Portfolio to match its target allocation and to
rebalance assets back to the target allocation, as it deems necessary.


This approach allows the Seasons Managed Allocation Portfolios to offer
professional asset management on two levels: 1) the fund management of each
underlying Select and Focused Portfolio; and 2) the overlay portfolio management
provided by Ibbotson.

Each Seasons Managed Allocation Portfolio can invest in as many as all of the
Select and Focused Portfolios. The four Seasons Managed Allocation Portfolios'
objectives and investment strategies are:

                                                               while maintaining risk at a reasonable level.
Allocation Moderate Growth   Long-term capital appreciation    Focuses on equity investing to help maximize
                                                               growth potential, but also invests a portion of

Allocation Moderate          Long-term capital appreciation    Combines equity investing with increased
                             and moderate current income       exposure to fixed income investing. Designed for
                                                               investors who want growth, but who are also
                                                               seeking a moderate level of income.
Allocation Balanced          Long-term capital appreciation    Offers the greatest exposure to fixed income.
                             and income                        Designed for investors who need greater balance
                                                               of growth potential and current income.

If you invest in a Seasons Managed Allocation Portfolio, you pay the expenses of
the Seasons Managed Allocation Portfolio and indirectly pay a proportionate
share of the expenses of the Underlying Funds in which the Seasons Managed
Allocation Portfolio invests. As a result, you will pay higher fees and expenses
under the Fund-of-Funds structure than if you invested directly in each of the
Underlying Funds held in the Fund-of-Funds structure.



SEASONS STRATEGIES



Each Seasons Strategy has a different investment objective and is a Variable
Portfolio of the Separate Account that invests in three Underlying Funds. The
allocation of money among these Underlying Funds varies depending on the
objective of the Seasons Strategy. The Seasons Strategies are designed utilizing
an asset allocation approach to meet your investment needs over time,
considering factors such as your age, goals and risk tolerance. However, each
Seasons Strategy is designed to achieve different levels of growth over time.


The three Underlying Funds in which a Seasons Strategy can invest are detailed
in the pie chart on the following page. The Underlying Funds comprising the
Seasons Strategies may only be purchased by the Seasons Strategies.


The Seasons Strategies use an investment approach based on asset allocation.
This approach is achieved by each Seasons Strategy investing in distinct
percentages in three specific Underlying Funds. In turn, the Underlying Funds
invest in a combination of domestic and international stocks, bonds and cash.
The goal for each Seasons Strategy is to have a specified asset mix of stocks,
bonds and cash in accordance with the specified objective of the Seasons
Strategy and relative to the Underlying Funds in which the Seasons Strategy
invests. The stated target asset allocation percentages and the mix of
Underlying Funds comprising each Seasons Strategy do not change for the life of
the contract. Please see the Seasons Series Trust prospectus which describes in
detail the Underlying Funds that comprise each Seasons Strategy.



SEASONS STRATEGY REBALANCING



Each quarter a rebalancing occurs among the Underlying Funds of the Season
Strategies to realign each Seasons Strategy with its distinct percentage
investment detailed below. This rebalancing is designed to help maintain the
asset allocation mix for each Seasons Strategy. The pie charts on the following
page demonstrate the asset allocation mix for each Seasons Strategy and the
percentage allocation of each Underlying Fund in which the Seasons Strategy
invests.


Before the end of each quarter (or as close to such date as is administratively
practicable), your money will be allocated among the various Underlying Funds
according to the percentages set forth on the next page. Additionally, within
each Multi-Managed Portfolio, as identified below, your investment will be
rebalanced among the various components. Rebalancing a Seasons Strategy may
involve shifting a portion of assets out of Underlying Funds with higher returns
into Underlying Funds with relatively lower returns.

STRATEGIC ALLOCATION PROGRAM




PROGRAM DESCRIPTION



The Strategic Allocation Program may be offered to you at no additional cost to
assist in diversifying your investment across various asset classes. The
Strategic Allocation Program allows you to choose from one of the four Strategic
Allocations designed to assist in meeting your stated investment goals.


Each of the Strategic Allocations allocate 33% of your investment in a STRATEGIC
MODEL and the remaining 67% in a SEASONS MANAGED ALLOCATION PORTFOLIO to attempt
to match a stated investment time horizon and risk tolerance (the "Primary
Allocation"). Each Strategic Model is comprised of a combination of Variable
Portfolios (the "Secondary Allocation"). Each Seasons Managed Allocation
Portfolio is a Fund-of-Funds. The 33% of your investment allocated to the
Strategic Model is considered "static" because the composition of the Strategic
Model will not be changed by us and is not actively managed. However, the 67% of
your investment allocated to the Seasons Managed Allocation Portfolio is
considered "active" because each Seasons Managed Allocation Portfolio is a
Variable Portfolio that an investment adviser continuously manages in order to
maintain the investment objective of the Seasons Managed Allocation Portfolio.

FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE SEE SEASONS MANAGED ALLOCATION PORTFOLIOS ABOVE.



ENROLLING AND INVESTING IN THE STRATEGIC ALLOCATION PROGRAM



You may enroll in the Strategic Allocation Program by selecting a Strategic
Allocation on the contract application form. You and your financial
representative should determine the Strategic Allocation most appropriate for
you based on your financial needs, risk tolerance and investment time horizon.
You may request to discontinue the use of a Strategic Allocation by sending a
written request, calling our Annuity Service Center or logging onto our website.


You may also choose to invest gradually into a Strategic Allocation through the


DCA program. PLEASE SEE THE DOLLAR COST AVERAGING PROGRAM ABOVE.



You may only invest in one Strategic Allocation at a time and participation in
the Strategic Allocation Program requires that you invest 100% of your initial
Purchase Payment and subsequent Purchase Payment(s) in a Strategic Allocation.
If you attempt to split your investment in one or more Strategic Allocations,
your investment may no longer be consistent with the Strategic Allocations'
intended objectives. Additionally, if you invest in any Variable Portfolios in
addition to investing in a Strategic Allocation, such an investment may no
longer be consistent with the Strategic Allocation's intended objectives. You
can transfer 100% of your investment from one Strategic Allocation to a
different Strategic Allocation at any time.



WITHDRAWALS



You may request withdrawals, as permitted by your contract, which will be taken
proportionately from each of the Variable Portfolios in the Strategic Allocation
unless otherwise indicated in your withdrawal instructions. If you choose to
make a non-proportional withdrawal from the Variable Portfolios in the Strategic
Allocation, your investment may no longer be consistent with the Strategic
Allocation's intended objectives. Withdrawals may also be taxable and a 10% IRS
penalty may apply if you are under age 59 1/2.



REBALANCING



You can elect to have your investment in the Strategic Allocations rebalanced
quarterly, semi-annually or annually to maintain the target asset allocation
among the Variable Portfolios of the Strategic Allocation you selected. If you
make such an election to rebalance, both the Primary Allocation and the
Secondary Allocation will be rebalanced to equal the 67%/33% split discussed
above. The target allocations of the Underlying Funds of each Seasons Managed
Allocation Portfolio are not rebalanced as part of the Strategic Allocation
Program. PLEASE SEE SEASONS MANAGED ALLOCATION PORTFOLIOS ABOVE. Over time, the
Strategic Allocation may no longer align with its original investment objective
due to the effects of Variable Portfolio performance, changes in the Variable
Portfolios, and the ever-changing investment markets. Therefore, if you do not
elect to have your investment in the Strategic Allocation rebalanced at least
annually, then your investment may no longer be consistent with the Strategic
Allocation's intended objectives. In addition, your investment needs may change.


21





If you elect certain optional living benefits, you will automatically be
enrolled in the Automatic Asset Rebalancing Program and your contract will be
rebalanced in accordance with the investment requirements of the living benefit.

PLEASE SEE OPTIONAL LIVING BENEFITS BELOW.



IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE STRATEGIC ALLOCATION PROGRAM



The Strategic Allocation Program is not intended as ongoing or personalized
advice about investing in the Variable Portfolios. We do not provide investment
advice regarding whether a Strategic Allocation should be selected or rebalanced
or whether it remains appropriate for any individual to invest in accordance
with any particular Strategic Allocation as your investment needs change.


The Strategic Allocation Program does not guarantee greater or more consistent
returns. Future market and asset class performance may differ from the
historical performance upon which the Strategic Allocations may have been built.
Also, allocation to a single asset class may outperform a Strategic Allocation,
so that you could have better investment returns investing in a single asset
class than in a Strategic Allocation. However, such a strategy may involve a
greater degree of risk because of the concentration of similar securities in a
single asset class. Further, there can be no assurance that any Variable
Portfolio chosen for a particular Strategic Allocation will perform well or that
its performance will closely reflect that of the asset class it is designed to
represent.


The Strategic Allocations represent suggested allocations that are provided to
you as general guidance. You should work with your financial representative in
determining if one of the Strategic Allocations meets your financial needs,
investment time horizon, and is consistent with your risk tolerance level.
Information concerning the specific Strategic Allocations can be obtained from
your financial representative.





WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO MODIFY, SUSPEND OR TERMINATE THE STRATEGIC ALLOCATION
PROGRAM AT ANY TIME.

The Strategic Allocations and their respective investment allocations amongst
the Variable Portfolios listed above are current as of the date of this
prospectus. The investments in each Strategic Allocation are reallocated
annually on or about May 1 for new contracts. Once you invest in a Strategic
Model, the percentages of your contract value allocated to each Variable
Portfolio within the Strategic Model will not be changed by us. You should speak
with


22





your financial representative about how to keep the Variable Portfolio
allocations in each Strategic Allocation in line with your investment goals.



SUBSTITUTION, ADDITION OR DELETION OF VARIABLE PORTFOLIOS



We may, subject to any applicable law, make certain changes to the Variable
Portfolios offered in your contract. We may offer new Variable Portfolios or
stop offering existing Variable Portfolios. New Variable Portfolios may be made
available to existing contract owners and Variable Portfolios may be closed to
new or subsequent Purchase Payments, transfers or allocations. In addition, we
may also liquidate the shares of any Variable Portfolio, substitute the shares
of one Underlying Fund held by a Variable Portfolio for another and/or merge
Variable Portfolio or cooperate in a merger of Underlying Funds. To the extent
required by the Investment Company Act of 1940, we may be required to obtain SEC
approval or your approval.



FIXED ACCOUNTS



Your contract may offer Fixed Accounts for varying guarantee periods. A Fixed
Account may be available for differing lengths of time (such as 1, 3, or 5
years). Each guarantee period may have different guaranteed interest rates.


We guarantee that the interest rate credited to amounts allocated to any Fixed
Account guarantee periods will never be less than the minimum guaranteed
interest rate specified in your contract. Once the rate is established, it will
not change for the duration of the guarantee period. We determine which, if any,
guarantee periods will be offered at any time in our sole discretion, unless
state law requires us to do otherwise. Please check with your financial
representative regarding the availability of Fixed Accounts.


There are three categories of interest rates for money allocated to the Fixed
Accounts. The applicable rate is guaranteed until the corresponding guarantee
period expires. With each category of interest rate, your money may be credited
a different rate as follows:


- INITIAL RATE: The rate credited to any portion of the initial Purchase
Payment allocated to a Fixed Account.


- CURRENT RATE: The rate credited to any portion of a subsequent Purchase
Payment allocated to a Fixed Account.


- RENEWAL RATE: The rate credited to money transferred from a Fixed Account
or a Variable Portfolio into a Fixed Account and to money remaining in a
Fixed Account after expiration of a guarantee period.


When a guarantee period ends, you may leave your money in the same Fixed Account
or you may reallocate your money to another Fixed Account or to the Variable
Portfolios. If you do not want to leave your money in the same Fixed Account,
you must contact us within 30 days after the end of the guarantee period and
provide us with new allocation instructions. WE DO NOT CONTACT YOU. IF YOU DO
NOT CONTACT US, YOUR MONEY WILL REMAIN IN THE SAME FIXED ACCOUNT WHERE IT WILL
EARN INTEREST AT THE RENEWAL RATE THEN IN EFFECT FOR THAT FIXED ACCOUNT.


We reserve the right to defer payments for a withdrawal from a Fixed Account for


up to six months. PLEASE SEE ACCESS TO YOUR MONEY BELOW.



If available, you may systematically transfer interest earned in available Fixed
Accounts into any of the Variable Portfolios on certain periodic schedules
offered by us. Systematic transfers may be started, changed or terminated at any
time by contacting our Annuity Service Center. Check with your financial
representative about the current availability of this service.


At any time we are crediting the minimum guaranteed interest rate specified in
your contract, we reserve the right to restrict your ability to make transfers
and Purchase Payments into the Fixed Accounts. All Fixed Accounts may not be
available in your state. Please check with your financial representative
regarding the availability of Fixed Accounts.



DOLLAR COST AVERAGING FIXED ACCOUNTS



You may invest initial and/or subsequent Purchase Payments in the dollar cost
averaging ("DCA") Fixed Accounts, if available. The minimum Purchase Payment
that you must invest for the 6-month DCA Fixed Account is $600 and for the
12-month DCA Fixed Account is $1,200. Purchase Payments less than these


23





minimum amounts will automatically be allocated to the Variable Portfolios
according to your instructions or your current allocation instruction on file.


DCA Fixed Accounts credit a fixed rate of interest and can only be elected to
facilitate a DCA program. PLEASE SEE DOLLAR COST AVERAGING PROGRAM BELOW for
more information. Interest is credited to amounts allocated to the DCA Fixed
Accounts while your money is transferred to the Variable Portfolios over certain
specified time frames. The interest rates applicable to the DCA Fixed Accounts
may differ from those applicable to any other Fixed Account but will never be
less than the minimum guaranteed interest rate specified in your contract.
However, when using a DCA Fixed Account, the annual interest rate is paid on a
declining balance as you systematically transfer your money to the Variable
Portfolios. Therefore, the actual effective yield will be less than the stated
annual crediting rate. We reserve the right to change the availability of DCA
Fixed Accounts offered, unless state law requires us to do otherwise.



DOLLAR COST AVERAGING PROGRAM



The DCA program allows you to invest gradually in the Variable Portfolios at no
additional cost. Under the program, you systematically transfer a specified
dollar amount or percentage of contract value from a Variable Portfolio, Fixed
Account or DCA Fixed Account ("source account") to any other Variable Portfolio
("target account"). Transfers occur on a monthly periodic schedule. The minimum
transfer amount under the DCA program is $100 per transaction, regardless of the
source account. Fixed Accounts are not available as target accounts for the DCA
program. Transfers resulting from your participation in the DCA program are not
counted towards the number of free transfers per contract year.


We may also offer DCA Fixed Accounts as source accounts exclusively to
facilitate the DCA program for a specified time period. The DCA Fixed Accounts
only accept initial or subsequent Purchase Payments. You may not make a transfer
from a Variable Portfolio or Fixed Account into a DCA Fixed Account.


If you choose to allocate subsequent Purchase Payments to an active DCA program
with a Fixed Account serving as the source account, the rate applicable to that
Fixed Account at the time we receive the subsequent Purchase Payment will apply.
Further, we will begin transferring that subsequent Purchase Payment into your
target allocations on the same day of the month as the initial active DCA
program. Therefore, you may not receive a full 30 days of interest prior to the
first transfer to the target account(s).


You may terminate the DCA program at any time. If you terminate the DCA program
and money remains in the DCA Fixed Account(s), we transfer the remaining money
according to your current allocation instructions on file.


The DCA program is designed to lessen the impact of market fluctuations on your
investment. However, the DCA program can neither guarantee a profit nor protect
your investment against a loss. When you elect the DCA program, you are
continuously investing in securities fluctuating at different price levels. You
should consider your tolerance for investing through periods of fluctuating
price levels.





EXAMPLE OF DCA PROGRAM:



Assume that you want to move $750 each month from one Variable Portfolio to
another Variable Portfolio over six months. You set up a DCA program and
purchase Accumulation Units at the following values:






----------------------------------------------------------------------------
MONTH             ACCUMULATION UNIT                  UNITS PURCHASED
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   1                    $ 7.50                             100
   2                    $ 5.00                             150
   3                    $10.00                              75
   4                    $ 7.50                             100
   5                    $ 5.00                             150
   6                    $ 7.50                             100
----------------------------------------------------------------------------








You paid an average price of only $6.67 per Accumulation Unit over six
months, while the average market price actually was $7.08. By investing an
equal amount of money each month, you automatically buy more Accumulation
Units when the market price is low and fewer Accumulation Units when the
market price is high. This example is for illustrative purposes only.



WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO MODIFY, SUSPEND OR TERMINATE THE DCA PROGRAM AT ANY
TIME.



24






TRANSFERS DURING THE ACCUMULATION PHASE



Subject to our rules, restrictions and policies described below, during the
Accumulation Phase you may transfer funds between the Variable Portfolios and/or
any Fixed Accounts by telephone (800) 99NY-SUN, through the Company's website
(www.aigsunamerica.com), or in writing by mail or facsimile. All transfer
instructions submitted via facsimile must be sent to (818) 615-1543; otherwise
they will not be considered received by us. We may accept transfers by telephone
or the Internet if you complete and send the Telephone Transfer Agreement form
to our Annuity Service Center. When receiving instructions over the telephone or
the Internet, we have procedures to provide reasonable assurance that the
transactions executed are genuine. Thus, we are not responsible for any claim,
loss or expense from any error resulting from instructions received over the
telephone or the Internet. If we fail to follow our procedures, we may be liable
for any losses due to unauthorized or fraudulent instructions.


Any transfer request will be priced as of the day it is received by us in Good
Order if the request is received before Market Close. If the transfer request is
received after Market Close, the request will be priced as of the next business
day.


Funds already in your contract cannot be transferred into the DCA Fixed
Accounts.


You must transfer at least $100 per transfer. If less than $100 remains in any
Variable Portfolio after a transfer, that amount must be transferred as well.


There is no charge for your first 15 transfers. We charge for transfers in
excess of 15 in any contract year. The fee is $25 for each transfer exceeding
this limit. Transfers resulting from your participation in the DCA or Automatic
Asset Rebalancing programs are not counted towards the number of free transfers
per contract year.



SHORT-TERM TRADING POLICIES



We do not want to issue this variable annuity contract to contract owners
engaged in trading strategies that seek to benefit from short-term price
fluctuations or price inefficiencies in the Variable Portfolios of this product
("Short-Term Trading") and we discourage Short-Term Trading as more fully
described below. However, we cannot always anticipate if a potential contract
owner intends to engage in Short-Term Trading. Short-Term Trading may create
risks that may result in adverse effects on investment return of the Underlying
Fund in which a Variable Portfolio invests. Such risks may include, but are not
limited to: (1) interference with the management and planned investment
strategies of an Underlying Fund; (2) dilution of the interests in the
Underlying Fund due to practices such as "arbitrage"; and/or (3) increased
brokerage and administrative costs due to forced and unplanned fund turnover.
These circumstances may reduce the value of the Variable Portfolio. In addition
to negatively impacting the Owner, a reduction in contract value may also be
harmful to Annuitants and/or Beneficiaries.


We have adopted the following administrative procedures to discourage Short-Term
Trading which are summarized below.


The first 5 transfers in a rolling 6-month look-back period ("6-Month Rolling
Period") can be made by telephone, through the Company's website, or in writing
by mail or by facsimile. The 5th transfer in a 6-Month Rolling Period triggers
the U.S. Mail method of transfer. Therefore, once you make the 5th transfer in a
6-Month Rolling Period, all transfers must be submitted by United States Postal
Service first-class mail ("U.S. Mail") for 12 months from the date of your 5th
transfer request ("Standard U.S. Mail Policy").


For example, if you made a transfer on August 16, 2007 and within the previous
six months (from February 17, 2007 forward) you made 5 transfers including the
August 16th transfer, then all transfers made for twelve months after August 16,
2007 must be submitted by U.S. Mail (from August 17, 2007 through August 16,
2008).


U.S. Mail includes any U.S. Postal Service delivery method that offers delivery
no sooner than U.S. Postal Service first-class mail, as determined in the
Company's sole discretion. We will not accept transfer requests sent by any
medium except U.S. Mail during this 12-month period. Transfer requests required
to be submitted by U.S. Mail can only be cancelled by a written request sent by
U.S. Mail with the appropriate paperwork received prior to the execution of the
transfer.


All transfers made on the same day prior to Market Close are considered one
transfer request for purposes of applying the Short-Term Trading policy and
calculating the number of free transfers. Transfers resulting from your


25





participation in the DCA or Automatic Asset Rebalancing programs are not
included for the purposes of determining the number of transfers before applying
the Standard U.S. Mail Policy.


We apply the Standard U.S. Mail Policy uniformly and consistently to all
contract owners except for omnibus group contracts as described below.


We believe that the Standard U.S. Mail Policy is a sufficient deterrent to
Short-Term Trading. However, we may become aware of transfer patterns among the
Variable Portfolios and/or Fixed Accounts which appear to be Short-Term Trading
or otherwise detrimental to the Variable Portfolios but have not yet triggered
the limitations of the Standard U.S. Mail Policy described above. If such
transfer activity comes to our attention, we may require you to adhere to our
Standard U.S. Mail Policy prior to reaching the specified number of transfers
("Accelerated U.S. Mail Policy"). To the extent we become aware of Short-Term
Trading activities which cannot be reasonably controlled solely by the Standard
U.S. Mail Policy or the Accelerated U.S. Mail Policy, we reserve the right to
evaluate, in our sole discretion, whether to: (1) impose further limits on the
size, manner, number and/or frequency of transfers you can make; (2) impose
minimum holding periods; (3) reject any Purchase Payment or transfer request;

(4) terminate your transfer privileges; and/or (5) request that you surrender
your contract. We will notify you in writing if your transfer privileges are
terminated. In addition, we reserve the right not to accept or otherwise
restrict transfers from a third party acting for you and not to accept
preauthorized transfer forms.


Some of the factors we may consider when determining whether to accelerate the
Standard U.S. Mail Policy, reject transfers or impose other conditions on
transfer privileges include:


(1) the number of transfers made in a defined period;


(2) the dollar amount of the transfer;


(3) the total assets of the Variable Portfolio involved in the transfer
and/or transfer requests that represent a significant portion of the
total assets of the Variable Portfolio;


(4) the investment objectives and/or asset classes of the particular
Variable Portfolio involved in your transfers;


(5) whether the transfer appears to be part of a pattern of transfers to
take advantage of short-term market fluctuations or market
inefficiencies;


(6) the history of transfer activity in the contract or in other contracts
we may offer; and/or


(7) other activity, as determined by us, that creates an appearance, real
or perceived, of Short-Term Trading or the possibility of Short-Term
Trading.


Notwithstanding the administrative procedures above, there are limitations on
the effectiveness of these procedures. Our ability to detect and/or deter
Short-Term Trading is limited by operational systems and technological
limitations, as well as our ability to predict strategies employed by contract
owners (or those acting on their behalf) to avoid detection. We cannot guarantee
that we will detect and/or deter all Short- Term Trading and it is likely that
some level of Short-Term Trading will occur before it is detected and steps are
taken to deter it. To the extent that we are unable to detect and/or deter
Short-Term Trading, the Variable Portfolios may be negatively impacted as
described above. Additionally, the Variable Portfolios may be harmed by transfer
activity related to other insurance companies and/or retirement plans or other
investors that invest in shares of the Underlying Fund. Moreover, our ability to
deter Short-Term Trading may be limited by decisions by state regulatory bodies
and court orders which we cannot predict. You should be aware that the design of
our administrative procedures involves inherently subjective decisions which we
attempt to make in a fair and reasonable manner consistent with the interests of
all owners of this contract. We do not enter into agreements with contract
owners whereby we permit or intentionally disregard Short-Term Trading.


The Standard and Accelerated U.S. Mail Policies are applied uniformly and
consistently to contract owners utilizing third party trading
services/strategies performing asset allocation services for a number of
contract owners at the same time. You should be aware that such third party
trading services may engage in transfer activities that can also be detrimental
to the Variable Portfolios, including trading relatively large groups of
contracts simultaneously. These transfer activities may not be intended to take
advantage of short-term price fluctuations or price inefficiencies. However,
such activities can create the same or similar risks as Short-Term Trading and
negatively impact the Variable Portfolios as described above.


26





Omnibus group contracts may invest in the same Underlying Funds available in
your contract but on an aggregate, not individual basis. Thus, we have limited
ability to detect Short-Term Trading in omnibus group contracts and the Standard
U.S. Mail Policy does not apply to these contracts. Our inability to detect
Short-Term Trading may negatively impact the Variable Portfolios as described
above.


WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO MODIFY THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESCRIBED IN THIS

SECTION AT ANY TIME. To the extent that we exercise this reservation of rights,
we will do so uniformly and consistently unless we disclose otherwise.



UNDERLYING FUNDS' SHORT-TERM TRADING POLICIES



Please note that the Underlying Funds have their own policies and procedures
with respect to frequent purchases and redemptions of their respective shares.
We reserve the right to enforce these Underlying Fund policies and procedures,
including, but not limited to, the right to collect a redemption fee on shares
of the Underlying Fund if imposed by such Fund's Board of Trustees/Directors. As
of the date of this prospectus, none of the Underlying Funds impose a redemption
fee. We also reserve the right to reject, with or without prior notice, any
purchase, transfer or allocation into a Variable Portfolio if the corresponding
Underlying Fund will not accept such purchase, transfer or allocation for any
reason. The prospectuses for the Underlying Funds describe these procedures,
which may be different among Underlying Funds and may be more or less
restrictive than our policies and procedures.


Under rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, we also have
written agreements with the Underlying Funds that obligate us to, among other
things, provide the Underlying Funds promptly upon request certain information
about you (e.g., your social security number) and your trading activity. In
addition, we are obligated to execute instructions from the Underlying Funds to
restrict or prohibit further purchases or transfers in an Underlying Fund under
certain circumstances.


Many investments in the Underlying Funds outside of this contract are omnibus
orders from intermediaries such as other separate accounts or retirement plans.
If an Underlying Fund's policies and procedures fail to successfully detect and
discourage Short-Term trading, there may be a negative impact to the owners of
the Underlying Fund. If an Underlying Fund believes that an omnibus order we
submit may reflect one or more transfer requests from owners engaged in
Short-Term Trading, the Underlying Fund may reject the entire omnibus order and
delay or prevent us from implementing your transfer request.



TRANSFERS DURING THE INCOME PHASE



During the Income Phase, only one transfer per month is permitted between the
Variable Portfolios. No other transfers are allowed during the Income Phase.
Transfers will be effected for the last NYSE business day of the month in which
we receive your request for the transfer.



AUTOMATIC ASSET REBALANCING PROGRAM



Market fluctuations may cause the percentage of your investment in the Variable
Portfolios to differ from your original allocations. Under the Automatic Asset
Rebalancing program, your investments in the Variable Portfolios are
periodically rebalanced to return your allocations to the percentages given at
your last instruction for no additional charge. Automatic Asset Rebalancing
typically involves shifting a portion of your money out of a Variable Portfolio
with a higher return into a Variable Portfolio with a lower return. At your
request, rebalancing occurs on a quarterly, semiannual or annual basis.
Transfers resulting from your participation in this program are not counted
against the number of free transfers per contract year. If you elect certain
optional living benefits, we will automatically enroll you in the Automatic
Asset Rebalancing Program with quarterly rebalancing. PLEASE SEE MARKETLOCK
INCOME PLUS AND MARKETLOCK FOR LIFE PLUS BELOW. If you make an internet transfer
on our website and you have not elected certain optional living benefits, the
Automatic Asset Rebalancing program will be terminated.



EXAMPLE OF AUTOMATIC ASSET REBALANCING PROGRAM:



Assume that you want your initial Purchase Payment split between two
Variable Portfolios. You want 50% in a bond Variable Portfolio and 50% in a
stock Variable Portfolio. Over the next calendar quarter, the bond market
does very well while the stock market performs poorly. At the end of the
calendar quarter, the bond Variable Portfolio now represents 60% of your
holdings because it has increased in value and the growth


27





Variable Portfolio represents 40% of your holdings. If you chose quarterly
rebalancing, on the last day of that quarter, we would sell some of your
Accumulation Units in the bond Variable Portfolio to bring its holdings
back to 50% and use the money to buy more Accumulation Units in the stock
Variable Portfolio to increase those holdings to 50%.



WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO MODIFY, SUSPEND OR TERMINATE THE AUTOMATIC ASSET
REBALANCING PROGRAM AT ANY TIME.




RETURN PLUS PROGRAM



The Return Plus program, available only if we are offering multi-year Fixed
Accounts, allows you to invest in one or more Variable Portfolios without
directly putting your Purchase Payment at risk. The program, available for no
additional charge, accomplishes this by allocating your investment strategically
between the Fixed Accounts and Variable Portfolios. You decide how much you want
to invest and approximately when you want a return of Purchase Payments. We
calculate how much of your Purchase Payment to allocate to the particular Fixed
Account to ensure that it grows to an amount equal to your total Purchase
Payment invested under this program. We invest the rest of your Purchase Payment
in the Variable Portfolio(s) according to your allocation instructions.



EXAMPLE OF RETURN PLUS PROGRAM:



Assume that you want to allocate a portion of your initial Purchase Payment
of $100,000 to a multi-year Fixed Account. You want the amount allocated to
the multi-year Fixed Account to grow to $100,000 in 3 years. If the 3-year
Fixed Account is offering a 4% interest rate, Return Plus will allocate
$88,900 to the 3-year Fixed Account to ensure that this amount will grow to
$100,000 at the end of the 3-year period. The remaining $11,100 may be
allocated among the Variable Portfolios according to your allocation
instructions.



WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO MODIFY, SUSPEND OR TERMINATE THE RETURN PLUS PROGRAM AT
ANY TIME.




VOTING RIGHTS



The Company is the legal owner of the Trusts' shares. However, when an
Underlying Fund solicits proxies in conjunction with a shareholder vote, we must
obtain your instructions on how to vote those shares. We vote all of the shares
we own in proportion to your instructions. This includes any shares we own on
our own behalf. Should we determine that we are no longer required to comply
with these rules, we will vote the shares in our own right.



ACCESS TO YOUR MONEY





You can access money in your contract by making a partial or total withdrawal,
and/or by receiving annuity income payments during the Income Phase. PLEASE SEE
ANNUITY INCOME OPTIONS BELOW. Any request for withdrawal will be priced as of
the day it is received by us in Good Order, if the request is received before
Market Close. If the request for withdrawal is received after Market Close, the
request will be priced as of the next business day.


Generally, we deduct a withdrawal charge applicable to any partial or total
withdrawal made before the end of the withdrawal charge period. If you surrender
your contract, we also deduct a contract maintenance fee, if applicable. PLEASE
SEE EXPENSES BELOW.


If you have elected an optional living benefit, you should consider the impact
of your withdrawals on the benefit. PLEASE SEE OPTIONAL LIVING BENEFITS BELOW.



FREE WITHDRAWAL PROVISION



Your contract provides for a free withdrawal amount each year. A free withdrawal
amount, as defined below, is the portion of your contract that we allow you to
take out each year without being charged a withdrawal charge. The free
withdrawal amount does not reduce the basis used to calculate future annual free
withdrawals or the withdrawal charges applicable upon a full surrender of your
contract. As a result, if you surrender your contract in the future, and
withdrawal charges are still applicable, you will not receive the benefit of any
previous free withdrawals upon a full surrender.


28





Withdrawals of Purchase Payments made prior to the end of the withdrawal charge
schedule that are in excess of your free withdrawal amount, will result in a
withdrawal charge. The amount of the withdrawal charge and how it applies are
discussed more fully in the EXPENSES section below. Before purchasing this
contract, you should consider the effect of withdrawal charges on your
investment if you need to withdraw more money than the free withdrawal amount.
You should fully discuss this decision with your financial representative.


To determine your free withdrawal amount and your withdrawal charge, we refer to
two special terms: "penalty free earnings" and "total invested amount."


Penalty-free earnings are equal to your contract value less your total invested
amount and may be withdrawn free of a withdrawal charge at any time, including
upon a full surrender of your contract. Purchase Payments that are no longer
subject to a withdrawal and not previously withdrawn may also be withdrawn free
of a withdrawal charge at any time. The total invested amount is the sum of all
Purchase Payments less portions of prior withdrawals that reduce your total
invested amount as follows:


- Free withdrawals in any year that were in excess of your penalty-free
earnings and were based on the portion of the total invested amount that
was no longer subject to withdrawal charges at the time of the
withdrawal; and


- Any prior withdrawals (including withdrawal charges applicable to those
withdrawals) of the total invested amount on which you already paid a
withdrawal charge.


When you make a withdrawal, we deduct it from penalty-free earnings first, any
remaining penalty-free withdrawal amount, and then from the total invested
amount on a first-in, first-out basis. This means that you can also access your
Purchase Payments, which are no longer subject to a withdrawal charge, before
those Purchase Payments that are still subject to the withdrawal charge.


During the first year after we issue your contract, your free withdrawal amount
is the greater of:


(1) your penalty-free earnings; or


(2) if you are participating in the Systematic Withdrawal program, a total
of 10% of your total invested amount.


After the first contract year, your annual free withdrawal amount is the greater
of:


(1) your penalty-free earnings and any portion of your total invested
amount no longer subject to a withdrawal charge; or


(2) 10% of the portion of your total invested amount that has been in your
contract for at least one year.


Although amounts withdrawn free of a withdrawal charge under the 10% provision
may reduce Purchase Payments for purposes of calculating amounts available for
future withdrawals of earnings, they do not reduce the amount you invested for
purposes of calculating the withdrawal charge if you surrender your contract. As
a result if you surrender your contract in the future, and withdrawal charges
are still applicable, any previous free withdrawals would then be subject to
applicable withdrawal charges. We calculate charges upon surrender of the
contract on the day after we receive your request and your contract. We return
to you your contract value less any applicable fees and charges.


When you make a withdrawal, we return the portion of contract value withdrawn
less any applicable fees and charges.


The withdrawal charge percentage is determined by the number of years the
Purchase Payment has been in the contract at the time of the withdrawal. PLEASE
SEE EXPENSES BELOW. For the purpose of calculating the withdrawal charge, any
prior free withdrawal is not subtracted from the total Purchase Payments still
subject to withdrawal charges.


For example, you make an initial Purchase Payment of $100,000. For purposes of
this example we will assume a 0% growth rate over the life of the contract and
no subsequent Purchase Payments. In contract year 2, you take


29





out your maximum free withdrawal of $10,000. After that free withdrawal your
contract value is $90,000. In the 4th contract year, you request a total
withdrawal of your contract. We will apply the following calculation:


A-(B X C) = D, where:


A=Your contract value at the time of your request for withdrawal ($90,000)


B=The amount of your Purchase Payments still subject to withdrawal charge



($100,000)


C=The withdrawal charge percentage applicable to the age of each Purchase
Payment (assuming 5% is the applicable percentage) [B X C = $5,000]


D=Your contract value ($85,000) available for total withdrawal


Under most circumstances, the partial withdrawal minimum is $1,000. We require
that the value left in any Variable Portfolio or Fixed Accounts be at least
$100, after the withdrawal and your total contract value must be at least
$2,500. The request for withdrawal must be in writing. For withdrawals of
$500,000 and more, you must submit a signature guarantee at the time of your
request. Unless you provide us with different instructions, partial withdrawals
will be made proportionately from each Variable Portfolio and the Fixed Account
in which you are invested. In the event that a proportionate partial withdrawal
would cause the value of any Variable Portfolio or Fixed Account investment to
be less than $100, we will contact you to obtain alternate instructions on how
to structure the withdrawal.


Withdrawals made prior to age 59 1/2 may result in a 10% IRS penalty tax. PLEASE
SEE TAXES BELOW. Under certain Qualified plans, access to the money in your
contract may be restricted.


We may be required to suspend or postpone the payment of a withdrawal for any
period of time when: (1) the NYSE is closed (other than a customary weekend and
holiday closings); (2) trading with the NYSE is restricted; (3) an emergency
exists such that disposal of or determination of the value of shares of the
Variable Portfolios is not reasonably practicable; (4) the SEC, by order, so
permits for the protection of contract owners.


Additionally, we reserve the right to defer payments for a withdrawal from a
Fixed Account for up to six months.



SYSTEMATIC WITHDRAWAL PROGRAM



During the Accumulation Phase, you may elect to receive periodic withdrawals
under the Systematic Withdrawal program for no additional charge. Under the
program, you may choose to take monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual
payments from your contract. Electronic transfer of these withdrawals to your
bank account is also available. The minimum amount of each withdrawal is $100.
There must be at least $2,500 remaining in your contract at all times.
Withdrawals may be taxable and a 10% federal penalty tax may apply if you are
under age 59 1/2. A withdrawal charge may apply if the amount of the periodic
withdrawals in any year exceeds the free withdrawal amount permitted each year.





PLEASE SEE ACCESS TO YOUR MONEY ABOVE AND SEE EXPENSES BELOW.


The program is not available to everyone. Please contact our Annuity Service
Center which can provide the necessary enrollment forms.



WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO MODIFY, SUSPEND OR TERMINATE THE SYSTEMATIC WITHDRAWAL
PROGRAM AT ANY TIME.




NURSING HOME WAIVER



If you are confined to a nursing home for 60 days or longer, we may waive the
withdrawal charge on certain withdrawals prior to the Annuity Date. The waiver
applies only to withdrawals made while you are in a nursing home or within 90
days after you leave the nursing home. You cannot use this waiver during the
first 90 days after your contract is issued. In addition, the confinement period
for which you seek the waiver must begin after you purchase your contract. We
will only waive the withdrawal charges on withdrawals or surrenders of contract
value paid directly to the contract owner, and not to a third party or other
financial services company.


In order to use this waiver, you must submit with your withdrawal request to the
Annuity Service Center, the following documents: (1) a doctor's note
recommending admittance to a nursing home; (2) an admittance form which shows
the type of facility you entered; and (3) a bill from the nursing home which
shows that you met the 60-day confinement requirement.


30






MINIMUM CONTRACT VALUE



Where permitted by state law, we may terminate your contract if your contract
value is less than $2,500 as a result of withdrawals and/or fees and charges. We
will provide you with sixty days written notice that your contract is being
terminated. At the end of the notice period, we will distribute the contract's
remaining value to you.



QUALIFIED CONTRACT OWNERS



Certain Qualified plans restrict and/or prohibit your ability to withdraw money
from your contract. SEE TAXES BELOW for a more detailed explanation.



OPTIONAL LIVING BENEFITS





YOU MAY ELECT ONE OF THE OPTIONAL LIVING BENEFITS DESCRIBED BELOW FOR AN
ADDITIONAL FEE. THESE FEATURES ARE DESIGNED TO PROTECT A PORTION OF YOUR
INVESTMENT IN THE EVENT YOUR CONTRACT VALUE DECLINES DUE TO UNFAVORABLE





INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE DURING THE ACCUMULATION PHASE AND BEFORE A DEATH BENEFIT
IS PAYABLE. IN ADDITION, THESE FEATURES CAN PROVIDE A GUARANTEED INCOME STREAM
AND OTHER BENEFITS. PLEASE SEE THE DESCRIPTIONS BELOW FOR DETAILED INFORMATION.



MARKETLOCK INCOME PLUS




WHAT IS MARKETLOCK INCOME PLUS?



MarketLock Income Plus is an optional guaranteed minimum withdrawal feature,
available for an additional fee. The feature is designed to help you create a
guaranteed income stream that will last as long as you live, or as long as you
and your spouse live, even if the entire value of your contract has been reduced
to zero, provided withdrawals taken are within the parameters of the feature.
MarketLock Income Plus may offer protection in the event your contract value
declines due to unfavorable investment performance, certain withdrawal activity,
if you live longer than expected or any combination of these factors. You may
not need to rely on MarketLock Income Plus as its value is dependent on your
contract's performance, your withdrawal activity and your longevity.


This feature may not be appropriate if you plan to make ongoing Purchase
Payments, such as with contributory IRA's or other tax-qualified plans. The
feature guarantees that only certain Purchase Payments received during the
contract's first five years are included in the Income Base.


Please remember that all withdrawals, including withdrawals taken under this
feature, reduce your contract value and your death benefit and may reduce other
benefits under the contract. In addition, withdrawals under this feature will
reduce the free withdrawal amount and may be subject to applicable withdrawal
charges if withdrawals taken are in excess of the Maximum Annual Withdrawal
Amount, as defined below. The sum of withdrawals in any contract year up to the
Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount will not be assessed a withdrawal charge.

PLEASE SEE ACCESS TO YOUR MONEY ABOVE.


In addition, any withdrawals taken may be subject to a 10% IRS tax penalty if
you are under age 59 1/2 at the time of the withdrawal. For information about
how the feature is treated for income tax purposes, you should consult a
qualified tax advisor concerning your particular circumstances. If you must take
required minimum distributions and want to ensure that these withdrawals are not
considered Excess Withdrawals, as defined below, your distributions must be set
up on the automated monthly minimum distribution withdrawal program administered
by our Annuity Service Center. In addition, if you have a Qualified contract,
tax law and the terms of the plan may restrict withdrawal amounts.


WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO MODIFY, SUSPEND OR TERMINATE MARKETLOCK INCOME PLUS AT
ANY TIME FOR PROSPECTIVELY ISSUED CONTRACTS. WE ALSO RESERVE THE RIGHT TO MODIFY
MARKETLOCK INCOME PLUS AT TIME OF EXTENSION FOR EXISTING CONTRACTS.



WHEN AND HOW MAY I ELECT MARKETLOCK INCOME PLUS?



You may elect MarketLock Income Plus at the time of contract issue for immediate
effectiveness. If we allow you to elect the feature after purchasing your
contract, the feature is effective on the first contract anniversary after your
election (the "Effective Date"). If MarketLock Income Plus is not approved in
your state as of the date of


31





this prospectus, you may elect the feature after you purchase your contract
provided the state approval occurs before your first contract anniversary. We
will contact you to let you know when the feature is approved in your state.


You may elect to have the feature cover only your life or the lives of both you
and your spouse. We refer to the person or persons whose lifetime withdrawals
are guaranteed under MarketLock Income Plus as the "Covered Person(s)." If the
contract is not owned by a natural person, references to Owner(s) apply to the
Annuitant(s). To elect this feature, Covered Persons must meet the age
requirement. The age requirement varies depending on the type of contract you
purchase and the number of Covered Persons. The tables below provide the age
requirement for this feature.





IF YOU ELECT ONE COVERED PERSON:







---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                     Covered Person

             Spousal Beneficiary                    45             80            45           N/A(2)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------








(1) The age requirements for optional death benefits and other optional features
may be different than those listed here. You must meet the age requirement
for those features in order to elect them.


(2) The age requirement is based solely on the single owner for purposes of
issuing the contract with the feature. The spousal beneficiary's age is not
considered in determining the maximum issue age of the second Covered
Person.



HOW DOES MARKETLOCK INCOME PLUS WORK?



MarketLock Income Plus locks-in the greater of two values in determining the
Income Base, defined below. The Income Base determines the basis of the Covered
Person(s)' guaranteed lifetime benefit which may be taken in a series of
withdrawals. Each consecutive one-year period starting from the Effective Date
is considered a Benefit Year. A new Income Base is automatically locked-in each
year on each Benefit Year anniversary during the first 5 Benefit Years following
the Effective Date based on the greater of either (1) the highest Anniversary
Value, or (2) the Income Base increased by any available Income Credit.
MarketLock Income Plus is designed for individuals or spousal joint owners.
Thus, if a contract is owned by non-spousal joint owners and either owner dies,
the full contract value must be paid within 5 years of death, after which time
the contract terminates; the surviving owner may not receive the benefit of
MarketLock Income Plus.


You may elect to extend both the Income Base Evaluation Period and the Income
Credit Period over which the feature locks-in either the highest Anniversary
Value or Income Base plus any Income Credit for two additional five year periods
provided that you are age 85 or younger at the time of each extension ("First
Extension and


32





Second Extension"). After election of the First Extension and the Second
Extension, you may elect to extend only the Income Base Evaluation Period over
which the feature locks-in the highest Anniversary Value ("Subsequent
Extension(s)") provided that you are age 85 or younger at the time of each
Subsequent Extension. As a result, the Income Credit Period is not available for
Subsequent Extensions.


The fee and investment requirements of the feature may change at the time of
extension and may be different than when you initially elected the feature. We
guarantee that the current fee, as reflected in the Fee Table above, will not
increase by more than 0.25% at the time of First Extension. WE WILL PROVIDE YOU
WITH AN EXTENSION ELECTION FORM PRIOR TO THE END OF EACH EVALUATION PERIOD YOU
ELECT TO EXTEND. IF YOU ELECT TO EXTEND THE FEATURE, YOU MUST COMPLETE THE
ELECTION FORM AND RETURN IT TO US OR ADVISE US AS TO YOUR INTENT TO EXTEND IN A
METHOD ACCEPTABLE TO US. PLEASE SEE "CAN I EXTEND THE INCOME BASE EVALUATION
PERIOD AND INCOME CREDIT PERIOD BEYOND 5 YEARS?" BELOW.



IS THERE AN ADDITIONAL GUARANTEE IF I DO NOT TAKE WITHDRAWALS FOR 10 YEARS?



Yes, there is an additional guarantee if you do not take any withdrawals before
the 10th Benefit Year anniversary. On the 10th Benefit Year anniversary
following the Effective Date, the Income Base, and if applicable, the Income
Credit Base, will be increased to equal at least 200% of your first Benefit
Year's Eligible Purchase Payments ("Minimum Income Base"), if you elect the
feature at contract issue. If you elect the feature after contract issue, the
Minimum Income Base is equal to 200% of the contract value as of the Effective
Date. You do not need to elect extensions in order to be eligible to receive the
Minimum Income Base.



WHAT DETERMINES THE MAXIMUM ANNUAL WITHDRAWAL PERCENTAGE?



The Maximum Annual Withdrawal Percentage represents the percentage of your
Income Base used to calculate the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount that you may
withdraw each year. The Maximum Annual Withdrawal Percentage is determined by
the age of the Covered Person(s) at the time of the first withdrawal as shown in
the tables below.





One Covered Person



If the feature is elected to cover one life but the contract is jointly owned,
then the Covered Person must be the older Owner and the following is applicable:






--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AGE OF THE COVERED PERSON AT                        MAXIMUM ANNUAL
TIME OF FIRST WITHDRAWAL                            WITHDRAWAL PERCENTAGE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Prior to 62nd birthday                             4% of Income Base
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 On or after 62nd birthday                          5% of Income Base
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------











Two Covered Persons



If the feature is elected to cover two lives, the following is applicable:






--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AGE OF THE YOUNGER COVERED PERSON OR SURVIVING      MAXIMUM ANNUAL
COVERED PERSON AT TIME OF FIRST WITHDRAWAL          WITHDRAWAL PERCENTAGE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Prior to 62nd birthday                             4% of Income Base
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 On or after 62nd birthday                          5% of Income Base
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------








If you are taking required minimum distributions ("RMD") from this contract, and
the amount of the RMD (based only on this contract) is greater than the Maximum
Annual Withdrawal Amount in any given Benefit Year, no portion of the RMD will
be treated as an Excess Withdrawal (defined below). Any portion of a withdrawal
in a Benefit Year that is more than the greater of both the Maximum Annual
Withdrawal Amount and the RMD amount (based only on this contract) will be
considered an Excess Withdrawal. PLEASE SEE "WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF WITHDRAWALS
ON MARKETLOCK INCOME PLUS?" BELOW.


33






ARE THERE INVESTMENT REQUIREMENTS IF I ELECT MARKETLOCK INCOME PLUS?



Yes, as long as you have not elected to cancel the feature, we require that you
allocate 100% of your investments to one of the following:


- Cash Management Variable Portfolio


- Managed Allocation Balanced Variable Portfolio


- Managed Allocation Moderate Variable Portfolio


- Managed Allocation Moderate Growth Variable Portfolio


- Strategic Allocation Balanced


- Strategic Allocation Moderate


- Strategic Allocation Moderate Growth


- 6-month or 12-month DCA Fixed Accounts, if available


If we offer additional allocations that comply with investment requirements in
the future, we will give you the opportunity to allocate your investments
accordingly.


The Strategic Allocations are designed to assist in diversifying your investment
across various asset classes which may help minimize the risk that your contract
value will be reduced to zero before your death. Therefore, the investment
requirements may reduce the need to rely on the guarantees provided by this
benefit. You may have better investment returns investing in a single asset
class or in Variable Portfolios that are not available for investment under this
feature. You should consult with your financial representative to assist you in
determining whether the Strategic Allocation Programs are suited for your
financial needs and risk tolerance. For details regarding the investment
allocations of the Strategic Allocations, PLEASE SEE STRATEGIC ALLOCATION
PROGRAM ABOVE.


Your allocation instructions accompanying any Purchase Payment must comply with
the investment requirements, described above, in order for your application or
subsequent Purchase Payment(s) to be considered in Good Order. PLEASE SEE
ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE PAYMENTS ABOVE. We will automatically enroll you in the
Automatic Asset Rebalancing Program with quarterly rebalancing. We require
quarterly rebalancing because market performance and transfer and withdrawal
activity may result in your contract's allocations going outside these
restrictions. Quarterly rebalancing will ensure that your allocations will
continue to comply with the investment requirements for this feature. In
addition to quarterly rebalancing, we will initiate rebalancing in accordance
with your Automatic Asset Rebalancing instructions, after any of the following
transactions:


- any transfer or reallocation you initiate; or


- any withdrawal you initiate.


Automatic transfers and/or systematic withdrawals will not result in
rebalancing. We will rebalance your contract in accordance with your most
current and compliant Automatic Asset Rebalancing Program instructions on file.
If at any point, for any reason, your Automatic Asset Rebalancing Program
instructions would result in allocations inconsistent with the investment
requirements listed above, we will revert to the last compliant instructions on
file whether for rebalancing or for allocation of a Purchase Payment; we will
implement the last compliant instructions at the next rebalancing. PLEASE SEE
AUTOMATIC ASSET REBALANCING PROGRAM ABOVE. You can modify your Automatic Asset
Rebalancing Program instructions, as long as they are consistent with the
investment requirements, at any time by calling the Annuity Service Center.


We reserve the right to change the investment requirements at any time for
prospectively issued contracts. We may also revise the investment requirements
for any existing contract to the extent that Variable Portfolios are added,
deleted, substituted, merged or otherwise reorganized. We will notify you of any
changes to the investment requirements due to deletions, substitutions, mergers
or reorganizations at least 30 days in advance.


34






HOW ARE THE COMPONENTS FOR MARKETLOCK INCOME PLUS CALCULATED?



First, we determine the ELIGIBLE PURCHASE PAYMENTS, which include:


1. 100% of Purchase Payments received during the first contract year; and


2. Purchase Payments received in each of contract years 2-5, capped in each
year at an amount equal to 100% of the Purchase Payments received in
year 1. This means that if you made a $100,000 Purchase Payment in year
1, Eligible Purchase Payments will include additional Purchase Payments
of up to $100,000 contributed in each of contract years 2-5 for a grand
total maximum of $500,000 of Eligible Purchase Payments.


Any Purchase Payments made in contract years 2-5 in excess of the annual cap
amount as well as all Purchase Payments received after the 5th contract year are
considered INELIGIBLE PURCHASE PAYMENTS. The calculation of Eligible Purchase
Payments does not include any spousal continuation contributions; however,
continuation contributions are included in the calculation of Anniversary
Values, as defined below. PLEASE SEE SPOUSAL CONTINUATION BELOW. Total Eligible
Purchase Payments are limited to $1,500,000 without our prior Company approval.


Second, we consider the INCOME CREDIT PERIOD and the INCOME BASE EVALUATION
PERIOD. The Income Credit Period is the period of time over which we calculate
the Income Credit. The Income Base Evaluation Period is the period of time over
which we consider Anniversary Values and if applicable and greater, the Income
Base plus any available Income Credit. The initial Income Credit Period and the
initial Income Base Evaluation Period begin on the Effective Date and end 5
years later. You may elect to extend both the Income Base Evaluation Period and
the Income Credit Period at the end of the initial Income Base Evaluation Period
and initial Income Credit Period, and after election of the First Extension, you
may elect a Second Extension. Subsequent Extensions apply to only the Income

Base Evaluation Period. PLEASE SEE "CAN I EXTEND THE INCOME BASE EVALUATION
PERIOD AND INCOME CREDIT PERIOD BEYOND 5 YEARS?" BELOW.


Third, we determine the ANNIVERSARY VALUE which equals your contract value on
any contract anniversary during the Income Base Evaluation Period minus any
Ineligible Purchase Payments.


Fourth, we determine the INCOME BASE which initially is equal to the first
Eligible Purchase Payment. If the feature is elected after contract issue, the
initial Income Base is the contract value on the Effective Date. In each
subsequent Benefit Year, the Income Base equals the Income Base at the beginning
of the Benefit Year plus any subsequent Eligible Purchase Payments made during
that Benefit Year, less proportionate adjustments for Excess Withdrawals that
occurred during that Benefit Year. On each Benefit Year anniversary, we
determine if the Income Base should be increased based on the maximum
Anniversary Value or any available Income Credit as defined below. PLEASE SEE
"HOW CAN THE INCOME BASE AND INCOME CREDIT BASE BE INCREASED?" AND"WHAT ARE THE
EFFECTS OF WITHDRAWALS ON MARKETLOCK INCOME PLUS?" BELOW.


Fifth, we determine the INCOME CREDIT BASE which is used solely as a basis for
calculating the Income Credit during an Income Credit Period. The initial Income
Credit Base is equal to the first Eligible Purchase Payment. If the feature is
elected after contract issue, the initial Income Credit Base is the contract
value on the Effective Date. PLEASE SEE "HOW CAN THE INCOME BASE AND INCOME

CREDIT BASE BE INCREASED?" BELOW.


Sixth, we determine the INCOME CREDIT which is an amount equal to 7% ("Income
Credit Percentage") of the Income Credit Base, on each Benefit Year anniversary.
If you take withdrawals in a Benefit Year that are less than or equal to the
Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount, the Income Credit Percentage on the Benefit
Year anniversary is reduced by a percentage calculated as the sum of all
withdrawals taken during the preceding Benefit Year, divided by the Income Base,
prior to the determining the Income Base for the next Benefit Year. If you take
a withdrawal that is greater than the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount in the
preceding Benefit Year, the Income Credit is equal to zero. PLEASE SEE THE
OPTIONAL LIVING BENEFITS EXAMPLES APPENDIX BELOW.


Finally, we determine the MAXIMUM ANNUAL WITHDRAWAL AMOUNT, which represents the
maximum amount that may be withdrawn each Benefit Year following the Effective
Date without reducing the Income Base, and if applicable, the Income Credit
Base. The Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount is calculated by multiplying the
Income Base by the applicable Maximum Annual Withdrawal Percentage shown in the
tables above. PLEASE SEE "HOW DO INCREASES AND DECREASES IN THE INCOME BASE
IMPACT THE MAXIMUM ANNUAL WITHDRAWAL AMOUNT?" BELOW.


35






HOW CAN THE INCOME BASE AND INCOME CREDIT BASE BE INCREASED?



On each Benefit Year anniversary during an Income Base Evaluation Period, we
determine if the Income Base should be increased based on the maximum
Anniversary Value or any available Income Credit.


Maximum Anniversary Value equals the highest Anniversary Value on any Benefit
Year anniversary occurring during an Income Base Evaluation Period. On each
Benefit Year anniversary during an Income Base Evaluation Period, the Income
Base is automatically increased to the Anniversary Value when the Anniversary
Value is greater than (a), (b), and (c), where:


(a) is the cumulative Eligible Purchase Payments; and


(b) is the current Income Base, increased by the Income Credit, if any; and


(c) is all previous Anniversary Values during any Income Base Evaluation
Period.


On each Benefit Year anniversary during the Income Credit Period, we determine
the amount to which the Income Credit Base and/or the Income Base could
increase. The components used to determine this amount are:


(a) the Income Base calculated based on the maximum Anniversary Value; and


(b) the current Income Base plus the Income Credit.


If (a) is greater than or equal to (b), the Income Credit Base and the Income
Base are increased to the current Anniversary Value. If (b) is greater than (a),
the Income Base is increased by the Income Credit and the Income Credit Base
remains unchanged.


INCREASES TO YOUR INCOME BASE OCCUR ON BENEFIT YEAR ANNIVERSARIES AS DESCRIBED
ABOVE. YOUR INCOME BASE WILL NOT INCREASE EVEN IF YOUR CONTRACT VALUE ON DAYS
OTHER THAN THE BENEFIT YEAR ANNIVERSARY WAS GREATER THAN YOUR INCOME BASE ON THE
BENEFIT YEAR ANNIVERSARY.


The Income Base Evaluation Period and the Income Credit Period can both be
extended at the First Extension and if you elected the First Extension, at the
Second Extension. Only the Income Base Evaluation Period can be extended on
Subsequent Extensions.


In addition, the Income Base, and if applicable, the Income Credit Base, can
also be increased to at least the Minimum Income Base on the 10th Benefit Year
anniversary, PROVIDED NO WITHDRAWALS ARE TAKEN PRIOR TO THAT ANNIVERSARY. If you
are eligible for the Minimum Income Base, the Income Base on the 10th Benefit
Year anniversary is the greatest of (a), (b) and (c), where:


(a) is the current Income Base, or if the First Extension was elected, the
Income Base calculated based on the maximum Anniversary Value; and


(b) is the current Income Base plus the Income Credit, if applicable; and


(c) is the Minimum Income Base.


On your 10th Benefit Year anniversary, if you are eligible for the Minimum
Income Base and if the First Extension is elected, the Income Credit Base is the
greatest of (a), (b) and (c), where:


(a) is the Income Base calculated based on the maximum Anniversary Value;
and


(b) is the current Income Credit Base; and


(c) is the Minimum Income Base.



HOW DO INCREASES AND DECREASES IN THE INCOME BASE IMPACT THE MAXIMUM ANNUAL
WITHDRAWAL AMOUNT?




INCREASES IN THE INCOME BASE



In any Benefit Year where Eligible Purchase Payments are allocated to your
contract, any remaining withdrawals of the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount will
be based on the increased Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount reduced by
withdrawals previously taken in that Benefit Year. If the Income Base is
increased on a Benefit Year anniversary, the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount
will be recalculated on that Benefit Year anniversary by multiplying the
increased Income Base by the applicable Maximum Annual Withdrawal Percentage.


36






DECREASES IN THE INCOME BASE



Excess Withdrawals reduce Your Income Base on the date the Excess Withdrawal
occurs. Any Excess Withdrawal in a Benefit Year reduces the Income Base in the
same proportion by which the contract value is reduced by the Excess Withdrawal.

PLEASE SEE "WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF WITHDRAWALS ON MARKETLOCK INCOME PLUS?"
BELOW. As a result of a reduction of the Income Base, the new Maximum Annual
Withdrawal Amount will be equal to the reduced Income Base multiplied by the
applicable Maximum Annual Withdrawal Percentage. The last recalculated Maximum
Annual Withdrawal Amount in a given Benefit Year is available for withdrawal at
the beginning of the next Benefit Year and may be lower than your previously
calculated Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount. When the contract value is less
than the Income Base, Excess Withdrawals will reduce the Income Base by an
amount which is greater than the amount of the Excess Withdrawal. In addition,
no Income Credit will be added to the Income Base in that Benefit Year.



WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF WITHDRAWALS ON MARKETLOCK INCOME PLUS?



The Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount, the Income Base and Income Credit Base may
change over time as a result of the timing and amount of withdrawals. IF YOU
TAKE A WITHDRAWAL BEFORE THE 10TH BENEFIT YEAR ANNIVERSARY, YOUR INCOME BASE,
AND IF APPLICABLE, THE INCOME CREDIT BASE, ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO BE INCREASED TO
THE MINIMUM INCOME BASE.


You may take withdrawals during a contract year that in total are less than or
equal to the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount which will not reduce the Income
Base or Income Credit Base. However, if you choose to take less than the Maximum
Annual Withdrawal Amount in any contract year, you may not carry over the unused
amount into subsequent years. Your Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount will not be
recalculated solely as a result of taking less than the entire Maximum Annual
Withdrawal Amount in any given year.


Withdrawals in excess of the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount are considered
EXCESS WITHDRAWALS. We define Excess Withdrawals as any portion of a withdrawal
that causes the total withdrawals in a Benefit Year to exceed the Maximum Annual
Withdrawal Amount, including but not limited to any withdrawal in a contract
year taken after the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount has been withdrawn. You
should not elect this feature if you plan to take Excess Withdrawals since those
withdrawals may significantly reduce or eliminate the value of the feature.


The impact of withdrawals and the effect on certain components of MarketLock
Income Plus are further explained below:


INCOME BASE AND INCOME CREDIT BASE: If the sum of withdrawals in any
Benefit Year exceeds the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount, the Income Base
and Income Credit Base will be reduced for those withdrawals. For each
Excess Withdrawal taken, the Income Base and Income Credit Base are reduced
in the same proportion by which the contract value is reduced by each
Excess Withdrawal.


MAXIMUM ANNUAL WITHDRAWAL AMOUNT: The Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount is
recalculated each time there is a change in the Income Base. Accordingly,
if the sum of withdrawals in any contract year does not exceed the Maximum
Annual Withdrawal Amount for that year, the Maximum Annual Withdrawal
Amount will not change for the next year unless your Income Base is
increased (as described above under "HOW ARE THE COMPONENTS FOR MARKETLOCK
INCOME PLUS CALCULATED?"). If you take an Excess Withdrawal, the Maximum
Annual Withdrawal Amount will be recalculated by multiplying the reduced
Income Base by the existing Maximum Annual Withdrawal Percentage. This
recalculated Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount is available for withdrawal
at the beginning of the next Benefit Year and may be lower than your
previous Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount.


Please remember that all withdrawals, including withdrawals taken under this
feature, reduce your contract value and your death benefit and may reduce other
benefits under the contract. In addition, withdrawals under this feature will
reduce the free withdrawal amount and may be subject to applicable withdrawal
charges if in excess of the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount. PLEASE SEE ACCESS
TO YOUR MONEY ABOVE AND EXPENSES BELOW.

OF WITHDRAWALS.

WHAT IS THE FEE FOR MARKETLOCK INCOME PLUS?



The fee for MarketLock Income Plus depends on whether you elect to cover one
life or two lives, as follows:






----------------------------------------------------
NUMBER OF COVERED PERSONS       ANNUALIZED FEE
----------------------------------------------------
 For One Covered Person      0.95% of Income Base
----------------------------------------------------
 For Two Covered Persons     1.20% of Income Base
----------------------------------------------------








The fee will be calculated and deducted quarterly from the portion of your
contract value allocated to the Variable Portfolios, starting on the first
quarter following the Effective Date and ending upon termination of the feature.
Once you elect this feature, you will be assessed a non-refundable fee
regardless of whether or not you take any withdrawals and/or receive any
lifetime annuity income payments under this feature.


An increase in the Income Base due to an adjustment to a higher Anniversary
Value, addition of an Income Credit, or subsequent Eligible Purchase Payments
will result in an increase to the dollar amount of the fee.


If your contract value falls to zero before the feature has been terminated, the
fee will no longer be deducted. We will not assess the quarterly fee if you
annuitize your contract or if a death benefit is paid before the end of a
contract quarter. If the feature is still in effect and you surrender your
contract, we will assess a pro-rata charge for the fee if you surrender your
contract before the end of a contract quarter. The pro-rata charge is calculated
by multiplying the full quarterly fee by the number of days between the date the
fee was last assessed and the date of surrender divided by the number of days in
that contract quarter.


The fee and investment requirements of the feature may change at the time of
extension and may be different than when you initially elected the feature. We
guarantee that the current fee, as reflected in the fee table, will not increase
by more than 0.25% at time of First Extension.



CAN I EXTEND THE INCOME BASE EVALUATION PERIOD AND INCOME CREDIT PERIOD BEYOND 5
YEARS?



Yes, after the initial Income Base Evaluation Period and initial Income Credit
Period you may elect to extend both the Income Base Evaluation Period and Income
Credit Period for two additional 5 year periods, as long as you have not elected
to cancel the feature, and the age of the Covered Person or younger of two
Covered Persons is 85 or younger at the time of extension ("First Extension and
Second Extension").


After election of the First Extension and Second Extension, as long as you have
not elected to cancel the feature and the age of the Covered Person or younger
of two Covered Persons is 85 or younger at the time of the next extension, you
may elect to extend only the Income Base Evaluation Period for additional 5 year
periods ("Subsequent Extensions").


Prior to the end of the initial Income Base Evaluation Period and initial Income
Credit Period and prior to the end of each evaluation period you elect to
extend, we will inform you of the terms of the next extension in writing. We
will provide you with an extension election form prior to the end of each
evaluation period you extend. If you elect to extend the evaluation period, you
must complete the election form and return it to us or advise us as to your
intent to extend in a method acceptable to us.


The fee and investment requirements of the feature may change at the time of
extension and may be different than when you initially elected the feature. We
guarantee that the current fee as reflected in the Fee Table above, will not
increase by more than 0.25% at the time of First Extension.


If you do not elect the First Extension and the Second Extension, Subsequent
Extensions are no longer available for election and the Income Base and Income
Credit Base, if applicable, will not be adjusted for higher Anniversary Values
or Income Credits on subsequent contract anniversaries. However, you can
continue to take the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount in effect at the end of
the last Income Base Evaluation Period, subject to adjustments for Excess
Withdrawals. You will continue to pay the fee at the rate that was in effect
during the last Income Base Evaluation Period and you will not be permitted to
extend the Income Base Evaluation Period in the future. If you have not taken
any withdrawals prior to the 10th Benefit Year anniversary, your Income Base
will be eligible to be increased to the Minimum Income Base even if you have not
elected the First Extension.


38






WHAT HAPPENS IF THE CONTRACT VALUE IS REDUCED TO ZERO?



All withdrawals from the contract, including withdrawals under this feature,
will reduce your contract value. Unfavorable investment experience may also
reduce your contract value. If the contract value is reduced to zero but the
Income Base is greater than zero, we will continue to pay guaranteed payments
under the terms of this feature over the lifetime of the Covered Person(s).


However, if at any time an Excess Withdrawal(s) reduce your contract value to
zero, no further benefits will remain under this feature and your contract along
with this feature will terminate.


If the contract value is reduced to zero, the contract's other benefits will be
terminated. You may no longer make subsequent Purchase Payments or transfers,
and no death benefit or future annuity income payments are available. Therefore,
you should be aware that, particularly during times of unfavorable investment
performance, withdrawals taken under the benefit may reduce the contract value
to zero and eliminate any other benefits of the contract.


When the contract value equals zero but a benefit remains payable, to receive
any remaining benefit, you must select one of the following options for payment:


1. The current Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount, divided equally and paid
on a quarterly, semi-annual or annual frequency as selected by you until
the date of death of the Covered Person(s); or


2. Any payment option mutually agreeable between you and us.


If you do not select a payment option above, the remaining benefit will be paid
as the current Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount divided equally and paid on a
quarterly basis until the date of death of the Covered Person(s).


Any amounts that we may pay under the feature in excess of your contract value
are subject to the Company's financial strength and claims-paying ability.



WHAT HAPPENS TO MARKETLOCK INCOME PLUS UPON A SPOUSAL CONTINUATION?



If there is one Covered Person and that person dies, the surviving spousal joint
owner or spousal beneficiary may elect to:


1. Make a death claim if the contract value is greater than zero which
terminates MarketLock Income Plus and the contract; or


2. Continue the contract if the contract value is greater than zero,
without MarketLock Income Plus and its corresponding fee.


If there are two Covered Persons, upon the death of one Covered Person, the
surviving Covered Person may elect to:


1. Make a death claim if the contract value is greater than zero, which
terminates MarketLock Income Plus and the contract; or


2. Continue the contract with MarketLock Income Plus and its corresponding
fee.


The components of the feature in effect at the time of spousal continuation will
not change. The surviving Covered Person can elect to receive withdrawals in
accordance with the provisions of the feature based on the age of the younger
Covered Person at the time the first withdrawal was taken. If no withdrawals
were taken prior to the spousal continuation, the Maximum Annual Withdrawal
Percentage will be based on the age of the surviving Covered Person at the time
the first withdrawal is taken.


If spousal continuation occurs during the Income Base Evaluation Period and/or
Income Credit Period, if applicable, the Continuing Spouse will continue to
receive any increases to the Income Base during the remaining Income Base
Evaluation Period and/or Income Credit Period. The Continuing Spouse is eligible
to receive the Minimum Income Base if no withdrawals have been taken during the
first 10 Benefit years following the Effective Date. PLEASE SEE "IS THERE AN
ADDITIONAL GUARANTEE IF I DO NOT TAKE WITHDRAWALS FOR 10 YEARS?"ABOVE. In
addition, the Continuing Spouse will be eligible to elect to extend the Income
Base Evaluation Period and the Income Credit Period upon the expiration of the
period. PLEASE SEE "CAN I EXTEND THE INCOME BASE EVALUATION PERIOD AND INCOME
CREDIT PERIOD BEYOND 5 YEARS?" ABOVE.


39






CAN A NON-SPOUSAL BENEFICIARY ELECT TO RECEIVE ANY REMAINING BENEFITS UNDER
MARKETLOCK INCOME PLUS UPON THE DEATH OF THE SECOND SPOUSE?



No. Upon the death of the Covered Person(s), if the contract value is greater
than zero, a non-spousal beneficiary must make an election under the death
benefit provisions of the contract, which terminates MarketLock Income Plus.

PLEASE SEE DEATH BENEFITS BELOW.



WHAT HAPPENS TO MARKETLOCK INCOME PLUS UPON THE LATEST ANNUITY DATE?



If the contract value and the Income Base are greater than zero on the Latest
Annuity Date, you must select one of the following options:


1. Annuitize the contract value under the contract's annuity provisions; or


2. Elect to receive the current Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount on the
Latest Annuity Date, divided equally and paid on a quarterly,
semi-annual or annual frequency as selected by you until the date of
death of the Covered Person(s); or


3. Any payment option mutually agreeable between you and us.


If you do not elect an option listed above, on the Latest Annuity Date, we may
annuitize the contract value in accordance with Annuity Income Option 3, AS
DESCRIBED IN ANNUITY INCOME OPTIONS BELOW. At that point, the Accumulation Phase
of your contract ends and the Income Phase begins.



CAN I ELECT TO CANCEL THE MARKETLOCK INCOME PLUS FEATURE?



MarketLock Income Plus may be cancelled by you on the 5th Benefit Year
anniversary, the 10th Benefit Year anniversary, or any Benefit Year anniversary
after the 10th Benefit Year anniversary. Once you elect to cancel the MarketLock
Income Plus feature, you will no longer be charged a fee and the guarantees
under the benefit are terminated. In addition, the investment requirements for
MarketLock Income Plus will no longer apply to your contract. You may not extend
the Income Base Evaluation Period or Income Credit Period and you may not
re-elect or reinstate MarketLock Income Plus after cancellation.



ARE THERE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH MARKETLOCK INCOME PLUS WILL AUTOMATICALLY
TERMINATE?



The feature automatically terminates upon the occurrence of one of the
following:


1. Annuitization of the contract; or


2. Termination or surrender of the contract; or


3. A death benefit is paid and the contract is terminated; or


4. Excess Withdrawals reduce the contract value to zero; or


5. Death of the Covered Person, if only one is elected; or, if two are
elected, death of the surviving Covered Person; or


6. A change that removes all Covered Persons from the contract except as
noted below and under "ARE THERE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH GUARANTEED

WITHDRAWALS FOR TWO COVERED PERSONS, IF ELECTED, TERMINATE FOR ONE OF
THE COVERED PERSONS?"


If a change of ownership occurs from a natural person to a non-natural entity,
the original natural Owner(s) must also be the Annuitant(s) after the ownership
change to prevent termination of MarketLock Income Plus. A change of ownership
from a non-natural entity to a natural person can only occur if the new natural
Owner(s) was the original natural Annuitant(s) in order to prevent termination
of MarketLock Income Plus. Any ownership change is contingent upon prior review
and approval by the Company.


40






ARE THERE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH GUARANTEED WITHDRAWALS FOR TWO COVERED
PERSONS, IF ELECTED, TERMINATE FOR ONE OF THE COVERED PERSONS?



Under any of the following circumstances, MarketLock Income Plus will provide a
guarantee for one Covered Person and not the lifetime of the other Covered
Person:


1. One of the two Covered Persons is removed from the contract, due to
reasons other than death; or


2. The original spousal joint Owners or spousal beneficiary, who are the
Covered Persons, are no longer married at the time of death of the first
spouse.


Under these circumstances, the fee for MarketLock Income Plus based on two
Covered Persons remains unchanged and the guaranteed withdrawals are payable for
one Covered Person only. However, the remaining Covered Person may choose to
terminate the feature as described under "CAN I ELECT TO CANCEL THE MARKETLOCK
INCOME PLUS FEATURE?"



MARKETLOCK FOR LIFE PLUS




WHAT IS MARKETLOCK FOR LIFE PLUS?



MarketLock For Life Plus is an optional guaranteed minimum withdrawal feature,
available for an additional fee. You may elect one of two MarketLock For Life
Plus options, described below. The feature is designed to help you create a
guaranteed income stream that may last as long as you live, or as long as you
and your spouse live, even if the entire value of your contract has been reduced
to zero. MarketLock For Life Plus may offer protection in the event your
contract value declines due to unfavorable investment performance, or certain
withdrawal activity, if you live longer than expected or any combination of
these factors. You may never need to rely on MarketLock For Life Plus as its
value is dependent on your contract's performance, your withdrawal activity and
your longevity.


This feature may not be appropriate if you plan to make ongoing Purchase
Payments, such as with contributory IRA's or other tax-qualified plans. The
feature guarantees that only certain Purchase Payments received during the
contract's first five years are included in the Income Base, as defined below.


Withdrawals under the feature are treated like any other withdrawal for the
purpose of calculating taxable income, reducing the contract value, deducting
applicable withdrawal charges, free withdrawal amounts and all other benefits,
features and conditions of your contract. The sum of withdrawals in any contract
year up to the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount will not be assessed a
withdrawal charge. PLEASE SEE ACCESS TO YOUR MONEY ABOVE.


Any withdrawals taken may be subject to a 10% IRS tax penalty if you are under
age 59 1/2 at the time of the withdrawal. For information about how the feature
is treated for income tax purposes, you should consult a qualified tax advisor
concerning your particular circumstances. If you must take required minimum
distributions and want to ensure that these withdrawals are not considered
Excess Withdrawals under the feature, your distributions must be set up on the
automated monthly minimum distribution withdrawal program administered by our
Annuity Service Center. In addition, if you have a Qualified contract, tax law
and the terms of the plan may restrict withdrawal amounts.



WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO MODIFY, SUSPEND OR TERMINATE MARKETLOCK FOR LIFE PLUS AT
ANY TIME FOR PROSPECTIVELY ISSUED CONTRACTS.




WHEN AND HOW MAY I ELECT MARKETLOCK FOR LIFE PLUS?



You may elect MarketLock For Life Plus at the time of contract issue for
immediate effectiveness. If we allow you to elect the feature after purchasing
your contract, the feature is effective on the first contract anniversary after
your election (the "Effective Date"). You cannot elect this feature if you elect
any other optional living benefit. You may elect to have the feature cover only
your life or the lives of both you and your spouse. We refer to the person or
persons whose lifetime withdrawals are guaranteed under MarketLock For Life Plus
as the "Covered Person(s)." There are age parameters applicable to this feature
which determine whether you can elect the feature and who can qualify as a
Covered Person. If the contract is not owned by a natural person, references to
Owner(s) apply to the Annuitants. The tables below provide the age requirement
for electing this feature depending on the type of contract you purchase and the
number of Covered Persons.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------








(1) The age requirements for optional death benefits and other optional features
may be different than those listed here. You must meet the age requirement
for those features in order to elect them.


(2) Not applicable because feature availability is based on the younger Covered
Person. The spousal beneficiary's age is not considered in determining the
maximum issue age of the second Covered Person.



HOW DOES MARKETLOCK FOR LIFE PLUS WORK?



MarketLock For Life Plus automatically locks-in the greater of two values in
determining the Covered Person(s) guaranteed lifetime benefit. For 10 years
following the Effective Date, both the +6% option and the +7% option annually
lock-in the highest Anniversary Value or the Income Base plus an Income Credit,
as described below. You may extend the period over which the feature locks-in
the highest Anniversary Value beyond 10 years; however, the Income Credit is
only available for the first 10 years following the Effective Date. The +7%
option offers an additional guarantee if you choose not to take withdrawals in
the first 10 years following the Effective Date. MarketLock For Life Plus is
designed for individuals or spousal joint owners. Thus, if a contract is owned
by non-spousal joint owners and either owner dies, the full contract value must
be paid within 5 years of death, after which time the contract terminates; the
surviving owner may not receive the benefit of MarketLock For Life Plus.


MarketLock For Life Plus automatically locks-in a new Income Base each year
during the first 10 years of your contract based on the greater of either (1)
the highest Anniversary Value, or (2) the Income Base increased by an Income
Credit. The Income Credit will only be added to the Income Base if no
withdrawals are taken in a contract year. For instance, if you take a withdrawal
in year 2, you will not be eligible for an Income Credit to be added to your
Income Base on your second contract anniversary; however, if you do not take a
withdrawal in year 3, you will be eligible for an Income Credit to be added to
your Income Base on your third contract anniversary.

                                 (1) highest Anniversary Value;
                                 (2) Income Base plus the Income Credit; or

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------








For an explanation of defined terms used in the table above, PLEASE SEE "HOW ARE


THE COMPONENTS OF MARKETLOCK FOR LIFE PLUS CALCULATED?" BELOW.




WHAT DETERMINES THE MAXIMUM ANNUAL WITHDRAWAL PERCENTAGE?



The Maximum Annual Withdrawal Percentage represents the percentage of your
Income Base used to calculate the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount that you may
withdraw each year. The Maximum Annual Withdrawal Percentage is determined by
the age of the Covered Person(s) at the time of the first withdrawal as shown in
the table below.





One Covered Person



If the feature is elected to cover one life but the contract is jointly owned,
then the Covered Person must be the older Owner and the following is applicable:






--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AGE OF THE COVERED PERSON AT                        MAXIMUM ANNUAL
TIME OF FIRST WITHDRAWAL                            WITHDRAWAL PERCENTAGE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 At least age 45 but prior to 60th birthday         4% of Income Base
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 At least age 60 but prior to 76th birthday         5% of Income Base
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 On or after 76th birthday                          6% of Income Base
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------











Two Covered Persons



If the feature is elected to cover two lives, the following is applicable:






--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AGE OF THE YOUNGER COVERED PERSON OR SURVIVING      MAXIMUM ANNUAL
COVERED PERSON AT TIME OF FIRST WITHDRAWAL          WITHDRAWAL PERCENTAGE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 At least age 45 but prior to 60th birthday         4% of Income Base
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 At least age 60 but prior to 76th birthday         5% of Income Base
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 On or after 76th birthday                          6% of Income Base
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------








If you are taking required minimum distributions ("RMD") from this contract, and
the amount of the RMD (based only on this contract) is greater than the Maximum
Annual Withdrawal Amount in a benefit year, no portion of the RMD withdrawal
will be treated as an Excess Withdrawal (defined below). Any portion of a
withdrawal that is greater than either the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount or
the RMD (based only on this contract) will be considered an Excess Withdrawal.

PLEASE SEE "WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF WITHDRAWALS ON MARKETLOCK FOR LIFE PLUS?"
BELOW.

If you purchased your contract prior to July 30, 2007, please refer to the
Statement of Additional Information for the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Percentage
applicable to your contract.

+7% OPTION - INVESTMENT REQUIREMENTS


You may comply with investment requirements for the +7% option by allocating
100% of your investments to one of the following:


- Cash Management Variable Portfolio


- Managed Allocation Balanced Variable Portfolio


- Managed Allocation Moderate Variable Portfolio


- Managed Allocation Moderate Growth Variable Portfolio


- Strategic Allocation Balanced


- Strategic Allocation Moderate


45





- Strategic Allocation Moderate Growth


- 6-month or 12-month DCA Fixed Accounts, if available


The Strategic Allocations are designed to assist in diversifying your investment
across various asset classes which may help minimize the risk that your contract
value will be reduced to zero before your death. Therefore, the investment
requirements may reduce the need to rely on the guarantees provided by this
benefit. You may have better investment returns investing in a single asset
class or in Variable Portfolios that are not available for investment under this
feature. You should consult with your financial representative to assist you in
determining whether the Strategic Allocation Programs are suited for your
financial needs and risk tolerance. For details regarding the investment
allocations of the Strategic Allocations, PLEASE SEE STRATEGIC ALLOCATION
PROGRAM ABOVE.


Your allocation instructions accompanying any Purchase Payment must comply with
the investment requirements, listed above, in order for your application or
subsequent Purchase Payment to be considered in Good Order. PLEASE SEE
ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE PAYMENTS ABOVE. We will automatically enroll you in the
Automatic Asset Rebalancing Program, with quarterly rebalancing, because market
performance and withdrawal activity may result in your contract's allocations
going outside these restrictions. This will ensure that your allocations are
rebalanced quarterly to comply with the investment requirements for this
feature. In addition to quarterly rebalancing, we will initiate rebalancing in
accordance with your Automatic Asset Rebalancing instructions, after any of the
following transactions:


- any transfer or reallocation you initiate; or


- any withdrawal you initiate.


Automatic transfers and/or systematic withdrawals will not result in
rebalancing. We will rebalance your contract in accordance with your most
current and compliant Automatic Asset Rebalancing Program instructions on file.
If at any point, for any reason, your Automatic Asset Rebalancing Program
instructions would result in allocations inconsistent with the investment
requirements, we will revert to the last compliant instructions on file whether
for rebalancing or for allocation of a Purchase Payment and implement those at
the next rebalancing. PLEASE SEE AUTOMATIC ASSET REBALANCING PROGRAM ABOVE. You
can modify your Automatic Asset Rebalancing Program instructions, as long as
they are consistent with the investment requirements, at any time by calling the
Annuity Service Center.


We reserve the right to change the investment requirements at any time for
prospectively issued contracts. We may also revise the investment requirements
for any existing contract to the extent Variable Portfolios and/or Fixed
Accounts are added, deleted, substituted, merged or otherwise reorganized. We
will notify you of any changes to the investment requirements at least 30 days
in advance.



HOW ARE THE COMPONENTS FOR MARKETLOCK FOR LIFE PLUS CALCULATED?



First, we determine the ELIGIBLE PURCHASE PAYMENTS, which include:


1. 100% of Purchase Payments received during the first contract year; and


2. Purchase Payments received in each of contract years 2-5, capped in each
year at an amount equal to 100% of the Purchase Payments received in
year 1. This means that if you made a $100,000 Purchase Payment in year
1, Eligible Purchase Payments will include additional Purchase Payments
of up to $100,000 contributed in each of contract years 2-5 for a grand
total maximum of $500,000 of Eligible Purchase Payments. If the feature
is elected after contract issue, Purchase Payments received from the
Effective Date through contract year 5 are capped in each year at an
amount equal to 100% of the Purchase Payments received during the first
contract year.


Any Purchase Payments made in contract years 2-5 in excess of the annual cap
amount as well as all Purchase Payments received after the 5th contract year are
considered INELIGIBLE PURCHASE PAYMENTS. The calculation of Eligible Purchase
Payments does not include any spousal continuation contributions; however,
continuation contributions are included in the calculation of Anniversary
Values, as defined below. PLEASE SEE SPOUSAL CONTINUATION BELOW. Total Eligible
Purchase Payments are limited to $1,500,000 without our prior Company approval.


46





Second, we consider the INCOME CREDIT PERIOD and the INCOME BASE EVALUATION
PERIOD. The Income Credit Period is the period of time over which we calculate
the potential Income Credit. The Income Base Evaluation Period is the period of
time over which we will consider Anniversary Values and if greater, the Income
Base plus Income Credit during the Income Credit Period. The Income Credit
Period and the Income Base Evaluation Period begin on the Effective Date and end
10 years later. On the expiration of the Income Base Evaluation Period, you may
contact us to extend the Income Base Evaluation Period. PLEASE SEE "CAN I EXTEND
THE INCOME BASE EVALUATION PERIOD BEYOND 10 YEARS?" BELOW. However, you cannot
extend the Income Credit Period.


Third, we determine the ANNIVERSARY VALUE which equals your contract value on
any contract anniversary during the Income Base Evaluation Period minus any
Ineligible Purchase Payments.


Fourth, we determine the INCOME BASE which initially is equal to the first
Eligible Purchase Payment. PLEASE SEE "WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF WITHDRAWALS ON
MARKETLOCK FOR LIFE PLUS?" BELOW. If the feature is elected after contract
issue, the initial Income Base is the contract value on the Effective Date. On
each contract anniversary, we determine if the Income Base should be increased
based on the maximum Anniversary Value or any available Income Credit. The
calculation and components of this determination are detailed below.



CALCULATION OF THE INCOME BASE WHEN INCOME CREDIT IS NOT AVAILABLE OR AFTER

INCOME CREDIT PERIOD ENDS:



On each contract anniversary occurring during the Income Base Evaluation
Period, the Income Base is automatically increased to the Anniversary Value
when the Anniversary Value is greater than both (a) and (b), where:


(a) is the current Income Base; and


(b) is all previous maximum Anniversary Values during the Income Base
Evaluation Period.



CALCULATION OF THE INCOME BASE WHEN INCOME CREDIT IS AVAILABLE:



The Income Credit Base is used to calculate the Income Credit during the
Income Credit Period. The Income Credit is calculated as a percentage of
the Income Credit Base. The Income Credit Base is used solely to calculate
the Income Credit. The initial Income Credit Base is equal to the initial
Eligible Purchase Payment.


On each contract anniversary during the Income Credit Period, we determine
the amount by which the Income Credit Base and/or the Income Base could
increase. The components used to determine this amount are:


(a) the Income Base calculated based on the maximum Anniversary Value;
and


(b) the current Income Base plus the Income Credit.


If (a) is greater than or equal to (b), the Income Credit Base and the
Income Base are increased to the current Anniversary Value. If (b) is
greater than (a), the Income Base is increased by the Income Credit and the
Income Credit Base remains unchanged.


If the +7% option is elected and NO WITHDRAWALS HAVE BEEN TAKEN SINCE THE
EFFECTIVE DATE, on the 10th contract anniversary the Income Base is
calculated as the greatest of (a), (b) or (c), where:


(a) is the Income Base calculated based on the maximum Anniversary
Value;


(b) is the Income Credit plus the current Income Base; and


(c) is 200% of the Purchase Payments made in the first contract year.


The Income Credit Base is increased each time subsequent Eligible Purchase
Payments are made. The Income Credit Base also increases when the Income Base is
increased as a result of a maximum Anniversary Value being achieved that is
greater than both the current Income Base and all previous maximum Anniversary
Values. The Income Credit Base is decreased each time an Excess Withdrawal is
taken, in the same proportion by which the contract value is reduced by the
Excess Withdrawal. The Income Credit Base is not used in the calculation of the
contract value or any other benefits under the contract.


The Income Base and Income Credit Base are increased each time subsequent
Eligible Purchase Payments are made, and adjusted each time an Excess Withdrawal
is taken. Other than adjustments made for Excess Withdrawals, the Income Base
and Income Credit Base can only be adjusted upwards, and subsequent lower


47





Anniversary Values during the Income Base Evaluation Period will not result in a
lower Income Base or lower Income Credit Base.


Finally, we determine the MAXIMUM ANNUAL WITHDRAWAL AMOUNT, which represents the
maximum amount that may be withdrawn each contract year. The Maximum Annual
Withdrawal Amount is calculated by multiplying the current Income Base by the
applicable Maximum Annual Withdrawal Percentage shown in the tables above. If
the Income Base is increased on a contract anniversary, the Maximum Annual
Withdrawal Amount is recalculated on that contract anniversary by multiplying
the increased Income Base by the applicable Maximum Annual Withdrawal
Percentage. If the Income Base is increased for any Eligible Purchase Payments,
the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount will be recalculated upon receipt of each
Eligible Purchase Payments by multiplying the new Income Base by the applicable
Maximum Annual Withdrawal Percentage. The Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount may
also be decreased due to Excess Withdrawals. PLEASE SEE "WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF
WITHDRAWALS ON MARKETLOCK FOR LIFE PLUS?" BELOW.





WHAT IS THE FEE FOR MARKETLOCK FOR LIFE PLUS?



The fee for MarketLock For Life Plus depends on whether you elect the +6% option
or +7% option and whether you elect to cover one life or two lives.






-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MARKETLOCK FOR LIFE PLUS OPTION  NUMBER OF COVERED PERSONS       ANNUALIZED FEE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 +6% Option                       For One Covered Person      0.65% of Income Base
                                 ----------------------------------------------------
                                  For Two Covered Persons     0.90% of Income Base
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 +7% Option                       For One Covered Person      0.75% of Income Base
                                 ----------------------------------------------------
                                  For Two Covered Persons     1.00% of Income Base
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------








The fee will be calculated and deducted quarterly from the portion of your
contract value allocated to the Variable Portfolios, starting on the first
quarter following the Effective Date and ending upon termination of the Benefit.
If you elect the +7% option and you take a withdrawal in the first 10 contract
years following the Effective Date, your Income Base is not eligible to be
increased to 200% of the Purchase Payments made in the first contract year;
however, the fee remains the same.


An increase in the Income Base due to an adjustment to a higher Anniversary
Value, addition of an Income Credit, or subsequent Eligible Purchase Payments
will result in an increase to the dollar amount of the fee. The fee of the
feature may change at the time of extension and may be different than when you
initially elected the feature.


If your contract value falls to zero before the feature has been terminated, the
fee will no longer be deducted. We will not assess the quarterly fee if you
annuitize your contract before the end of a contract quarter. If the feature is
still in effect and you surrender your contract, we will assess a pro-rata
charge for the fee if you surrender your contract before the end of a contract
quarter. The pro-rata charge is calculated by multiplying the full quarterly fee
by the number of days between the date the fee was last assessed and the date of
surrender divided by the number of days in a contract quarter.



WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF WITHDRAWALS ON MARKETLOCK FOR LIFE PLUS?



The Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount, the Income Base and Income Credit Base may
change over time as a result of the timing and amount of withdrawals. IF YOU
ELECT THE +7% OPTION AND YOU TAKE A WITHDRAWAL IN THE FIRST 10 CONTRACT YEARS
FOLLOWING THE EFFECTIVE DATE, YOUR INCOME BASE IS NOT ELIGIBLE TO BE INCREASED
TO 200% OF THE PURCHASE PAYMENTS MADE IN THE FIRST CONTRACT YEAR.


Any withdrawals in a contract year that in total are less than or equal to the
Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount do not reduce the Income Base or Income Credit
Base. Withdrawals in excess of the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount are
considered EXCESS WITHDRAWALS. We define Excess Withdrawals as any portion of a
withdrawal that causes the total withdrawals in a Benefit Year to exceed the
Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount, including but not limited to any withdrawal in
a contract year taken after the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount has been
withdrawn.


48





You should not elect this feature if you plan to take Excess Withdrawals since
those withdrawals may significantly reduce or eliminate the value of the
feature. In addition, if you plan to take withdrawals in any year during the
Income Credit Period, an Income Credit will not be added to your Income Base on
that contract anniversary.


You may take withdrawals during a contract year up to or less than the Maximum
Annual Withdrawal Amount. However, if you choose to take less than the Maximum
Annual Withdrawal Amount in any contract year, you may not carry over the unused
amount into subsequent years. Your Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount will not be
recalculated as a result of taking less than the entire Maximum Annual
Withdrawal Amount in any given year.


The impact of withdrawals and the effect on each component of MarketLock For
Life Plus are further explained below:


INCOME BASE AND INCOME CREDIT BASE: If the sum of withdrawals in any
Benefit Year exceeds the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount, the Income Base
and Income Credit Base will be reduced for those withdrawals.


For each Excess Withdrawal taken, the Income Base and Income Credit Base
are reduced in the same proportion by which the contract value is reduced
by each Excess Withdrawal.


Since Excess Withdrawals reduce the Income Credit Base, it will result in
the reduction of the amount of the Income Credit available in subsequent
Benefit Years.


MAXIMUM ANNUAL WITHDRAWAL AMOUNT: The Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount is
recalculated each time there is a change in the Income Base. Accordingly,
if the sum of withdrawals in any contract year does not exceed the Maximum
Annual Withdrawal Amount for that year, the Maximum Annual Withdrawal
Amount will not change for the next year unless your Income Base is
increased (AS DESCRIBED ABOVE UNDER "HOW ARE THE COMPONENTS FOR MARKETLOCK
FOR LIFE PLUS CALCULATED?").


If you take an Excess Withdrawal, the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount will
be recalculated by multiplying the reduced Income Base by the existing
Maximum Annual Withdrawal Percentage. This recalculated Maximum Annual
Withdrawal Amount will be available beginning on the next contract
anniversary and may be lower than your previous Maximum Annual Withdrawal
Amount.






THE OPTIONAL LIVING BENEFITS EXAMPLES APPENDIX PROVIDES EXAMPLES OF THE EFFECTS
OF WITHDRAWALS.




WHAT HAPPENS IF THE CONTRACT VALUE IS REDUCED TO ZERO?



If the contract value is reduced to zero but the Income Base is greater than
zero, guaranteed withdrawals will continue to be payable over the lifetime of
the Covered Person(s). However, if at any time an Excess Withdrawal reduces your
contract value to zero, no benefits will remain under this feature, the Income
Base Evaluation Period and the Income Credit Period end and the Income Credit
Base equals zero.


If the contract value is reduced to zero, the contract's other benefits will be
terminated. You may no longer make subsequent Purchase Payments or transfers,
and no death benefit or future annuity income payments are available. Therefore,
you should be aware that, particularly during times of unfavorable investment
performance, withdrawals taken under the benefit may reduce the contract value
to zero and eliminate any other benefits of the contract.


When the contract value equals zero but a benefit remains payable, to receive
any remaining benefit, you must select one of the following options for payment:


1. The current Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount, divided equally and paid
on a quarterly, semi-annual or annual frequency as selected by you until
the date of death of the Covered Person(s); or


2. Any payment option mutually agreeable between you and us.


If you do not select a payment option above, the remaining benefit will be paid
as the current Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount divided equally and paid on a
quarterly basis until the date of death of the Covered Person(s).


Any amounts that we may pay under the feature in excess of your contract value
are subject to the Company's financial strength and claims-paying ability.


49






CAN I EXTEND THE INCOME BASE EVALUATION PERIOD BEYOND 10 YEARS?



There is an option for extension of the Income Base Evaluation Period as long as
you have not elected to cancel the feature and the age of the Covered Person or
younger of two Covered Persons is 85 or younger at the time of extension. If you
elect to extend the Income Base Evaluation Period, the Income Base can continue
to be adjusted upward as described above on each anniversary during the new
Income Base Evaluation Period which is a period of 5 years.


Prior to the end of the initial Income Base Evaluation Period and prior to the
end of each evaluation period you elect to extend, we will notify you of the
terms of the next extension in writing. We will provide you with an extension
election form prior to the end of each evaluation period you extend. If you
elect to extend the evaluation period, you must complete the election form and
return it to us or advise us as to your intent to extend in a method acceptable
to us.


The fee and investment requirements of the feature may change at the time of
extension and may be different than when you initially elected the feature.


If you do not contact us at the end of each Income Base Evaluation Period to
extend the Income Base Evaluation Period, an extension will no longer be
available and the Income Base will not be adjusted for higher Anniversary Values
on subsequent contract anniversaries. However, you can continue to take the
Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount in effect at the end of the last Income Base
Evaluation Period, subject to adjustments for Excess Withdrawals. You will
continue to pay the fee at the rate that was in effect during the last Income
Base Evaluation Period and you will not be permitted to extend the Income Base
Evaluation Period in the future.



CAN I EXTEND THE INCOME CREDIT PERIOD BEYOND 10 YEARS?



No. The Income Credit Period may not be extended. However, the Income Base
Evaluation Period as described above may be extended.



WHAT HAPPENS TO MARKETLOCK FOR LIFE PLUS UPON A SPOUSAL CONTINUATION?



If there is one Covered Person and that person dies, the surviving spousal joint
owner or spousal beneficiary may elect to:


1. Make a death claim if the contract value is greater than zero which
terminates MarketLock For Life Plus and the contract; or


2. Continue the contract if the contract value is greater than zero,
without MarketLock For Life Plus and its corresponding fee.


If there are two Covered Persons, upon the death of one Covered Person, the
surviving Covered Person may elect to:


1. Make a death claim if the contract value is greater than zero, which
terminates MarketLock For Life Plus and the contract; or


2. Continue the contract with MarketLock For Life Plus and its
corresponding fee.


The components of the feature will not change as a result of a spousal
continuation. The surviving Covered Person can elect to receive withdrawals in
accordance with the provisions of the feature based on the age of the younger
Covered Person when the first withdrawal was taken or the age of the surviving
Covered Person, or if no withdrawals were taken prior to the continuation, the
age of the surviving Covered Person at the time the first withdrawal is taken.


If spousal continuation occurs during the Income Base Evaluation Period and/or
Income Credit Period, if applicable, the Continuing Spouse will continue to
receive any increases to the Income Base during the remaining Income Base
Evaluation Period and/or Income Credit Period. If the +7% option was elected,
the Continuing Spouse is eligible to receive the additional guarantee if no
withdrawals have been taken during the first 10 contract years following the
Effective Date. In addition, the Continuing Spouse will be eligible to extend
the Income Base Evaluation Period upon the expiration of the previous period.

PLEASE SEE "CAN I EXTEND THE INCOME BASE EVALUATION PERIOD BEYOND 10 YEARS?"
ABOVE.


50






CAN A NON-SPOUSAL BENEFICIARY ELECT TO RECEIVE ANY REMAINING BENEFITS UNDER
MARKETLOCK FOR LIFE PLUS UPON THE DEATH OF THE SECOND SPOUSE?



No. Upon the death of the Covered Person(s), if the contract value is greater
than zero, a non-spousal beneficiary must make an election under the death
benefit provisions of the contract, which terminates MarketLock For Life Plus.

PLEASE SEE DEATH BENEFITS BELOW.



WHAT HAPPENS TO MARKETLOCK FOR LIFE PLUS UPON THE LATEST ANNUITY DATE?



If the contract value and the Income Base are greater than zero on the Latest
Annuity Date, you must select one of the following options:


1. Annuitize the contract value under the contract's annuity provisions; or


2. Elect to receive the current Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount on the
Latest Annuity Date, divided equally and paid on a quarterly,
semi-annual or annual frequency as selected by you until the date of
death of the Covered Person(s); or


3. Any payment option mutually agreeable between you and us.


If you do not elect an option listed above, on the Latest Annuity Date, we may
annuitize the contract value in accordance with Annuity Income Option 3, AS
DESCRIBED IN ANNUITY INCOME OPTIONS BELOW. At that point, the Accumulation Phase
of your contract ends and the Income Phase begins.



CAN I ELECT TO CANCEL THE MARKETLOCK FOR LIFE PLUS FEATURE?



MarketLock For Life Plus may be cancelled by you on the 5th contract
anniversary, the 10th contract anniversary, or any contract anniversary after
the 10th contract anniversary. Once you elect to cancel the MarketLock For Life
Plus feature, you will no longer be charged a fee and the guarantees under the
benefit are terminated. In addition, the investment requirements for MarketLock
For Life Plus will no longer apply to your contract. You may not extend the
Income Base Evaluation Period and you may not re-elect or reinstate MarketLock
For Life Plus after cancellation.



ARE THERE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH MARKETLOCK FOR LIFE PLUS WILL AUTOMATICALLY
TERMINATE?



The feature automatically terminates upon the occurrence of one of the
following:


1. Annuitization of the contract; or


2. Full surrender or termination of the contract; or


3. A death benefit is paid and the contract is terminated; or


4. Excess Withdrawals reduce the contract value to zero; or


5. Death of the Covered Person, if only one; or, if two Covered Persons are
elected, death of the surviving Covered Persons; or


6. A change that removes all Covered Persons from the contract except as
noted below and under "ARE THERE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH GUARANTEED

WITHDRAWALS FOR TWO COVERED PERSONS, IF ELECTED, TERMINATE FOR ONE OF
THE COVERED PERSONS?"


If a change of ownership occurs from a natural person to a non-natural entity,
the original natural Owner(s) must also be the Annuitant(s) after the ownership
change to prevent termination of MarketLock For Life Plus. A change of ownership
from a non-natural entity to a natural person can only occur if the new natural
Owner(s) was the original Annuitant(s) in order to prevent termination of
MarketLock For Life Plus. Any ownership change is contingent upon prior review
and approval by the Company.


51






ARE THERE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH GUARANTEED WITHDRAWALS FOR TWO COVERED
PERSONS, IF ELECTED, TERMINATE FOR ONE OF THE COVERED PERSONS?



Under any of the following circumstances, MarketLock For Life Plus will provide
a guarantee for one Covered Person and not the lifetime of the other Covered
Person:


1. One of the two Covered Persons is removed from the contract, due to
reasons other than death; or


2. The original spousal joint Owners or spousal beneficiary, who are the
Covered Persons, are no longer married at the time of death of the first
spouse.


Under these circumstances, the fee for MarketLock For Life Plus based on two
Covered Persons remains unchanged and the guaranteed withdrawals are payable for
one Covered Person only. However, the remaining Covered Person may choose to
terminate the feature as described under "CAN I ELECT TO CANCEL THE MARKETLOCK
FOR LIFE PLUS FEATURE?"



MARKETLOCK




WHAT IS MARKETLOCK?



MarketLock is an optional guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit designed to help
you create a guaranteed income stream for a specified period of time that may
last as long as you live even if the entire value of your contract has been
reduced to zero (the "Benefit"). Thus, MarketLock may offer protection in the
event your contract value declines due to unfavorable investment performance,
certain withdrawal activity, a longer than expected life span, or any
combination of these factors. Please check with your financial representative
for availability and any additional restrictions.


The feature does not guarantee a withdrawal of an income stream based on any
Purchase Payments made after the second contract anniversary. The feature only
guarantees lifetime withdrawals in the manner described below. You may never
need to rely on MarketLock depending on your contract's market performance, your
withdrawal activity, and your longevity.


This feature may not be appropriate if you plan to make ongoing Purchase
Payments, such as with contributory IRA's or tax-qualified plans. The feature
guarantees only Purchase Payments received in the contract's first two years.


Withdrawals under the feature are treated like any other withdrawal for the
purpose of calculating taxable income, deducting applicable withdrawal charges,
and reducing the contract value, free withdrawal amounts and all other benefits,
features and conditions of your contract. PLEASE SEE ACCESS TO YOUR MONEY ABOVE.


Any withdrawals taken may be subject to a 10% IRS tax penalty if you are under
age 59 1/2 at the time of the withdrawal. For information about how the feature
is treated for income tax purposes, you should consult a qualified tax advisor
concerning your particular circumstances. If you take required minimum
distributions and have elected this feature, your distributions must be set up
on the automated minimum distribution withdrawal program administered by our
Annuity Service Center. In addition, if you have a Qualified contract, tax law
and the terms of the plan may restrict withdrawal amounts.



WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO MODIFY, SUSPEND OR TERMINATE MARKETLOCK AT ANY TIME FOR
PROSPECTIVELY ISSUED CONTRACTS.



The investment requirements applicable to MarketLock Income Plus and MarketLock
For Life Plus, discussed above, are not applicable to MarketLock.



HOW AND WHEN CAN I ELECT MARKETLOCK?



You may only elect MarketLock at the time of contract issue and if you are age
75 or younger on the contract issue date. If the contract is jointly owned, the
maximum issue age is based on the age of the older owner. MarketLock cannot be
elected if you elect any other optional living benefit.


52






HOW DOES MARKETLOCK WORK?



MarketLock automatically locks in the highest contract Anniversary Value during
the first 10 years (or 20 years if you extend the Maximum Anniversary Value
("MAV") Evaluation Period, as discussed below) and guarantees annual withdrawals
based on this amount over the period that the Benefit is in effect.
Additionally, you may take withdrawals over the lifetime of the owner as more
fully described below. For jointly owned contracts, the older owner is the life
upon which the lifetime guarantee applies. Accordingly, if the older contract
owner were to die first, the surviving younger spousal owner is not eligible for
lifetime withdrawals, but may elect to continue the contract and receive any
remaining withdrawals under the feature as described below. MarketLock is
designed for individuals or spousal joint owners. Thus, if a contract is owned
by non-spousal joint owners and either owner dies, the full contract value must
be paid within 5 years of death, after which time the contract terminates; the
surviving owner may not receive the benefit of MarketLock.


The Benefit's components and value may vary depending on when the first
withdrawal is taken, the age of the older owner at the time of the first
withdrawal and the amount that is withdrawn. Your withdrawal activity determines
the time period over which you are eligible to receive withdrawals. You will
automatically be eligible to receive lifetime withdrawals if you begin
withdrawals on or after your 65th birthday and your withdrawals do not exceed
the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount in any Benefit Year. However, you may begin
taking withdrawals under the Benefit immediately following the contract issue
date. PLEASE SEE THE MARKETLOCK SUMMARY TABLE BELOW.


The table below is a summary of the MarketLock feature and applicable components
of the Benefit. "Benefit Year Anniversary" refers to each one-year period
beginning on the contract issue date and ending on the day before the contract
anniversary date. The term "Extension" refers to your ability to extend the MAV
Evaluation Period beyond the first 10 years of your contract. PLEASE SEE "CAN I
EXTEND THE MAV EVALUATION PERIOD BEYOND 10 YEARS?" BELOW.

*   For the purposes of complying with the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Percentage,
the amount of the withdrawal would include any charges applicable to the
withdrawal.


**  The fractional year indicates that the final withdrawal of the remaining MAV
Benefit Base, which will be less than your Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount,
may be taken at any time during the final year of the Minimum Withdrawal
Period.


*** Lifetime withdrawals are available so long as your first withdrawal is taken
on or after age 65 and withdrawals do not exceed the 5% Maximum Annual
Withdrawal Percentage indicated above. If withdrawals exceed the 5% Maximum
Annual Withdrawal Percentage in any Benefit Year (other than for RMD amounts
for this contract that are greater than the Maximum Annual Withdrawal
Amount), lifetime withdrawals are no longer available. Instead, available
withdrawals are automatically recalculated with respect to the Minimum
Withdrawal Period and Maximum Annual Withdrawal Percentage listed in the
table above, based on the time of first withdrawal and reduced for
withdrawals already taken.


If you are taking required minimum distributions ("RMD") from the contract,
and the portion of the RMD amount based on this contract only, is greater
than the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount in a benefit year, that portion
of the withdrawal will not be treated as an Excess Withdrawal. Any portion
of an RMD withdrawal in a Benefit Year that is greater than both the
Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount and the


53





RMD amount (based only on this contract) will be considered an Excess
Withdrawal. This will result in cancellation of the lifetime withdrawals
and may further reduce your Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount, MAV Benefit
Base, and remaining Minimum Withdrawal Period. PLEASE SEE "HOW ARE THE
COMPONENTS FOR MARKETLOCK CALCULATED?" BELOW.



FOR DETAILS ON THE EFFECTS OF WITHDRAWALS, PLEASE SEE "WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF
WITHDRAWALS ON MARKETLOCK?"




HOW ARE THE COMPONENTS FOR MARKETLOCK CALCULATED?



In order to determine the Benefit's value, we calculate each of the components
as described below.


FIRST, we determine the ELIGIBLE PURCHASE PAYMENTS, which include the amount of
Purchase Payments received during the first two years after your contract issue
date, adjusted for any withdrawals during that period. Any Purchase Payments we
receive more than two years after your contract issue date are considered
INELIGIBLE PURCHASE PAYMENTS. The calculation of Eligible Purchase Payments does
not include any spousal continuation contributions; however, spousal
continuation contributions are included in the calculation of Anniversary
Values, as defined below. PLEASE SEE SPOUSAL CONTINUATION BELOW. Eligible
Purchase Payments are limited to $1,500,000 without prior Company approval.


SECOND, we consider the MAV EVALUATION PERIOD, which begins on your contract
issue date and ends on your 10th contract anniversary. On the expiration of the
MAV Evaluation Period, you may contact us to extend the MAV Evaluation Period
for an additional period as discussed further below.


THIRD, we determine the ANNIVERSARY VALUE which equals the value of your
contract on any contract anniversary during the MAV Evaluation Period minus any
Ineligible Purchase Payments.


FOURTH, we determine the MAV BENEFIT BASE. Initially, the MAV Benefit Base
equals the first Eligible Purchase Payment. Thereafter, the MAV Benefit Base is
increased each time subsequent Eligible Purchase Payments are made, and adjusted
each time any withdrawals of contract value are taken. PLEASE SEE "WHAT ARE THE
EFFECTS OF WITHDRAWALS ON MARKETLOCK?" BELOW. On each contract anniversary
throughout the MAV Evaluation Period, the MAV Benefit Base automatically adjusts
upwards if the current Anniversary Value is greater than both the current MAV
Benefit Base and any previous year's Anniversary Value. Other than adjustments
made for withdrawals, the MAV Benefit Base will only be adjusted upwards, and
subsequent lower Anniversary Values through the MAV Evaluation Period will not
result in a lower MAV Benefit Base.


FIFTH, we determine the MAXIMUM ANNUAL WITHDRAWAL AMOUNT, which represents the
maximum amount that may be withdrawn each Benefit Year and is an amount
calculated as a percentage of the MAV Benefit Base. The applicable Maximum
Annual Withdrawal Percentage is determined based on the Benefit Year when you
take your first withdrawal or whether you are taking lifetime withdrawals.
Applicable percentages are shown in the MarketLock Summary Table above. If the
MAV Benefit Base is increased to the current Anniversary Value, the Maximum
Annual Withdrawal Amount is recalculated on that contract anniversary using the
applicable Maximum Annual Withdrawal Percentage multiplied by the new MAV
Benefit Base. If the MAV Benefit Base is increased for Eligible Purchase
Payments, the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount will be recalculated by
multiplying the new MAV Benefit Base by the applicable Maximum Annual Withdrawal
Percentage.


FINALLY, we determine the MINIMUM WITHDRAWAL PERIOD, which is the minimum period
over which you may take withdrawals under the feature. The initial Minimum
Withdrawal Period is calculated when withdrawals under the Benefit begin and is
recalculated when the MAV Benefit Base is adjusted to a higher Anniversary Value
by dividing the MAV Benefit Base by the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount. Please
see the MarketLock Summary Table above for initial Minimum Withdrawal Periods.
The Minimum Withdrawal Periods will be reduced due to withdrawals.



FOR DETAILS ON THE EFFECTS OF WITHDRAWALS, PLEASE SEE "WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF
WITHDRAWALS ON MARKETLOCK?" BELOW.




CAN I EXTEND THE MAV EVALUATION PERIOD BEYOND 10 YEARS?



Yes. As long as you have not elected to cancel the feature and the older owner
is age 85 or younger at the time you elect the extension, you may elect to
extend the MAV Evaluation Period. We guarantee that you will be given the
opportunity to extend the MAV Evaluation Period under these conditions for at
least one additional evaluation period of 10 years. IN ORDER TO EXTEND THE MAV
EVALUATION PERIOD, YOU MUST CONTACT US NO LATER THAN THE END OF


54





THE MAV EVALUATION PERIOD. If you elect to extend the MAV Evaluation Period, the
MAV Benefit Base can continue to be adjusted upward as described above on each
anniversary during the new MAV Evaluation Period. PLEASE SEE "HOW ARE THE
COMPONENTS OF MARKETLOCK CALCULATED?"


Prior to the end of the initial MAV Evaluation Period, we will inform you of the
terms of the next extension in writing. We will provide you with an extension
election form prior to the end of the initial MAV Evaluation Period. If you
elect to extend the MAV Evaluation Period, you must complete the election form
and return it to us or advise us as to your intent to extend in a method
acceptable to us. Additional MAV Evaluation Periods may be offered at our sole
discretion.


The fee for the feature may change at the time of extension and may be different
than when you initially elected the feature.


If you do not contact us to extend the MAV Evaluation Period, the MAV Benefit
Base will no longer be adjusted on subsequent contract anniversaries. However,
you can continue to take the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount in effect at the
end of the last MAV Evaluation Period, subject to adjustments for withdrawals.
You will continue to pay the fee at the rate that was in effect during the last
MAV Evaluation Period and you will not be permitted to extend the MAV Evaluation
Period in the future.



WHAT IS THE FEE FOR MARKETLOCK?



The annualized fee for MarketLock is calculated as 0.65% of the MAV Benefit Base
for all years in which the feature is in effect. However, if you elect to extend
the MAV Evaluation Period the fee may change at the time of the extension. The
fee will be calculated and deducted quarterly from the portion of your contract
value allocated to the Variable Portfolios, starting on the first quarter
following your contract issue date and ending upon termination of the Benefit.
We will not assess the quarterly fee if you surrender or annuitize your contract
before the end of a contract quarter.


You should keep in mind that an increase in the MAV Benefit Base due to an
adjustment to a higher Anniversary Value or due to subsequent Eligible Purchase
Payments will result in an increase to the dollar amount of the fee.
Alternatively, a decrease in MAV Benefit Base due to withdrawals will decrease
the dollar amount of the fee.


If your MAV Benefit Base falls to zero before the feature has been terminated,
the fee will no longer be deducted. However, if the MAV Benefit Base is adjusted
upwards at a later date because the current anniversary value is greater than
both the current and any previous anniversary values, the calculation and
deduction of the fee will resume.



WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF WITHDRAWALS ON MARKETLOCK?



The Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount, MAV Benefit Base and Minimum Withdrawal
Period may change over time as a result of the timing and amounts of
withdrawals.


If you elect to begin withdrawals prior to your 65th birthday (if jointly owned,
prior to the 65th birthday of the older owner), you will not be eligible to
receive lifetime withdrawals. If you begin withdrawals on or after your 65th
birthday (older owner's 65th birthday if jointly owned) and wish to receive
lifetime withdrawals, you must withdraw no more than the Maximum Annual
Withdrawal Amount which is calculated as 5% of the MAV Benefit Base. If the
amount of withdrawals, at any time, exceeds 5% of the MAV Benefit Base in a
Benefit Year, you will not receive lifetime withdrawals. However, you can
continue to receive withdrawals over the Minimum Withdrawal Period in amounts up
to the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount as described in the MarketLock Summary
Table and under "HOW ARE THE COMPONENTS FOR MARKETLOCK CALCULATED?" above, based
on when you made your first withdrawal and adjusted for withdrawals already
taken.


Total withdrawals in any Benefit Year equal to or less than the Maximum Annual
Withdrawal Amount reduce the MAV Benefit Base by the amount of the withdrawal.
Withdrawals in excess of the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount are considered
Excess Withdrawals. We define Excess Withdrawals as either: 1) any portion of a
withdrawal that causes the total withdrawals in a Benefit Year to exceed the
Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount; or 2) any withdrawal in a Benefit Year taken
after the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount has been withdrawn. Excess
Withdrawals will reduce the MAV Benefit Base by the greater of: (a) the amount
of the Excess Withdrawal; or (b) the relative size of the Excess Withdrawal in
relation to the contract value prior to the Excess


55





Withdrawal. This means that if contract value is less than the MAV Benefit Base,
withdrawals greater than the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount will result in a
proportionately greater reduction of the MAV Benefit Base (as described below),
which will be more than the amount of the withdrawal itself. This will also
reduce your Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount.


The impact of withdrawals and the effect on each component of MarketLock are
further explained below:


MAV BENEFIT BASE: Withdrawals reduce the MAV Benefit Base as follows:


(1) If the withdrawal does not cause total withdrawals in the Benefit Year
to exceed the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount, the MAV Benefit Base
will be reduced by the amount of the withdrawal;


(2) Excess Withdrawals as described above reduce the MAV Benefit Base as
follows:


If total withdrawals during the Benefit Year, including the current
withdrawal, exceed the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount, the MAV Benefit
Base is reduced to the lesser of (a) or (b), where:


(a) is the MAV Benefit Base immediately prior to the withdrawal minus
the amount of the Excess Withdrawal, or;


(b) is the MAV Benefit Base immediately prior to the withdrawal reduced
in the same proportion by which the contract value is reduced by the
amount of the Excess Withdrawal.


MAXIMUM ANNUAL WITHDRAWAL AMOUNT: If the sum of withdrawals in a Benefit Year
does not exceed the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount for that Benefit Year, the
Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount will not change for the next Benefit Year
unless your MAV Benefit Base is adjusted upward (as described above under "HOW
ARE THE COMPONENTS FOR MARKETLOCK CALCULATED?"). If total withdrawals in a
Benefit Year exceed the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount, the Maximum Annual
Withdrawal Amount will be recalculated on the next contract anniversary. The new
Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount will equal the new MAV Benefit Base after any
withdrawals on that contract anniversary, divided by the new Minimum Withdrawal
Period on that contract anniversary. On that contract anniversary, the new
Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount may be lower than your previous Maximum Annual
Withdrawal Amount.


MINIMUM WITHDRAWAL PERIOD: On each contract anniversary, a new Minimum
Withdrawal Period is calculated as shown in the chart below.








-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    THE AMOUNT WITHDRAWN IN A BENEFIT YEAR                   EFFECT ON MINIMUM WITHDRAWAL PERIOD
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Amounts up to the Maximum Annual Withdrawal    New Minimum Withdrawal Period = the MAV Benefit Base (which
  Amount                                         includes a deduction for any previous withdrawal), divided
                                                 by the current Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Amounts in excess of the Maximum Annual        New Minimum Withdrawal Period = the Minimum Withdrawal
  Withdrawal Amount                              Period as of the prior contract anniversary minus one year
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------












THE OPTIONAL LIVING BENEFITS EXAMPLES APPENDIX PROVIDES EXAMPLES OF THE EFFECTS
OF WITHDRAWALS.




WHAT HAPPENS IF MY CONTRACT VALUE IS REDUCED TO ZERO?



If the contract value is zero but the MAV Benefit Base is greater than zero, a
Benefit remains payable under the feature until the MAV Benefit Base is zero.
Further, if you are eligible to take lifetime withdrawals, a Benefit is still
payable even if the contract value and MAV Benefit Base both equal zero.
However, the contract's other benefits, will be terminated once the contract
value equals zero. You may not make subsequent Purchase Payments or transfers
and no death benefit or future annuitization payments are available. Therefore,
during times of unfavorable investment performance, withdrawals taken under the
Benefit may reduce the contract value to zero eliminating any other benefits of
the contract.


Any amounts that we may pay under the feature in excess of your contract value
are subject to the Company's financial strength and claims-paying ability.


56





When the contract value equals zero, to receive any remaining Benefit, you must
select one of the following income options:


1. The current Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount, paid equally on a
quarterly, semi-annual or annual frequency as selected by you until
either: (a) the time at which the Minimum Withdrawal Period equals zero,
or (b) if receiving lifetime withdrawals, the date of death of the older
contract owner; or


2. Lump sum distribution of the discounted present value as determined by
us, of the total remaining guaranteed withdrawals; or


3. Any payment option mutually agreeable between you and us.



WHAT HAPPENS TO MARKETLOCK UPON A SPOUSAL CONTINUATION?



A Continuing Spouse may elect to continue or cancel the feature and its
accompanying fee. The components of the feature will not change as a result of a
spousal continuation. However, lifetime withdrawals or the option to receive
lifetime withdrawals will cease upon death of the older owner. Excluding the
lifetime option, a younger continuing spouse can elect to receive withdrawals in
accordance with the provisions of the MarketLock Summary Table above based on
when the first withdrawal was taken and adjusted for any withdrawals already
taken. In the event of the death of the younger spouse, the older spousal
beneficiary may continue to receive lifetime withdrawals because they are based
on the older owner's life.


If the contract owner elected MarketLock and dies during the MAV Evaluation
Period and the spousal beneficiary continues the Benefit, we will continue to
re-evaluate the MAV Benefit Base on each contract anniversary during the MAV
Evaluation Period, and any spousal continuation contribution is included in the
calculation of the Anniversary Value. PLEASE SEE SPOUSAL CONTINUATION BELOW.
Additionally, the Continuing Spouse may extend the MAV Evaluation Period an
additional period of 10 years provided that (1) the original owner did not
previously extend the MAV Evaluation Period and (2) the Continuing Spouse is age
85 or younger at the time they extend the MAV Evaluation Period. Spousal
continuation contributions are not considered to be Eligible Purchase Payments.
However, spousal continuation contributions are included for the purpose of
determining the MAV Benefit Base during the MAV Evaluation Period.



CAN MY NON-SPOUSAL BENEFICIARY ELECT TO RECEIVE ANY REMAINING WITHDRAWALS UNDER
MARKETLOCK UPON MY DEATH?



Upon the death of the older contract owner, lifetime withdrawals will no longer
be available. If the contract value is greater than zero when the owner dies, a
non-spousal Beneficiary must make a death claim under the contract provisions,
which terminates MarketLock. If the contract value is zero when the owner dies,
meaning that no death benefit is payable, but the Minimum Withdrawal Period
remaining is greater than zero, a non-spousal Beneficiary may elect to continue
receiving any remaining withdrawals under the feature. The other components of
the feature will not change. However, the contract and its other benefits will
be terminated. PLEASE SEE DEATH BENEFITS BELOW.



WHAT HAPPENS TO MARKETLOCK UPON THE LATEST ANNUITY DATE?



If there is remaining contract value and the MAV Benefit Base is greater than
zero on the Latest Annuity Date, you must select one of the following options:


1. Annuitize the contract value under the contract's annuity income
options; or


2. If eligible for lifetime withdrawals, even if the MAV Benefit Base
equals zero, elect to receive the current Maximum Annual Withdrawal
Amount on the Latest Annuity Date, paid equally on a quarterly, semi-
annual or annual frequency as selected by you, until your death; or


3. Elect to receive your remaining MAV Benefit Base on the Latest Annuity
Date paid over the Minimum Withdrawal Period with payments equal to the
current Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount. If withdrawals have not
started, your Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount and Minimum Withdrawal
Period will be calculated based on the applicable Maximum Annual
Withdrawal Percentage; or


4. Any payment option mutually agreeable between you and us.


57





Upon election of any of the above annuity income options, the Accumulation Phase
of your contract ends and the Income Phase begins. Therefore, if electing
annuity income payments for the life of the Annuitant, upon death, no benefit
remains and the contract and its features will terminate.



CAN I ELECT TO CANCEL THE MARKETLOCK FEATURE?



MarketLock may be cancelled by you on the 5th contract anniversary, the 10th
contract anniversary, or any contract anniversary thereafter. Once you elect to
cancel the MarketLock feature, you will no longer be charged a fee and the
guarantees under the benefit are terminated. You may not re-elect or reinstate
MarketLock after cancellation.



ARE THERE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH MARKETLOCK WILL AUTOMATICALLY TERMINATE?



The feature automatically terminates upon the occurrence of one of the
following:


1. The Minimum Withdrawal Period has been reduced to zero unless conditions
for lifetime withdrawals are met; or


2. Annuitization of the contract; or


3. Full surrender of the contract; or


4. A death benefit is paid.


Lifetime withdrawals will not be available in the event of:


1. An ownership change which results in a change of the older owner;* or


2. Withdrawals prior to the 65th birthday of the older owner; or


3. Death of the older owner; or


4. A Spousal Continuation (upon the death of the older owner); or


5. A withdrawal in excess of 5% of MAV Benefit Base.**


*   If a change of ownership occurs from a natural person to a non-natural
entity, the original natural older owner must also be the annuitant after
the ownership change to prevent termination of lifetime withdrawals. A
change of ownership from a non-natural entity to a natural person can only
occur if the new natural owner was the original natural older annuitant in
order to prevent termination of lifetime withdrawals. Any ownership change
is contingent upon prior review and approval by the Company.


**  If a required minimum distribution withdrawal for this contract exceeds the
Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount, the ability to receive lifetime
withdrawals will not be terminated.


MarketLock For Two and Seasons Income Rewards are no longer offered for election
in new contracts. If you elected MarketLock For Two or Seasons Income Rewards,
please see the Statement of Additional Information for details regarding these
benefits.



SEASONS PROMISE




WHAT IS SEASONS PROMISE?



Seasons Promise is an optional guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit. Seasons
Promise offers protection in the event that your contract value declines due to
unfavorable investment performance. On your 10th contract anniversary ("Benefit
Date"), the feature provides a one-time adjustment ("Benefit") so that your
contract will be worth at least the amount of your guaranteed Purchase
Payment(s), adjusted for withdrawals as specified below as of the Benefit Date.



HOW AND WHEN CAN I ELECT SEASONS PROMISE?



You may only elect this feature at the time your contract is issued. You cannot
elect the feature if you are age 81 or older on the contract issue date. Seasons
Promise is not available if you elect any other optional living benefit.


58





Seasons Promise may not be available through the broker-dealer with which your
financial representative is affiliated. Please check with your financial
representative for availability.



CAN SEASONS PROMISE BE CANCELLED?



Generally, this feature and its corresponding charge cannot be cancelled or
terminated prior to the Benefit Date. The feature terminates automatically
following the Benefit Date. In addition, the feature will no longer be available
and no Benefit will be paid if a death benefit is paid or if the contract is
fully surrendered or annuitized before the end Benefit Date.



HOW IS THE BENEFIT CALCULATED FOR SEASONS PROMISE?



The Benefit is a one-time adjustment to your contract in the event that your
contract value on the Benefit Date is less than the Purchase Payments made in
the contract's first 90 days.


The Benefit is equal to your Benefit Base, as defined below, minus your contract
value on the Benefit Date. If the resulting amount is positive, you will receive
a Benefit under the feature. If the resulting amount is negative, you will not
receive a Benefit.


Your Benefit Base is equal to (a) minus (b) where:


(a) is the Purchase Payments received on or after the contract issue date
in the contract's first 90 days, and;


(b) is an adjustment for all withdrawals and applicable fees and charges
made subsequent to the contract issue date, in an amount proportionate
to the amount by which the withdrawal decreased the contract value at
the time of the withdrawal.



WHAT IS THE FEE FOR SEASONS PROMISE?



The annualized fee is calculated as a percentage of contract value minus
Purchase Payments received after the 90th day since the contract issue date. The
fee will be deducted from the portion of your contract value allocated to the
Variable Portfolios each quarter throughout the first 10 full contract years,
beginning at the end of the first contract quarter following the contract issue
date and up to and including on the Benefit Date. Once the feature is
terminated, as discussed above, the charge will no longer be deducted. We will
also not assess the quarterly fee if you surrender or annuitize before the end
of the quarter.

WHAT HAPPENS TO SEASONS PROMISE UPON A SPOUSAL CONTINUATION?



If your spouse chooses to continue this contract upon your death, this feature
cannot be terminated. The Benefit Date will not change as a result of a spousal
continuation. PLEASE SEE SPOUSAL CONTINUATION BELOW.



IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT SEASONS PROMISE



Seasons Promise only guarantees Purchase Payments made in the first 90 days
after issue. If you plan to add subsequent Purchase Payments after the first 90
days, you should know that Seasons Promise would not protect those Purchase
Payments.


Since Seasons Promise may not guarantee a return of all Purchase Payments, it is
important to realize that subsequent Purchase Payments made into the contract
may decrease the value of the Benefit. For example, if near the Benefit Date
your Benefit Base is greater than your contract value, and you then make a
subsequent Purchase Payment that causes your contract value to be larger than
your Benefit Base on your Benefit Date, you will not


59





receive any Benefit even though you have paid for Seasons Promise throughout the
first 10 full contract years. You should discuss making subsequent Purchase
Payments with your financial representative as such activity may reduce or
eliminate the value of the Benefit.


We will allocate the Benefit, if any, on the Benefit Date to the Cash Management
Variable Portfolio. Any Benefit paid is not considered a Purchase Payment for
purposes of calculating other benefits or features of your contract. Other
contract benefits based on earnings, will continue to define earnings as the
difference between contract value and Purchase Payments adjusted for
withdrawals. For information about how the Benefit is treated for income tax
purposes, you should consult a qualified tax advisor for information concerning
your particular circumstances.



WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO MODIFY, SUSPEND OR TERMINATE SEASONS PROMISE AT ANY TIME
FOR PROSPECTIVELY ISSUED CONTRACTS.




DEATH BENEFITS





If you die during the Accumulation Phase of your contract, we pay a death
benefit to your Beneficiary. You must select a death benefit option at the time
you purchase your contract. Once selected, you cannot change your death benefit
option. You should discuss the available options with your financial
representative to determine which option is best for you.


We do not pay a death benefit if you die after you begin the Income Phase; your
Beneficiary would receive any remaining guaranteed annuity income payments in
accordance with the annuity income option you selected. PLEASE SEE ANNUITY
INCOME OPTIONS BELOW.


If your contract value is reduced to zero as a result of receiving guaranteed
withdrawals under a living benefit feature, no death benefit will be paid.

PLEASE SEE MARKETLOCK INCOME PLUS, MARKETLOCK FOR LIFE PLUS AND MARKETLOCK
ABOVE.


You designate your Beneficiary, who will receive any death benefit payments. You
may change the Beneficiary at any time, unless you previously made an
irrevocable Beneficiary designation. If your contract is jointly owned, the
surviving joint owner is the sole beneficiary.


We calculate and pay the death benefit when we receive all required paperwork
and satisfactory proof of death at the Annuity Service Center. All death benefit
calculations discussed below are made as of the day a death benefit request is
received by us in Good Order, at the Annuity Service Center (including
satisfactory proof of death) if the request is received before Market Close. If
the death benefit request is received after Market Close, the death benefit
calculations will be as of the next business day. We consider the following
satisfactory proof of death:


1. a certified copy of the death certificate; or


2. a certified copy of a decree of a court of competent jurisdiction as to
the finding of death; or


3. a written statement by a medical doctor who attended the deceased at the
time of death; or


4. any other proof satisfactory to us.


If a Beneficiary does not elect a settlement option, within 60 days of our
receipt of all required paperwork and satisfactory proof of death, we pay a lump
sum death benefit to the Beneficiary.


The death benefit must be paid within 5 years of the date of death unless the
Beneficiary elects to have it payable in the form of an annuity income option.
If the Beneficiary elects an annuity income option, it must be paid over the
Beneficiary's lifetime or for a period not extending beyond the Beneficiary's
life expectancy. Payments must begin within one year of your death.


If the Beneficiary is the spouse of a deceased owner, he or she can elect to
continue the contract at the then current value. PLEASE SEE SPOUSAL CONTINUATION
BELOW.


A Beneficiary may also elect to continue the contract and take the death benefit
amount in a series of payments based upon the Beneficiary's life expectancy
under the Extended Legacy program, if available, described below, subject to the
applicable Internal Revenue Code distribution requirements. Payments must begin
no later than the first anniversary of death for Non-Qualified contracts or
December 31st of the year following the year of death for


60





IRAs. Your Beneficiary cannot participate in the Extended Legacy program if
he/she has already elected another settlement option. Beneficiaries who do not
begin taking payments within these specified time periods will not be eligible
to elect an annuity income option or participate in the Extended Legacy program.



EXTENDED LEGACY PROGRAM AND BENEFICIARY CONTINUATION OPTIONS



The Extended Legacy program, if available, can allow a Beneficiary to take the
death benefit amount in the form of annuity income payments over a longer period
of time with the flexibility to withdraw more than the IRS required minimum
distribution. The contract continues in the original owner's name for the
benefit of the Beneficiary. The Extended Legacy program allows the Beneficiary
to take withdrawals in the form of a series of payments similar to the required
minimum distributions under an IRA. Generally, IRS required minimum
distributions must be made at least annually over a period not to exceed the
Beneficiary's life expectancy as determined in the calendar year after the
owner's death.


A Beneficiary may withdraw all or a portion of the contract value at any time,
name their own beneficiary to receive any remaining unpaid amount in the
contract in the event of their death and make transfers among investment
options. Participation in the program may impact certain features of the
contract that are detailed in the Death Claim Form. Please see your financial
representative for additional information.


If the Beneficiary elects to participate in this program and the contract value
is less than the death benefit amount as of the date we receive satisfactory
proof of death and all required paperwork, we will increase the contract value
by the amount which the death benefit exceeds contract value.



OTHER BENEFICIARY CONTINUATION OPTIONS



Alternatively to the Extended Legacy program, the Beneficiary may also elect to
receive the death benefit under a 5-year settlement option. The Beneficiary may
take withdrawals as desired, but the entire contract value must be distributed
by the fifth anniversary of death for Non-Qualified contracts or by December
31st of the year containing the fifth anniversary of death for IRAs. For IRAs,
the 5-year payout option is not available if the date of death is after the
required beginning date for distributions (April 1 of the year following the
year the original owner reaches the age of 70 1/2).


Please consult a qualified advisor regarding tax implications of these options
and your particular circumstances.



DEATH BENEFIT DEFINED TERMS



The term "Net Purchase Payment" is used frequently in describing the death
benefit payable. Net Purchase Payment is an on-going calculation. It does not
represent a contract value.


We define Net Purchase Payments as Purchase Payments less an adjustment for each
withdrawal, including fees and charges applicable to that withdrawal. If you
have not taken any withdrawals from your contract, Net Purchase Payments equal
total Purchase Payments into your contract. To calculate the adjustment amount
for the first withdrawal made under the contract, we determine the percentage by
which the withdrawal reduced the contract value. For example, a $10,000
withdrawal from a $100,000 contract is a 10% reduction in value. This percentage
is calculated by dividing the amount of each withdrawal by the contract value
immediately before taking the withdrawal. The resulting percentage is then
multiplied by the amount of the total Purchase Payments and subtracted from the
amount of the total Purchase Payments on deposit at the time of the withdrawal.
The resulting amount is the initial Net Purchase Payment.


To arrive at the Net Purchase Payment calculation for subsequent withdrawals, we
determine the percentage by which the contract value is reduced, by taking the
amount of the withdrawal in relation to the contract value immediately before
the withdrawal. We then multiply the Net Purchase Payment calculation as
determined prior to the withdrawal, by this percentage. We subtract that result
from the Net Purchase Payment calculation as determined prior to the withdrawal
to arrive at all subsequent Net Purchase Payment calculations.


The term "withdrawals" as used in describing the death benefit options is
defined as withdrawals and the fees and charges applicable to those withdrawals.


THE COMPANY DOES NOT ACCEPT PURCHASE PAYMENTS FROM ANYONE AGE 86 OR OLDER.
THEREFORE, THE DEATH BENEFIT CALCULATIONS ASSUME THAT NO PURCHASE PAYMENTS ARE
RECEIVED ON OR AFTER YOUR 86TH BIRTHDAY.


61






DEATH BENEFIT OPTIONS



This contract provides two death benefit options: the Standard Death Benefit
which is automatically included in your contract for no additional fee, and an
optional enhanced death benefit, which you may elect for an additional fee.



STANDARD DEATH BENEFIT



If the contract is issued prior to your 83rd birthday, the standard death
benefit on your contract is the greater of:


1. Contract value; or


2. Net Purchase Payments.


If the contract is issued on or after your 83rd birthday but prior to your 86th
birthday, the standard death benefit is the greater of:


1. Contract value; or


2. The lesser of:


a. Net Purchase Payments; or


b. 125% of Contract Value.



OPTIONAL MAXIMUM ANNIVERSARY VALUE OPTION



You may elect the Maximum Anniversary Value option described below which can
provide greater protection for your beneficiaries. You must elect the Maximum
Anniversary Value option at the time you purchase your contract and once elected
it cannot be terminated by you. The annualized fee for the Maximum Anniversary
Value option is 0.20% of the average daily net asset value allocated to the
Variable Portfolios.


The death benefit is the greatest of:


1. Contract value; or


2. Net Purchase Payments; or


3. Maximum anniversary value on any contract anniversary prior to your 83rd
birthday. The anniversary values equal the contract value on a contract
anniversary, reduced for withdrawals since that contract anniversary in
the same proportion that the contract value was reduced on the date of
such withdrawal, and adjusted for any Purchase Payments since that
anniversary.


The Maximum Anniversary Value option can only be elected prior to your 83rd
birthday.


For contracts in which the aggregate of all Purchase Payments in contracts
issued by AIG SunAmerica Life and/or First SunAmerica Life to the same
owner/annuitant are in excess of $1,500,000, we reserve the right to limit the
death benefit amount that is in excess of contract value at the time we receive
all paperwork and satisfactory proof of death. Any limit on the maximum death
benefit payable would be mutually agreed upon in writing by you and the Company
prior to purchasing the contract.



SPOUSAL CONTINUATION



The Continuing Spouse may elect to continue the contract after your death.
Generally, the contract, its benefits and elected features, if any, remain the
same. The Continuing Spouse is subject to the same fees, charges and expenses
applicable to the original owner of the contract. A spousal continuation can
only take place once, upon the death of the original owner of the contract. If
the Continuing Spouse terminates any optional death benefit or dies after the
Latest Annuity Date, no optional death benefit will be payable to the Continuing
Spouse's Beneficiary.


To the extent that the Continuing Spouse invests in the Variable Portfolios,
they will be subject to investment risk as was the original owner.


62





Upon a spousal continuation, we will contribute to the contract value an amount
by which the death benefit that would have been paid to the Beneficiary upon the
death of the original owner, exceeds the contract value ("Continuation
Contribution"), if any. We calculate the Continuation Contribution as of the
date of the original owner's death. We will add the Continuation Contribution as
of the date we receive both the Continuing Spouse's written request to continue
the contract and satisfactory proof of death of the original owner
("Continuation Date") at the Annuity Service Center. The Continuation
Contribution is not considered a Purchase Payment for the purposes of any other
calculations except the death benefit following the Continuing Spouse's death.
Generally, the age of the Continuing Spouse on the Continuation Date and on the
date of the Continuing Spouse's death will be used in determining any future
death benefits under the contract. PLEASE SEE THE SPOUSAL CONTINUATION APPENDIX
FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE DEATH BENEFIT CALCULATIONS AFTER A SPOUSAL CONTINUATION.


WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO MODIFY, SUSPEND OR TERMINATE THE SPOUSAL CONTINUATION
PROVISION (IN ITS ENTIRETY OR ANY COMPONENT) AT ANY TIME FOR PROSPECTIVELY
ISSUED CONTRACTS.



PLEASE SEE OPTIONAL LIVING BENEFITS AND DEATH BENEFITS ABOVE FOR INFORMATION ON
THE EFFECT OF SPOUSAL CONTINUATION ON THOSE BENEFITS.






EXPENSES





There are fees and expenses associated with your contract which reduce your
investment return. We will not increase the contract fees, such as Separate
Account or withdrawal charges for the life of your contract. Underlying Fund
fees may increase or decrease.


We intend to profit from the sale of the contracts. Our profit may be derived as
a result of a variety of pricing factors including but not limited to the fees
and charges assessed under the contract and/or amounts we may receive from an
Underlying Fund, its investment adviser and/or subadvisers (or affiliates
thereof). PLEASE SEE PAYMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH DISTRIBUTION OF THE CONTRACT
BELOW. The fees, charges, amounts received from the Underlying Funds (or
affiliates thereof) and any resulting profit may be used for any corporate
purpose including supporting marketing, distribution and/or administration of
the Contract and, in its role as an intermediary, the Underlying Funds.



SEPARATE ACCOUNT EXPENSES



The annualized Separate Account expense is 1.55% of the average daily ending net
asset value allocated to the Variable Portfolios. This charge compensates the
Company for the mortality and expense risk and the costs of contract
distribution assumed by the Company.


Generally, the mortality risks assumed by the Company arise from its contractual
obligations to make annuity income payments after the Annuity Date and to
provide a death benefit. The expense risk assumed by the Company is that the
costs of administering the contracts and the Separate Account will exceed the
amount received from the fees and charges assessed under the contract.


If these charges do not cover all of our expenses, we will pay the difference.
Likewise, if these charges exceed our expenses, we will keep the difference. The
mortality and expense risk charge is expected to result in a profit. Profit may
be used for any legitimate cost or expense including supporting distribution.

PLEASE SEE PAYMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH DISTRIBUTION OF THE CONTRACT BELOW.



WITHDRAWAL CHARGES



The contract provides a free withdrawal amount every contract year. PLEASE SEE
ACCESS TO YOUR MONEY ABOVE. You may incur a withdrawal charge if you take a
withdrawal in excess of the free withdrawal amount and/or if you fully surrender
your contract.


We apply a withdrawal charge against each Purchase Payment you contribute to the
contract. After a Purchase Payment has been in the contract for 4 complete
years, a withdrawal charge no longer applies to that Purchase


63





Payment. The withdrawal charge percentage declines over time for each Purchase
Payment in the contract. The withdrawal charge schedule is as follows:








YEAR SINCE RECEIPT OF PURCHASE PAYMENT    1    2    3    4   5+
--------------------------------------   ---  ---  ---  ---  ---
Withdrawal Charge..........              7%   6%   6%   5%   0%








When calculating the withdrawal charge, we treat withdrawals as coming first
from the Purchase Payments that have been in your contract the longest. However,
for tax purposes, your withdrawals are considered as coming from earnings first,
then Purchase Payments. PLEASE SEE ACCESS TO YOUR MONEY ABOVE.


Whenever possible, we deduct the withdrawal charge from the money remaining in
your contract. If you fully surrender your contract value, we deduct any
applicable withdrawal charges from the amount surrendered.


We will not assess a withdrawal charge when we pay a death benefit, contract
fees and/or when you switch to the Income Phase.


Withdrawals made prior to age 59 1/2 may result in tax penalties. SEE TAXES


BELOW.







UNDERLYING FUND EXPENSES




INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEES



The Separate Account purchases shares of the Variable Portfolios. The
Accumulation Unit value for each Variable Portfolio reflects the investment
management fees and other expenses of the corresponding Underlying Funds. These
fees may vary. They are not fixed or specified in your annuity contract, rather
the Variable Portfolios are governed by their own boards of trustees.



12b-1 FEES



Underlying Fund shares are subject to a fee of 0.25% imposed under a servicing
plan adopted by Seasons Series Trust, SunAmerica Series Trust and T. Rowe Price
Equity Series, Inc. pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the Investment Company Act of
1940. The Seasons Managed Allocation Portfolios do not directly impose a 12b-1
fee, but do invest in certain Select and Focused Portfolios, and thus,
indirectly bear the expenses of those Underlying Funds including the 12b-1 fees.



FOR MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ON THESE UNDERLYING FUND FEES, REFER TO THE TRUST
PROSPECTUSES.




CONTRACT MAINTENANCE FEE



During the Accumulation Phase, we deduct a contract maintenance fee of $35 from
your contract once per year on your contract anniversary. This charge
compensates us for the cost of administering your contract. We will deduct the
contract maintenance fee on a pro-rata basis from the portion of your contract
value allocated to the Variable Portfolios on your contract anniversary. The fee
is deducted proportionately from your contract value by redeeming the number of
Accumulation Units invested in the Variable Portfolios which equal the amount of
the fee. If you withdraw your entire contract value, we will deduct the contract
maintenance fee from that withdrawal.


If your contract value is $50,000 or more on your contract anniversary date, we
currently waive this fee. This waiver is subject to change without notice.



TRANSFER FEE



We permit 15 free transfers between investment options each contract year. We
charge you $25 for each additional transfer that contract year.



OPTIONAL MARKETLOCK INCOME PLUS FEE



The annualized MarketLock Income Plus fee will be assessed as a percentage of
the Income Base for all years in which the feature is in effect. The fee for
MarketLock Income Plus depends on whether you elect to cover one life or two
lives. The fee will be calculated and deducted quarterly from your contract
value, starting on the first quarter following the Effective Date and ending
upon termination of the feature. You will be notified of any change in fee prior
to the First, Second and Subsequent Extensions. We guarantee that the current
fee reflected below will not increase by more than 0.25% at the time of First
Extension.


The fee is deducted from the portion of your contract value allocated to the
Variable Portfolios starting on the first quarter following the contract issue
date and ending upon the termination of the feature. The fee is deducted


64





proportionately from your contract value by redeeming the number of Accumulation
Units invested in the Variable Portfolios which equal the amount of the fee. If
your contract value falls to zero before the feature has been terminated, the
fee will no longer be assessed. We will not assess the quarterly fee if you
annuitize your contract or if a death benefit is paid before the end of a
contract quarter. If the feature is still in effect and you surrender your
contract, we will assess a pro-rata fee if you surrender your contract before
the end of a contract quarter. The pro-rata fee is calculated by multiplying the
full quarterly fee by the number of days between the date the fee was last
assessed and the date of surrender divided by the number of days in that
contract quarter. The fee is as follows:








----------------------------------------------------------------------
ALL YEARS IN WHICH THE FEATURE IS IN EFFECT       ANNUALIZED FEE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 For One Covered Person                        0.95% of Income Base
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 For Two Covered Persons                       1.20% of Income Base
----------------------------------------------------------------------









OPTIONAL MARKETLOCK FOR LIFE PLUS FEE



The annualized MarketLock For Life Plus fee will be assessed as a percentage of
the Income Base for all years in which the feature is in effect. The fee for
MarketLock For Life Plus depends on whether you elect to cover one life or two
lives and whether you elect +6% Option or +7% Option. The fee will be calculated
and deducted quarterly from your contract value, starting on the first quarter
following the Effective Date and ending upon termination of the Benefit. The fee
of the feature may change at the time of extension and may be different than
when you initially elected the feature.


The fee is deducted proportionately from the portion of your contract value
allocated to the Variable Portfolios starting on the first quarter following the
contract issue date and ending upon the termination of the feature. The fee is
deducted proportionately from your contract value by redeeming the number of
Accumulation Units invested in the Variable Portfolios which equal the amount of
the fee. If your contract value falls to zero before the feature has been
terminated, the fee will no longer be assessed. We will not assess the quarterly
fee if you annuitize your contract before the end of a contract quarter. If the
feature is still in effect and you surrender your contract, we will assess a
pro-rata fee if you surrender your contract before the end of a contract
quarter. The pro-rata fee is calculated by multiplying the full quarterly fee by
the number of days between the date the fee was last assessed and the date of
surrender divided by the number of days in a contract quarter. The fee is as
follows:








-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MARKETLOCK FOR LIFE PLUS OPTION NUMBER OF COVERED PERSONS      ANNUALIZED FEE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 +6% Option                      For One Covered Person     0.65% of Income Base
                                ---------------------------------------------------
                                 For Two Covered Persons    0.90% of Income Base
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 +7% Option                      For One Covered Person     0.75% of Income Base
                                ---------------------------------------------------
                                 For Two Covered Persons    1.00% of Income Base
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------









OPTIONAL MARKETLOCK FEE



The annualized MarketLock fee will be assessed as a percentage of the MAV
Benefit Base. The fee will be deducted quarterly from the portion of your
contract value allocated to the Variable Portfolios starting on the first
quarter following the contract issue date and ending upon the termination of the
feature. The fee is deducted proportionately from your contract value by
redeeming the number of Accumulation Units invested in the Variable Portfolios
which equal the amount of the fee. If your contract value and/or MAV Benefit
Base falls to zero before the feature has been terminated, the fee will no
longer be assessed. However, if the MAV Benefit Base is adjusted upwards at a
later date because the current anniversary value is greater than both the
current and any previous anniversary values, the calculation and deduction of
the fee will resume. We will not assess the quarterly fee if you surrender or
annuitize before the end of a quarter. The fee is as follows:








-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                     ANNUALIZED FEE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  All years in which the feature is in
                 effect                         0.65% of MAV Benefit Base
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------








65






OPTIONAL SEASONS PROMISE FEE



The annualized Seasons Promise fee is calculated as a percentage of the portion
of your contract value allocated to the Variable Portfolios minus Purchase
Payments received after the 90th day since contract issue date. If you elect the
feature, the fee is deducted at the end of the first contract quarter and
quarterly thereafter from your contract value. The fee is deducted
proportionately from your contract value by redeeming the number of Accumulation
Units invested in the Variable Portfolios which equal the amount of the fee. We
will not assess the quarterly fee if you surrender or annuitize before the end
of a quarter. The fee is as follows:








---------------------------------------------------------
       CONTRACT YEAR                ANNUALIZED FEE
---------------------------------------------------------
            0-5                         0.65%
---------------------------------------------------------
            6-10                        0.45%
---------------------------------------------------------
            11+                          none
---------------------------------------------------------









OPTIONAL MAXIMUM ANNIVERSARY VALUE DEATH BENEFIT FEE



The annualized fee for the optional Maximum Anniversary Value death benefit is
0.20% of the average daily ending net asset value allocated to the Variable
Portfolio(s).



INCOME TAXES



We do not currently deduct income taxes from your contract. We reserve the right
to do so in the future.






REDUCTION OR ELIMINATION OF FEES, EXPENSES AND ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS CREDITED



Sometimes sales of contracts to groups of similarly situated individuals may
lower our fees and expenses. We reserve the right to reduce or waive certain
fees and expenses when this type of sale occurs. In addition, we may also credit
additional amounts to contracts sold to such groups. We determine which groups
are eligible for this treatment. Some of the criteria we evaluate to make a
determination are size of the group; amount of expected Purchase Payments;
relationship existing between us and the prospective purchaser; length of time a
group of contracts is expected to remain active; purpose of the purchase and
whether that purpose increases the likelihood that our expenses will be reduced;
and/or any other factors that we believe indicate that fees and expenses may be
reduced.


The Company may make such a determination regarding sales to its employees, it
affiliates' employees and employees of currently contracted broker-dealers; its
registered representatives; and immediate family members of all of those
described.



WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO MODIFY, SUSPEND OR TERMINATE ANY SUCH DETERMINATION OR
THE TREATMENT APPLIED TO A PARTICULAR GROUP AT ANY TIME.




ANNUITY INCOME OPTIONS






ANNUITY DATE



During the Income Phase, we use the money accumulated in your contract to make
regular annuity income payments to you. You may begin the Income Phase any time
13 or more months after contract issue. You must provide us with a written
request of the date you want annuity income payments to begin and send your
request to the Annuity Service Center. Your Annuity Date is the first day of the
month you select annuity income payments to begin ("Annuity Date"). You may
change your Annuity Date by sending a written request to the Annuity Service
Center, so long as you do so at least seven days before the annuity income
payments are scheduled to begin. Except as indicated under Option 5 below, once
you begin receiving annuity income payments, you cannot otherwise access your
money through a withdrawal or surrender.


We do not pay a death benefit to your Beneficiary once you begin the Income


Phase. PLEASE SEE DEATH BENEFITS ABOVE.



66





If your contract value is reduced to zero as a result of receiving guaranteed
withdrawals under a living benefit feature, no annuity income payments will be
available. PLEASE SEE MARKETLOCK INCOME PLUS, MARKETLOCK FOR LIFE PLUS AND
MARKETLOCK ABOVE.


Annuity income payments must begin on or before your Latest Annuity Date. If you
do not choose an Annuity Date, your annuity income payments will begin on the
Latest Annuity Date.


If the Annuity Date is past your 85th birthday, your contract could lose its
status as an annuity under Federal tax laws. This may cause you to incur adverse
tax consequences. In addition, most Qualified contracts require you to take
minimum distributions after you reach age 70 1/2. PLEASE SEE TAXES BELOW.



ANNUITY INCOME OPTIONS



You must contact us to select an annuity income option by sending a written
request to our Annuity Service Center. Once you begin receiving annuity income
payments, you cannot change your income option before beginning the Income
Phase. If you elect to receive annuity income payments but do not select an
income option, your annuity income payments shall be in accordance with Option 4
for a period of 10 years; for annuity income payments based on joint lives, the
default is Option 3 for a period of 10 years.


We base our calculation of annuity income payments on the life expectancy of the
Annuitant and the annuity rates set forth in your contract. As the contract
owner, you may change the Annuitant at any time prior to the Annuity Date. You
must notify us if the Annuitant dies before the Annuity Date and designate a new
Annuitant. If we do not receive your notification no annuity income option based
on the life of the Annuitant may be elected.



ANNUITY INCOME OPTION 1 - LIFE INCOME ANNUITY



This option provides annuity income payments for the life of the Annuitant.
Annuity income payments end when the Annuitant dies.



ANNUITY INCOME OPTION 2 - JOINT AND SURVIVOR LIFE INCOME ANNUITY



This option provides annuity income payments for the life of the Annuitant and
for the life of another designated person. Upon the death of either person, we
will continue to make annuity income payments during the lifetime of the
survivor. Annuity income payments end when the survivor dies.



ANNUITY INCOME OPTION 3 - JOINT AND SURVIVOR LIFE INCOME ANNUITY WITH 10 YEARS
GUARANTEED



This option is similar to Option 2 above, with an additional guarantee of
payments for at least 10 years, depending on the period chosen. If the Annuitant
and the survivor die before all of the guaranteed annuity income payments have
been made, the remaining annuity income payments are made to the Beneficiary
under your contract.



ANNUITY INCOME OPTION 4 - LIFE INCOME ANNUITY WITH 10 OR 20 YEARS GUARANTEED



This option is similar to Option 1 above with an additional guarantee of
payments for at least 10 or 20 years, depending on the period chosen. If the
Annuitant dies before all guaranteed annuity income payments are made, the
remaining annuity income payments are made to the Beneficiary under your
contract.



ANNUITY INCOME OPTION 5 - INCOME FOR A SPECIFIED PERIOD



This option provides annuity income payments for a guaranteed period ranging
from 5 to 30 years, depending on the period chosen. If the Annuitant dies before
all the guaranteed annuity income payments are made, the remaining annuity
income payments are made to the Beneficiary under your contract. Additionally,
if variable annuity income payments are elected under this option, you (or the
Beneficiary under the contract if the Annuitant dies prior to all guaranteed
annuity income payments being made) may redeem any remaining guaranteed variable
annuity income payments after the Annuity Date. The amount available upon such
redemption would be the discounted present value of any remaining guaranteed
variable annuity income payments.


If provided for in your contract, any applicable withdrawal charge will be
deducted from the discounted value as if you fully surrendered your contract.


67





The value of an Annuity Unit, regardless of the option chosen, takes into
account separate account charges which includes a mortality and expense risk
charge. Since Option 5 does not contain an element of mortality risk, no benefit
is derived from this charge.


Please see the Statement of Additional Information for a more detailed
discussion of the annuity income options.



FIXED OR VARIABLE ANNUITY INCOME PAYMENTS



You can choose annuity income payments that are fixed, variable or both. Unless
otherwise elected, if at the date when annuity income payments begin you are
invested in the Variable Portfolios only, your annuity income payments will be
variable and if your money is only in Fixed Accounts at that time, your annuity
income payments will be fixed in amount. Further, if you are invested in both
Fixed Accounts and Variable Portfolios when annuity income payments begin, your
payments will be fixed and variable, unless otherwise elected. If annuity income
payments are fixed, the Company guarantees the amount of each payment. If the
annuity income payments are variable, the amount is not guaranteed.



ANNUITY INCOME PAYMENTS



We make annuity income payments on a monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual
basis. You instruct us to send you a check or to have the payments directly
deposited into your bank account. If state law allows, we distribute annuities
with a contract value of $5,000 or less in a lump sum. Also, if state law allows
and the selected annuity income option results in annuity income payments of
less than $50 per payment, we may decrease the frequency of payments.


If you are invested in the Variable Portfolios after the Annuity Date, your
annuity income payments vary depending on the following:


- for life income options, your age when annuity income payments begin; and


- the contract value attributable to the Variable Portfolios on the Annuity
Date; and


- the 3.5% assumed investment rate used in the annuity table for the
contract; and


- the performance of the Variable Portfolios in which you are invested
during the time you receive annuity income payments.


If you are invested in both the Fixed Accounts and the Variable Portfolios after
the Annuity Date, the allocation of funds between the Fixed Accounts and
Variable Portfolios also impacts the amount of your annuity income payments.


The value of variable annuity income payments, if elected, is based on an
assumed investment rate ("AIR") of 3.5% compounded annually. Variable annuity
income payments generally increase or decrease from one annuity income payment
date to the next based upon the performance of the applicable Variable
Portfolios. If the performance of the Variable Portfolios selected is equal to
the AIR, the annuity income payments will remain constant. If performance of
Variable Portfolios is greater than the AIR, the annuity income payments will
increase and if it is less than the AIR, the annuity income payments will
decline.



TRANSFERS DURING THE INCOME PHASE



During the Income Phase, one transfer per month is permitted between the
Variable Portfolios. No other transfers are allowed during the Income Phase.
Transfers will be effected for the last NYSE business day of the month in which
we receive your request for the transfer.



DEFERMENT OF PAYMENTS



We may defer making fixed payments for up to six months, or less if required by
law. Interest is credited to you during the deferral period. PLEASE SEE ACCESS
TO YOUR MONEY ABOVE FOR A DISCUSSION OF WHEN PAYMENTS FROM A VARIABLE PORTFOLIO
MAY BE SUSPENDED OR POSTPONED.

TAXES





NOTE: THE BASIC SUMMARY BELOW ADDRESSES BROAD FEDERAL TAXATION MATTERS, AND
GENERALLY DOES NOT ADDRESS STATE TAXATION ISSUES OR QUESTIONS. IT IS NOT TAX
ADVICE. WE CAUTION YOU TO SEEK COMPETENT TAX ADVICE ABOUT YOUR OWN
CIRCUMSTANCES. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THE TAX STATUS OF YOUR ANNUITY. TAX LAWS
CONSTANTLY CHANGE; THEREFORE, WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT THE INFORMATION CONTAINED
HEREIN IS COMPLETE AND/OR ACCURATE. WE HAVE INCLUDED AN ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION
REGARDING TAXES IN THE STATEMENT OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.



ANNUITY CONTRACTS IN GENERAL



The Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") provides for special rules regarding the tax
treatment of annuity contracts. Generally, taxes on the earnings in your annuity
contract are deferred until you take the money out. Qualified retirement
investments that satisfy specific tax and ERISA requirements automatically
provide tax deferral regardless of whether the underlying contract is an
annuity, a trust, or a custodial account. Different rules apply depending on how
you take the money out and whether your contract is Qualified or Non-Qualified.


If you do not purchase your contract under a pension plan, a specially sponsored
employer program or an Individual Retirement Account ("IRA"), your contract is
referred to as a Non-Qualified contract. A Non-Qualified contract receives
different tax treatment than a Qualified contract. In general, your cost in a
Non-Qualified contract is equal to the Purchase Payments you put into the
contract. You have already been taxed on the cost basis in your contract.


If you purchase your contract under a pension plan, a specially sponsored
employer program, as an individual retirement annuity, or under an IRA, your
contract is referred to as a Qualified contract. Examples of qualified plans or
arrangements are: Individual Retirement Annuities and IRAs, Roth IRAs,
Tax-Sheltered Annuities (also referred to as 403(b) annuities or 403(b)
contracts), plans of self-employed individuals (often referred to as H.R. 10
Plans or Keogh Plans), pension and profit sharing plans including 401(k) plans,
and governmental 457(b) plans. Typically, for employer plans and tax-deductible
IRA contributions, you have not paid any tax on the Purchase Payments used to
buy your contract and therefore, you have no cost basis in your contract.
However, you normally will have a cost basis in a Roth IRA, a Roth 403(b) or a
Roth 401(k) account, and you may have cost basis in a traditional IRA or in
another Qualified contract.



AGGREGATION OF CONTRACTS



All Non-Qualified contracts that are issued by us (or our affiliates) to you
during any calendar year will be treated as one annuity contract for purposes of
determining the taxable amount of any distribution.






TAX TREATMENT OF DISTRIBUTIONS - NON-QUALIFIED CONTRACTS



If you make partial or total withdrawals from a Non-Qualified contract, the IRC
generally treats such withdrawals as coming first from taxable earnings and then
coming from your Purchase Payments. Purchase Payments made prior to August 14,
1982, however, are an important exception to this general rule, and for tax
purposes generally are treated as being distributed first, before either the
earnings on those contributions, or other Purchase Payments and earnings in the
contract. If you annuitize your contract, a portion of each annuity income
payment will be considered, for tax purposes, to be a return of a portion of
your Purchase Payment, generally until you have received all of your Purchase
Payment. Any portion of each annuity income payment that is considered a return
of your Purchase Payment will not be taxed. Additionally, the taxable portion of
any withdrawals, whether annuitized or other withdrawals, generally is subject
to applicable state and/or local income taxes, and may be subject to an
additional 10% penalty tax unless withdrawn in conjunction with the following
circumstances:


- after attaining age 59 1/2;


- when paid to your Beneficiary after you die;


- after you become disabled (as defined in the IRC);


- when paid as a part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments
(not less frequently than annually) made for your life (or life
expectancy) or the joint lives (or joint expectancies) of you and your
designated Beneficiary for a period of 5 years or attainment of age
59 1/2, whichever is later;


69





- under an immediate annuity contract;


- which are attributable to Purchase Payments made prior to August 14,
1982.






TAX TREATMENT OF DISTRIBUTIONS - QUALIFIED CONTRACTS (INCLUDING GOVERNMENTAL


457(b) ELIGIBLE DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS)


Generally, you have not paid any taxes on the Purchase Payments used to buy a
Qualified contract. As a result, most amounts withdrawn from the contract or
received as annuity income payments will be taxable income. Exceptions to this
general rule include withdrawals attributable to after-tax Roth IRA, Roth

403(b), and Roth 401(k) contributions. Withdrawals from Roth IRAs are generally
treated for federal tax purposes as coming first from the Roth contributions
that have already been taxed, and as entirely tax free. Withdrawals from Roth
403(b) and Roth 401(k) accounts, and withdrawals generally from Qualified
contracts, are treated generally as coming pro-rata from amounts that already
have been taxed and amounts that are taxed upon withdrawal. Withdrawals from
Roth IRA, Roth 403(b) and Roth 401(k) accounts which satisfy certain
qualification requirements, including at least five years in a Roth account
under the plan or IRA and either attainment of age 59 1/2, death or disability
(or, if an IRA for the purchase of a first home), will not be subject to federal
income taxation.


The taxable portion of any withdrawal or income payment from a Qualified
contract will be subject to an additional 10% penalty tax, under the IRC, except
in the following circumstances:


- after attainment of age 59 1/2;


- when paid to your Beneficiary after you die;


- after you become disabled (as defined in the IRC);


- as a part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less
frequently than annually) made for your life (or life expectancy) or the
joint lives (or joint expectancies) of you and your designated
Beneficiary for a period of 5 years or attainment of age 59 1/2,
whichever is later;


- payments to employees after separation from service after attainment of
age 55 (does not apply to IRAs);


- dividends paid with respect to stock of a corporation described in IRC

Section 404(k);


- for payment of medical expenses to the extent such withdrawals do not
exceed limitations set by the IRC for deductible amounts paid during the
taxable year for medical care;


- payments to alternate payees pursuant to a qualified domestic relations
order (does not apply to IRAs);


- for payment of health insurance if you are unemployed and meet certain
requirements;


- distributions from IRAs for higher education expenses;


- distributions from IRAs for first home purchases;


- amounts distributed from a Code Section 457(b) plan other than to the
extent such amounts in a governmental Code Section 457(b) plan represent
rollovers from an IRA or employer-sponsored plan to which the 10% penalty
would otherwise apply and which are treated as distributed from a
Qualified plan for purposes of the premature distribution penalty.


The IRC limits the withdrawal of an employee's voluntary Purchase Payments from
a Tax-Sheltered Annuity (TSA). Withdrawals can only be made when an Owner: (1)
reaches age 59 1/2; (2) severs employment with the employer; (3) dies; (4)
becomes disabled (as defined in the IRC); or (5) experiences a financial
hardship (as defined in the IRC). In the case of hardship, the owner can only
withdraw Purchase Payments. Additional plan limitations may also apply. Amounts
held in a TSA annuity contract as of December 31, 1988 are not subject to these
restrictions.


Qualifying transfers of amounts from one TSA contract to another TSA contract
under section 403(b) or to a custodial account under section 403(b)(7), and
qualifying transfers to a state defined benefit plan to purchase service
credits, are not considered distributions, and thus are not subject to these
withdrawal limitations. If amounts are transferred from a custodial account
described in Code section 403(b)(7) to this contract the transferred amount will
retain the custodial account withdrawal restrictions.


70





Transfer among 403(b) annuities and/or 403(b)(7) custodial accounts generally
are subject to rules set out in the Code, regulations, IRS pronouncements, and
other applicable legal authorities.


On July 26, 2007, the Department of the Treasury published final 403(b)
regulations that are largely effective on January 1, 2009. These comprehensive
regulations include several new rules and requirements, such as a requirement
that employers maintain their 403(b) plans pursuant to a written plan. The final
regulations, subsequent IRS guidance, and the terms of the written plan may
impose new restrictions on both new and existing contracts, including
restrictions on the availability of loans, distributions, transfers and
exchanges, regardless of when a contract was purchased.


Prior to the effective date of the final regulations, provisions applicable to
tax-free transfers and exchanges of 403(b) annuity contracts or custodial
accounts became effective September 25, 2007, replacing existing rules under IRS
Revenue Ruling 90-24 ("90-24 transfer"). Under these new rules, transfers and
exchanges (both referred to below as "transfers") are available only to the
extent permitted under the employer's 403(b) plan once established.
Additionally, transfers occurring after September 24, 2007 that do not comply
with these new rules can become taxable on January 1, 2009, or the date of the
transfer, whichever is later. If you make a transfer to a contract or custodial
account that is not part of the employer's 403(b) plan (other than a transfer to
a different plan), and the provider and employer fail to enter into an
information sharing agreement by January 1, 2009, the transfer would be
considered a "failed" transfer that is subject to tax. Additional guidance
issued by the IRS generally permits a failed transfer to be corrected no later
than June 30, 2009 by re-transferring to a contract or custodial account that is
part of the employer's 403(b) plan or that is subject to an information-sharing
agreement with the employer.


In general, certain contracts originally established by a 90-24 transfer prior
to September 25, 2007 are exempt (or grandfathered) from some of the
requirements of the final regulations; provided that no salary reduction or
other contributions have ever been made to the contract, and that no additional
transfers are made to the contract on or after September 25, 2007. Further,
contracts that are not grandfathered are generally required to be part of, and
subject to the requirements of an employer's 403(b) plan upon its establishment,
but no later than by January 1, 2009.


The new rules in the final regulations generally do not affect a participant's
ability to transfer some or all of a 403(b) account to a state-defined benefit
plan to purchase service credits, where such a transfer is otherwise consistent
with applicable rules and requirements and with the terms of the employer's
plan.


You may wish to discuss the new regulations and/or the general information above
with your tax advisor.


Withdrawals from other Qualified contracts are often limited by the IRC and by
the employer's plan.


If you are purchasing the contract as an investment vehicle for a trust under a
Qualified Plan, you should consider that the contract does not provide any
additional tax-deferral benefits beyond the treatment provided by the trust
itself. In addition, if the contract itself is a qualifying arrangement (as with
a 403(b) annuity or Individual Retirement Annuity), the contract generally does
not provide tax deferral benefits beyond the treatment provided to alternative
qualifying arrangements such as trusts or custodial accounts. However, in both
cases the contract offers features and benefits that other investments may not
offer. You and your financial representative should carefully consider whether
the features and benefits, including the investment options, lifetime annuity
income options, and protection through living benefits, death benefits and other
benefits provided under an annuity contract issued in connection with a
Qualified contract are suitable for your needs and objectives and are
appropriate in light of the expense.



REQUIRED MINIMUM DISTRIBUTIONS



Generally, the IRC requires that you begin taking annual distributions from
Qualified annuity contracts by April 1 of the calendar year following the later
of (1) the calendar year in which you attain age 70 1/2 or (2) the calendar year
in which you separate from service from the employer sponsoring the plan. If you
own a traditional IRA, you must begin receiving minimum distributions for the
year in which you reach age 70 1/2. You can delay taking your first distribution
until the following year; however, you must take your distribution on or before
April 1 of that same following year. It is important to note that if you choose
to delay your first distribution, you will be required to withdraw your second
required minimum distribution on or before December 31 in that same year. For
each year thereafter, you must withdraw your required minimum distribution by
December 31.


71





If you own more than one TSA, you may be permitted to take your annual
distributions in any combination from your TSAs. A similar rule applies if you
own more than one IRA. However, you cannot satisfy this distribution requirement
for your TSA contract by taking a distribution from an IRA, and you cannot
satisfy the requirement for your IRA by taking a distribution from a TSA.


You may be subject to a surrender charge on withdrawals taken to meet minimum
distribution requirements, if the withdrawals exceed the contract's maximum
penalty free amount.


Failure to satisfy the minimum distribution requirements may result in a tax
penalty. You should consult your tax advisor for more information.


You may elect to have the required minimum distribution amount on your contract
calculated and withdrawn each year under the automatic withdrawal option. You
may select monthly, quarterly, semiannual, or annual withdrawals for this
purpose. This service is provided as a courtesy and we do not guarantee the
accuracy of our calculations. Accordingly, we recommend you consult your tax
advisor concerning your required minimum distribution. You may terminate your
election for automated minimum distribution at any time by sending a written
request to our Annuity Service Center. We reserve the right to change or
discontinue this service at any time.


The IRS issued regulations, effective January 1, 2003, regarding required
minimum distributions from Qualified annuity contracts. One of the regulations
effective January 1, 2006 will require that the annuity contract value used to
determine required minimum distributions include the actuarial value of other
benefits under the contract, such as optional death benefits and living
benefits. This regulation does not apply to required minimum distributions made
under an irrevocable annuity income option. You should discuss the effect of
these new regulations with your tax advisor.



TAX TREATMENT OF DEATH BENEFITS



Any death benefits paid under the contract are taxable to the Beneficiary. The
rules governing the taxation of payments from an annuity contract, as discussed
above, generally apply whether the death benefits are paid as lump sum or as
annuity income payments. Estate taxes may also apply.


Certain enhanced death benefits may be purchased under your contract. Although
these types of benefits are used as investment protection and should not give
rise to any adverse tax effects, the IRS could take the position that some or
all of the charges for these death benefits should be treated as a partial
withdrawal from the contract. In that case, the amount of the partial withdrawal
may be includible in taxable income and subject to the 10% penalty if the owner
is under 59 1/2.


If you own a Qualified contract and purchase these enhanced death benefits, the
IRS may consider these benefits "incidental death benefits" or "life insurance."
The IRC imposes limits on the amount of the incidental benefits and/or life
insurance allowable for Qualified contracts and the employer-sponsored plans
under which they are purchased. If the death benefit(s) selected by you are
considered to exceed these limits, the benefit(s) could result in taxable income
to the owner of the Qualified contract, and in some cases could adversely impact
the qualified status of the Qualified contract or the plan. You should consult
your tax advisor regarding these features and benefits prior to purchasing a
contract.



TAX TREATMENT OF OPTIONAL LIVING BENEFITS



Generally, we will treat amounts credited to the contract value under the
optional living benefit guarantees, for income tax purposes, as earnings in the
contract. Payments in accordance with such guarantees after the contract value
has been reduced to zero may be treated for tax purposes as amounts received as
an annuity, if the other requirements for such treatment are satisfied. All
payments or withdrawals after cost basis has been reduced to zero, whether or
not under such a guarantee, will be treated as taxable amounts.


If available and you elect an optional living benefit, the application of
certain tax rules, including those rules relating to distributions from your
contract, are not entirely clear. Such benefits are not intended to adversely
affect the tax treatment of distributions or of the contract. However, you
should be aware that little such guidance is available. You should consult a tax
advisor before electing an optional living benefit.


72






CONTRACTS OWNED BY A TRUST OR CORPORATION



A Trust or Corporation ("Non-Natural Owner") that is considering purchasing this
contract should consult a tax advisor. Generally, the IRC does not treat a
Non-Qualified contract owned by a non-natural owner as an annuity contract for
Federal income tax purposes. The Non-Natural Owner pays tax currently on the
contract's value in excess of the owner's cost basis. However, this treatment is
not applied to a contract held by a trust or other entity as an agent for a
natural person nor to contracts held by Qualified Plans. Please see the
Statement of Additional Information for a more detailed discussion of the
potential adverse tax consequences associated with non-natural ownership of a
Non-Qualified annuity contract.



GIFTS, PLEDGES AND/OR ASSIGNMENTS OF A CONTRACT



If you transfer ownership of your Non-Qualified contract to a person other than
your spouse (or former spouse incident to divorce) as a gift you will pay
federal income tax on the contract's cash value to the extent it exceeds your
cost basis. The recipient's cost basis will be increased by the amount on which
you will pay federal taxes. In addition, the IRC treats any assignment or pledge
(or agreement to assign or pledge) of any portion of a Non-Qualified contract as
a withdrawal. Please see the Statement of Additional Information for a more
detailed discussion regarding potential tax consequences of gifting, assigning,
or pledging a Non-Qualified contract.


The IRC prohibits Qualified annuity contracts including IRAs from being
transferred, assigned or pledged as security for a loan. This prohibition,
however, generally does not apply to loans under an employer-sponsored plan
(including loans from the annuity contract) that satisfy certain requirements,
provided that: (a) the plan is not an unfunded deferred compensation plan; and

(b) the plan funding vehicle is not an IRA.



DIVERSIFICATION AND INVESTOR CONTROL



The IRC imposes certain diversification requirements on the underlying
investments for a variable annuity. We believe that the manager of the
Underlying Funds monitors the Funds so as to comply with these requirements. To
be treated as a variable annuity for tax purposes, the Underlying Funds must
meet these requirements.


The diversification regulations do not provide guidance as to the circumstances
under which you, and not the Company, would be considered the owner of the
shares of the Variable Portfolios under your Non-Qualified contract, because of
the degree of control you exercise over the underlying investments. This
diversification requirement is sometimes referred to as "investor control." The
determination of whether you possess sufficient incidents of ownership over
Variable Portfolio assets to be deemed the owner of the Underlying Funds depends
on all of the relevant facts and circumstances. However, IRS Revenue Ruling
2003-91 provides that an annuity owner's ability to choose among general
investment strategies either at the time of the initial purchase or thereafter,
does not constitute control sufficient to cause the contract holder to be
treated as the owner of the Variable Portfolios. The Revenue Ruling provides
that if, based on all the facts and circumstances, you do not have direct or
indirect control over the Separate Account or any Variable Portfolio asset, then
you do not possess sufficient incidents of ownership over the assets supporting
the annuity to be deemed the owner of the assets for federal income tax
purposes. If any guidance is provided which is considered a new position, then
the guidance should generally be applied prospectively. However, if such
guidance is considered not to be a new position, it may be applied
retroactively. This would mean that you, as the owner of the Non-Qualified
contract, could be treated as the owner of the Underlying Fund. Due to the
uncertainty in this area, we reserve the right to modify the contract in an
attempt to maintain favorable tax treatment.


These investor control limitations generally do not apply to Qualified
contracts, which are referred to as "Pension Plan Contracts" for purposes of
this rule, although the limitations could be applied to Qualified contracts in
the future.

PLEASE SEE APPENDIX D FOR IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING CERTAIN GUARANTEES FOR
CONTRACTS ISSUED PRIOR TO FEBRUARY 1, 2008.




PAYMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH DISTRIBUTION OF THE CONTRACT




PAYMENTS WE MAKE



We make payments in connection with the distribution of the contracts that
generally fall into the three categories below.


COMMISSIONS. Registered representatives of broker-dealers ("selling firms")
licensed under federal securities laws and state insurance laws sell the
contract to the public. The selling firms have entered into written selling
agreements with the Company and the Distributor. We pay commissions to the
selling firms for the sale of your contract. The selling firms are paid
commissions for the promotion and sale of the contracts according to one or more
schedules. The amount and timing of commissions will vary depending on the
selling firm and its selling agreement with us. For example, as one option, we
may pay upfront commission only, up to a maximum 6.25% of each Purchase Payment
you invest (which may include promotional amounts we may pay periodically as
commission specials). Another option may be a lower upfront commission on each
Purchase Payment, with a trail commission of up to a maximum 1.50% of contract
value annually.


74





The registered representative who sells you the contract typically receives a
portion of the compensation we pay to his/her selling firm, depending on the
agreement between the selling firms and its registered representative and their
internal compensation program. We are not involved in determining your
registered representative's compensation.


ADDITIONAL CASH COMPENSATION. We may enter into agreements to pay selling firms
support fees in the form of additional cash compensation ("revenue sharing").
These revenue sharing payments may be intended to reimburse the selling firms
for specific expenses incurred or may be based on sales, certain assets under
management, longevity of assets invested with us and/or a flat fee.


Asset-based payments primarily create incentives to service and maintain
previously sold contacts. Sales-based payments primarily create incentives to
make new sales of contracts. These payments may be consideration for, among
other things, product placement/preference and visibility, greater access to
train and educate the selling firm's registered representatives about our
contracts, our participation in sales conferences and educational seminars and
for selling firms to perform due diligence on our contracts. The amount of these
fees may be tied to the anticipated level of our access in that selling firm.


We enter into such arrangements in our discretion and we may negotiate
customized arrangements with selling firms, including affiliated and
non-affiliated selling firms based on various factors. These special
compensation arrangements are not offered to all selling firms and the terms of
such revenue sharing arrangements may vary between selling firms depending on,
among other things, the level and type of marketing and distribution support
provided, assets under management and the volume and size of the sales of our
contracts.


We provide a list of selling firms to whom we paid annual amounts greater than
$5,000 under these revenue sharing arrangements in 2007 in the Statement of
Additional Information which is available upon request.


We do not assess a specific charge directly to you or your separate account
assets in order to cover commissions and other sales expenses and incentives we
pay. However, we anticipate recovering these amounts from our profits which are
derived from the fees and charges collected under the contract. We hope to
benefit from these revenue sharing arrangements through increased sales of our
contracts and greater customer service support.


NON-CASH COMPENSATION. Some registered representatives may receive various types
of non-cash compensation such as gifts, promotional items and entertainment in
connection with our marketing efforts. We may also pay for registered
representatives to attend educational and/or business seminars. Any such
compensation is paid in accordance with SEC and FINRA rules.


Revenue sharing arrangements may provide selling firms and/or their registered
representatives with an incentive to favor sales of our contracts over other
variable annuity contracts (or other investments) with respect to which a
selling firm does not receive the same level of additional compensation. You
should discuss with your selling firm and/or registered representative how they
are compensated for sales of a contract and/or any resulting real or perceived
conflicts of interest. You may wish to take such revenue sharing arrangements
into account when considering or evaluating any recommendation relating to this
contract.



PAYMENTS WE RECEIVE



We may directly or indirectly receive revenue sharing payments from the Trust's,
their investment advisers, subadvisers and/or distributors (or affiliates
thereof), in connection with certain administrative, marketing and other
services we provide and related expenses we incur. The availability of these
revenue sharing arrangements creates an incentive for us to seek and offer
Underlying Funds (and classes of shares of such Underlying Funds) that make such
payments to us. Other Underlying Funds (or available classes of shares) may have
lower fees and better overall investment performance. Not all Trusts pay the
same amount of revenue sharing. Therefore, the amount of fees we collect may be
greater or smaller based on the Underlying Funds you select.


We generally receive three kinds of payments described below.


RULE 12B-1 FEES. We receive 12b-1 fees of up to 0.25% of the average daily net
assets of the Underlying Funds, including the Feeder Funds. These fees are
deducted directly from the assets of the Underlying Funds with the exception of
the Seasons Managed Allocation Portfolios. The Seasons Managed Allocation
Portfolios, which are structured as Fund-of-Funds, are not subject to 12b-1 fees
but indirectly bear the expenses of the Underlying Funds, including the 12b-1
fees, in which they invest. PLEASE SEE EXPENSES ABOVE.


75





ADMINISTRATIVE, MARKETING AND SUPPORT SERVICE FEES. We receive compensation of
up to 0.50% annually based on assets under management from certain Trusts'
investment advisers, subadvisers and/or distributors (or affiliates thereof).
These payments may be derived, in whole or in part, from the investment
management fees deducted from assets of the Underlying Funds. Contract owners,
through their indirect investment in the Trusts, bear the costs of these
investment management fees, which in turn will reduce the return on their
investment. These amounts are generally based on assets under management from
certain Trust's investment advisers, subadvisers and/or distributors (or
affiliates thereof) pay us more than others. Such amounts received from our
affiliate, AIG SAAMCo, are paid pursuant to a profit sharing agreement and are
not expected to exceed 0.50% annually based on assets under management.


OTHER PAYMENTS. Certain investment advisers, subadvisers and/or distributors (or
affiliates thereof) may help offset the costs we incur for marketing activities
and training to support sales of the Underlying Funds in the contract. These
amounts are paid voluntarily and may provide such advisers access to national
and regional sales conferences attended by our employees and registered
representatives. The amounts paid depend on the nature of the meetings, the
number of meetings attended, the costs expected to be incurred and the level of
the subadviser's participation.


In addition, we (and our affiliates) may receive occasional gifts, entertainment
or other compensation as an incentive to market the Underlying Funds and to
cooperate with their marketing efforts. As a result of these payments, the
investment advisers, subadvisers and/or distributors (or affiliates thereof) may
benefit from increased access to our wholesalers and to our affiliates involved
in the distribution of the contract.



ADMINISTRATION



We are responsible for the administrative servicing of your contract. Please
contact our Annuity Service Center at (800) 99NY-SUN, if you have any comment,
question or service request.


We send out transaction confirmations and quarterly statements. During the

such as dollar cost averaging, may be confirmed quarterly. Purchase Payments
received through the automatic payment plan or a salary reduction arrangement,
may also be confirmed quarterly. For all other transactions, we send
confirmations immediately. It is your responsibility to review these documents
carefully and notify our Annuity Service Center of any inaccuracies immediately.
We investigate all inquiries. To the extent that we believe we made an error, we
retroactively adjust your contract, provided you notify us within 30 days of
receiving the transaction confirmation or quarterly statement. Any other
adjustments we deem warranted are made as of the time we receive notice of the
error. If you fail to notify our Annuity Service Center of any mistakes or
inaccuracy within 30 days of receiving the transaction confirmation or quarterly
statement, we will deem you to have ratified the transaction.



LEGAL PROCEEDINGS



There are no pending legal proceedings affecting the Separate Account. Various
lawsuits against the Company have arisen in the ordinary course of business. In
addition, various federal, state and other regulatory agencies may from time to
time review, examine or inquire into the operations, practices and procedures of
the Company, such as through financial examinations, market conduct exams or
regulatory inquiries. In management's opinion, these matters are not material in
relation to the financial position of the Company.

APPENDIX B - DEATH BENEFITS FOLLOWING




SPOUSAL CONTINUATION





The following details the death benefit options available upon the Continuing
Spouse's death. The death benefit we will pay to the new Beneficiary chosen by
the Continuing Spouse varies depending on the death benefit option elected by
the original owner of the contract, and the age of the Continuing Spouse as of
the Continuation Date and Continuing Spouse's date of death.


Capitalized terms used in this Appendix have the same meaning as they have in
the prospectus.


The term "Continuation Net Purchase Payment" is used frequently to describe the
death benefit options payable to the beneficiary of a Continuing Spouse. We
define Continuation Net Purchase Payment as Net Purchase Payments made as of the
Continuation Date. For the purposes of calculating Continuation Net Purchase
Payments, the amount that equals the contract value on the Continuation Date,
including the Continuation Contribution is considered a Purchase Payment. If the
Continuing Spouse makes no additional Purchase Payments or withdrawals,
Continuation Net Purchase Payments equals the contract value on the Continuation
Date, including the Continuation Contribution. The term "withdrawals" as used in
describing the death benefits is defined as withdrawals and the fees and charges
applicable to those withdrawals.


THE COMPANY WILL NOT ACCEPT PURCHASE PAYMENTS FROM ANYONE AGE 86 OR OLDER.
FURTHERMORE, THE DEATH BENEFIT CALCULATIONS ASSUME THAT NO PURCHASE PAYMENTS ARE
RECEIVED ON OR AFTER YOUR 86TH BIRTHDAY.



STANDARD DEATH BENEFIT PAYABLE UPON CONTINUING SPOUSE'S DEATH



If the Standard Death Benefit was selected by the original owner, the death
benefit is as follows upon the Continuing Spouse's death:


A. If the Continuing Spouse is age 82 or younger on the Continuation Date,
the death benefit is the greater of:


1. Contract value; or


2. Continuation Net Purchase Payments.


B. If the Continuing Spouse is age 83-85 on the Continuation Date, the
death benefit is the greater of:


1. Contract value; or


2. The lesser of:


a. Continuation Net Purchase Payments; or


b. 125% of contract value.


If the Continuing Spouse is age 86 or older on the Continuation Date, the
Standard Death Benefit is the contract value as of the later of the date of
death of the Continuing Spouse or the NYSE business day in which we receive all
required documentation in Good Order at our Annuity Service Center.



MAXIMUM ANNIVERSARY VALUE DEATH BENEFIT PAYABLE UPON CONTINUING SPOUSE'S DEATH



If the Maximum Anniversary Value death benefit was selected by the original
owner, the death benefit is as follows upon a Continuing Spouses's death;


A. If the Continuing Spouse is age 82 or younger on the Continuation Date,
the death benefit is the greatest of:


a. Contract value; or


b. Continuation Net Purchase Payments; or


c. Maximum anniversary value on any contract anniversary occurring after
the Continuation Date but prior to the Continuing Spouse's 83rd
birthday; plus any Purchase Payments received after that anniversary
but received prior to the Continuing Spouse's 86th birthday; and
reduced for any


B-1





withdrawals (and fees and charges applicable to those withdrawals)
recorded after the anniversary in the same proportion that the
withdrawal reduced the contract value on the date of the withdrawal.


B. If the Continuing Spouse is age 83-85 on the Continuation Date the death
benefit is the Standard Death Benefit, which is equal to, the greater
of:


1. Contract value; or


2. The lesser of:


a. Continuation Net Purchase Payments; or


b. 125% of contract value.


The fee for the Maximum Anniversary Value death benefit will no longer be
deducted as of the Continuation Date.


If the Continuing Spouse is age 86 or older on the Continuation Date, the death
benefit is the contract value as of the later of the date of death of the
Continuing Spouse or the NYSE business day in which we receive all required
documentation in Good Order at our Annuity Service Center. Therefore, if the
Continuing Spouse is age 86 or older on the Continuation Date, the Continuing
Spouse's beneficiary will not receive any benefit from the Maximum Anniversary
Value death benefit.


WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO MODIFY, SUSPEND OR TERMINATE THE SPOUSAL CONTINUATION
PROVISION (IN ITS ENTIRETY OR ANY COMPONENT) AT ANY TIME ON PROSPECTIVELY ISSUED
CONTRACTS.

APPENDIX C - OPTIONAL LIVING BENEFITS EXAMPLES





The following examples demonstrate the operation of the MarketLock Income Plus,
MarketLock For Life Plus and MarketLock features:



MARKETLOCK INCOME PLUS EXAMPLES



The following examples demonstrate the operation of the MarketLock Income Plus
feature:



EXAMPLE 1:



Assume you elect MarketLock Income Plus and you invest a single Purchase
Payment of $100,000, and you make no additional Purchase Payments, and no
withdrawals before the first contract anniversary. Assume that on your
first contract anniversary, your contract value is $103,000.


Your initial Income Base and Income Credit Base are equal to 100% of your
Eligible Purchase Payments, or $100,000. Your Income Credit on the first
contract anniversary is the Net Income Credit Percentage (7%) multiplied by
the Income Credit Base ($100,000) which equals $7,000. On your first
contract anniversary, your Income Base is equal to the greatest of your
current Income Base ($100,000), your contract value ($103,000), or your
Income Credit plus your current Income Base ($7,000 + $100,000). Assuming
your Maximum Annual Withdrawal Percentage is 5%, then your Maximum Annual
Withdrawal Amount if you were to start taking withdrawals after the first
contract anniversary is 5% of the Income Base (5% X $107,000 = $5,350).
Therefore, as of your first contract anniversary, you may take withdrawals
of up to $5,350 each year as long as the Covered Person(s) is(are) alive
and you do not take any excess withdrawals.



EXAMPLE 2 - IMPACT OF SUBSEQUENT ELIGIBLE PURCHASE PAYMENTS WITH NO

WITHDRAWALS AND NO MAXIMUM ANNIVERSARY VALUES:



Assume you elect MarketLock Income Plus, you invest an initial Purchase
Payment of $100,000, you make subsequent Purchase Payments of $120,000 in
year 2, $30,000 in year 5, and $50,000 in year 6, you take no withdrawals
before the sixth contract anniversary and you have elected to extend both
the Income Base Evaluation Period and the Income Credit Period. Assume
further that on your first contract anniversary, your contract value
increases to $103,000, but through each subsequent contract year, there is
effectively 0% growth net of fees in your contract value. Therefore, your
Income Base and Income Credit Base do not increase due to a maximum
Anniversary Value. Your contract values, Income Bases, Income Credit Bases,
Income Credits and Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amounts are given as follows:








---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                                              MAXIMUM ANNUAL

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         4th              $223,000         $249,000         $200,000           $14,000            $12,450
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         5th              $253,000         $295,100         $230,000           $16,100            $14,755
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         6th              $303,000         $311,200         $230,000           $16,100            $15,560
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------








Since the Income Base equals the Income Base at the beginning of that
Benefit Year plus the subsequent Eligible Purchase Payments made in year 2,
your new Income Base at the time of deposit equals $207,000
($107,000 + $100,000). $20,000 of the $120,000 Purchase Payment is
considered Ineligible Purchase Payments because it exceeds the Eligible
Purchase Payment made in the first contract year. On your second contract
anniversary, your Income Credit is $14,000 (7% X $200,000) and your Income
Base equals $221,000 ($207,000 + $14,000). Your Income Base is not
increased to the $223,000 contract value because the highest Anniversary
Value is reduced for $20,000 of Ineligible Purchase Payments. Assuming your
Maximum Annual Withdrawal Percentage at that time is 5%, then your Maximum
Annual Withdrawal Amount would be $11,050 if you were to start taking
withdrawals after the second contract anniversary (5% of the $221,000
Income Base). However, continuing to assume you do not take any withdrawals
in years 3 and 4, your Income


C-1





Base will increase by your Income Credit and as a result, your Maximum
Annual Withdrawal Amount will also increase. After your Purchase Payment in
year 5, your new Income Base at the time of deposit equals $279,000
($249,000 + $30,000). On your fifth contract anniversary, your Income
Credit Base is $230,000 and your Income Credit equals $16,100
($230,000 X 7%). Your Income Base equals $295,100 ($279,000 + $16,100). Any
Purchase Payments made on or after your fifth contract anniversary are
considered Ineligible Purchase Payments. Therefore, your $50,000 Purchase
Payment in year 6 will not increase the Income Base, Income Credit Base, or
Income Credit. Your Income Base is $311,200 ($295,100 + $16,100). If you
were to start taking withdrawals after the sixth contract anniversary, and
your Maximum Annual Withdrawal Percentage at that time remains at 5%, your
Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount would be $15,560 (5% of the $311,200
Income Base). If you do not take any Excess Withdrawals and begin taking
withdrawals as of the sixth contract anniversary, you may take up to
$15,560 each year as long as the Covered Person(s) is(are) alive.





EXAMPLE 3 - IMPACT OF MAXIMUM ANNIVERSARY VALUES:



Assume you elect MarketLock Income Plus and you invest a single Purchase
Payment of $100,000, you make no additional Purchase Payments and you have
elected to extend both the Income Base Evaluation Period and the Income
Credit Period. Assume that your contract values, Income Bases, Income
Credit Bases, Income Credits and Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amounts are
given as follows:






---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                                              MAXIMUM ANNUAL

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------








* The Income Base calculated based on the maximum Anniversary Value is
greater than the Income Credit plus the Income Base; therefore, the
Income Credit Base and Income Base are increased to the current
Anniversary Value, and the Income Base is not increased by the Income
Credit.


On your sixth contract anniversary, your contract value is $145,000, and
your Income Base is stepped-up to $149,800 and Income Credit Base remains
unchanged. Assume your Maximum Annual Withdrawal Percentage is 5%, then
your Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount if you were to start taking
withdrawals would be $7,490 (5% of the $149,800 Income Base). Therefore, if
you do not take any Excess Withdrawals and begin taking withdrawals as of
the sixth contract anniversary, you may take up to $7,490 each year as long
as the Covered Person(s) is(are) alive.



EXAMPLE 4 - IMPACT OF WITHDRAWALS IN EXCESS OF MAXIMUM ANNUAL WITHDRAWAL

AMOUNT:



Assume you elect MarketLock Income Plus, and you invest a single Purchase
Payment of $100,000 with no additional Purchase Payments, no withdrawals
before the sixth contract anniversary and you have elected to extend both
the Income Base Evaluation Period and the Income Credit Period. Contract
values, Income Bases, Income Credit Bases, and Income Credits are as
described in EXAMPLE 3 above. Also assume that during your seventh contract
year, after your sixth contract anniversary, your contract value is
$107,990 and you make a withdrawal of $11,510. Because the withdrawal is
greater than your Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount ($7,490), this
withdrawal includes an Excess Withdrawal. In this case, the amount of the
Excess Withdrawal is the total amount of the withdrawal less your Maximum
Annual Withdrawal Amount ($11,510 - $7,490), or $4,020. First, we process
the portion of your withdrawal that is not the Excess Withdrawal, which is
$7,490. Your contract value after this portion of the withdrawal is
$100,500 ($107,990 - $7,490), but your Income Base and Income Credit Base
are unchanged. Next, we recalculate your Income Base, Income Credit Base
and Income Credit by reducing the Income Base and Income Credit Base by the
proportion by which the contract value was reduced by the Excess Withdrawal
($4,020/$100,500 = 4%). The Income Base is adjusted to $143,808
($149,800 X 96%). The Income Credit


C-2





Base is adjusted to $134,400 ($140,000 X 96%). Your new Income Credit is 7%
of your new Income Credit Base (7% X $134,400), which equals $9,408. Your
new Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount is your Income Base multiplied by your
Maximum Annual Withdrawal Percentage ($143,808 X 5%), which equals
$7,190.40. Therefore, if you do not take additional Excess Withdrawals, you
may take up to $7,190.40 each year as long as the Covered Person(s) is(are)
alive.



EXAMPLE 5 - IMPACT OF MINIMUM INCOME BASE:



Assume you elect MarketLock Income Plus, you invest a single Purchase
Payment of $100,000, you make no additional Purchase Payments, no
withdrawals before the tenth contract anniversary and you have elected to
extend both the Income Base Evaluation Period and the Income Credit Period.
Assume further that on your first contract anniversary, your contract value
increases to $103,000, but through each subsequent contract year, there is
effectively 0% growth net of fees in your contract value. Therefore, your
Income Base and Income Credit Base do not increase due to a maximum
Anniversary Value. Assume that your contract values, Income Bases, Income
Credit Bases, Income Credits and Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amounts are
given as follows:








---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                                              MAXIMUM ANNUAL

* The Income Base calculated based on 200% of the Purchase Payments made in
the first contract year is greater than the maximum Anniversary Value and
the Income Credit plus the Income Base; therefore, the Income Base and
the Income Credit Base are increased to $200,000 on the tenth contract
anniversary.


On your tenth contract anniversary, your Income Base is equal to the
greatest of your contract value($103,000), your Income Credit plus your
current Income Base ($170,000 = $163,000 + $7,000), and 200% of the
Purchase Payments made in the first contract year
($200,000 = 200% X $100,000). Assume your Maximum Annual Withdrawal
Percentage is 5%, then your Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount if you were to
start taking withdrawals would be $10,000 (5% of the $200,000 Income Base).
Therefore, if you do not take any Excess Withdrawals and begin taking
withdrawals as of the tenth contract anniversary, you may take up to
$10,000 each year as long as the Covered Person(s) is(are) alive.



EXAMPLE 6 - IMPACT OF WITHDRAWALS WITHOUT MAXIMUM ANNIVERSARY VALUES:



Assume you elect MarketLock Income Plus, you invest a single Purchase
Payment of $100,000, you make no additional Purchase Payments, no
withdrawals before the eighth contract anniversary and you have elected to
extend both the Income Base Evaluation Period and the Income Credit Period.
Assume further that on your first contract anniversary, your contract value
increases to $103,000, but through each subsequent contract year, there is
effectively 0% growth net of fees in your contract value. Therefore, your
Income Base and Income Credit Base do not increase due to a maximum
Anniversary Value. Assume that your contract values,

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------








On your eighth contract anniversary, your contract value is $103,000, and
your Income Base is stepped-up to $156,000 and your Income Credit Base
remains unchanged. Assuming your Maximum Annual Withdrawal Percentage is
5%, then your Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount if you were to start taking
withdrawals would be $7,800 (5% of the $156,000 Income Base). Assume that
during your ninth contract year, after your eighth contract anniversary,
you make a withdrawal of $4,680 (3% of the $156,000 Income Base) which is
less than your Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount. Then, your contract value
on your ninth contract anniversary will equal $98,320 ($103,000 - $4,680).
Your new Income Credit is 4% (7%-3%) of your Income Credit Base
(4% * $100,000), which is $4,000. Your Income Base is equal to the greatest
of your contract value ($98,320) or your Income Credit plus your current
Income Base ($160,000 = $4,000 + $156,000). Assume that during your tenth
contract year, after your ninth contract anniversary, you make another
withdrawal of $8,000 (5% of the $160,000 Income Base) which is equal to
your Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount. Then, your contract value on your
tenth contract anniversary will equal $90,320 ($98,320 - $8,000). Your new
Income Credit is 2% (7%-5%) of your Income Credit Base (2% X $100,000),
which is $2,000. Your Income Base is equal to the greatest of your contract
value ($90,320) or your Income Credit plus your current Income Base
($162,000 = $2,000 + $160,000). The Income Base will not increase to the
Minimum Income Base since withdrawals were taken before the tenth Benefit
Year anniversary.


On your tenth contract anniversary, if your Maximum Annual Withdrawal
Percentage is 5%, your new Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount will be $8,100
(5% of the $162,000 Income Base). Therefore, if you do not take any Excess
Withdrawals, you may take up to $8,100 each year as long as the Covered
Person(s) is(are) alive.



MARKETLOCK FOR LIFE PLUS EXAMPLES



The following examples demonstrate the operation of the MarketLock For Life Plus

+6% option unless otherwise specified:



EXAMPLE 1:



Assume you elect MarketLock For Life Plus and you invest a single Purchase
Payment of $100,000, and you make no additional Purchase Payments, and no
withdrawals before the first contract anniversary. Assume that on your
first contract anniversary, your contract value is $103,000.


Your initial Income Base and Income Credit Base are equal to 100% of your
Eligible Purchase Payments, or $100,000. Your Income Credit on the first
contract anniversary is calculated as the Income Credit Percentage
multiplied by the Income Credit Base (6% X $100,000) which equals $6,000.
On your first contract anniversary, your Income Base is adjusted to
$106,000 which equals the greatest of your current Income Base ($100,000),
your contract value ($103,000), or your Income Credit plus your current
Income Base ($6,000 + $100,000).


C-4





Assume your Maximum Annual Withdrawal Percentage is 5%, then your Maximum
Annual Withdrawal Amount if you were to start taking withdrawals after the
first contract anniversary is 5% of the Income Base (5% x
$106,000 = $5,300). Therefore, as of your first contract anniversary, you
may take withdrawals of up to $5,300 each year as long as the Covered
Person(s) is(are) alive and you do not take any Excess Withdrawals.



EXAMPLE 2:



Assume you elect MarketLock For Life Plus, you invest an initial Purchase
Payment of $100,000, you make subsequent Purchase Payments of $120,000 in
year 2, $30,000 in year 5, and $50,000 in year 6, and you take no
withdrawals before the sixth contract anniversary. Assume further that on
your first contract anniversary, your contract value is $103,000.
Therefore, your Income Base and Income Credit Base do not increase due to a
maximum Anniversary Value. Your contract values, Income Bases, Income
Credit Bases, and Income Credits are given as follows:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------








Since the Income Base equals the Income Base at the beginning of that
Benefit Year plus the subsequent Eligible Purchase Payments made in year 2,
your new Income Base at the time of deposit equals $206,000 ($106,000 +
$100,000). $20,000 of the $120,000 Purchase Payment is considered
Ineligible Purchase Payments because it exceeds the Eligible Purchase
Payment made in the first contract year (100% of $100,000). On your second
contract anniversary, your Income Credit is $12,000 (6% X $200,000) and
your Income Base equals $218,000 ($206,000 + $12,000). Assuming your
Maximum Annual Withdrawal Percentage at that time is 5%, then your Maximum
Annual Withdrawal Amount would be $10,900 if you were to start taking
withdrawals after the second contract anniversary (5% of the $218,000
Income Base). However, continuing to assume you do not take any withdrawals
in years 3 and 4, your Income Base will increase by your Income Credit and
as a result, your Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount will also increase.
After your Purchase Payment of $30,000 in year 5, your new Income Base
equals $272,000 ($242,000 + $30,000). On your fifth contract anniversary,
your Income Credit Base is $230,000 and your Income Credit equals $13,800
($230,000 X 6%). Your Income Base equals $285,800 ($272,000 + $13,800). Any
Purchase Payments made on or after your fifth contract anniversary are
considered Ineligible Purchase Payments. Therefore, your $50,000 Purchase
Payment in year 6 will not increase the Income Base, Income Credit Base, or
Income Credit. A maximum Anniversary Value is not attained on the sixth
contract anniversary since the contract value of $303,000 is reduced by
Ineligible Purchase Payments of $70,000 ($20,000 + $50,000). Therefore,
your Income Base is $299,600 ($285,800 + $13,800). If you were to start
taking withdrawals after the sixth contract anniversary, and your Maximum
Annual Withdrawal Percentage at that time remains at 5%, your Maximum
Annual Withdrawal Amount would be $14,980 (5% of the $299,600 Income Base).
If you do not take any Excess Withdrawals and begin taking withdrawals as
of the sixth contract anniversary, you may take up to $14,980 each year as
long as the Covered Person(s) is (are) alive.

* The Income Base calculated based on the maximum Anniversary Value is
greater than the Income Credit plus the Income Base; therefore, the
Income Credit Base and Income Base are increased to the current
anniversary value, and the Income Base is not increased by the Income
Credit.


On your sixth contract anniversary, your contract value is $145,000, and
your Income Base is stepped-up to $148,400 and Income Credit Base remains
unchanged. Assume your Maximum Annual Withdrawal Percentage is 5%, then
your Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount if you were to start taking
withdrawals would be $7,420 (5% of the $148,400 Income Base). Therefore, if
you do not take any Excess Withdrawals and begin taking withdrawals as of
the sixth contract anniversary, you may take up to $7,420 each year as long
as the Covered Person(s) is (are) alive.



EXAMPLE 4 - IMPACT OF WITHDRAWALS IN EXCESS OF MAXIMUM ANNUAL WITHDRAWAL

AMOUNT:



Assume you elect MarketLock For Life Plus, and you invest a single Purchase
Payment of $100,000 with no additional Purchase Payments and no withdrawals
before the sixth contract anniversary. Contract values, Income Bases,
Income Credit Bases, and Income Credits are as described in EXAMPLE 3
above. Also assume that during your seventh contract year, after your sixth
contract anniversary, your contract value is $107,920 and you make a
withdrawal of $11,440. Because the withdrawal is greater than your Maximum
Annual Withdrawal Amount ($7,420), this withdrawal includes an Excess
Withdrawal. In this case, the amount of the Excess Withdrawal is the total
amount of the withdrawal less your Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount
($11,440 - $7,420), or $4,020. First, we process the portion of your
withdrawal that is not the Excess Withdrawal, which is $7,420. Your
contract value after this portion of the withdrawal is $100,500 ($107,920 -
$7,420), but your Income Base and Income Credit Base are unchanged. Next,
we recalculate your Income Base, Income Credit Base and Income Credit by
reducing the Income Base and Income Credit Base by the proportion by which
the contract value was reduced by the Excess Withdrawal
($4,020/$100,500 = 4%). The Income Base is adjusted to $142,464 ($148,400
minus 4% of $148,400 equals $5,936). The Income Credit Base is adjusted to
$134,400($140,000 minus 4% of $140,000 equals $5,600). Your new Income
Credit is 6% of your new Income Credit Base (6% X $134,400), which equals
$8,064. Your new Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount is your Income Base
multiplied by your Maximum Annual Withdrawal Percentage ($142,464 X 5%),
which equals $7,123.20. Therefore, if you do not take additional Excess
Withdrawals, you may take up to $7,123.20 each year as long as the Covered
Person(s) is(are) alive.



EXAMPLE 5 - IF YOU ELECT MARKETLOCK FOR LIFE PLUS +7% OPTION:



Assume you elect MarketLock For Life Plus +7% option, and you invest a
single Purchase Payment of $100,000. You make no additional Purchase
Payments and no withdrawals before the tenth contract anniversary. Assume
further that on your first contract anniversary, your contract value
increases to $103,000, but through each subsequent contract year, there is
effectively 0% growth net of fees in your contract value. Therefore, your
Income Base and Income Credit Base do not increase due to a maximum
Anniversary Value.

* The Income Base calculated based on 200% of the Purchase Payments made in
the first contract year is greater than both maximum Anniversary Value
and the Income Credit plus the Income Base; therefore, the Income Base is
increased to $200,000 on the tenth contract anniversary.


On your tenth contract anniversary, your Income Base is equal to the
greatest of your contract value ($103,000), your Income Credit plus your
current Income Base ($170,000 = $163,000 + $7,000), and 200% of the
Purchase Payments made in the first contract year ($200,000 = 200% of
$100,000). Assume your Maximum Annual Withdrawal Percentage is 5%, then
your Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount if you were to start taking
withdrawals would be $10,000 (5% of the $200,000 Income Base). Therefore,
if you do not take any Excess Withdrawals and begin taking withdrawals as
of the tenth contract anniversary, you may take up to $10,000 each year as
long as the Covered Person(s) is(are) alive.



MARKETLOCK EXAMPLES



The following examples demonstrate the operation of the MarketLock feature:



EXAMPLE 1:



Assume you elect MarketLock and you invest a single Purchase Payment of
$100,000, and that you make no additional Purchase Payments and no
withdrawals before the first contract anniversary. Assume that on your
first contract anniversary, your contract value is $105,000.


Your initial MAV Benefit Base is equal to 100% of your Eligible Purchase
Payments, or $100,000. On your first contract anniversary, your MAV Benefit
Base is equal to the greater of your current MAV Benefit Base ($100,000),
or your contract value ($105,000), which is $105,000. Your Maximum Annual
Withdrawal Amount if you were to start taking withdrawals following your
first contract anniversary is 5% of the MAV Benefit Base
(5% X $105,000 = $5,250). The Minimum Withdrawal Period is equal to the MAV
Benefit Base divided by the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount, which is 20
years ($105,000/$5,250). Therefore, as of your first contract anniversary,
you may take up to $105,000 in withdrawals of up to $5,250 annually over a
minimum of 20 years. However, if the first withdrawal occurs on or after
the older owner's 65th birthday and no withdrawal ever exceeds 5% of each
year's MAV Benefit Base, then all such withdrawals are guaranteed for the
lifetime of the older owner and the Minimum Withdrawal Period does not
apply unless lifetime withdrawals are terminated.


C-7








EXAMPLE 2:



Assume you elect MarketLock and you invest a single Purchase Payment of
$100,000, and that you make no additional Purchase Payments and no
withdrawals before the fifth contract anniversary. Assume that your
contract anniversary values and MAV Benefit Base values are as follows:






-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                                            LIFETIME MAXIMUM

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         2nd              $115,000         $115,000          $5,750              20              $5,750
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         5th              $120,000         $120,000          $8,400            14.28             $6,000
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------








On your fifth contract anniversary, your contract value is $120,000, and
your MAV Benefit Base is stepped-up to $120,000. Your Maximum Annual
Withdrawal Amount if you were to start taking withdrawals after your fifth
contract anniversary is 7% of the MAV Benefit Base
(7% X $120,000 = $8,400). The Minimum Withdrawal Period is equal to the MAV
Benefit Base divided by the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount, which is
14.28 years ($120,000/$8,400). Therefore, as of your fifth contract
anniversary, you may take $120,000 in withdrawals of up to $8,400 annually
over a minimum of 14 years, plus $2,400 in the last Benefit Year. If you
are age 65 or older, you may take annual withdrawals of up to $6,000
(5% X $120,000) for life.



EXAMPLE 3 - IMPACT OF WITHDRAWALS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO MAXIMUM ANNUAL

WITHDRAWAL AMOUNT:



Assume you elect MarketLock, and you invest a single Purchase Payment of
$100,000 with no additional Purchase Payments and no withdrawals before the
fifth contract anniversary, and contract values and MAV Benefit Base values
as described in EXAMPLE 2 above. During your sixth contract year, after
your fifth contract anniversary, you make a withdrawal of $4,500. Because
the withdrawal is less than or equal to your Maximum Annual Withdrawal
Amount ($8,400), your MAV Benefit Base ($120,000) is reduced by the total
dollar amount of the withdrawal ($4,500). Your new MAV Benefit Base equals
$115,500. Your Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount remains $8,400. Your new
Minimum Withdrawal Period following the withdrawal is equal to the new MAV
Benefit Base divided by your current Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount,
($115,500/$8,400). Therefore, following this first withdrawal of $4,500,
you may take withdrawals of up to $8,400 annually over the next 13 years,
plus $6,300 in the last Benefit Year.





EXAMPLE 4 - IMPACT OF WITHDRAWALS IN EXCESS OF MAXIMUM ANNUAL WITHDRAWAL

AMOUNT:



Assume you elect MarketLock and you invest a single Purchase Payment of
$100,000, and that you make no additional Purchase Payments and no
withdrawals before the fifth contract anniversary. Assume that your
contract values and MAV Benefit Base values are as follows:






-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                                            LIFETIME MAXIMUM

         2nd              $115,000         $115,000          $5,750              20              $5,750

         3rd              $120,000         $120,000          $6,000              20              $6,000
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         4th              $110,000         $120,000          $6,000              20              $6,000
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         5th              $80,000          $120,000          $8,400            14.28             $6,000
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------








Your Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount if you were to start taking
withdrawals after your fifth contract anniversary is 7% of the MAV Benefit
Base (7% X $120,000 = $8,400). The Minimum Withdrawal Period is equal to
the MAV Benefit Base divided by the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount, which
is 14.28 years ($120,000/$8,400). Therefore, you may take annual
withdrawals of up to $8,400 over the next 14 years, plus $2,400 in the last
Benefit Year.


C-8





Now assume that during your sixth contract year, after your fifth contract
anniversary, your contract value is $80,000 and you make a withdrawal of
$11,688. Because the withdrawal is greater than your Maximum Annual
Withdrawal Amount ($8,400), this withdrawal includes an Excess Withdrawal.
In this case, the amount of the Excess Withdrawal is the total amount of
the withdrawal less your Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount
($11,688 - $8,400), or $3,288. First, we process the portion of your
withdrawal that is not the Excess Withdrawal, which is $8,400 from the
contract value and the MAV Benefit Base. Your contract value after this
portion of the withdrawal is $71,600 ($80,000 - $8,400). Your MAV Benefit
Base after this portion of your withdrawal is $111,600 ($120,000 - $8,400).
Next, we recalculate your MAV Benefit Base by taking the lesser of two
calculations. For the first calculation, we deduct the amount of the Excess
Withdrawal from the MAV Benefit Base ($111,600 - $3,288 = $108,312). For
the second calculation, we reduce the MAV Benefit Base by the proportion by
which the contract value was reduced by the Excess Withdrawal
($68,312/$71,600 = 95.4%), (or $111,600 X 95.4%) which equals $106,475.
Your MAV Benefit Base is the lesser of these two calculations, or $106,475.
The Minimum Withdrawal Period following the Excess Withdrawal is equal to
the Minimum Withdrawal Period at the end of the prior year (14.28 years)
reduced by one year (13.28 years). Your new Maximum Annual Withdrawal
Amount following the Excess Withdrawal is your MAV Benefit Base divided by
your Minimum Withdrawal Period ($106,475/13.28), which equals $8,017.71.
Therefore, you may take annual withdrawals of up to $8,017.71 over the next
13 years, plus $2,244.77 in the last Benefit Year. Since the withdrawal is
greater than your lifetime Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount ($6,000),
lifetime withdrawals are no longer available.

SEPARATE ACCOUNT





FS Variable Annuity Account Five ("Separate Account") was originally established
by First SunAmerica Life Insurance Company (the "Company") on August 1, 1997
pursuant to the provisions of New York law, as a segregated asset account of the
Company. The Company is a direct wholly owned subsidiary of SunAmerica Life
Insurance Company (the "Parent"), which is a wholly owned subsidiary of AIG
Retirement Services, Inc. ("AIGRS") (formerly AIG SunAmerica Inc.), a wholly
owned subsidiary of American International Group, Inc. ("AIG"). AIG is a holding
company which, through its subsidiaries, is engaged in a broad range of
insurance and insurance-related activities in the United States and abroad.
AIG's activities include general insurance and life insurance and retirement
services, financial services and asset management. The Company is a New
York-domiciled life insurance company principally engaged in the business of
writing annuity contracts directed to the market for tax-deferred, long-term
savings products. The Separate Account meets the definition of a "Separate
Account" under the federal securities laws and is registered with the SEC as a
unit investment trust under the Investment Company Act of 1940. This
registration does not involve supervision of the management of the Separate
Account or the Company by the SEC.


The assets of the Separate Account are the property of the Company. However, the
assets of the Separate Account, equal to its reserves and other contract
liabilities, are not chargeable with liabilities arising out of any other
business the Company may conduct. Income, gains, and losses, whether or not
realized, from assets allocated to the Separate Account are credited to or
charged against the Separate Account without regard to other income, gains, or
losses of the Company.


The Separate Account is divided into Premier Portfolios, Select Portfolios,
Focused Portfolios, Seasons Managed Allocation Portfolios and Seasons Strategies
("Variable Portfolio(s)"), with the assets of each Variable Portfolio invested
in the shares of one or more underlying investment portfolios. The Company does
not guarantee the investment performance of the Separate Account, its Variable
Portfolios or the underlying investment portfolios. Values allocated to the
Separate Account and the amount of variable annuity income payments will vary
with the values of shares of the underlying investment portfolios, and are also
reduced by Separate Account charges and fees.


The basic objective of a variable annuity contract is to provide variable
annuity income payments which will be to some degree responsive to changes in
the economic environment, including inflationary forces and changes in rates of
return available from various types of investments. The contract is designed to
seek to accomplish this objective by providing that variable annuity income
payments will reflect the investment performance of the Separate Account with
respect to amounts allocated to it both before and after the Annuity Date. Since
the Separate Account is always fully invested in shares of the underlying
investment portfolios, its investment performance reflects the investment
performance of those entities. The values of such shares held by the Separate
Account fluctuate and are subject to the risks of changing economic conditions
as well as the risk inherent in the ability of the underlying funds' managements
to make necessary changes in their Variable Portfolios to anticipate changes in
economic conditions. Therefore, the owner bears the entire investment risk that
the basic objectives of the contract may not be realized, and that the adverse
effects of inflation may not be lessened. There can be no assurance that the
aggregate amount of variable annuity income payments will equal or exceed the
Purchase Payments made with respect to a particular account for the reasons
described above, or because of the premature death of an Annuitant.


Another important feature of the contract related to its basic objective is the
Company's promise that the dollar amount of variable annuity income payments
made during the lifetime of the Annuitant will not be adversely affected by the
actual mortality experience of the Company or the actual expenses incurred by
the Company in excess of expense deductions provided for in the contract
(although the Company does not guarantee the amounts of the variable annuity
income payments).

GENERAL ACCOUNT





The General Account is made up of all of the general assets of the Company other
than those allocated to the Separate Account or any other segregated asset
account of the Company. A Purchase Payment may be allocated to the available
Fixed Account options and/or available DCA Fixed Account(s) available in
connection with the general account, as elected by the owner purchasing a
contract. Assets supporting amounts allocated to a fixed investment option
become part of the Company's general account assets and are available to fund
the claims of all classes of customers of the Company, as well as of its
creditors. Accordingly, all of the Company's assets held in the general account
will be available to fund the Company's obligations under the contracts as well
as such other claims.


The Company will invest the assets of the general account in the manner chosen
by the Company and allowed by applicable state laws regarding the nature and
quality of investments that may be made by life insurance companies and the
percentage of their assets that may be committed to any particular type of
investment. In general, these laws permit investments, within specified limits
and subject to certain qualifications, in federal, state and municipal
obligations, corporate bonds, preferred and common stocks, real estate
mortgages, real estate and certain other investments.



Support Agreement Between the Company and AIG



The Company has a support agreement in effect between the Company and AIG (the
"Support Agreement"), pursuant to which AIG has agreed that AIG will cause the
Company to maintain a policyholder's surplus of not less than $1,000,000 or such
greater amount as shall be sufficient to enable the Company to perform its
obligations under any policy issued by it. The Support Agreement also provides
that if the Company needs funds not otherwise available to it to make timely
payment of its obligations under policies issued by it, AIG will provide such
funds at the request of the Company. The Support Agreement is not a direct or
indirect guarantee by AIG to any person of any obligations of the Company. AIG
may terminate the Support Agreement with respect to outstanding obligations of
the Company only under circumstances where the Company attains, without the
benefit of the Support Agreement, a financial strength rating equivalent to that
held by the Company with the benefit of the Support Agreement. Policyholders
have the right to cause the Company to enforce its rights against AIG and, if

Agreement or if the Company defaults in any claim or payment owed to such
policyholder when due, have the right to enforce the Support Agreement directly

MASTER-FEEDER STRUCTURE





The following underlying funds currently do not buy individual securities
directly: American Funds Global Growth SAST Portfolio, American Funds Growth
SAST Portfolio, American Funds Growth-Income SAST Portfolio, and American Funds
Asset Allocation SAST Portfolio (the "Feeder Funds"). Instead, each Feeder Fund
invests all of its investment assets in a corresponding "Master Fund" of
American Funds Insurance Series(R), managed by Capital Research and Management
Company ("Capital Research").


Because each Feeder Fund invests all of its assets in a Master Fund, the
investment adviser to the Feeder Funds, AIG SunAmerica Asset Management Corp.
("AIG SAAMCo") does not provide any portfolio management services for the Feeder
Funds. AIG SAAMCo provides those services for the Feeder Funds that are normally
provided by a fund's investment adviser with the exception of portfolio
management. Such services include, but are not limited to: monitoring the
ongoing investment performance of the Master Funds, monitoring the Feeder Funds'
other service providers, facilitating the distribution of Master Fund
shareholder materials to Feeder Fund shareholders and providing such other
services as are necessary or appropriate to the efficient operation of the
Feeder Funds with respect to their investment in the corresponding Master Funds.
Pursuant to its investment advisory agreement with SunAmerica Series Trust, AIG
SAAMCo will provide these services so long as a Feeder Fund is a "feeder fund"
investing in a Master Fund.


AIG SAAMCo has contractually agreed to waive 0.70% of its advisory fee for
so long as the Feeder Fund is operated as a feeder fund. Under the master-feeder
structure, however, each Feeder Fund may withdraw its entire investment from its
corresponding Master Fund if the Feeder Fund Board determines that it is in the
best interests of the Feeder Fund and its shareholders to do so. If the
underlying fund ceases to operate as a "feeder fund," AIG SAAMCo will serve as
investment manager for the Feeder Fund.


The terms "Feeder Fund" and "Master Fund" as used in the Prospectus are
used for ease of relevant disclosure. There are a number of differences between
arrangements commonly referred to as master-feeder funds, and the investments by
the Feeder Funds in the Master Funds described in the Prospectus. These
differences include the following:


- Advisory fees commonly are assessed by the master fund, but not by the
feeder fund. The Master Funds and the Feeder Funds both have investment
advisory fees. (However, as described above, AIG SAAMCo's advisory fee is
solely attributable to administrative services, not portfolio management.
Moreover, AIG SAAMCo has contractually agreed to waive certain Feeder
Fund advisory fees for as long as the Feeder Funds invest in a Master
Fund); and


- Master funds commonly sell their shares only to feeder funds. The Master
Funds in which the Feeder Funds invest also sell their shares to separate
accounts of life insurance companies to fund variable annuity contracts
and variable life insurance contracts issued by the companies.

PERFORMANCE DATA





From time to time the Separate Account may advertise the Cash Management
Portfolio's "yield" and "effective yield." Both yield figures are based on
historical earnings and are not intended to indicate future performance. The
"yield" of the Cash Management Portfolio refers to the net income generated for
a contract funded by an investment in the Portfolio (which invests in shares of
the Cash Management Portfolio of Seasons Series Trust) over a seven-day period
(which period will be stated in the advertisement). This income is then
"annualized." That is, the amount of income generated by the investment during
that week is assumed to be generated each week over a 52-week period and is
shown as a percentage of the investment. The "effective yield" is calculated
similarly but, when annualized, the income earned by an investment in the
Portfolio is assumed to be reinvested at the end of each seven day period. The
"effective yield" will be slightly higher than the "yield" because of the
compounding effect of this assumed reinvestment. Neither the yield nor the
effective yield takes into consideration the effect of any capital changes that
might have occurred during the seven day period, nor do they reflect the impact
of premium taxes or any withdrawal charges. The impact of other recurring
charges (including the mortality and expense risk charge, distribution expense
charge and contract maintenance fee) on both yield figures is, however,
reflected in them to the same extent it would affect the yield (or effective
yield) for a contract of average size.


The Separate Account may advertise "total return" data for its Variable
Portfolios. Total return figures are based on historical data and are not
intended to indicate future performance. The "total return" for a Variable
Portfolio is a computed rate of return that, when compounded annually over a
stated period of time and applied to a hypothetical initial investment in a
contract funded by that Variable Portfolio made at the beginning of the period,
will produce the same contract value at the end of the period that the
hypothetical investment would have produced over the same period (assuming a
complete redemption of the contract at the end of the period.) The effect of
applicable Withdrawal Charges due to the assumed redemption will be reflected in
the return figures, but may be omitted in additional return figures given for
comparison.


For periods starting prior to the date the Variable Portfolios first became
available through the Separate Account, the total return data for the Variable
Portfolios of the Separate Account will be derived from the performance of the
corresponding underlying funds of Seasons Series Trust, ("Trust") modified to
reflect the charges and expenses as if the contract had been in existence since
the inception date of the Trust's underlying fund. Further, returns shown are
for the original class of shares of the Trust, adjusted to reflect the fees and
charges for the newer class of shares (for Class 3) until performance for the
newer class becomes available. However, the actual shares purchased under this
contract are Class 3 of the Trust. Returns of the newer class will be lower than
those of the original class since the newer class of shares is subject to
service fees of 0.25% for the Trust. The inception date of the Class 3 shares in
Seasons Series Trust is November 17, 2003. In some cases a particular Variable
Portfolio may have been available in another contract funded through this
Separate Account. If the Variable Portfolio was incepted in this Separate
Account prior to the offering of this contract, we report standardized contract
performance adjusted for the fees and charges on this contract. We commonly
refer to these performance calculations as hypothetical adjusted historical
returns. Performance figures similarly adjusted but based on underlying Trusts'
performance (outside of this Separate Account) should not be construed to be
actual historical performance of the relevant Separate Account Variable
Portfolio. Rather, they are intended to indicate the historical performance of
the corresponding underlying funds of the Trust adjusted to provide direct
comparability to the performance of the Variable Portfolios after the date the


6





contracts were first offered to the public (which will reflect the effect of
fees and charges imposed under the contracts). The Trust has served since its
inception as underlying investment media for Separate Accounts of other
insurance companies in connection with variable contracts not having the same
fee and charge schedules as those imposed under the contracts.


Performance data for the various Variable Portfolios are computed in the manner
described below.



Cash Management Portfolio



Current yield is computed by first determining the Base Period Return
attributable to a hypothetical contract having a balance of one Accumulation
Unit at the beginning of a 7 day period using the formula:



Base Period Return = (EV - SV - CMF)/(SV)



where:


SV  = value of one Accumulation Unit at the start of a 7 day period


EV  = value of one Accumulation Unit at the end of the 7 day period


CMF   = an allocated portion of the $30 annual Contract Maintenance Fee,
prorated for 7 days


The change in the value of an Accumulation Unit during the 7 day period reflects
the income received minus any expenses accrued, during such 7 day period. The
Contract Maintenance Fee (CMF) is first allocated among the Select Portfolios,
Focused Portfolios and/or Strategies and the general account so that each Select
Portfolio's, Focused Portfolio's and/or Strategy's allocated portion of the fee
is proportional to the percentage of the number of accounts that have money
allocated to that Select Portfolio, Focused Portfolio and/or Strategy. The fee
is further reduced, for purposes of the yield computation, by multiplying it by
the ratio that the value of the hypothetical contract bears to the value of an
account of average size for contracts funded by the Cash Management Portfolio.
Finally, as is done with the other charges discussed above, the result is
multiplied by the fraction 365/7 to arrive at the portion attributable to the 7
day period.


The current yield is then obtained by annualizing the Base Period Return:



Current Yield = (Base Period Return) x (365/7)



The Cash Management Portfolio also quotes an "effective yield" that differs from
the current yield given above in that it takes into account the effect of
dividend reinvestment in the underlying fund. The effective yield, like the
current yield, is derived from the Base Period Return over a 7 day period.
However, the effective yield accounts for dividend reinvestment by compounding
the current yield according to the formula:



Effective Yield = [(Base Period Return + 1)365/7 - 1]



The yield quoted should not be considered a representation of the yield of the
Cash Management Portfolio in the future since the yield is not fixed. Actual
yields will depend on the type, quality and maturities of the investments held
by the underlying fund and changes in interest rates on such investments. But
also on factors such as an owner's account size (since the impact of fixed
dollar charges will be greater for small accounts than for larger accounts.)


Yield information may be useful in reviewing the performance of the Cash
Management Portfolio and for providing a basis for comparison with other
investment alternatives. However, the Cash Management Portfolio's yield
fluctuates, unlike bank deposits or other investments that typically pay a fixed
yield for a stated period of time.


7






Other Variable Portfolios



The Variable Portfolios of the Separate Account other than the Cash Management
Portfolio compute their performance data as "total return."


Total return for a Variable Portfolio represents a single computed annual rate
of return that, when compounded annually over a specified time period (one,
five, and ten years, or since inception) and applied to a hypothetical initial
investment in a contract funded by that Variable Portfolio made at the beginning
of the period, will produce the same contract value at the end of the period
that the hypothetical investment would have produced over the same period. The
total rate of return (T) is computed so that it satisfies the formula:



P (1 + T) TO THE POWER OF n = ERV



where:


P = a hypothetical initial payment of $1,000


T = average annual total return


n = number of years


ERV   = redeemable value of a hypothetical $1,000 payment made at the
beginning of the 1, 5 or 10 year period as of the end of the
period (or fractional portion thereof)


Standardized performance for the Portfolios and Strategies available in this
contract reflect total returns using the method of computation discussed below:


- Using the four year surrender charge schedule available on contracts.


We may, from time to time, advertise other variations of performance along with
the standardized performance as described above.


The total return figures reflect the effect of both non-recurring and recurring
charges. The applicable Withdrawal Charge (if any) is deducted as of the end of
the period, to reflect the effect of the assumed complete redemption. Total
return figures are derived from historical data and are not intended to be a
projection of future performance. FS Variable Annuity Account Five also funds
other contracts which have been in existence longer than the Seasons Elite
Variable Annuity. The one year and since inception numbers for Seasons Elite are
based on other products within FS Variable Annuity Account Five historical data
(which is adjusted for the fees and charges applicable to Seasons Elite) and
represent adjusted actual performance of the Separate Account.


These rates of return do not reflect election of the additional optional
features. As a fee is charged for these features, the rates of return would be
lower if these features were included in the calculations. Total return figures
are based on historical data and are not intended to indicate future
performance.



MarketLock For Two Optional Living Benefit Provisions






MARKETLOCK FOR TWO




What is MarketLock For Two?



MarketLock For Two is an optional guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit designed
to help you create a guaranteed income stream for the life of two spouses. Thus,
MarketLock For Two may offer protection in the event your contract value
declines due to unfavorable investment performance, certain withdrawal activity,
a longer than expected life span, or any combination of these factors.


The feature does not guarantee a withdrawal of an income stream based on any
Purchase Payments made after the second contract anniversary. The feature only
guarantees lifetime withdrawals in the manner described below. You may never
need to rely on MarketLock For Two depending on your contract's market
performance, your withdrawal activity, and your longevity.


The feature may not be appropriate if you plan to make ongoing Purchase
Payments, such as with contributory IRA's or tax-qualified plans. The feature
guarantees only Purchase Payments received in the contract's first two years.


WITHDRAWALS UNDER THE FEATURE ARE TREATED LIKE ANY OTHER WITHDRAWAL FOR THE
PURPOSE OF CALCULATING TAXABLE INCOME, DEDUCTING APPLICABLE WITHDRAWAL CHARGES,
AND REDUCING THE CONTRACT VALUE, FREE WITHDRAWAL AMOUNTS AND ALL OTHER BENEFITS,
FEATURES, AND CONDITIONS OF YOUR CONTRACT. PLEASE SEE ACCESS TO YOUR MONEY

SECTION IN THE PROSPECTUS.


8





Any withdrawals taken may be subject to a 10% IRS tax penalty if your under age
59 1/2 at the time of the withdrawal. For information about how the feature is
treated for income tax purposes, you should consult a qualified tax advisor
concerning your particular circumstances. If you take required minimum
distributions and have elected this feature, your distributions must be set up
on the automated minimum distribution withdrawal program administered by our
Annuity Service Center. In addition, if you have a Qualified contract, tax law
and the terms of the plan may restrict withdrawal amounts.



WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO MODIFY, SUSPEND, OR TERMINATE MARKETLOCK FOR TWO AT ANY
TIME FOR PROSPECTIVELY ISSUED CONTRACTS.




When and how may I elect MarketLock For Two?



You may only elect MarketLock For Two at the time of contract issue and this
feature cannot be elected if you elect any other optional living benefit,
including MarketLock. To elect MarketLock For Two, you must purchase the
contract with your spouse as joint owner or you must designate your spouse as
the sole, primary beneficiary. For Non-qualified contracts, the younger
owner/spousal beneficiary must be at least age 55 and no older than age 75. For
Qualified contracts, the owner and the spousal beneficiary must be at least age
55 and the owner must be no older than age 75 at the time of contract issue.


How does MarketLock For Two work?


MarketLock For Two automatically locks-in the highest Anniversary Value during
the first 10 years (or 20 years if you extend the MAV Evaluation Period, as
discussed below) and guarantees annual withdrawals based on this amount over
your lifetime and the lifetime of your spouse. You may begin taking withdrawals
immediately following the contract issue date. The Maximum Annual Withdrawal
Percentage represents the maximum percentage of your MAV Benefit Base used to
calculate the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount that you may withdraw each year,
and varies depending on the age of the younger spouse at the time of the first
withdrawal.

*     If you are taking required minimum distributions ("RMD") from the
contract, and the portion of the RMD amount based on this contract is
greater than the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount (defined below), that
portion of the withdrawal will not be treated as an excess withdrawal. Any
portion of an RMD withdrawal that is based on amounts other than this
contract will be considered an Excess Withdrawal. Please see "What are the
effects of withdrawals on MarketLock For Two?" below.


How are the components for MarketLock For Two calculated?


FIRST, we determine the ELIGIBLE PURCHASE PAYMENTS, which include the amount of
Purchase Payments received during the first two years after your contract issue
date. Any Purchase Payments we receive more than two years after your contract
issue date are considered INELIGIBLE PURCHASE PAYMENTS. The calculation of
Eligible Purchase Payments does not include any spousal continuation
contributions; however, spousal continuation contributions are included in the
calculation of Anniversary Values, as defined below. SEE SPOUSAL CONTINUATION

SECTION IN THE PROSPECTUS. Eligible Purchase Payments are limited to $1,5000,000
without prior Company approval.


9





SECOND, we consider the MAV EVALUATION PERIOD, which begins on your contract
issue date and ends on your 10th contract anniversary. On the expiration of the
MAV Evaluation Period, you may contact us to extend the MAV Evaluation Period
for an additional period as discussed further below.


THIRD, we determine the ANNIVERSARY VALUE which equals the value of your
contract on any contract anniversary during the MAV Evaluation Period minus any
Ineligible Purchase Payments.


FOURTH, we determine the MAV BENEFIT BASE. Initially, the MAV Benefit Base is
equal to the first Eligible Purchase Payment. Thereafter, the MAV Benefit Base
is increased each time subsequent Eligible Purchase Payments are made, and
adjusted each time any Excess Withdrawals are taken. Please see "What are the
effects of withdrawals on MarketLock For Two?" below. On each contract
anniversary throughout the MAV Evaluation Period, the MAV Benefit Base
automatically adjusts upwards if the current Anniversary Value is greater than
both the current MAV Benefit Base and any previous year's Anniversary Value.
Other than adjustments made for excess withdrawals, the MAV Benefit Base will
only be adjusted upwards, and subsequent lower Anniversary Values through the
MAV Evaluation Period will not result in a lower MAV Benefit Base.


FINALLY, we determine the MAXIMUM ANNUAL WITHDRAWAL AMOUNT, which represents the
maximum amount that may be withdrawn each Benefit Year and is an amount
calculated by multiplying the current MAV Benefit Base by the applicable Maximum
Annual Withdrawal Percentage. The applicable Maximum Annual Withdrawal
Percentage is determined based on the younger spouse's age when you take your
first withdrawal. Applicable percentages are shown in the MarketLock For Two
Summary table above. If the MAV Benefit Base is increased to the current
Anniversary Value, the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount is recalculated on that
contract anniversary by multiplying the new MAV Benefit Base by the applicable
Maximum Annual Withdrawal Percentage. If the MAV Benefit Base is increased for
any Eligible Purchase Payments, the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount will be
recalculated upon receipt of each Eligible Purchase Payments by multiplying the
new MAV Benefit Base by the applicable Maximum Annual Withdrawal Percentage.



What is the fee for MarketLock For Two?



The annualized fee for MarketLock For Two for all years in which the feature is
in effect, is calculated as 0.40% of the MAV Benefit Base prior to any
withdrawal being taken and 0.80% of the MAV Benefit Base after the first
withdrawal is taken. However, if you elect to extend the MAV Evaluation Period
the fee may change at the time of the extension.


You should keep in mind that an increase in the MAV Benefit Base due to an
adjustment to a higher Anniversary Value or due to subsequent Eligible Purchase
Payments will result in an increase to the dollar amount of the fee. The fee
will be calculated and deducted quarterly from the portion of your contract
value allocated to the Variable Portfolios, starting on the first quarter
following your contract issue date and ending upon termination of the Benefit.
The 0.80% fee applicable after the first withdrawal is assessed at the end of
the quarter in which the withdrawal is taken. If your contract value and/or MAV
Benefit Base falls to zero before the


10





feature has been terminated, the fee will no longer be deducted. However, if the
MAV Benefit Base is adjusted upwards at a later date because the current
anniversary value is greater than both the current and any previous anniversary
values, the calculation and deduction of the fee will resume. We will not assess
the quarterly fee if you surrender or annuitize your contract before the end of
a contract quarter.


What are the effects of withdrawals on MarketLock For Two?


The Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount and the MAV Benefit Base may change over
time as a result of the timing and amounts of withdrawals.


Any withdrawals in a Benefit Year that in total are less than or equal to the
Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount, do not reduce the MAV Benefit Base. We define
Excess Withdrawals as either: 1) any portion of a withdrawal that causes the
total withdrawals in a benefit year to exceed the Maximum Annual Withdrawal
Amount; or 2) any withdrawal in a Benefit Year taken after the Maximum Annual
Withdrawal Amount has been withdrawn. Excess Withdrawals will reduce the MAV
Benefit Base in the same proportion by which the contract value is reduced by
the Excess Withdrawal. Excess Withdrawals also result in a reduction to your
Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount because it is recalculated after each Excess
Withdrawal by multiplying the reduced MAV Benefit Base by the existing Maximum
Annual Withdrawal Percentage. In addition, if in any year an Excess Withdrawal
reduces the contract value to zero, MarketLock For Two is terminated and you
will not continue to receive withdrawals over your and your spouse's lifetime.


The impact of withdrawals and the effect on each component of MarketLock For Two
are further explained below:


MAV BENEFIT BASE: If the sum of withdrawals in any Benefit Year does not
exceed the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount, the MAV Benefit Base is not
reduced for those withdrawals. Excess Withdrawals as described above reduce
the MAV Benefit Base as follows:


For each Excess Withdrawal taken, the MAV Benefit Base is reduced in the
same proportion by which the contract value is reduced by each Excess
Withdrawal.


MAXIMUM ANNUAL WITHDRAWAL AMOUNT: The Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount is
recalculated each time there is a change in the MAV Benefit Base.
Accordingly, if the sum of withdrawals in any Benefit Year does not exceed
the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount for that year, the Maximum Annual
Withdrawal Amount will not change for the next year unless your MAV Benefit
Base is adjusted upward (as described above under "How are the components
for MarketLock For Two Calculated?"). If you take an Excess Withdrawal, the
Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount will be recalculated by multiplying the
reduced MAV Benefit Base by the existing Maximum Annual Withdrawal
Percentage. This newly recalculated Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount will be
available beginning on the next contract anniversary and may be lower than
your previous Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount For Two. PLEASE SEE BELOW FOR
EXAMPLES OF THE EFFECTS OF WITHDRAWALS.


What happens if the contract value is reduced to zero?


If the contract value is zero but the MAV Benefit Base is greater than zero, a
Benefit remains payable over your lifetime and the lifetime of your spouse.
However, if at the time an Excess Withdrawal is taken, your contract value is
reduced to zero, no Benefit remains.


The contract's other benefits will be terminated once the contract value equals
zero. You may not make subsequent Purchase Payments or transfers and no death
benefit or future annuity payments are available. Therefore, during times of
unfavorable investment performance, withdrawals taken under the benefit may
reduce the contract value to zero eliminating any other benefits of the
contract.


11





Except as described above, when the contract value equals zero, to receive any
remaining benefit, you may select one of the following income options:


1.  The current Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount, paid equally on a
quarterly, semi-annual or annual frequency as selected by you until the
date of death of the surviving spouse; or


2.  Lump sum distribution of the discounted present value as determined by
us, of the total remaining guaranteed withdrawals; or


3.  Any payment option mutually agreeable between you and us.


If you do not select a payment option, the remaining Benefit will be paid as the
current Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount on a quarterly basis until the date of
death of the surviving spouse.


Can I extend the MAV Evaluation Period beyond 10 years?


Yes. As long as the Benefit is still in effect and the younger spouse is age 85
or younger at the time you elect the extension, they may elect to extend the MAV
Evaluation Period. We guarantee that you will be given the opportunity to extend
the MAV Evaluation Period under these conditions for at least one additional
evaluation period of 10 years. IN ORDER TO EXTEND THE MAV EVALUATION PERIOD, YOU
MUST CONTACT US NO LATER THAN 60 DAYS AFTER THE END OF THE MAV EVALUATION
PERIOD. If you elect to extend the MAV Evaluation Period, the MAV Benefit Base
can continue to be adjusted upward as described above on each anniversary during
the new MAV Evaluation Period. See "How are the components for MarketLock For
Two calculated?" Also, if you extend the MAV Evaluation Period, you should note
that the components of the feature, such as the fee, will change to those in
effect at the time you elect to extend, which may be different from the
components when you initially elected the feature. Additional MAV Evaluation
Periods may be offered at our sole discretion.


If you do not contact us to extend the MAV Evaluation Period, the MAV Benefit
Base will no longer be adjusted for market gains on subsequent contract
anniversaries. However, you can continue to take the Maximum Annual Withdrawal
Amount in effect at the end of the last MAV Evaluation Period, subject to
adjustments for excess withdrawals. You will continue to pay the fee at the rate
that was in effect during the last MAV Evaluation Period and you will not be
permitted to extend the MAV Evaluation Period in the future. ***


What happens to MarketLock For Two upon a spousal continuation?


The components of the feature will not change as a result of a spousal
continuation. A continuing spouse can elect to receive withdrawals in accordance
with the provisions of the MarketLock For Two Summary Table above based on the
age of the younger spouse when the first withdrawal was taken and based on the
MAV Benefit Base at the time of spousal continuation. Alternatively, if contract
value is greater than zero, a continuing spouse may make a death claim under the
death provisions of the contract and terminate the contract and the MarketLock
For Two feature.


If spousal continuation occurs during the MAV Evaluation Period, the continuing
spouse will continue to receive any upward adjustments due to market gains to
the MAV Benefit Base during the period and any spousal continuation contribution
is included in the Anniversary Value. However, spousal continuation
contributions are not considered to be Eligible Purchase Payments. In addition,
the continuing spouse will be eligible to extend the MAV Evaluation Period upon
the expiration of the initial period. (See "Can I extend the MAV Evaluation
Period beyond 10 years?").


Can a non-spousal Beneficiary elect to receive any remaining benefits under
MarketLock For Two upon the death of the second spouse?


No. Upon the death of both spouses, if the contract value is greater than zero,
a non-spousal beneficiary must make an election under the death provisions of
the contract, which terminates MarketLock For Two. SEE DEATH BENEFITS SECTION IN
THE PROSPECTUS.


12





What happens to MarketLock For Two upon the Latest Annuity Date?


If there is remaining contract value and the MAV Benefit Base is greater than
zero on the Latest Annuity Date, you must select one of the following options:


1.  Annuitize the contract value under the contract's annuity provisions; or


2.  Elect to receive the current Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount on the
Latest Annuity Date, paid equally on a quarterly, semi-annual or annual
frequency as selected by you until the date of death of the surviving
spouse, if eligible for lifetime withdrawals, even if the MAV Benefit
Base is zero; or


3.  Any payment option mutually agreeable between you and us.


Upon election of items 1, 2, or 3 above, the Accumulation Phase of your contract
ends and the Income Phase begins. Therefore, if electing Income Payments for the
life of the Annuitant, upon death, no benefit remains and the contract and its
features will terminate.


Can MarketLock For Two be cancelled?


MarketLock For Two may be cancelled on the 5th contract anniversary, the 10th
contract anniversary, or any contract anniversary thereafter. Once MarketLock
For Two is cancelled, you will no longer be charged a fee and the guarantees
under the Benefit are terminated. You may not extend the MAV Evaluation Period
and you may not re-elect MarketLock For Two after cancellation.


Are there circumstances under which MarketLock For Two will automatically
terminate?


The feature automatically terminates upon the occurrence of one of the
following:


1.  Annuitization of the contract; or


2.  Full surrender of the contract; or


3.  A death benefit is paid and the contract is not continued by the spouse;
or


4.  Excess withdrawals that reduce the contract value to zero which then
reduces the MAV Benefit Base to zero; or


5.  Death of surviving original spouse; or


6.  A change in ownership that involves the original owner(s) except as
noted below and under "Are there circumstances under which guaranteed
withdrawals over the lifetime of your spouse is terminated?"


If a change of ownership occurs from a natural person to a non-natural
entity, the original natural owner(s) must also be the annuitant(s) after
the ownership change to prevent termination of MarketLock For Two. A
change of ownership from a non-natural entity to a natural person can only
occur if the new natural owner(s) was the original natural annuitant(s) in
order to prevent termination of MarketLock For Two. Any ownership change
is contingent upon prior review and approval by the Company.


13





Are there circumstances under which guaranteed withdrawals over the lifetime of
your spouse is terminated?


Under any of the following circumstances, MarketLock For Two will provide a
guarantee for your lifetime and not the lifetime of your spouse:


1. One of the two original owners is removed from the contract; or


2. The original spousal beneficiary is removed or replaced; or


3. The original spousal joint owner or spousal beneficiary is removed or
replaced upon divorce; or


4. The original spousal joint owners or spousal beneficiary are no longer
married at the time of death of the first spouse.


Under these circumstances, the original remaining owner continues to pay the fee
for MarketLock For Two and receives the Benefit for his/her lifetime only, or
may choose to terminate the feature as described under "Can MarketLock For Two
be cancelled?"



MARKETLOCK FOR TWO OPTIONAL LIVING BENEFIT EXAMPLES






EXAMPLE 1:



Assume you elect MarketLock For Two and you invest a single Purchase Payment
of $100,000, and that you make no additional Purchase Payments and no
withdrawals before the 1st contract anniversary. Assume that on your 1st
contract anniversary, your contract value is $105,000.


Your initial MAV Benefit Base is equal to 100% of your Eligible Purchase
Payments, or $100,000. On your first contract Anniversary, your MAV Benefit
Base is equal to the greater of your current MAV Benefit Base ($100,000), or
your contract value ($105,000), which is $105,000. Your Maximum Annual
Withdrawal Amount if you were to start taking withdrawals (when the younger
of you and if applicable, your spouse is at least 63 years old but younger
than 76 years old) is 5% of the MAV Benefit Base (5% x $105,000 = $5,250).
Therefore, as of your 1st contract anniversary, you may take up to $105,000
in withdrawals of up to $5,250 annually as long as at least one of you or
your spouse is alive.





EXAMPLE 2:



Assume you elect MarketLock For Two and you invest a single Purchase Payment
of $100,000, and that you make no additional Purchase Payments. Assume that
your contract anniversary values and MAV Benefit Base values are as follows:






ANNIVERSARY                          CONTRACT VALUE    MAV BENEFIT BASE
-----------                          --------------    ----------------
   1st                                 $ 105,000           $ 105,000
   2nd                                 $ 115,000           $ 115,000
   3rd                                 $ 107,000           $ 115,000
   4th                                 $ 110,000           $ 115,000
   5th                                 $ 120,000           $ 120,000








On your 5th anniversary, your contract value is $120,000, and your MAV
Benefit Base is stepped-up to $120,000. Your Maximum Annual Withdrawal
Amount if you were to start taking withdrawals (provided the younger of you
or your spouse is at least 76) is 6% of the MAV Benefit Base (6% x $120,000
= $7,200). Therefore, you may take up to $7,200 annually while at least one
of you or your spouse is alive.


14






EXAMPLE 3 -- IMPACT OF WITHDRAWALS IN EXCESS OF MAXIMUM ANNUAL WITHDRAWAL
AMOUNT:



Assume you elect MarketLock For Two, and you invest a single Purchase
Payment of $100,000 with no additional Purchase Payments and no withdrawals
before the 5th contract anniversary, and contract values and Benefit Base
values are as described in EXAMPLE 2 above. Also assume that during your 6th
contract year, after your 5th contract anniversary, your contract value is
$118,000 and you make your first withdrawal in the amount of $11,632.
Assuming that you or the younger of you or your spouse is at least age 76 at
the time of your first withdrawal, your Maximum Annual Withdrawal percentage
would be 6% of the MAV Benefit Base (6% x $120,000 = $7,200). However
because your withdrawal of $11,632 is greater than your Maximum Annual
Withdrawal Amount ($7,200), this withdrawal includes an Excess Withdrawal.
In this case, the amount of the Excess Withdrawal is the total amount of the
withdrawal less your Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount ($11,632 -- $7,200),
or $4,432. First, we process the portion of your withdrawal that is not the
Excess Withdrawal, which is $7,200. Your contract value after this portion
of the withdrawal is $110,800 ($118,000 -- $7,200), but your Benefit Base is
unchanged. Next, we recalculate your Benefit Base by reducing the Benefit
Base by the proportion by which the contract value was reduced by the Excess
Withdrawal ($4,432/$110,800 = 4%), or $120,000 x 96% which equals $115,200.
Your new Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount is your Benefit Base multiplied by
your Maximum Annual Withdrawal percentage ($115,200 * 6%), which equals
$6,912. Therefore, you may take up to $6,912 annually while at least one of
you or your spouse is alive.



SEASONS INCOME REWARDS OPTIONAL LIVING BENEFIT PROVISIONS






SEASONS INCOME REWARDS




What is Seasons Income Rewards?



Seasons Income Rewards is an optional guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit
designed to help you create a guaranteed income stream. You are guaranteed to
receive withdrawals over a minimum number of years that in total equal at least
Purchase Payments made in the first 90 days after contract issue with an
opportunity for a Step-Up Amount, as described below, adjusted for withdrawals
during that period (the "Benefit"); these withdrawals are guaranteed even if the
contract value falls to zero. Seasons Income Rewards does not guarantee lifetime
withdrawals but it may offer protection in the event your contract value
declines due to unfavorable investment performance. Seasons Income Rewards has
rules and restrictions that are discussed more fully below.


Seasons Income Rewards offers three options. These options provide, over a
minimum number of years, a guaranteed minimum withdrawal amount equal to at
least your Purchase Payments made in the first 90 days (adjusted for
withdrawals) with an opportunity to receive a 10%, 20% or 50% step-up amount
depending on the option elected. If you take withdrawals prior to the Benefit
Availability Date (as defined in the table below), you will receive either no
step-up amount or a reduced step-up amount, depending on the option selected.


Each option and its components are described below. You should read each option
carefully and discuss the feature with your financial representative before
electing an option.



How and when can I elect Seasons Income Rewards?



You may only elect this feature at the time of contract issue. You may not
change the option after election. Please refer to the Seasons Income Rewards
Summary Table below for the age limitations associated with these features.


15





Generally, once you elect Seasons Income Rewards, it cannot be cancelled.


Seasons Income Rewards cannot be elected if you elect any other optional Living
Benefit. Seasons Income Rewards may not be available through the broker-dealer
with which your financial representative is affiliated. Please check with your
financial representative for availability.


How is the Benefit for Seasons Income Rewards calculated?


In order to determine the Benefit, we calculate each of the components as
described below. The Benefit's components and value may vary depending on the
option you choose. The earliest date you may begin taking withdrawals under the
Benefit is the BENEFIT AVAILABILITY DATE. Each one-year period beginning on the
contract issue date and ending on the day before the contract anniversary date
is considered a BENEFIT YEAR.


What are the three Seasons Income Rewards options?


The table below is a summary of the three Seasons Income Rewards options we are
currently offering.

distributions, the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount will be the
greater of: (1) the amount indicated in the table above; or (2) the
annual required minimum distribution amount associated with your
contract value only. Required minimum distributions may reduce your
Minimum Withdrawal Period. PLEASE SEE IMPORTANT INFORMATION SECTION

IN THE PROSPECTUS.


16





How are the components for Seasons Income Rewards calculated?


FIRST, we determine the ELIGIBLE PURCHASE PAYMENTS, which include the amount of
Purchase Payments made to the contract during the first 90 days after your
contract issue date, adjusted for any withdrawals before the Benefit
Availability Date in the same proportion that the withdrawal reduced the
contract value on the date of the withdrawal. The calculation of Eligible
Purchase Payments does not include any Payment Enhancements and/or spousal
continuation contributions. SEE SPOUSAL CONTINUATION SECTION IN THE PROSPECTUS.


SECOND, we determine the WITHDRAWAL BENEFIT BASE. On the Benefit Availability
Date, the Withdrawal Benefit Base equals the sum of all Eligible Purchase
Payments.


THIRD, we determine the STEP-UP AMOUNT, if any, which is calculated as a
specified percentage (listed in the Seasons Income Rewards Summary table above)
of the Withdrawal Benefit Base on the Benefit Availability Date. If you elect
Option 1 or 2, you will not receive a Step-Up Amount if you take any withdrawals
prior to the Benefit Availability Date. If you elect Option 3, the Step-Amount
will be reduced to 30% of the Withdrawal Benefit Base if you take any
withdrawals prior to the Benefit Availability Date. The Step-Up Amount is not
considered a Purchase Payment and cannot be used in calculating any other
benefits, such as death benefits, contract values or annuitization value.


FOURTH, we determine the STEPPED-UP BENEFIT BASE, which is the total amount
available for withdrawal under the feature and is used to calculate the minimum
time period over which you may take withdrawals under the Seasons Income Rewards
feature. The Stepped-Up Benefit Base equals the Withdrawal Benefit Base plus the
Step-Up Amount, if any.


FIFTH, we determine the MAXIMUM ANNUAL WITHDRAWAL AMOUNT, which is a stated
percentage (listed in the Seasons Income Rewards Summary table above) of the
Withdrawal Benefit Base and represents the maximum amount of withdrawals that
are available under this feature each Benefit Year after the Benefit
Availability Date.


FINALLY, we determine the MINIMUM WITHDRAWAL PERIOD, which is the minimum period
over which you may take withdrawals under the Seasons Income Rewards feature.
The Minimum Withdrawal Period is calculated by dividing the Stepped-Up Benefit
Base by the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount.



What is the fee for Seasons Income Rewards?



The annualized Seasons Income Rewards fee will be assessed as a percentage of
the Withdrawal Benefit Base. The fee will be deducted quarterly from the portion
of your contract value allocated to the Variable Portfolios starting on the
first quarter following the contract issue date and ending upon the termination
of the feature. If your contract value falls to zero before the feature has been
terminated, the fee will no longer be assessed. We will not assess the quarterly
fee if you surrender or annuitize before the end of a quarter.


17











CONTRACT YEAR                            ANNUALIZED FEE
-------------                            --------------
 -0-7 years                                   0.65%
 8-10 years                                   0.45%
    11+                                       None








What are the effects of withdrawals on Seasons Income Rewards?


The Benefit amount, Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount and Minimum Withdrawal
Period may change over time as a result of withdrawal activity. Withdrawals
after the Benefit Availability Date equal to or less than the Maximum Annual
Withdrawal Amount generally reduce the Benefit by the amount of the withdrawal.
Withdrawals in excess of the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount will reduce the
Benefit in the same proportion that the contract value was reduced at the time
of the withdrawal. This means if investment performance is down and contract
value is reduced, withdrawals greater than the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount
will result in a greater reduction of the Benefit. The impact of withdrawals and
the effect on each component of Seasons Income Rewards are further explained
through the calculations below:


WITHDRAWAL BENEFIT BASE: Withdrawals prior to the Benefit Availability Date
reduce the Withdrawal Benefit Base in the same proportion that the contract
value was reduced at the time of the withdrawal. Withdrawals prior to the
Benefit Availability Date also eliminate any Step-Up Amount for Options 1 and 2
and reduce the Step-Up Amount to 30% of the Withdrawal Benefit Base for Option
3.


Withdrawals after the Benefit Availability Date will not reduce the Withdrawal
Benefit Base until the sum of withdrawals after the Benefit Availability Date
exceeds the Step-Up Amount.


Thereafter, any withdrawal or portion of a withdrawal will reduce the
Withdrawal Benefit Base as follows:


(1) If the withdrawal does not cause total withdrawals in the Benefit Year
to exceed the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount, the Withdrawal Benefit
Base will be reduced by the amount of the withdrawal, or


(2) If the withdrawal causes total withdrawals in the Benefit Year to exceed
the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount, the Withdrawal Benefit Base is
reduced to the lesser of (a) or (b), where:


a.  is the Withdrawal Benefit Base immediately prior to the withdrawal
minus the amount of the withdrawal, or;


b.  is the Withdrawal Benefit Base immediately prior to the withdrawal
reduced in the same proportion by which the contract value is
reduced by the amount of the withdrawal.


STEPPED-UP BENEFIT BASE: Since withdrawals prior to the Benefit Availability
Date eliminate any Step-Up Amount for Options 1 and 2, the Stepped-Up Benefit
Base will be equal to the Withdrawal Benefit Base if you take withdrawals prior
to the Benefit Availability Date. For Option 3, if you take withdrawals prior to
the Benefit Availability Date, the Stepped-Up Benefit Base will be equal to the
Withdrawal Benefit Base plus the reduced Step-Up Amount which will be 30% of the
Withdrawal Benefit Base, adjusted for such withdrawals.


18





If you do not take withdrawals prior to the Benefit Availability Date, you
will receive the entire Step-Up Amount and the Stepped-Up Benefit Base will
equal the Withdrawal Benefit Base plus the Step-Up Amount.


After the Benefit Availability Date, any withdrawal that does not cause
total withdrawals in a Benefit Year to exceed the Maximum Annual Withdrawal
Amount will reduce the Stepped-Up Benefit Base by the amount of the
withdrawal. After the Benefit Availability Date, any withdrawal that causes
total withdrawals in a Benefit Year to exceed the Maximum Annual Withdrawal
Amount (in that Benefit Year) reduces the Stepped-Up Benefit Base to the
lesser of (a) or (b), where:


a.  is the Stepped-Up Benefit Base immediately prior to the withdrawal
minus the amount of the withdrawal, or;


b.  is the Stepped-Up Benefit Base immediately prior to the withdrawal
reduced in the same proportion by which the contract value is
reduced by the amount of the withdrawal.


MAXIMUM ANNUAL WITHDRAWAL AMOUNT: If the sum of withdrawals in a Benefit Year
does not exceed the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount for that Benefit Year, the
Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount does not change for the next Benefit Year. If
total withdrawals in a Benefit Year exceed the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount,
the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount will be recalculated at the start of the
next Benefit Year. The new Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount will equal the
Stepped-Up Benefit Base on that Benefit Year anniversary divided by the Minimum
Withdrawal Period on that Benefit Year anniversary. The new Maximum Annual
Withdrawal Amount may be lower than your previous Maximum Annual Withdrawal
Amounts.


MINIMUM WITHDRAWAL PERIOD: After each withdrawal, a new Minimum Withdrawal
Period is calculated. If total withdrawals in a Benefit Year are less than
or equal to the current Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount, the new Minimum
Withdrawal Period equals the Stepped-Up Benefit Base after the withdrawal,
divided by the current Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount.


During any Benefit Year in which the sum of withdrawals exceeds the Maximum
Annual Withdrawal Amount, the new Minimum Withdrawal Period equals the
Minimum Withdrawal Period calculated at the end of the prior Benefit Year
reduced by one year.


CONTRACT VALUE: Any withdrawal under the Benefit reduces the contract value
by the amount of the withdrawal.



PLEASE SEE BELOW FOR EXAMPLES OF THE EFFECTS OF WITHDRAWALS.



What happens if my contract value is reduced to zero with Seasons Income
Rewards?


If the contract value is zero but the Stepped-Up Benefit Base is greater than
zero, a Benefit remains payable under the feature until the Benefit Base is
zero. However, the contract and its features and other benefits will be
terminated once the contract value equals zero. Once the contract is terminated,
you may not make subsequent Purchase Payments and no death benefit or future
annuitization payments are available. Therefore, under adverse market
conditions, withdrawals taken under the Benefit may reduce the contract value to
zero eliminating any other benefits of the contract.


To receive your remaining Benefit, you may select one of the following options:


1.  The current Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount, paid equally on a
quarterly, semi-annual or annual frequency as selected by you until the
Stepped-Up Benefit Base equals zero; or


19





2.  Lump sum distribution of the discounted present value as determined by
us, of the total remaining guaranteed withdrawals; or


3.  Any payment option mutually agreeable between you and us.


If you do not select a payment option, the remaining Benefit will be paid as the
current Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount on a quarterly basis.


What happens to Seasons Income Rewards upon a spousal continuation?


A Continuing Spouse may elect to continue or cancel the feature and its
accompanying fee. The components of the feature will not change as a result of a
spousal continuation. However, continuation contributions are not considered to
be Eligible Purchase Payments. SEE SPOUSAL CONTINUATION SECTION IN THE

PROSPECTUS.


Can my non-spousal Beneficiary elect to receive any remaining withdrawals under
Seasons Income Rewards upon my death?


If the contract value is greater than zero when the owner dies, a non-spousal
Beneficiary must make a death claim under the contract provisions, which
terminates Seasons Income Rewards. SEE DEATH BENEFITS SECTION IN THE PROSPECTUS.
If the contract value is zero when the owner dies, meaning that no death benefit
is payable, but the Stepped-Up Benefit Base is greater than zero, a non-spousal
Beneficiary may elect to continue receiving any remaining withdrawals under the
feature. The components of the feature will not change.


Can Seasons Income Rewards be cancelled?


Once you elect Seasons Income Rewards, you may not cancel the feature. However,
there is no charge for Seasons Income Rewards after the 10th contract
anniversary.


Additionally, the feature automatically terminates upon the occurrence of one of
the following:


1.  The Stepped-Up Benefit Base is equal to zero; or


2.  Annuitization of the contract; or


3.  Full surrender of the contract; or


4.  Death benefit is paid; or


5.  Upon a spousal continuation, the Continuing Spouse elects not to
continue the contract with the feature.


What happens to Seasons Income Rewards upon the Latest Annuity Date?


If your contract value and Stepped-Up Benefit Base are greater than zero, and
you begin the Income Phase upon or before the Latest Annuity Date, you will not
receive the benefit of any remaining guaranteed withdrawals under the feature.
Your annuity income payments will be calculated using your contract value and
the selected income option. PLEASE SEE INCOME OPTIONS SECTION IN THE PROSPECTUS.



IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT SEASONS INCOME REWARDS



Seasons Income Rewards is designed to offer protection of your initial
investment in the event of a significant market downturn. Seasons Income Rewards
may not guarantee an income stream based on all Purchase Payments made into your
contract. Seasons Income Rewards does not guarantee investment gains nor does it
guarantee a withdrawal of any subsequent Purchase Payments made after the 90th
day following the contract issue date. This feature also does not guarantee
lifetime income payments. You may never need to rely on Seasons Income Rewards
if your contract performs within a historically anticipated range. However, past
performance is no guarantee of future results.


20





WITHDRAWALS UNDER THIS FEATURE ARE TREATED LIKE ANY OTHER WITHDRAWAL FOR THE
PURPOSE OF REDUCING THE CONTRACT VALUE, FREE WITHDRAWAL AMOUNTS AND ALL OTHER
BENEFITS, FEATURES AND CONDITIONS OF YOUR CONTRACT. PLEASE SEE ACCESS TO YOUR
MONEY SECTION IN THE PROSPECTUS.


If you elect Seasons Income Rewards and need to take withdrawals or are required
to take required minimum distributions ("RMD") under the Internal Revenue Code
from this contract prior to the Benefit Availability Date, you should know that
such withdrawals may negatively affect the value of the Benefit.


Any withdrawals taken may be subject to a 10% IRS tax penalty if you are under
age 59 1/2 at the time of the withdrawal. For information about how the feature
is treated for income tax purposes, you should consult a qualified tax advisor
concerning your particular circumstances. If you set up RMDs and have elected
this feature, your withdrawals must be automated and will not be recalculated on
an annual basis.



WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO MODIFY, SUSPEND OR TERMINATE THE SEASONS INCOME REWARDS
AT ANY TIME FOR PROSPECTIVELY ISSUED CONTRACTS.




Seasons Income Rewards Optional Living Benefit Examples






SEASONS INCOME REWARDS




EXAMPLE 1 OF SEASONS INCOME REWARDS:



Assume you elect Seasons Income Rewards Option 2 and you invest a single
Purchase Payment of $100,000. If you make no additional Purchase Payments and no
withdrawals, your Withdrawal Benefit Base is $100,000 on the Benefit
Availability Date.


Your Stepped-Up Benefit Base equals Withdrawal Benefit Base plus the Step-Up
Amount ($100,000 + (20% x $100,000) = $120,000). Your Maximum Annual Withdrawal
Amount as of the Benefit Availability Date is 10% of your Withdrawal Benefit
Base ($100,000 x 10% = $10,000). The Minimum Withdrawal Period is equal to the
Stepped-Up Benefit Base divided by the Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount, which
is 12 years ($120,000/$10,000). Therefore, you may take up to $120,000 in
withdrawals of up to $10,000 annually over a minimum of 12 years beginning on or
after the Benefit Availability Date.



EXAMPLE 2 -- IMPACT OF WITHDRAWALS PRIOR TO THE BENEFIT AVAILABILITY DATE
FOR SEASONS INCOME REWARDS OPTIONS 1 AND 2:



Assume you elect Seasons Income Rewards Option 2 and you invest a single
Purchase Payment of $100,000. You make a withdrawal of $11,000 prior to the
Benefit Availability Date. Prior to the withdrawal, your contract value is
$110,000. You make no other withdrawals before the Benefit Availability Date.


Immediately following the withdrawal, your Withdrawal Benefit Base is
recalculated by first determining the proportion by which your contract value
was reduced by the withdrawal ($11,000/$110,000 = 10%). Next, we reduce your
Withdrawal Benefit Base by the percentage by which the contract value was
reduced by the withdrawal ($100,000 -- (10% x 100,000) = $90,000). Since the
Step-Up Amount is zero because a withdrawal was made prior to the Benefit
Availability Date, your Stepped-Up Benefit Base on the Benefit Availability Date
equals your Withdrawal Benefit Base. Therefore, the Stepped-Up Benefit Base also
equals $90,000. Your Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount is 10% of the Withdrawal
Benefit Base on the Benefit Availability Date ($90,000). This equals $9,000.
Therefore, you may take withdrawals of up to $9,000 annually over a minimum of
10 years ($90,000/$9,000 = 10).


21






EXAMPLE 3 -- IMPACT OF WITHDRAWALS PRIOR TO THE BENEFIT AVAILABILITY DATE




FOR SEASONS INCOME REWARDS OPTION 3:



Assume you elect Seasons Income Rewards Option 3 and you invest a single
Purchase Payment of $100,000. You make a withdrawal of $11,000 prior to the
Benefit Availability Date. Prior to the withdrawal, your contract value is
$110,000. You make no other withdrawals before the Benefit Availability Date.


Immediately following the withdrawal, your Withdrawal Benefit Base is
recalculated by first determining the proportion by which your contract value
was reduced by the withdrawal ($11,000/$110,000 = 10%). Next, we reduce your
Withdrawal Benefit Base by the percentage by which the contract value was
reduced by the withdrawal ($100,000 -- (10% x 100,000) = $90,000). Since the
withdrawal occurred prior to the Benefit Availability Date, your Step-Up Amount
will be reduced to 30% of your Withdrawal Benefit Base ((30% x $90,000) =
$27,000). Therefore, your Stepped-Up Benefit Base on the Benefit Availability
Date equals the Withdrawal Benefit Base plus the Step-Up Amount (($90,000 +
$27,000) = $117,000). Your Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount is 10% of the
Withdrawal Benefit Base on the Benefit Availability Date ($90,000). This equals
$9,000. Therefore, you may take withdrawals of up to $9,000 annually over a
minimum of 13 years ($117,000/$9,000 = 13).



EXAMPLE 4 -- IMPACT OF WITHDRAWALS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO MAXIMUM ANNUAL
WITHDRAWAL AMOUNT AFTER THE BENEFIT AVAILABILITY DATE FOR SEASONS

INCOME REWARDS:



Assume you elect Seasons Income Rewards Option 2 and you invest a single
Purchase Payment of $100,000. You make a withdrawal of $7,500 during the first
year after the Benefit Availability Date.


Because the withdrawal is less than or equal to your Maximum Annual Withdrawal
Amount ($10,000), your Stepped-Up Benefit Base ($120,000) is reduced by the
total dollar amount of the withdrawal ($7,500). Your new Stepped-Up Benefit Base
equals $112,500. Your Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount remains $10,000. Your new
Minimum Withdrawal Period following the withdrawal is equal to the new
Stepped-Up Benefit Base divided by your current Maximum Annual Withdrawal
Amount, ($112,500/$10,000). Therefore, you may take withdrawals of up to $10,000
annually over a minimum of 11 years, plus $2,500 in the last Benefit Year.



EXAMPLE 5 -- IMPACT OF WITHDRAWALS IN EXCESS OF MAXIMUM ANNUAL WITHDRAWAL
AMOUNT AFTER THE BENEFIT AVAILABILITY DATE FOR SEASONS INCOME

REWARDS:



Assume you elect Seasons Income Rewards Option 2 and you invest a single
Purchase Payment of $100,000. Your Withdrawal Benefit Base is $100,000 and your
Stepped-Up Benefit Base is $120,000. You make a withdrawal of $15,000 during the
first year after the Benefit Availability Date. Your contract value is $125,000
at the time of the withdrawal.


Because the withdrawal is greater than your Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount
($10,000), we recalculate your Stepped-Up Benefit Base ($120,000) by taking the
lesser of two calculations. For the first calculation, we deduct the amount of
the withdrawal from the Stepped-Up Benefit Base ($120,000 -- $15,000 =
$105,000). For the second calculation, we deduct the amount of the Maximum
Annual Withdrawal Amount from the Stepped-Up Benefit Base ($120,000 -- $10,000 =
$110,000). Next, we calculate the excess portion of the withdrawal ($5,000) and
determine the proportion by which the contract value was reduced by the excess
portion of the withdrawal ($5,000 /$125,000 = 4%). Finally we reduce $110,000 by
that proportion (4%) which equals $105,600. Your Stepped-Up Benefit Base is the
lesser of these two calculations or $105,000. The Minimum Withdrawal Period
following the withdrawal is equal to the Minimum Withdrawal Period at the end of
the prior year (12 years) reduced by one year (11 years). Your Maximum Annual
Withdrawal Amount is your Stepped-Up Benefit Base divided by your Minimum
Withdrawal Period ($105,000/11), which equals $9,545.45.

ANNUITY INCOME PAYMENTS






Initial Monthly Annuity Income Payment



The initial annuity income payment is determined by taking the contract value,
less any premium tax, less any Market Value Adjustment that may apply in the
case of a premature annuitization of CERTAIN guarantee amounts, and then
applying it to the annuity table specified in the contract. Those tables are
based on a set amount per $1,000 of proceeds applied. The appropriate rate must
be determined by the sex (except where, as in the case of certain Qualified
contracts and other employer-sponsored retirement plans, such classification is
not permitted) and age of the Annuitant and designated second person, if any.
The dollars applied are then divided by 1,000 and the result multiplied by the
appropriate annuity factor appearing in the table to compute the amount of the
first monthly annuity payment. In the case of a variable annuity, that amount is
divided by the value of an Annuity Unit as of the Annuity Date to establish the
number of Annuity Units representing each variable annuity income payment. The
number of Annuity Units determined for the first variable annuity income payment
remains constant for the second and subsequent monthly variable annuity income
payments, assuming that no reallocation of contract values is made.



Subsequent Monthly Annuity Income Payments



For a fixed annuity, the amount of the second and each subsequent monthly
annuity income payment is the same as that determined above for the first
monthly payment.


The amount of the second and each subsequent monthly variable annuity income
payment is determined by multiplying the number of Annuity Units, as determined
in connection with the determination of the initial monthly payment, above, by
the Annuity Unit Value as of the day preceding the date on which each annuity
income payment is due.





ANNUITY UNIT VALUES





The value of an Annuity Unit is determined independently for each Variable
Portfolio. The annuity tables contained in the contract are based on a 3.5% per
annum assumed investment rate. If the actual net investment rate experienced by
a Variable Portfolio exceeds 3.5%, variable annuity payments derived from
allocations to that Variable Portfolio will increase over time. Conversely, if
the actual rate is less than 3.5%, variable annuity income payments will
decrease over time. If the net investment rate equals 3.5%, the variable annuity
payments will remain constant. If a higher assumed investment rate had been
used, the initial monthly annuity income payment would be higher, but the actual
net investment rate would also have to be higher in order for annuity income
payments to increase (or not to decrease).


The payee receives the value of a fixed number of Annuity Units each month. The
value of a fixed number of Annuity Units will reflect the investment performance
of the Variable Portfolio elected, and the amount of each annuity income payment
will vary accordingly. For each Variable Portfolio, the value of an Annuity Unit
is determined by multiplying the Annuity Unit value for the preceding month by
the Net Investment Factor for the month for which the Annuity Unit value is
being calculated. The result is then multiplied by a second factor which offsets
the effect of the assumed net investment rate of 3.5% per annum which is assumed
in the annuity tables contained in the contract.



Net Investment Factor



The Net Investment Factor ("NIF") is an index applied to measure the net
investment performance of Variable Portfolio from one month to the next. The NIF
may be greater or less than or equal to one; therefore, the value of an Annuity
Unit may increase, decrease or remain the same.


23





The NIF for any Variable Portfolio for a certain month is determined by dividing

(a) by (b) where:


(a) is the Accumulation Unit value of the Variable Portfolio determined as of
the end of that month, and (b) is the Accumulation Unit value of the Variable
Portfolio determined as of the end of the preceding month.


The NIF for a Variable Portfolio for a given month is a measure of the net
investment performance of the Variable Portfolio from the end of the prior month
to the end of the given month. A NIF of 1.000 results from no change; a NIF
greater than 1.000 results from an increase; and a NIF less than 1.000 results
from a decrease. The NIF is increased (or decreased) in accordance with the
increases (or decreases, respectively) in the value of the shares of the
underlying investment portfolios in which the Variable Portfolio invests; it is
also reduced by Separate Account asset charges.



Illustrative Example



Assume that one share of a given Variable Portfolio had an Accumulation Unit
value of $11.46 as of the close of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") on the
last business day in September; that its Accumulation Unit value had been $11.44
at the close of the NYSE on the last business day at the end of the previous
month. The NIF for the month of September is:


NIF = ($11.46/$11.44) = 1.00174825


The change in Annuity Unit value for a Variable Portfolio from one month to the
next is determined in part by multiplying the Annuity Unit value at the prior
month end by the NIF for that Variable Portfolio for the new month. In addition,
however, the result of that computation must also be multiplied by an additional
factor that takes into account, and neutralizes, the assumed investment rate of
3.5 percent per annum upon which the annuity income payment tables are based.
For example, if the net investment rate for a Variable Portfolio (reflected in
the NIF) were equal to the assumed investment rate, the variable annuity income
payments should remain constant (i.e., the Annuity Unit value should not
change). The monthly factor that neutralizes the assumed investment rate of 3.5
percent per annum is:


1/[(1.035)/\(1/12)] = 0.99713732


In the example given above, if the Annuity Unit value for the Variable Portfolio
was $10.103523 on the last business day in August, the Annuity Unit value on the
last business day in September would have been:


$10.103523 x 1.00174825 x 0.99713732 = $10.092213


To determine the initial payment, the initial annuity income payment for
variable annuitization is calculated based on our mortality expectations and an
assumed interest rate (AIR) of 3.5%. Thus the initial variable annuity income
payment is the same as the initial payment for a fixed interest payout annuity
calculated at an effective rate of 3.5%.


The NIF measures the performance of the funds that are the basis for the amount
of future annuity income payments. This performance is compared to the AIR, and
if the growth in the NIF is the same as the AIR rate the payment remains the
same as the prior month. If the rate of growth of the NIF is different than the
AIR, then the payment is changed proportionately to the ratio (1+NIF)/(1+AIR),
calculated on a monthly basis. If the NIF is greater than the AIR, then this
proportion is greater than one and payments are increased. If the NIF is less
than the AIR, then this proportion is less than one and payments are decreased.

Variable Annuity Income Payments




Illustrative Example



Assume that a male owner, P, owns a contract in connection with which P has
allocated all of his contract value to a single Variable Portfolio. P is also
the sole Annuitant and, at age 60, has elected to annuitize his contract as a
life annuity with 120 monthly payments guaranteed. As of the last valuation
preceding the Annuity Date, P's Account was credited with 7543.2456 Accumulation
Units each having a value of $15.432655, (i.e., P's Account Value is equal to
7543.2456 x $15.432655 = $116,412.31). Assume also that the Annuity


Unit value for the Variable Portfolio on that same date is $13.256932, and that
the Annuity Unit value on the day immediately prior to the second annuity income
payment date is $13.327695.


P's first variable annuity income payment is determined from annuity rate
tables, using the information assumed above. From the tables, which supply
monthly annuity income payments for each $1,000 of applied contract value, P's
first variable annuity payment is determined by multiplying the monthly
installment of $4.79 (Option 4 tables, male Annuitant age 60 at the Annuity Date
annuitizing in 2010) by the result of dividing P's account value by $1,000:



First Payment = $4.79 x ($116,412.31/$1,000) = $557.61



The number of P's Annuity Units (which will be fixed; i.e., it will not change
unless he transfers his Account to another Account) is also determined at this
time and is equal to the amount of the first variable annuity income payment
divided by the value of an Annuity Unit on the day immediately prior to
annuitization:



Annuity Units = $557.61/$13.256932 = 42.062143



P's second variable annuity income payment is determined by multiplying the
number of Annuity Units by the Annuity Unit value as of the day immediately
prior to the second payment due date:



Second Payment = 42.062143 x $13.327695 = $560.59



The third and subsequent variable annuity income payments are computed in a
manner similar to the second variable annuity income payment.


Note that the amount of the first variable annuity income payment depends on the
contract value in the relevant Variable Portfolio on the Annuity Date and thus
reflects the investment performance of the Variable Portfolio net of fees and
charges during the Accumulation Phase. The amount of that payment determines the
number of Annuity Units, which will remain constant during the Annuity Phase
(assuming no transfers from the Variable Portfolio). The net investment
performance of the Variable Portfolio during the Annuity Phase is reflected in
continuing changes during this phase in the Annuity Unit value, which determines
the amounts of the second and subsequent variable annuity income payments.



Additional Provisions



We will require proof of age and sex of the Annuitant before making any life
annuity income payment provided for by the contract. If the age or sex of the
Annuitant has been misstated, we will compute the amount payable based on the
correct age and sex. If annuity income payments have begun, any underpayment
that may have been made will be paid in full with the next annuity income
payment, including interest at the minimum annual rate of 3%. Any overpayments,
including interest at the minimum annual rate of 3%, unless repaid to us in one
sum, will be deducted from future annuity income payments until we are repaid in
full.


25





If a contract provision requires that a person be alive, we may require due
proof that the person is alive before we act under that provision.


We will give the payee under an annuity income payment option a settlement
contract for the payment option.


You may assign the contract prior to the Annuity Date. You must send a dated and
signed written request to our Administrative Office accompanied by a duly
executed copy of any assignment. We are not responsible for the validity of any
assignment.





TAXES






GENERAL



Note: We have prepared the following information on taxes as a general
discussion of the subject. It is not intended as tax advice to any individual.
You should consult your own tax adviser about your own circumstances.


Section 72 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code" or
"IRC") governs taxation of annuities in general. An owner is not taxed on
increases in the value of a contract until distribution occurs, either in the
form of a non-annuity distribution or as income payments under the annuity
option elected. For a lump-sum payment received as a total surrender (total
redemption), the recipient is taxed on the portion of the payment that exceeds
the cost basis of the contract. For a payment received as a withdrawal (partial
redemption), federal tax liability is determined on a last-in, first-out basis,
meaning taxable income is withdrawn before the cost basis of the contract is
withdrawn. A different rule applies to Purchase Payments made (including, if
applicable, in the case of a contract issued in exchange for a prior contract)
prior to August 14, 1982. Those Purchase Payments are considered withdrawn first
for federal income tax purposes, followed by earnings on those Purchase
Payments. For Non-qualified contracts, the cost basis is generally the Purchase
Payments. The taxable portion of the lump-sum payment is taxed at ordinary
income tax rates. Tax penalties may also apply.


If you purchase your contract under a pension plan, a specially sponsored
employer program, as an individual retirement annuity, or under an individual
retirement account, your contract is referred to as a qualified contract.
Examples of qualified plans or arrangements are: Individual Retirement Annuities
and Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), Roth IRAs, Tax-Sheltered Annuities
(also referred to as 403(b) annuities or 403(b) contracts), plans of
self-employed individuals (often referred to as H.R. 10 Plans or Keogh Plans),
pension and profit sharing plans including 401(k) plans, and governmental 457(b)
plans. Typically, for employer plans and tax-deductible IRA contributions, you
have not paid any tax on the Purchase Payments used to buy your contract and
therefore, you have no cost basis in your contract. However, you normally will
have a cost basis in a Roth IRA, a Roth 403(b) or a Roth 401(k) account, and you
may have cost basis in a traditional IRA or in another qualified contract.


For annuity payments, the portion of each payment that is in excess of the
exclusion amount is includible in taxable income. The exclusion amount for
payments based on a fixed annuity option is determined by multiplying the
payment by the ratio that the cost basis of the Contract (if any, and adjusted
for any period or refund feature) bears to the expected return under the
Contract. The exclusion amount for payments based on a variable annuity option
is determined by dividing the cost basis of the Contract (adjusted for any
period certain or refund guarantee) by the number of years over which the
annuity is expected to be paid. Payments received after the investment in the
Contract has been recovered (i.e. when the total of the excludable amount equals
the investment in the Contract) are fully taxable. The taxable portion is taxed
at ordinary income tax rates. For certain types of qualified plans there may be
no cost basis in the Contract within the meaning of Section 72 of the Code.
Owners, annuitants and beneficiaries under the Contracts should seek competent
financial advice about the tax consequences of any distributions.


26





The Company is taxed as a life insurance company under the Code. For federal
income tax purposes, the Separate Account is not a separate entity from the
Company and its operations form a part of the Company.






WITHHOLDING TAX ON DISTRIBUTIONS



Generally, you have not paid any federal taxes on the Purchase Payments used to
buy a qualified contract. As a result, most amounts withdrawn from the contract
or received as income payments will be taxable income. Exceptions to this
general rule include withdrawals attributable to after-tax Roth IRA, Roth

403(b), and Roth 401(k) contributions. Withdrawals from Roth IRAs are generally
treated for federal tax purposes as coming first from the Roth contributions
that have already been taxed, and as entirely tax free. Withdrawals from Roth
403(b) and Roth 401(k) accounts, and withdrawals generally from qualified
contracts, are treated generally as coming pro-rata from amounts that already
have been taxed and amounts that are taxed upon withdrawal. Withdrawals from
Roth IRA, Roth 403(b) and Roth 401(k) accounts which satisfy certain
qualification requirements, including at least five years in a Roth account
under the plan or IRA and either attainment of age 59 1/2, death or disability
(or, if an IRA for the purchase of a first home), will not be subject to federal
income taxation.


The taxable portion of any withdrawal or income payment from a qualified
contract will be subject to an additional 10% federal penalty tax, under the
IRC, except in the following circumstances:


o   after attainment of age 59 1/2;


o   when paid to your beneficiary after you die;


o   after you become disabled (as defined in the IRC);


o as a part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not
less frequently than annually) made for your life (or life expectancy) or the
joint lives (or joint expectancies) of you and your designated beneficiary for a
period of 5 years or attainment of age 59 1/2, whichever is later;


o   payments to employees after separation from service after
attainment of age 55 (does not apply to IRAs);


o   dividends paid with respect to stock of a corporation described in
IRC Section 404(k);


o for payment of medical expenses to the extent such withdrawals do not
exceed limitations set by the IRC for deductible amounts paid during the taxable
year for medical care;


o   payments to alternate payees pursuant to a qualified domestic
relations order (does not apply to IRAs);


o   for payment of health insurance if you are unemployed and meet
certain requirements;


27





o   distributions from IRAs for higher education expenses;


o   distributions from IRAs for first home purchases;


o amounts distributed from a Code Section 457(b) plan other than
amounts representing rollovers from an IRA or employer sponsored plan to which
the 10% penalty would otherwise apply.


The Pension Protection Act of 2006 created other distribution events and
exemptions from the 10% early withdrawal penalty tax. These include payments to
certain reservists called up for active duty between September 11, 2001 and
December 31, 2007 and payments up to $3,000 per year for health, life and
accident insurance by certain retired public safety officers which are federal
tax-free.


The Code generally requires the Company (or, in some cases, a plan
administrator) to withhold federal tax on the taxable portion of any
distribution or withdrawal from a contract. For eligible rollover distributions"
from contracts issued under certain types of qualified plans, not including
IRAs, 20% of the distribution must be withheld, unless the payee elects to have
the distribution "rolled over" or transferred to another eligible plan in a
direct "trustee-to- trustee" transfer. This requirement is mandatory and cannot
be waived by the owner. Withholding on other types of distributions, including
distributions from IRAs can be waived. An "eligible rollover distribution" is
the taxable portion of any amount received by a covered employee from a
traditional IRA or retirement plan qualified under Sections 401 or 403 or, if
from a plan of a governmental employer, under Section 457(b) of the Code, or
from a tax-sheltered annuity qualified under Section 403(b) of the Code other
than (1) substantially equal periodic payments calculated using the life (or
life expectancy) of the employee, or joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of
the employee and his or her designated Beneficiary, or for a specified period of
ten years or more; (2) financial hardship withdrawals; and (3) minimum
distributions required to be made under the Code (4) distribution of
contributions to a qualified contract which were made in excess of the
applicable contribution limit. Failure to "roll over" the entire amount of an
eligible rollover distribution (including an amount equal to the 20% portion of
the distribution that was withheld) could have adverse tax consequences,
including the imposition of a federal penalty tax on premature withdrawals,
described later in this section. Only (1) the participant, or, (2) in the case
of the participant's death, the participant's surviving spouse, or (3) in the
case of a domestic relations order, the participant's spouse or ex-spouse may
roll over a distribution into a plan of the participant's own. An exception to
this rule is that a non-spousal beneficiary may, subject to plan provisions,
roll inherited funds from an eligible retirement plan into an Inherited IRA. An
Inherited IRA is an IRA created for the sole purpose of receiving funds
inherited by non-spousal beneficiaries of eligible retirement plans. The
distribution must be transferred to the Inherited IRA in a direct
"trustee-to-trustee" transfer. Inherited IRAs must meet the distribution
requirements relating to IRAs inherited by non-spousal beneficiaries under Code
sections 408(a)(6) and (b)(3) and 401(a)(9).


Beginning in 2008, subject to federal income limitations, funds in a qualified
contract may be rolled directly over to a Roth IRA.


28





Withdrawals or distributions from a contract other than eligible rollover
distributions are also subject to withholding on the taxable portion of the
distribution, but the owner may elect in such cases to waive the withholding
requirement. If not waived, withholding is imposed (1) for periodic payments, at
the rate that would be imposed if the payments were wages, or (2) for other
distributions, at the rate of 10%. If no withholding exemption certificate is in
effect for the payee, the rate under (1) above is computed by treating the payee
as a married individual claiming 3 withholding exemptions.



DIVERSIFICATION - SEPARATE ACCOUNT INVESTMENTS



Section 817(h) of the Code imposes certain diversification standards on the
underlying assets of Non-qualified variable annuity contracts. These
requirements generally do not apply to qualified contracts, which are considered
"Pension Plan Contracts" for purposes of these Code requirements. The Code
provides that a variable annuity contract will not be treated as an annuity
contract for any period (and any subsequent period) for which the investments
are not adequately diversified, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the
United States Treasury Department ("Treasury Department"). Disqualification of
the contract as an annuity contract would result in imposition of federal income
tax to the owner with respect to earnings allocable to the contract prior to the
receipt of any payments under the contract. The Code contains a safe harbor
provision which provides that annuity contracts, such as your contract, meet the
diversification requirements if, as of the close of each calendar quarter, the
underlying assets meet the diversification standards for a regulated investment
company, and no more than 55% of the total assets consist of cash, cash items,
U.S. government securities and securities of other regulated investment
companies.


The Treasury Department has issued regulations which establish diversification
requirements for the investment portfolios underlying variable contracts such as
the contracts. The regulations amplify the diversification requirements for
variable contracts set forth in the Code and provide an alternative to the safe
harbor provision described above. Under the regulations an investment portfolio
will be deemed adequately diversified if (1) no more than 55% of the value of
the total assets of the portfolio is represented by any one investment; (2) no
more than 70% of the value of the total assets of the portfolio is represented
by any two investments; (3) no more than 80% of the value of the total assets of
the portfolio is represented by any three investments; and (4) no more than 90%
of the value of the total assets of the portfolio is represented by any four
investments. For purposes of determining whether or not the diversification
standards imposed on the underlying assets of variable contracts by Section
817(h) of the Code have been met, "each United States government agency or
instrumentality shall be treated as a separate issuer."



NON-NATURAL OWNERS



Under Section 72(u) of the Code, the investment earnings on premiums for the
Contracts will be taxed currently to the Owner if the Owner is a non-natural
person, e.g., a corporation or certain other entities. Such Contracts generally
will not be treated as annuities for federal income tax purposes. However, this
treatment is not applied to a Contract held by a trust or other entity as an
agent for a natural person or to Contracts held by qualified plans. Purchasers
should consult their own tax counsel or other tax adviser before purchasing a
Contract to be owned by a non-natural person.


29






MULTIPLE CONTRACTS



The Code provides that multiple Non-qualified annuity contracts which are issued
within a calendar year to the same contract owner by one company or its
affiliates are treated as one annuity contract for purposes of determining the
federal tax consequences of any distribution. Such treatment may result in
adverse tax consequences including more rapid taxation of the distributed
amounts from such combination of contracts. For purposes of this rule, contracts
received in a Section 1035 exchange will be considered issued in the year of the
exchange. (However, they may be treated as issued on the issue date of the
contract being exchanged, for certain purposes, including for determining
whether the contract is an immediate annuity contract.) Owners should consult a
tax adviser prior to purchasing more than one Non-qualified annuity contract
from the same issuer in any calendar year.



TAX TREATMENT OF ASSIGNMENTS OF QUALIFIED CONTRACTS



Generally, a qualified contract, including an IRA, may not be assigned or
pledged. One exception to this rule is if the assignment is part of a permitted
loan program under an employer-sponsored plan or pursuant to a qualified
domestic relations order meeting the requirements of the plan or arrangement
under which the contract is issued (or, in the case of an IRA, pursuant to a
decree of divorce or separation maintenance or a written instrument incident to
such decree.)



TAX TREATMENT OF GIFTING, ASSIGNING OR TRANSFERRING OWNERSHIP OF A NON-QUALIFIED
CONTRACT



Under IRC Section 72(e)(4)(c), if you transfer ownership of your Non-qualified
Contract to a person other than your spouse (or former spouse if incident to
divorce) for less than adequate consideration you will be taxed on the earnings
above the purchase payments at the time of transfer. If you transfer ownership
of your Non-qualified Contract and receive payment less than the Contract's
value, you will also be liable for the tax on the Contract's value above your
purchase payments not previously withdrawn.


The new Contract owner's purchase payments (basis) in the Contract will be
increased to reflect the amount included in your taxable income.



FEDERAL WITHDRAWAL RESTRICTIONS FROM QUALIFIED CONTRACTS



The IRC limits the withdrawal of Purchase Payments from certain Tax-Sheltered
Annuities (TSAs) and certain other qualified contracts. Withdrawals can only be
made when an owner: (1) reaches age 59 1/2 (70 1/2 in the case of Section 457(b)
Plans); (2) separates from employment from the employer sponsoring the plan; (3)
dies; (4) becomes disabled (as defined in the IRC) (does not apply to section
457(b) plans); or (5) experiences a financial hardship (as defined in the IRC).
In the case of hardship, the owner can only withdraw Purchase Payments.
Transfers of


30





amounts from one qualified contract to another investment option under the same
plan, or to another contract or account of the same plan type or from a
qualified plan to a state defined benefit plan to purchase service credits are
not considered distributions, and thus are not subject to these withdrawal
limitations. Such transfers may, however, be subject to limitations under the
annuity contract or Plan. On July 26, 2007, the Department of the Treasury
published final 403(b) regulations that are largely effective on January 1,
2009. These comprehensive regulations include several new rules and
requirements, such as a requirement that employers maintain their 403(b) plans
pursuant to a written plan. The final regulations, subsequent IRS guidance, and
the terms of the written plan may impose new restrictions on both new and
existing contracts, including restrictions on the availability of loans,
distributions, transfers and exchanges, regardless of when a contract was
purchased.


Prior to the effective date of the final regulations, provisions applicable to
tax-free transfers AND exchanges (both referred to below as "transfers") of
403(b) annuity contracts or custodial accounts became effective September 25,
2007, replacing existing rules under IRS Revenue Ruling 90-24 ("90-24
transfer"). Under these new rules, transfers are available only to the extent
permitted under the employer's 403(b) plan once established. Additionally,
transfers occurring after September 24, 2007 that do not comply with these new
rules can become taxable on January 1, 2009, or the date of the transfer,
whichever is later. If you make a transfer to a contract or custodial account
THAT IS NOT PART OF THE EMPLOYER'S 403(b) PLAN (OTHER THAN A TRANSFER TO A
CONTRACT OR CUSTODIAL ACCOUNT IN A DIFFERENT PLAN), and the provider and
employer fail to enter into an information sharing agreement by January 1, 2009,
the TRANSFER would be considered a "failed" TRANSFER that is subject to tax.
Additional guidance issued by the IRS generally permits a failed TRANSFER to be
corrected no later than June 30, 2009 by re-transferring to a contract or
custodial account that is PART OF THE EMPLOYER'S 403(b) PLAN or that is subject
to an information-sharing agreement with the employer.


In general, certain contracts originally established by a 90-24 transfer prior
to September 25, 2007 are exempt (or grandfathered) from some of the
requirements of the final regulations; provided that no salary reduction or
other contributions have ever been made to the contract, and that no additional
transfers are made to made to the contract on or after September 25, 2007.
Further, contracts that are not grandfathered are generally required to be part
of, and subject to the requirements of an employer's 403(b) plan upon its
establishment, but no later than by January 1, 2009.


The new rules in the final regulations generally do not affect a participant's
ability to transfer some or all of a 403(b) account to a state-defined benefit
plan to purchase service credits, where such a transfer is otherwise consistent
with applicable rules and requirements and with the terms of the employer's
plan.


You may wish to discuss the new regulations and/or the general information above
with your tax advisor.



PARTIAL 1035 EXCHANGES OF NON-QUALIFIED ANNUITIES



Section 1035 of the Code provides that a Non-qualified annuity contract may be
exchanged in a tax-free transaction for another Non-qualified annuity contract.
Historically, it was generally understood that only the exchange of an entire
annuity contract, as opposed to a partial exchange, would be respected by the
IRS as a tax-free exchange. In 1998, the U.S. Tax Court ruled that the direct
transfer of a portion of an annuity contract into another annuity contract


31





qualified as a tax-free exchange. In 1999, the IRS acquiesced in that Tax Court
decision, but stated that it would nonetheless continue to challenge partial
exchange transactions under certain circumstances. In Notice 2003-51, published
on July 9, 2003, the IRS announced that, pending the publication of final
regulations, it will consider all the facts and circumstances to determine
whether a partial exchange and subsequent withdrawal from, or surrender of,
either the surviving annuity contract or the new annuity contract within 24
months of the partial exchange should be treated as an integrated transaction,
and thus whether the two contracts should be treated as a single contract to
determine the tax treatment of the surrender or withdrawal under Section 72 of
the Code. Although Notice 2003-51 and the IRS's acquiescence in the Tax Court
decision indicate that the IRS will respect partial exchanges of annuity
contracts under certain circumstances, uncertainty remains, and owners should
seek their own tax advice regarding such transactions and the tax risks
associated with subsequent surrenders or withdrawals.



QUALIFIED PLANS



The contracts offered by this prospectus are designed to be available for use
under various types of qualified plans. Taxation of owners in each qualified
plan varies with the type of plan and terms and conditions of each specific
plan. Owners and Beneficiaries are cautioned that benefits under a qualified
plan may be subject to limitations under the IRC and the employer-sponsored
plan, in addition to the terms and conditions of the contracts issued pursuant
to the plan.


Following are general descriptions of the types of qualified plans with which
the contracts may be used. Such descriptions are not exhaustive and are for
general information purposes only. The tax rules regarding qualified plans are
very complex and will have differing applications depending on individual facts
and circumstances. Each purchaser should obtain competent tax advice prior to
purchasing a contract issued under a qualified plan.


Contracts issued pursuant to qualified plans include special provisions
restricting contract provisions that may otherwise be available and described in
this prospectus. Generally, contracts issued pursuant to qualified plans are not
transferable except upon surrender or annuitization. Various penalty and excise
taxes may apply to contributions or distributions made in violation of
applicable limitations. Furthermore, certain contractual withdrawal penalties
and restrictions may apply to surrenders from qualified contracts.


(a) Plans of Self-Employed Individuals: "H.R. 10 Plans"


Section 401 of the Code permits self-employed individuals to establish qualified
plans for themselves and their employees, commonly referred to as "H.R. 10" or
"Keogh" Plans. Contributions made to the plan for the benefit of the employees
will not be included in the gross income of the employees, for federal tax
purposes, until distributed from the plan. The tax consequences to owners may
vary depending upon the particular plan design. However, the Code places
limitations and restrictions on these plans, such as: amounts of allowable
contributions; form, manner and timing of distributions; vesting and
non-forfeitability of interests; nondiscrimination in eligibility and
participation; and the tax treatment of distributions, withdrawals and
surrenders. Purchasers of contracts for use with an H.R. 10 Plan should obtain
competent tax advice as to the tax treatment and suitability of such an
investment.


32





(b) Tax-Sheltered Annuities


Section 403(b) of the Code permits the purchase of "tax-sheltered annuities" by
public schools and certain charitable, education and scientific organizations
described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Code. These qualifying employers may make
contributions to the contracts for the benefit of their employees. Such
contributions are not includible in the gross income of the employee until the
employee receives distributions from the contract. The amount of contributions
to the tax-sheltered annuity is limited to certain maximums imposed by the Code.


One of these limits, on the amount that the employee may contribute on a
voluntary basis, is imposed by the annuity contract as well as by the Code. That
limit for 2007 is the lesser of 100% of includible compensation or $15,500. The
limit may be increased by up to $3,000 for certain employees with at least
fifteen years of full-time equivalent service with an eligible employer, and by
an additional $5,000 in 2008 for employees age 50 or older, provided that other
applicable requirements are satisfied. Total combined employer and employee
contributions for 2008 may not exceed the lesser of $46,000 or 100% of
compensation. Furthermore, the Code sets forth additional restrictions governing
such items as transferability, distributions, nondiscrimination and withdrawals.
Any employee should obtain competent tax advice as to the tax treatment and
suitability of such an Investment.


(c) Individual Retirement Annuities


Section 408(b) of the Code permits eligible individuals to contribute to an
individual retirement program known as a traditional "Individual Retirement
Annuity" ("IRA"). Under applicable limitations, certain amounts may be
contributed to an IRA which will be deductible from the individual's gross
income. The ability to deduct an IRA contribution to a traditional IRA is
subject to limits based upon income levels, retirement plan participation
status, and other factors. The maximum IRA (traditional and/or Roth)
contribution for 2008 is the lesser of $5,000 or 100% of compensation.
Individuals age 50 or older may be able to contribute an additional $1,000 in
2008. IRAs are subject to limitations on eligibility, contributions,
transferability and distributions. Sales of contracts for use with IRAs are
subject to special requirements imposed by the Code, including the requirement
that certain informational disclosure be given to persons desiring to establish
an IRA. Purchasers of contracts to be qualified as IRAs should obtain competent
tax advice as to the tax treatment and suitability of such an investment. If
neither the Owner or the Owner's spouse is covered by an employer retirement
plan, the IRA contribution may be fully deductible. If the Owner, or if filing
jointly, the Owner or spouse, is covered by an employer retirement plan, the
Owner may be entitled to only a partial (reduced) deduction or no deduction at
all, depending on adjusted gross income, The rules concerning what constitutes
"coverage" are complex and purchasers should consult their tax advisor or
Internal Revenue Service Publication 590 for more details. The effect of income
on the deduction, is sometimes called the adjusted gross income limitation (AGI
limit). A modified AGI at or below a certain threshold level allows a full
deduction of contributions regardless of coverage under an employer's plan. If
you and your spouse are filing jointly and have a modified AGI of less than
$85,000, your contribution may be fully deductible; if your income is between
$85,000 and $95,000, your contribution may be partially deductible and if your
income is $95,000 or more, your contribution may not be deductible. If you are
single and your income is less than $53,000, your contribution may be fully
deductible; if your income is between $53,000 and $63,000,


33





your contribution may be partially deductible and if your income is $63,000 or
more, your contribution may not be deductible. If you are married filing
separately and you lived with your spouse at anytime during the year, and your
income exceeds $10,000, none of your contribution may be deductible.


(d) Roth IRAs


Section 408(A) of the Code permits an individual to contribute to an individual
retirement program called a Roth IRA. Contributions to a Roth IRA are not
deductible but distributions are tax-free if certain requirements are satisfied.
The maximum IRA (traditional and/or Roth) contribution for 2008 is the lesser of
$5,000 or 100% of compensation. Individuals age 50 or older may be able to
contribute an additional $1,000 in 2008. Unlike traditional IRAs, to which
everyone can contribute even if they cannot deduct the full contribution, Roth
IRAs have income limitations on who can establish such a contract. Generally,
you can make a full or partial contribution to a Roth IRA if you have taxable
compensation and your modified adjusted gross income is less than: $169,000 for
married filing jointly or qualifying widow(er), $10,000 for married filing
separately and you lived with your spouse at any time during the year, and
$116,000 for single, head of household, or married filing separately and you did
not live with your spouse at any time during the year. Certain persons may be
eligible to convert a traditional IRA into a Roth IRA.


Conversions or rollovers from qualified plans into Roth IRAs normally require
taxes to be paid on any previously untaxed amounts included in the amount
converted. If the Contracts are made available for use with Roth IRAs, they may
be subject to special requirements imposed by the Internal Revenue Service
("IRS"). Purchasers of the Contracts for this purpose will be provided with such
supplementary information as may be required by the IRS or other appropriate
agency.


(e) Pension and Profit-Sharing Plans


Section 401(a) of the Code permits certain employers to establish various types
of retirement plans, including 401(k) plans, for employees. However,
governmental employers may not establish new 401(k) plans. These retirement
plans may permit the purchase of the contracts to provide benefits under the
plan. Contributions to the plan for the benefit of employees will not be
includible in the gross income of the employee until distributed from the plan.
The tax consequences to owners may vary depending upon the particular plan
design. However, the Code places limitations on all plans on such items as
amount of allowable contributions; form, manner and timing of distributions;
investing and non-forfeitability of interests; nondiscrimination in eligibility
and participation; and the tax treatment of distributions, withdrawals and
surrenders. Purchasers of contracts for use with pension or profit sharing plans
should obtain competent tax advice as to the tax treatment and suitability of
such an investment.


(f) Deferred Compensation Plans - Section 457(b)


Under Section 457(b) of the Code, governmental and certain other tax-exempt
employers may establish, for the benefit of their employees, deferred
compensation plans, which may invest in


34





annuity contracts. The Code, as in the case of employer sponsored retirement
plans generally establishes limitations and restrictions on eligibility,
contributions and distributions. Under these plans, contributions made for the
benefit of the employees will not be includible in the employees' gross income
until distributed from the plan. Funds in a non-governmental 457(b) plan remain
assets of the employer and are subject to claims by the creditors of the
employer. As of January 1, 1999, all 457(b) plans of state and local governments
must hold assets and income in a qualifying trust, custodial account, or annuity
contract for the exclusive benefit of participants and their Beneficiaries.



ECONOMIC GROWTH AND TAX RELIEF RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2001 AND PENSION
PROTECTION ACT OF 2006



For tax years beginning in 2002, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief
Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA) expanded the range of eligible tax-free
rollover distributions that may be made among qualified plans and increased
contribution limits applicable to these plans. The changes made to the IRC by
EGTRRA were scheduled to expire on December 31, 2010. The Pension Protection Act
of 2006 made permanent those provisions of EGTRRA relating to IRAs and employer
sponsored plans.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM



To the Board of Directors of First SunAmerica Life Insurance Company and the
Contractholders of its separate account, FS Variable Annuity Account Five


In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of portfolio investments, and the related statements of operations
and of changes in net assets present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of each of the Variable Accounts constituting FS Variable
Annuity Account Five, a separate account of First SunAmerica Life Insurance
Company (the "Separate Account") at April 30, 2008, the results of their
operations for the year then ended and the changes in their net assets for each
of the two years in the period then ended, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Separate Account's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits, which included confirmation of securities at April 30, 2008 by
correspondence with the custodian, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



1.   ORGANIZATION


FS Variable Annuity Account Five of First SunAmerica Life Insurance Company
(the "Separate Account") is an investment account of First SunAmerica Life
Insurance Company (the "Company"). The Company is a direct wholly owned
subsidiary of SunAmerica Life Insurance Company, which is a subsidiary of
AIG Retirement Services, Inc., the retirement services and asset management
organization within American International Group, Inc. ("AIG"). AIG is a
holding company, which through its subsidiaries is engaged in a broad range
of insurance and insurance-related activities, financial services,
retirement savings and asset management. The Separate Account is registered
as a unit investment trust pursuant to the provisions of the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended.


The Separate Account offers the following variable annuity products:

Seasons Triple Elite, Seasons Select II, and Seasons Elite.


The Separate Account contracts are sold through the Company's affiliated
broker-dealers, independent broker-dealers, full-service securities firms
and financial institutions. The distributor of these contracts is AIG
SunAmerica Capital Services, Inc., an affiliate of the Company. No
underwriting fees are paid in connection with the distribution of the
contracts.


The Separate Account is composed of a total of 18 variable portfolios and 4
variable strategies of Class 3 (the "Variable Accounts"). Each of the
Variable Accounts is invested solely in the shares of one of the following:

four Class 3 multi-managed variable investment strategies (the "Seasons
Strategies"), ten Class 3 variable portfolios (the "Select Portfolios"),
four Class 3 focused portfolios (the "Focused Portfolios"), and four Class
3 managed allocation portfolios (the "Managed Allocation Portfolios"), each
with a distinct investment objective. The Seasons Strategies are comprised
of Growth, Moderate Growth, Balanced Growth, and Conservative Growth. Each
strategy invests in the shares of a designated multi-managed portfolio of
the Seasons Series Trust (the "Trust") and in two other portfolios of the
Trust. Each of the Select Portfolios, Managed Allocation Portfolios, and
Focused Portfolios is invested solely in the shares of a designated
portfolio of the Trust. The Trust is a diversified, open-ended affiliated
investment company, which retains an investment advisor to assist in its
investment activities. The contract holder may elect to have investments
allocated to the guaranteed-interest funds of the Company (the "General
Account"), which are not a part of the Separate Account. The financial
statements include balances allocated by the participant to the Seasons
Strategies, Select Portfolios, Managed Allocation Portfolios, and Focused
Portfolios and do not include balances allocated to the General Account.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES


INVESTMENT ACCOUNTING AND VALUATION: The investments are stated at the net
asset value of each of the portfolios of the Trusts as determined at the
close of business day. Purchases and sales of shares of the portfolios are
valued at the net asset values of such portfolios, which value their
investment securities at fair value, on the date the shares are purchased
or sold. Dividends and capital gains distributions are recorded on the
ex-distribution date. Realized gains and losses on the sale of investments
in the Trusts are recognized at the date of sale and are determined on a
first-in, first-out basis. Accumulation unit values are computed daily
based on total net assets of the portfolios.


Effective May 1, 2007, the Separate Account changed its method of
determining cost of investments sold by the Trusts from an average cost
method to the first-in, first-out method. Management believes that the
first-in, first-out method is more commonly used for financial reporting by
separate accounts and is a preferable method of accounting. Since
investments are stated at net asset value of each of the portfolios of the
Trusts, which value their investment securities at fair value, the change
has no impact on net assets. The change in method of determining cost of
investments sold will result in a reclassification between realized gains
and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation of investments,
beginning May 1, 2007, with no impact on the total increase (decrease) in
net assets from operations. Since records of purchases and sales of
investments are not readily available for prior periods, it is
impracticable to determine the prior periods reclassification between
realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation of
investments.


FEDERAL INCOME TAXES: The Company qualifies for federal income tax
treatment granted to life insurance companies under subchapter L of the
Internal Revenue Service Code (the "Code"). The operations of the Separate
Account are part of the total operations of the Company and are not taxed
separately. Under the current provisions of the Code, the Company does not
expect to incur federal income taxes on the earnings of the Separate
Account to the extent that the earnings are credited under the contracts.
Based on this, no charge is being made currently to the Separate Account
for federal income taxes. The Separate Account is not treated as a
regulated investment company under the Code.


USE OF ESTIMATES: The preparation of financial statements in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
amounts reported therein. Actual results could differ from these estimates.


RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS: In September 2006, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157,
"Fair Value Measurements" (the "Statement"). This Statement defines fair
value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally
accepted accounting principles, and

FS VARIABLE ANNUITY ACCOUNT FIVE

OF

FIRST SUNAMERICA LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY




NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)


requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements. This
Statement does not require any new fair value measurements, but the
application of this Statement could change current practices in determining
fair value. The Separate Account will adopt this guidance effective May 1,
2008. The Separate Account's adoption of this guidance is not expected to
have a material effect on the Separate Account's financial position and
results of operations.


3.   CHARGES AND DEDUCTIONS


Charges and deductions are applied against the current value of the
Separate Account and are paid as follows.


WITHDRAWAL CHARGE: Each contract provides that in the event that a contract
holder withdraws all or a portion of the contract value during the
surrender charge period, withdrawal charges may be assessed on the excess
of the free withdrawal amounts as defined in the contract. The withdrawal
charges are based on tables of charges applicable to the specific
contracts, with a maximum charge of up to 9% (applicable to contracts with
the Seasons Rewards) of any amount withdrawn that exceeds the free
withdrawal amount. Withdrawal charges are recorded as redemptions in the
accompanying Statement of Changes in Net Assets.


CONTRACT MAINTENANCE CHARGE: An annual contract maintenance charge of $30
($35 for Seasons Elite) is charged against certain contracts, which
reimburses the Company for expenses incurred in establishing and
maintaining records relating to the contracts. The contract maintenance
charge will be assessed on each anniversary during the accumulation phase.
In the event that a total surrender of contract value is made, the entire
charge is assessed as of the date of surrender, and deducted from that
withdrawal. The contract maintenance charge is recorded as a charge in the
Statement of Changes in Net Assets.


SEPARATE ACCOUNT ANNUAL CHARGE: The Company deducts a separate account
annual charge comprised of mortality and expense risk charges and
distribution expense charges, computed on a daily basis. Separate Account
annual charges are recorded as a charge in the Statement of Operations. The
total annual rates of the net asset value of each Seasons Strategy/Select
Portfolio/Managed Allocation Portfolio/Focused Portfolio, depending on any
optional death benefits elected for each product, are as follows: Seasons
Triple Elite, 1.55% or 1.75%; Seasons Select II, 1.40% or 1.60%; Seasons
Elite, 1.55% or 1.75%. The mortality risk charge is compensation for the
mortality risks assumed by the Company from its contractual obligations to
make annuity payments after the contract has annuitized for the life of the
annuitant and to provide the standard death benefit. The expense risk
charge is compensation for assuming the risk that the current contract
administration charges will be insufficient in the future to cover the cost
of administering the contract. The distribution

FS VARIABLE ANNUITY ACCOUNT FIVE

OF

FIRST SUNAMERICA LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY




NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



3.   CHARGES AND DEDUCTIONS (continued)


expense charge is deducted at an annual rate of 0.15% of the net asset
value of each Seasons Strategy/Select Portfolio/ Managed Allocation
Portfolio/Focused Portfolio and is included in the respective separate
account annual charge rate. This charge is for all expenses associated with
the distribution of the contract. If this charge is not sufficient to cover
the cost of distributing the contract, the Company will bear the loss.


TRANSFER FEE: A transfer fee of $25, depending on the contract provisions,
may be assessed on each transfer of funds in excess of the maximum
transactions allowed within a contract year and is recorded as a redemption
in the accompanying Statement of Changes in Net Assets.


SEASONS PROMISE FEE: The optional Seasons Promise Program provides a
guaranteed minimum contract value at the end of ten full contract years.
The fee is up to 0.65% of the contract value less the purchase payments
received after the 90th day from the contract issue date. The fee is
deducted quarterly from the contract value during the first full ten years,
and is recorded as a redemption in the accompanying Statement of Changes in
Net Assets.


MARKETLOCK, MARKETLOCK FOR TWO, MARKETLOCK FOR LIFE PLUS AND SEASONS INCOME
REWARDS FEE: The optional MarketLock, MarketLock for Two, MarketLock for
Life Plus and Seasons Income Rewards features provide a guaranteed
withdrawal stream by locking in market gains during an applicable
evaluation period. The MarketLock, MarketLock for Two and Seasons Income
Rewards features are offered in Seasons Triple Elite, Seasons Elite and
Seasons Select II. The annual fee is 0.65% for MarketLock, 0.40% prior to
the first withdrawal and 0.80% after the first withdrawal for MarketLock
for Two and 0.65% in years 0-7 and 0.45% in years 8-10 for Seasons Income
Rewards, of the Maximum Anniversary Value Benefit Base or Withdrawal
Benefit Base (as described below), deducted quarterly from the contract
value and is recorded as a redemption in the accompanying Statement of
Changes in Net Assets. The Maximum Anniversary Value Benefit Base for
MarketLock and MarketLock for Two is calculated as the greater of eligible
purchase payments received during the first two years, adjusted for
withdrawals or the maximum anniversary date contract value occurring in the
first ten contract years, adjusted for withdrawals. The Withdrawal Benefit
Base for Seasons Income Rewards is calculated as eligible purchase payments
adjusted for withdrawals received during the first 90 days.


The MarketLock for Life Plus feature is offered in Seasons Select II and
Seasons Elite. The annual fee ranges from 0.65% to 0.75% for one covered
person or from 0.90% to 1.00% for two covered persons, of the Maximum
Anniversary Value Benefit Base, deducted quarterly from the contract value
and recorded as a redemption in the accompanying Statement of Changes in
Net Assets. The Maximum Anniversary Values Benefit Base for MarketLock for
Life Plus is calculated as the greater of purchase

payments made in the first contract year and purchase payments made in
contract years 2-5, capped at 100% of purchase payments made in the first
year or the highest anniversary date contract value less purchase payments
in years 2-5 over the first year purchase payments.


PREMIUM TAXES: Premium taxes or other taxes payable to a state or other
governmental entity will be charged against the contract values. The rate
will range up to 3.5%. Some states assess premium taxes at the time
purchase payments are made; whereas some states assess premium taxes at the
time annuity payments begin or at the time of surrender. There are certain
states that do not assess premium taxes. The Company currently deducts
premium taxes at the time of surrender or upon annuitization; however, it
reserves the right to deduct any premium taxes when incurred or upon
payment of the death benefit. Premium taxes are recorded as redemptions in
the Statement of Changes in Net Assets.


SEPARATE ACCOUNT INCOME TAXES: The Company currently does not maintain a
provision for taxes, but has reserved the right to establish such a
provision for taxes in the future if it determines, in its sole discretion,
that it will incur a tax as a result of the operation of the Separate
Account.

(1)  These amounts represent the annualized contract expenses of the variable
account, consisting of distribution, mortality and expense charges, for
each period indicated. The ratios include only those expenses that result
in a direct reduction to unit values. Charges made directly to contract
owner accounts through the redemption of units and expenses of the
underlying investment portfolio have been excluded. For additional
information on charges and deductions, see footnote 3.


(2)  These amounts represent the dividends, excluding distributions of capital
gains, received by the variable account from the underlying investment
portfolio, net of management fees assessed by the portfolio manager,
divided by the average net assets. These ratios exclude those expenses,
such as mortality and expense charges, that are assessed against contract
owner accounts either through reductions in the unit values or the
redemption of units. The recognition of investment income by the variable
account is affected by the timing of the declaration of dividends by the
underlying portfolio in which the variable account invests. The average net
assets are calculated by adding ending net asset balances at the end of
each month of the year and dividing it by the number of months that the
portfolio had an ending asset balance during the year.


(3)  These amounts represent the total return for the periods indicated,
including changes in the value of the underlying investment portfolio and
expenses assessed through the reduction of unit values. These ratios do not
include any expenses assessed through the redemption of units. Investment
options with a date notation indicate the effective date of that investment
option in the variable account. The total return is calculated for each
period indicated or from the effective date through the end of the
reporting period.


(4)  For Period from December 20, 2004 (inception) to April 30, 2005.


(5)  For Period from February 14, 2005 (inception) to April 30, 2005.


(6)  Individual contract unit fair values are not all within the range presented
due to differences in the unit fair value at a product's launch date and
other market conditions.


(7)  Individual contract total returns are not all within the total return range
presented due to a variable account being added to a product during the
year.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM



To the Board of Directors and Shareholder of
First SunAmerica Life Insurance Company:


In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheet and the related statements of
income and comprehensive income (loss) and of cash flows present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of First SunAmerica Life Insurance
Company (the "Company"), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of American
International Group, Inc., at December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2007 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

FIRST SUNAMERICA LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005



1.   NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND ORGANIZATION


First SunAmerica Life Insurance Company (the "Company") is a direct wholly
owned subsidiary of SunAmerica Life Insurance Company (the "Parent"), which
is a wholly owned subsidiary of AIG Retirement Services, Inc. ("AIGRS"), a
wholly owned subsidiary of American International Group, Inc. ("AIG"). AIG
is a holding company which, through its subsidiaries, is engaged in a broad
range of insurance and insurance-related activities in the United States
and abroad. AIG's activities include general insurance and life insurance
and retirement services, financial services and asset management.


The Company is a New York-domiciled life insurance company principally
engaged in the business of writing annuity contracts directed to the market
for tax-deferred, long-term savings products. Other than its contract to
reinsure credit life and health insurance policies discussed in Note 8, the
majority of the Company's revenues are derived from customers in the State
of New York. Products are marketed through affiliated and independent
broker-dealers, full-service securities firms and financial institutions.
Four financial institutions represented approximately 18%, 12%, 11% and 10%
of deposits in the year ended December 31, 2007. Four financial
institutions represented approximately 16%, 12%, 11% and 11% of deposits in
the year ended December 31, 2006. No other independent selling organization
was responsible for more than 10% of deposits for any such periods.


The operations of the Company are influenced by many factors, including
general economic conditions, monetary and fiscal policies of the federal
government, and policies of state and other regulatory authorities. The
level of sales of the Company's financial products is influenced by many
factors, including general market rates of interest, the strength, weakness
and volatility of equity markets, and terms and conditions of competing
financial products. The Company is exposed to the typical risks normally
associated with a portfolio of fixed-income securities, namely interest
rate, option, liquidity and credit risk. The Company controls its exposure
to these risks by, among other things, closely monitoring and matching the
duration and cash flows of its assets and liabilities, monitoring and
limiting prepayment and extension risk in its portfolio, maintaining a
large percentage of its portfolio in highly liquid securities, and engaging
in a disciplined process of underwriting, reviewing and monitoring credit
risk. The Company also is exposed to market risk, as market volatility may
result in reduced fee income in the case of assets held in separate
accounts.


During the second half of 2007, disruption in the global credit markets,
coupled with the repricing of credit risk, and the U.S. housing market
deterioration, particularly in the fourth quarter, created increasingly
difficult conditions in the financial markets. These conditions have
resulted in greater volatility, less liquidity, widening of credit spreads
and a lack of price transparency in certain markets and have made it more
difficult to value certain of the Company's invested assets and the
obligations and collateral relating to certain financial instruments issued
or held by the Company.


2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES


BASIS OF PRESENTATION: The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
("GAAP"). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
Actual results could differ, possibly materially, from those estimates.
Certain reclassifications and format changes have been made to prior period
amounts to conform to the current period presentation.


CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS: Cash and short-term investments consist of
cash on hand and non-interest bearing demand deposits, interest-bearing
cash equivalents, time deposits, and investments with original maturities
within one year from the date of purchase, such as commercial paper.

2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)


INVESTMENTS IN FIXED MATURITIES: Fixed maturities available for sale
consist of bonds, notes and redeemable preferred stocks and are carried at
fair value. Premiums and discounts arising from the purchase of fixed
maturities available for sale are treated as yield adjustments over their
estimated lives, until maturity, or call date, if applicable. Unrealized
gains or losses from available for sale investments in fixed maturities are
reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss,
net of deferred acquisition costs, other deferred expenses and income tax,
in shareholder's equity. Investments in fixed maturities are recorded on a
trade-date basis.


The Company evaluates its investments for other-than-temporary impairment.
The determination that a security has incurred an other-than-temporary
impairment in value and the amount of any loss recognized requires the
judgment of the Company's management and a continual review of its
investments. A security is considered a candidate for other-than-temporary
impairment if it meets any of the following criteria:


-    Trading at a significant (25 percent or more) discount to par,
amortized cost (if lower) or cost for an extended period of time
(nine consecutive months or longer);


-    The occurrence of a discrete credit event resulting in (i) the
issuer defaulting on a material outstanding obligation; (ii) the
issuer seeking protection from creditors under the bankruptcy
laws or any similar laws intended for court supervised
reorganization of insolvent enterprises; or (iii) the issuer
proposing a voluntary reorganization pursuant to which creditors
are asked to exchange their claims for cash or securities having
a fair value substantially lower than par value of their claims;
or


-    The Company may not realize a full recovery on its investment
regardless of the occurrence of one of the foregoing events.


The above criteria also consider circumstances of a rapid and severe market
valuation decline, such as that experienced in current credit markets, in
which the Company could not reasonably assert that the recovery period
would be temporary. At each balance sheet date, the Company evaluates its
securities holdings with unrealized losses. When the Company does not
intend to hold such securities until they have recovered their cost basis,
based on the circumstances at the date of evaluation, the Company records
the unrealized loss in income. If a loss is recognized from a sale
subsequent to a balance sheet date pursuant to changes in circumstances,
the loss is recognized in the period in which the intent to hold the
securities to recovery no longer existed. In periods subsequent to the
recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment charge for fixed
maturities, which is not credit or foreign exchange related, the Company
generally accretes the discount or amortizes the reduced premium resulting
from the reduction in cost basis over the remaining life of the security.


MORTGAGE AND OTHER LOANS: Mortgage and other loans include mortgage loans
on real estate and collateral, commercial and guaranteed loans. All such
loans are carried at unpaid principal balances less credit allowances and
plus or minus adjustments for the accretion or amortization of discount and
premium. Interest income on such loans is accrued as earned. Impairment of
mortgage loans on real estate and collateral and commercial loans is based
on certain risk factors and when collection of all amounts due under the
contractual terms is not probable. This impairment is generally measured
based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the
loan's effective interest rate subject to the fair value of underlying
collateral. Interest income on such impaired loans is recognized as cash is
received. The Company did not record a credit allowance for mortgage and
other loans as of December 31, 2007 and 2006.


POLICY LOANS: Policy loans are carried at unpaid principal amount. There is
no allowance for policy loans because these loans serve to reduce the death
benefit paid when the death claim is made and the balances are effectively
collateralized by the cash surrender value of the policy.

SECURITIES LENDING INVESTED COLLATERAL AND SECURITIES LENDING PAYABLE: The
Company lends securities through an agreement with an affiliated lending
agent, which authorizes the agent to lend securities held in the Company's
portfolio to a list of authorized borrowers. The affiliated lending agent
receives primarily cash collateral in an amount in excess of the market
value of the securities loaned. The affiliated lending agent monitors the
daily market value of securities loaned with respect to the collateral
value and obtains additional collateral when necessary to ensure that the
collateral received is maintained at a minimum of 102% of the value of the
loaned securities (105% for cross-currency loans). The collateral is held
in a custodial account for the beneficial interest of the Company and other
affiliated lenders, and is not available for the general use of the
Company. The collateral is reinvested in short-term investments and fixed
maturity securities, primarily floating-rate bonds. Securities lending
collateral investments in fixed maturity securities are carried at fair
value and accounted for in a manner consistent with other
available-for-sale fixed maturity securities. Unrealized gains and losses
on these collateral investments are reflected within accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss), net of deferred acquisition costs, other
deferred expenses and income tax in shareholder's equity. Securities
lending collateral investments are subject to review for
other-than-temporary impairment in a manner consistent with other
available-for-sale fixed maturity securities. The Company's allocated
portion of income earned on the collateral investments, net of interest
repaid to the borrowers under the securities lending agreements and the
related management fees paid to administer the program, is recorded as net
investment income in the statement of income and comprehensive income

(loss). The Company's allocated portion of any realized investment gains or
losses on the collateral investments is recorded in the statement of income
and comprehensive income (loss).


The fair values of the securities pledged under the securities lending
agreement were $1,965,871,000 and $1,149,653,000 as of December 31, 2007
and 2006, respectively, and are included in fixed maturities available for
sale in the balance sheet.


DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: The Company issues certain variable
annuity products that offer optional guaranteed minimum account value
("GMAV") and guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit ("GMWB") living
benefits. Under Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards ("FAS") No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("FAS 133"), the GMAV and GMWB are
considered embedded derivatives that are required to be bifurcated from the
host contract and carried at fair value. The fair value of the GMAV and
GMWB requires significant management estimates and is based on the present
value of expected benefits to be paid less the present value of fee income
associated with the guarantees. The fair value estimate of the GMAV and
GMWB guarantees include unobservable inputs such as management's estimate
of contract holder behavior as well as such observable inputs as swap
curves and market calibrated implied volatility. The GMAV and GMWB are
reported in other assets or other liabilities in the accompanying balance
sheet. The changes in fair value of the Company's derivative instruments
are reported in net realized investment loss in the accompanying statement
of income and comprehensive income (loss).


GMAV is a feature offered on certain variable annuity products. If
available and elected by the contract holder at the time of contract
issuance, this feature guarantees that the account value under the contract
will at least equal the amount of the deposits invested during the first
ninety days of the contract, adjusted for any subsequent withdrawals, at
the end of a ten-year waiting period. The Company bears the risk that
protracted under-performance of the financial markets could result in GMAV
benefits being higher than the underlying contract holder account balance
and that the fees collected under the contract are insufficient to cover
the costs of the benefit to be provided.

2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)


GMWB is a feature offered on certain variable annuity products. If
available and elected by the contract holder at the time of contract
issuance, this feature provides a guaranteed annual withdrawal stream at
the end of a specified wait period, if any, regardless of market
performance. The guaranteed withdrawal stream is based upon deposits
invested during a specified period adjusted for subsequent withdrawals, and
may include an increase in the benefit base. The Company bears the risk
that protracted under-performance of the financial markets could result in
GMWB benefits being higher than the underlying contract holder account
balance and that the fees collected under the contract are insufficient to
cover the costs of the benefit to be provided.


DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS ("DAC"): Policy acquisition costs represent
those costs, including commissions and other underwriting expenses that
vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new business.
Policy acquisition costs related to universal life and investment-type
products are deferred and amortized, with interest, in relation to the
incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over the estimated
lives of the contracts in accordance with FAS No. 97, "Accounting and
Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Long-Duration Contracts and
for Realized Gains and Losses from the Sale of Investments" ("FAS 97").
Estimated gross profits are composed of net interest income, net realized
investment gains and losses, fees, surrender charges, expenses, and
mortality and morbidity gains and losses. If estimated gross profits change
significantly, DAC is recalculated using the new assumptions. Any resulting
adjustment is included in income as an adjustment to DAC. DAC is grouped
consistent with the manner in which the insurance contracts are acquired,
serviced and measured for profitability and is reviewed for recoverability
based on the current and projected future profitability of the underlying
insurance contracts.


The DAC for investment-type products is also adjusted with respect to
estimated gross profits as a result of changes in the net unrealized gains
or losses on fixed maturities available for sale. Because fixed maturities
available for sale are carried at aggregate fair value, an adjustment is
made to DAC equal to the change in amortization that would have been
recorded if such securities had been sold at their stated aggregate fair
value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields. The change in this
adjustment, net of tax, is included with the change in net unrealized gains
or losses on fixed maturities available for sale that is credited or
charged directly to accumulated other comprehensive loss.


OTHER DEFERRED EXPENSES: The Company offers sales inducements, which
include enhanced crediting rates or bonus payments to contract holders on
certain annuity products. Sales inducements provided to the contract holder
are primarily recognized as part of the liability for separate and variable
accounts in the balance sheet. Such amounts are deferred and amortized over
the life of the contract using the same methodology and assumptions used to
amortize DAC. To qualify for such accounting treatment, these bonus
payments must be explicitly identified in the contract at inception, and
the Company must demonstrate that such amounts are incremental to amounts
the company credits on similar contracts without these bonus payments, and
are higher than the contract's expected ongoing crediting rates for periods
after the bonus period.


SEPARATE AND VARIABLE ACCOUNTS: The assets supporting the variable portion
of both traditional variable annuities and variable contracts with
guarantees are carried at fair value and reported as separate and variable
account assets with an equivalent summary total reported as separate and
variable account liabilities when the separate account qualifies for
separate account treatment under American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants Statement of Position 03-1, "Accounting and Reporting by
Insurance Enterprises for Certain Nontraditional Long-Duration Contracts
and for Separate Accounts" ("SOP 03-1"). Separate and variable accounts
represent funds for which investment income and investment gains and losses
accrue directly to the contract holders who bear the investment risk. Each
account has specific investment objectives. The assets of each account are
legally segregated and are not subject to claims that arise out of any
other business of the Company. Amounts assessed against the contract
holders for mortality, administrative, and other services and features are
included in variable annuity policy fees in the statement of income and
comprehensive income (loss).

RESERVES FOR FIXED ANNUITY AND UNIVERSAL LIFE INSURANCE CONTRACTS: Reserves
for fixed annuity and universal life insurance contracts are accounted for
in accordance with FAS 97 and are recorded at accumulated value (deposits
received, plus accrued interest, less withdrawals and assessed fees).
Deposits collected on non-traditional life and annuity insurance products
are not reflected as revenues in the Company's statement of income and
comprehensive income (loss), as they are recorded directly to contract
holder liabilities upon receipt.


RESERVES FOR GUARANTEED BENEFITS: The Company follows SOP 03-1, which
requires recognition of a liability for guaranteed minimum death benefits
("GMDB") related to variable annuity and variable life contracts as well as
certain disclosures for these products. This liability is included in other
liabilities on the balance sheet.


The Company reports variable annuity contracts through separate and
variable accounts, or general accounts when not qualified for separate
account reporting, when the Company contractually guarantees to the
contract holder either (a) total deposits made to the contract less any
partial withdrawals plus a minimum return (and in minor instances, no
minimum returns) or (b) the highest contract value attained, typically on
any anniversary date minus any subsequent withdrawals following the
contract anniversary.


The Company offers GMDB options that guarantee to contract holders, that
upon death, the contract holder's beneficiary will receive the greater of

(1) the contract holder's account value, or (2) a guaranteed minimum death
benefit that varies by product and election by contract owner. The Company
bears the risk that death claims following a decline in the debt and equity
markets may exceed contract holder account balances, and that the fees
collected under the contract are insufficient to cover the costs of the
benefit to be provided. The GMDB liability is determined by estimating the
expected value of death benefits in excess of the projected account balance
and recognizing the excess ratably over the accumulation period based on
total expected assessments. The Company regularly evaluates estimates used
and adjusts the additional liability balance, with a related charge or
credit to guaranteed benefits, if actual experience or other evidence
suggests that earlier assumptions should be revised.


NET INVESTMENT INCOME: Net investment income represents income primarily
from the following sources in the Company's operations:


-    Interest income and related expenses, including amortization of
premiums and accretion of discounts on bonds with changes in the
timing and the amount of expected principal and interest cash
flows reflected in the yield, as applicable.


-    Dividend income and distributions from other investments when
receivable.


NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES: Net realized investment gains and
losses are determined by specific identification. The net realized
investment gains and losses are generated primarily from the following
sources:


-    Sales of fixed maturities, equity securities, securities lending
invested collateral and other types of investments.


-    Reductions to the cost basis of fixed maturities, equity
securities, securities lending invested collateral and other
invested assets for other-than-temporary impairments.


-    Changes in fair value of GMAV and GMWB embedded derivatives.


FEE INCOME: Fee income includes variable annuity policy fees, universal
life insurance fees and surrender charges. Variable annuity policy fees are
generally based on the market value of assets in the separate accounts
supporting the variable annuity contracts. Universal life insurance policy
fees consist of mortality charges, up-front fees earned on deposits
received and administrative fees, net of reinsurance premiums. Surrender
charges are assessed on withdrawals occurring during the surrender charge
period. All fee income is recorded as income when earned.

INCOME TAXES: The Company is included in the consolidated federal income
tax return of its ultimate parent, AIG. Income taxes have been calculated
as if the Company filed a separate return. Additionally, the Company
participates with its affiliates in the filing of certain combined state
income tax returns and files separate state income tax returns in the state
of New York. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the
effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of an asset or
liability and its reported amount in the financial statements. The Company
assesses its ability to realize deferred tax assets primarily based on the
earnings history, the future earnings potential, the reversal of taxable
temporary differences, and the tax planning strategies available to the
legal entity when recognizing deferred tax assets in accordance with FAS
No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("FAS 109"). See Note 11 herein for
a further discussion of income taxes.



RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS:



ACCOUNTING CHANGES: In September 2005, the AICPA issued Statement of
Position 05-1, "Accounting by Insurance Enterprises for Deferred
Acquisition Costs in Connection with Modifications or Exchanges of
Insurance Contracts" ("SOP 05-1"). SOP 05-1 provides guidance on accounting
for internal replacements of insurance and investment contracts other than
those specifically described in FAS No. 97. SOP 05-1 defines an internal
replacement as a modification in product benefits, features, rights, or
coverage that occurs by the exchange of a contract for a new contract, or
by amendment, endorsement, or rider to a contract, or by the election of a
feature or coverage within a contract. Internal replacements that result in
a substantially changed contract are accounted for as a termination and a
replacement contract. The Company's adoption of SOP 05-1 on January 1, 2007
did not have a material effect on the Company's financial condition or
results of operations.


In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109"
("FIN 48"), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax
positions. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement
attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of an
income tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48
also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and
penalties, accounting in interim periods, and additional disclosures. The
Company's adoption of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007 did not have a material
effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.


FUTURE APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS: In September 2006, the FASB
issued FAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("FAS 157"). FAS 157 defines
fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands
disclosures about fair value measurements but does not change existing
guidance about whether an instrument is carried at fair value. FAS 157 also
clarifies that an issuer's credit standing should be considered when
measuring liabilities at fair value. The Company adopted FAS 157 on January
1, 2008, its required effective date. The adoption of FAS 157 resulted in a
decrease in net income of approximately $2,000,000 in the first quarter of
2008 primarily due to the inclusion of explicit risk margins, where
appropriate.


In February 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities" ("FAS 159"). FAS 159 permits
entities to choose to measure at fair value many financial instruments and
certain other items that are not currently required to be measured at fair
value. Subsequent changes in fair value for designated items will be
required to be reported in income. FAS 159 also establishes presentation
and disclosure requirements for similar types of assets and liabilities
measured at fair value. FAS 159 permits the fair value option election on
an instrument-by-instrument basis of accounting for eligible items existing
at the adoption date and at initial recognition of an asset or liability or
upon an event that gives rise to a new basis of accounting for that
instrument. As of January 1, 2008 the Company did not choose to elect the
fair value option for any of its financial assets or liabilities.

4.   FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS


FAS No. 107, "Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments" ("FAS
107"), requires disclosure of fair value information about financial
instruments for which it is practicable to estimate such fair value. FAS
107 excludes certain financial instruments, including those related to
insurance contracts. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount
that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in
an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
The degree of judgment used in measuring the fair value of financial
instruments generally correlates with the level of pricing observability.
Financial instruments with quoted prices in active markets generally have
more pricing observability and less judgment is used in measuring fair
value. Conversely, financial instruments traded in other than active
markets or that do not have quoted prices have less observability and are
measured at fair value using valuation models or other pricing techniques
that require more judgment. Pricing observability is affected by a number
of factors, including the type of financial instrument, whether the
financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established, the
characteristics specific to the transaction and general market conditions.


CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS: The carrying value of these assets
approximates fair value because of the relatively short period of time
between origination and expected realization.


FIXED MATURITIES: The Company maximizes the use of observable inputs and
minimizes the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The
Company obtains market price data to value financial instruments whenever
such information is available. Market price data generally is obtained from
market exchanges or dealer quotations. The types of instruments valued
based on market price data consists of U.S. government and agency
securities. The Company estimates the fair value of fixed income
instruments not traded in active markets by referring to traded securities
with similar attributes and using a matrix pricing methodology. This
methodology considers such factors as the issuer's industry, the security's
rating and tenor, its coupon rate, its position in the capital structure of
the issuer, and other relevant factors. The types of fixed income
instruments not traded in active markets include mortgage-backed
securities, securities of public utilities and corporate bonds and notes.
For fixed income instruments that are not traded in active markets or that
are subject to transfer restrictions, valuations are adjusted to reflect
illiquidity and/or non-transferability, and such adjustments generally are
based on available market evidence. In the absence of such evidence,
management's best estimate is used.

4.   FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (Continued)


MORTGAGE AND OTHER LOANS: Mortgage and other loans include mortgage loans
on real estate and collateral, commercial and guaranteed loans. Fair value
for mortgage loans is primarily determined by using discounted cash flow
calculations based upon the Company's current incremental lending rates for
similar type loans. Fair value for collateral, commercial and guaranteed
loans is based principally on independent pricing services, broker quotes
and other independent information.


POLICY LOANS: The fair values of the policy loans were not calculated as
the Company believes it would have to expend excessive costs for the
benefits derived.


SECURITIES LENDING INVESTED COLLATERAL AND PAYABLE: Securities lending
invested collateral consists of short-term investments and fixed maturity
securities, primarily floating-rate bonds. The carrying value of short-term
investments is considered to be a reasonable estimate of fair value.
Securities lending collateral investments in fixed maturities are carried
at fair value, which is based principally on independent pricing services,
broker quotes and other independent information, consistent with the
valuation of other fixed maturities. The contract values of securities
lending payable approximate fair value as these obligations are short-term
in nature.


OTHER ASSETS/LIABILITIES: Included in other assets or liabilities are the
embedded derivatives relating to GMAV and GMWB. Fair value for these
embedded derivatives is calculated based on actuarial and capital market
assumptions related to the projected cash flows, including benefits and
related contract charges, over the lives of the contracts, incorporating
expectations of contract holder behavior.


RESERVES FOR FIXED ANNUITY CONTRACTS: Deferred annuity contracts are
assigned a fair value equal to current net surrender value. Annuitized
contracts are valued based on the present value of future cash flows at
current pricing rates.


The estimated fair values of the Company's financial instruments at
December 31, 2007 and 2006 compared with their respective carrying values
are as follows:








                                            Carrying Value   Fair Value

(b)  Net amount at risk represents the guaranteed benefit exposure in excess of
the current account value, if all contract holders reached the specified
date at the same balance sheet date.


(c)  Net amount at risk represents the guaranteed benefit exposure in excess of
the current account value if all contract holders exercise the maximum
withdrawal benefits at the same balance sheet date. If no withdrawals have
been made for those policies with a waiting period, the contract holder
will realize an increase in the benefit base after all other amounts
guaranteed under this benefit have been paid. This increase in the benefit
base increases the net amount at risk by $3,549,000 and $4,057,000 as of
December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively and is payable no sooner than 10
years from the end of the waiting period.

7.   GUARANTEED BENEFITS (Continued)


The following summarizes the reserves for guaranteed benefits on variable
contracts reflected in the general account:






                                    Years Ended
                                    December 31,

   Guaranteed benefits paid         (119)    (373)

                                  ======   ======








The following assumptions and methodology were used to determine the
reserve for guaranteed benefits at December 31, 2007 and 2006:


-    Data used was 50 and 5000 stochastically generated investment
performance scenarios as of 2007 and 2006, respectively.


-    Mean investment performance assumption was 10%.


-    Volatility assumption was 16%.


-    Mortality was assumed to be 50% Male and 80% Female of the 1994
Variable Annuity MGDB table for 2007 and 64% of the 75-80 ALB table
for 2006.


-    Lapse rates vary by contract type and duration and range from 0% to
40%.


-    The discount rate was approximately 8%.


8.   REINSURANCE


Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the Company from its obligations to
contract holders. The Company could become liable for all obligations of
the reinsured policies if the reinsurers were to become unable to meet the
obligations assumed under the respective reinsurance agreements. The
Company monitors its credit exposure with respect to these agreements.
However, due to the high credit ratings of the reinsurers, such risks are
considered to be minimal. The Company has no reinsurance recoverable or
related concentration of credit risk greater than 10% of shareholder's
equity.


The Company has a reinsurance treaty that limits its universal life risk on
any one insured life to $100,000. Universal life insurance fees are
presented net of reinsurance premiums of $6,348,000, $7,518,000 and
$7,423,000 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Reinsurance recoveries
recognized as a reduction of claims on universal life insurance contracts
amounted to $3,798,000, $12,163,000 and $6,303,000 in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.


On November 1, 2004, the Company entered a contract to reinsure credit life
and health insurance policies. The Company received a share of premium for
the reinsured policies and indemnified the reinsured for a proportionate
share of these liabilities while the reinsured retained the assets and
corresponding reserve liabilities. The contract was considered modified
coinsurance and as such the reinsurance claims payable is offset against
reinsurance premiums receivable and included in other assets on the balance
sheet. The treaty was for one year with the option to renew annually. The
Company allowed the contract to expire on October 31, 2006. The pretax
income from the contract was $17,572,000 and $16,283,000 in 2006 and 2005,
respectively.

9.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES


Various federal, state and other regulatory agencies may from time to time
review, examine or inquire into the operations, practices and procedures of
the Company, such as through financial examinations, market conduct exams
or regulatory inquiries. Based on the current status of pending regulatory
examinations and inquiries involving the Company, the Company believes it
is not likely that these regulatory examinations or inquiries will have a
material adverse effect on the financial position, results of operations or
cash flows of the Company.


In February 2006, AIG reached a resolution of claims and matters under
investigation with the United States Department of Justice ("DOJ"), the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), the Office of the New York
Attorney General ("NYAG") and the New York State Department of Insurance
("DOI"). The settlements resolved outstanding investigations conducted by
the SEC, NYAG and DOI in connection with the accounting, financial
reporting and insurance brokerage practices of AIG and its subsidiaries, as
well as claims relating to the underpayment of certain workers compensation
premium taxes and other assessments. As a result of the settlement, the
Company obtained temporary permission from the SEC to continue to serve as
a depositor for separate accounts. The Company received permanent
permission from the SEC in September 2007.


Various lawsuits against the Company have arisen in the ordinary course of
business. Except as noted above, contingent liabilities arising from
litigation, income taxes and regulatory and other matters are not
considered material in relation to the financial position, results of
operations or cash flows of the Company.

Dividends that the Company may pay to its shareholder in any year without
prior approval of the New York Department of Insurance are limited by
statute. The maximum amount of dividends which can be paid to stockholders
by a life insurance company domiciled in the State of New York without
obtaining the prior approval of the Superintendent of Insurance is limited
to the lesser of the Company's net gain from operations of the preceding
year's statutory annual statement, excluding realized capital gains, or 10%
of preceding year's statutory surplus. Dividends of $50,090,000 can be paid
to the shareholder during 2008 without prior approval of the New York
Superintendent of Insurance.


Under statutory accounting principles utilized in filings with insurance
regulatory authorities, the Company's net income (loss) for the years ended
December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was approximately $(7,137,000),
$18,487,000 and $10,979,000, respectively. The Company's statutory capital
and surplus totaled approximately $503,904,000, $396,981,000 and

The U.S. federal income tax rate is 35% for 2007, 2006 and 2005. Actual tax
expense on income differs from the "expected" amount computed by applying
the federal income tax rate because of the following:

In December 2007, AIGRS reached a settlement with the IRS in the United
States Tax Court for tax years ended in September 30, 1993 and September
30, 1994. The terms of the settlement will be incorporated into the IRS
examinations for tax years of AIGRS from September 30, 1995 through
September 30, 1998, and for the Parent for tax year December 31, 1999. The
statute of limitations for the years 1997 through 1999 expires on March 31,
2008. In January 2008, the Parent signed a settlement agreement with the
IRS for examination of tax years 2000 through 2002.


The tax years that remain subject to examination in the United States tax
jurisdiction are 1997 to 1999 and 2003 to 2006. The Company has recorded a
receivable related to known taxing authority examination adjustments. The
amount accrued as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, excluding interest,
totaled $2,069,000.


The Company continually evaluates adjustments proposed by taxing
authorities. At December 31, 2007, there are no proposed adjustments that
would result in a material change to the Company's financial position over
the next twelve months.


At January 1 and December 31, 2007, the Company had no unrecognized tax
benefits.


Interest and penalties, if any, related to taxing authority examinations
and unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax
expense. At January 1 and December 31, 2007, the Company had a payable of
$920,000 and a receivable of $596,000, respectively, related to interest
(net of federal tax). For the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company had
recognized a benefit of $1,516,000 of interest (net of federal tax).


12.  RELATED-PARTY MATTERS


Starr International Company, Inc. ("SICO") has provided a series of
two-year Deferred Compensation Profit Participation Plans ("SICO Plans") to
certain employees of AIG, its subsidiaries and affiliates. The SICO Plans
came into being in 1975 when the voting shareholders and Board of Directors
of SICO, a private holding company whose principal asset is AIG common
stock, decided that a portion of the capital value of SICO should be used
to provide an incentive plan for the current and succeeding managements of
all American International companies, including the Company.


None of the costs of the various benefits provided under the SICO Plans has
been paid by the Company, although the Company has recorded a charge to
reported earnings for the deferred compensation amounts paid to employees
of the Company and affiliates by SICO and allocated to the Company, with an
offsetting entry to additional paid-in capital reflecting amounts deemed
contributed by SICO. The SICO Plans provide that shares currently owned by
SICO may be set aside by SICO for the benefit of the participant and
distributed upon retirement. The SICO Board of Directors currently may
permit an early payout under certain circumstances. Prior to payout, the
participant is not entitled to vote, dispose of or receive dividends with
respect to such shares, and shares are subject to forfeiture under certain
conditions, including but not limited to the participant's voluntary
termination of employment with AIG or its subsidiaries and affiliates prior
to normal retirement age. Under the SICO Plans, SICO's Board of Directors
may elect to pay a participant cash in lieu of shares of AIG common stock.
Following notification from SICO to participants in the SICO Plans that it
will settle specific future awards under the SICO Plans with shares rather
than cash, the Company modified its accounting for the SICO Plans from
variable to fixed measurement accounting. The Company gave effect to this
change in settlement method beginning on December 9, 2005, the date of
SICO's notice to the participants in the SICO Plans.

As total compensation expense related to the SICO Plans for each prior year
would not have been material to any such prior year, in the first quarter
of 2005 the Company has recorded the total amount of compensation expense
related to the SICO Plans that would have been recorded in all prior
periods through December 31, 2004, as a reduction of retained earnings on
the balance sheet of $93,000, with a corresponding increase in additional
paid-in capital, and with no effect on total shareholder's equity, results
of operations or cash flows. Compensation expense with respect to the SICO
Plans aggregated $56,000, $4,000 and $104,000 for 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively, and is included in general and administrative expenses in the
statement of income and comprehensive income. Additionally, a corresponding
increase to additional paid-in capital was recorded in each year.


On January 20, 2004, the Company entered into a short-term financing
arrangement with the Parent whereby the Company has the right to borrow up
to $15,000,000 from the Parent and vice versa. Any advances made under this
agreement must be repaid within 30 days. There was no outstanding balance
under this agreement at December 31, 2007 and 2006.


On February 15, 2004, the Company entered into a short-term financing
arrangement with an affiliate, AIG SunAmerica Life Assurance Company ("AIG
SALAC") whereby the Company has the right to borrow up to $15,000,000 from
AIG SALAC and vice versa. Any advances made under this arrangement must be
repaid within 30 days. There was no outstanding balance under this
agreement at December 31, 2007 and 2006.


On February 15, 2004, the Company entered into a short-term financing
arrangement with SunAmerica Investments, Inc. ("SAII") whereby the Company
has the right to borrow up to $15,000,000 from SAII and vice versa. Any
advances made under this arrangement must be repaid within 30 days. There
was no outstanding balance under this agreement at December 31, 2007 and
2006.


In 2007, the Company paid commissions to seven affiliated broker-dealers.
Commissions paid to these broker-dealers totaled $1,641,000, $1,546,000 and
$1,042,000 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These affiliated
broker-dealers represented approximately 2%, 1% and 1% of premiums in 2007,
2006 and 2005, respectively.


Pursuant to a Service and Expense Agreement, AIG provides, or causes to be
provided, administrative, marketing, investment management, accounting,
occupancy, and data processing services to the Company. The allocation of
such costs for investment management services is based on the level of
assets under management. The allocation of costs for other services is
based on estimated levels of usage, transactions or time incurred in
providing the respective services. Amounts paid for such services were
$12,729,000, $9,137,000 and $7,597,000 in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. The component of such costs that relate to the production or
acquisition of new business during these periods amounted to $2,376,000,
$1,915,000 and $2,070,000 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and is
deferred and amortized as part of DAC. The other components of these costs
are included in general and administrative expenses in the statement of
income and comprehensive income (loss).


An affiliate of the Company is responsible for the administration of the
Company's fixed annuity contracts and is reimbursed for the cost of
administration. Costs charged to the Company to administer these policies
were approximately $2,352,000, $1,922,000 and $1,638,000 in 2007, 2006 and
2005, respectively. Additionally, costs charged to the Company for
marketing such policies amounted to $3,233,000, $3,305,000 and $3,409,000
for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and are
deferred and amortized as part of DAC. The Company believes these costs are
less than the Company would have incurred to administer these policies
internally.

Pursuant to an Investment Advisory Agreement, the majority of the Company's
invested assets are managed by an affiliate of the Company. The investment
management fees incurred were $3,173,000, $2,613,000 and $2,241,000 in
2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.


The Company incurred $1,375,000, $1,494,000 and $1,039,000 of management
fee expense to an affiliate of the Company to administer its securities
lending program during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.


On February 1, 2004, the Company entered into an administrative services
agreement with its affiliate AIG SunAmerica Asset Management Corp.
("SAAMCo"), whereby SAAMCo will pay to the Company a fee based on a
percentage on all assets invested through the Company's variable annuity
products in exchange for services performed. SAAMCo is the investment
advisor for certain trusts that serve as investment options for the
Company's variable annuity products. Amounts earned by the Company under
this agreement totaled $2,315,000, $1,983,000 and $1,790,000 in 2007, 2006
and 2005, respectively, and are included in variable annuity policy fees in
the statement of income and comprehensive income (loss).


The Company has a support agreement in effect between the Company and AIG
(the "Support Agreement"), pursuant to which AIG has agreed that AIG will
cause the Company to maintain a contract holders' surplus of not less than
$1,000,000 or such greater amount as shall be sufficient to enable the
Company to perform its obligations under any policy issued by it. The
Support Agreement also provides that if the Company needs funds not
otherwise available to it to make timely payment of its obligations under
policies issued by it, AIG will provide such funds at the request of the
Company. The Support Agreement is not a direct or indirect guarantee by AIG
to any person of any obligations of the Company. AIG may terminate the
Support Agreement with respect to outstanding obligations of the Company
only under circumstances where the Company attains, without the benefit of
the Support Agreement, a financial strength rating equivalent to that held
by the Company with the benefit of the Support Agreement. Contract holders
have the right to cause the Company to enforce its rights against AIG and,
if the Company fails or refuses to take timely action to enforce the
Support Agreement or if the Company defaults in any claim or payment owed
to such contract holder when due, have the right to enforce the Support
Agreement directly against AIG.


The Company's insurance policy obligations for individual and group
contracts issued prior to January 31, 2008, at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, are
guaranteed (the "Guarantee") by American Home Assurance Company ("American
Home"), a subsidiary of AIG and an affiliate of the Company. American Home
files statutory annual and quarterly reports with the New York State
Insurance Department, through which such reports are available to the
public. As of January 31, 2008, at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time (the "Point of
Termination"), the Guarantee by American Home was terminated for
prospectively issued contracts. The Guarantee will not cover any contracts
with a date of issue later than the Point of Termination. The Guarantee
will, however, continue to cover insurance obligations on contracts issued
by the Company with a date of issue earlier than the Point of Termination,
including obligations arising from purchase payments received with respect
to these contracts after the Point of Termination. The Guarantee provides
that the contract owners owning contracts issued by the Company with a date
of issue earlier than the Point of Termination can enforce the Guarantee
directly against American Home.

In February 2008, the Company received a cash capital contribution of
$100,000,000 from the Parent.
