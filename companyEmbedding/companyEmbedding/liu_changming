Influences[edit]
Many works of Professor Liu Changming have been collected by the National Art Museum of China, as well as by the Asian Museum of Watercolor Art, and many other of them are collected both inside and outside art museums, galleries, and clubs. His works have attracted the attention from collectors throughout the world. Examples include: "A teacher's table", collected by National Art Museum of China, and listed in the classic collection (a significant breakthrough in both skill and style is identified in this work); "Net fish series" (also considered classic). "Rose N#1" and "Rose N#2" were collected by the Asian Museum of Watercolor Art (Asia's first international Watercolor collection organization). As one of 33 the most famous painters selected by the China mainland, an invitation was made for his works to be included in the Cross-Strait Famous Artists Watercolor Exhibition (sponsored by Taiwan culture bureau, Taiwan "education ministry" and The CKS Memorial Hall.

In addition to watercolor paintings, M. Liu Changming's oil painting presents another unique set of personal characteristics. He works mainly in the medium of the Still life, forming a complete expression of "image" which is fundamentally different from classic oil paintings in the style of Still life. As an important contemporary Chinese artist, his exploration of style has been of considerable concern.

Aerohive Networks is an American multinational computer networking equipment company headquartered in Milpitas, California, with 17 additional offices worldwide.[3] The company was founded in 2006, and provides wireless networking to medium-sized and larger businesses.[3][4]
In 2012, Aerohive was listed on The Wall Street Journal's list of "Top 50 Start-Ups."[5] The company raised around $105 million in venture capital funding before undergoing an IPO in March 2014.[6][7]
History[edit]
Aerohive was founded in 2006 by Changming Liu. That same year, the company raised $4 million in series A round funding. In July 2007, the company raised an additional $20 million in series B round funding led by Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.[8] Aerohive completed a series C round of funding, raising $23.5 million to expand its sales and marketing strategy in March 2010.[9][10] In 2011, the company acquired Pareto Networks, a cloud-based routing service, the acquisition allowed Aerohive to integrate Paret's cloud management technology into its existing offerings.[11][12][13] In September 2012, Aerohive raised $22.5 million in a series E round of funding and announced its plans to undergo an IPO the following year.[14] The company raised an additional $10 million in funding as it prepared to go public, in 2013.[7] On March 28, 2014, the company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the HIVE symbol.[15] Aerohive joined Barack Obama's ConnectED initiative in October 2014, when it partnered with Apple Inc. and provided wireless connectivity to the schools receiving Apple products.[16]
Aerohive announced that its devices would operate more seamlessly with Barracuda Networks security products in May 2015.[17] In September 2015, the company announced a technology alliance with Juniper Networks.[18] In January 2016, the company released HiveSchool, a learning application for K-12 classrooms that runs on any network with any computer running the Google Chrome web browser.[19] The company announced that it had entered a distribution agreement with Synnex Corporation in February 2016. The agreement named Synnex as the exclusive distributor of Aerohive products in Canada.[20] In April 2016, Aerohive announced a strategic partnership with the technology company Dell.[21]
In September 2016, the company released SD-LAN, a software-defined network that functions on local area networks.[22]
Operations[edit]
Aerohive develops a controller-less LAN architecture called Cooperative Control, which provides all the performance, availability, management, mobility, and security needed in a large campus deployment. This architecture also enables secure, scalable, high-performance, and mission-critical wireless networking in a manageable and cost-effective way to industries such as education, distributed enterprises, retail, healthcare, state and local government and manufacturing.[23] The company also develops an operating system, HiveOS, for access points and switches, a cloud enabled management system, HiveManager, Wi-Fi planning tools, applications, and network administration tools for its devices.[24]
The company makes available open REST APIs to its cloud platform, Aerohive Cloud Services, for developers to build Wi-Fi management and analytics solutions.[25] In September 2016, Aerohive announced an update to its cloud management system, HiveManager NG, which enabled LAN networks to become software-defined.[26]

About this book




As one of the eighteen field-specific reports comprising the comprehensive scope of the strategic general report of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, this sub-report addresses long-range planning for developing science and technology in the field of  water science. They each craft a roadmap for their sphere of development to 2050. In their entirety, the general and sub-group reports analyze the evolution and laws governing the development of science and technology, describe the decisive impact of science and technology on the modernization process, predict that the world is on the eve of an impending S&T revolution, and call for China to be fully prepared for this new round of S&T advancement. Based on the detailed study of the demands on S&T innovation in China's modernization, the reports draw a framework for eight basic and strategic systems of socio-economic development with the support of science and technology, work out China's S&T roadmaps for the relevant eight basic and strategic systems in line with China's reality, further detail S&T initiatives of strategic importance to China's modernization, and provide S&T decision-makers with comprehensive consultations for the development of S&T innovation consistent with China's reality. Supported by illustrations and tables of data, the reports provide researchers, government officials and entrepreneurs with guidance concerning research directions, the planning process, and investment. Founded in 1949, the Chinese Academy of Sciences is the nation's highest academic institution in natural sciences. Its major responsibilities are to conduct research in basic and technological sciences, to undertake nationwide integrated surveys on natural resources and ecological environment, to provide the country with scientific data and consultations for government's decision-making, to undertake government-assigned projects with regard to key S&T problems in the process of socio-economic development, to initiate personnel training, and to promote China's high-tech enterprises through its active engagement in these areas.
