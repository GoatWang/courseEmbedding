Potomac Futures Fund
L.P.

Fourth Amended and Restated
Limited Partnership Agreement

Amended and Restated as of
February 29, 2016

This Fourth Amended and Restated
Limited Partnership Agreement (this “Agreement”),
effective as of February 29, 2016, is by and among Ceres
Managed Futures LLC (formerly Citigroup Managed Futures LLC) (the
“General Partner”) and those other parties who shall
execute this Agreement, whether in counterpart or by
attorney-in-fact, as limited partners. (Such other parties who are
limited partners are hereinafter collectively referred to as the
“Limited Partners.” The General Partner and the Limited
Partners may be collectively referred to herein as
“Partners.”) This Agreement amends and restates the
Third Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement dated as
of March 1, 2011 as amended by the amendment dated
August 8, 2014 and the amendment dated December 30, 2015
(the “Third Amended and Restated Limited Partnership
Agreement”) by and among the General Partner and the other
limited partners party thereto.

W I T N E S
S E T H :

WHEREAS, on March 14, 1997,
Potomac Futures Fund L.P. (formerly Smith Barney Potomac Futures
Fund L.P.) (the “Partnership”) was formed for the
purpose of trading in commodity interests, as described in
Paragraph 3 hereof, pursuant to the Partnership’s Limited
Partnership Agreement, dated as of March 14, 1997 (the
“Initial Agreement”) by and among the General Partner,
an initial limited partner (the “Initial Limited
Partner”) and the other limited partners party thereto;
and

WHEREAS, the Initial Agreement was
amended and restated pursuant to an Amended and Restated Limited
Partnership Agreement dated as of March 1, 1999 (the
“First Amended and Restated Limited Partnership
Agreement”) by and among SFG Global Investments, Inc., the
Initial Limited Partner and the other limited partners party
thereto; and

WHEREAS, the First Amended and
Restated Limited Partnership Agreement was amended and restated
pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Limited Partnership
Agreement; and

WHEREAS, the Second Amended and
Restated Limited Partnership Agreement was amended and restated
pursuant to the Third Amended and Restated Limited Partnership
Agreement (together with the Second Amended and Restated Limited
Partnership Agreement, the First Amended and Restated Limited
Partnership Agreement and the Initial Agreement, the “Prior
Agreement”); and

WHEREAS, the Partnership commenced
trading on October 1, 1997; and

WHEREAS, this Agreement has been
amended previously, among other things, (a) to name a
commodity trading advisor of the Partnership, (b) to admit a
replacement general partner, (c) to reflect the termination of
a trading manager agreement, (d) to reinstate the General
Partner as general partner of the Partnership, (e) to change
the name of the General Partner and the Partnership, and
(f) to remove certain of the restrictions on the Limited
Partners’ ability to assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of
their Units of Limited Partnership Interest; and



WHEREAS, the General Partner has
deemed it advisable to amend the Prior Agreement to, among other
things, (i) reflect a change of address of the principal
office of the Partnership, (ii) amend the termination date of
the Partnership and (iii) offer multiple classes of Units of
Limited Partnership Interest; and

WHEREAS, the General Partner,
consistent with the requirements of Paragraph 17(a) of the Prior
Agreement, has determined that such amendment is not adverse to and
does not require the consent of the Limited Partners;
and

WHEREAS, the General Partner,
consistent with the requirements of Paragraph 17(a) of the Prior
Agreement, has determined to make other conforming amendments to
the Prior Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of
the mutual premises and agreements herein made and intending to be
legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree to amend and restate
the Prior Agreement in its entirety as follows:
 



1.


Formation
and Name.




The parties hereto hereby continue a
limited partnership under the New York Revised Limited Partnership
Act (the “Partnership Act”). The name of the limited
partnership is Potomac Futures Fund L.P. The General Partner has
executed and filed a Certificate of Limited Partnership in
accordance with the provisions of the Partnership Act and shall
execute, file, record and publish, as appropriate, such amendments,
restatements and other documents as are or become necessary or
advisable, as determined by the General Partner.
 



2.


Principal
Office.




The principal office of the
Partnership shall be 522 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10036, or
such other place as the General Partner may designate from time to
time.
 



3.


Business.




(a) The Partnership’s business
and purpose is to trade, buy, sell or otherwise acquire, hold or
dispose of interests in commodities of all descriptions (including
futures contracts, commodity options, forward contracts and any
other rights or interests pertaining thereto, including interests
in commodity pools). The objective of the Partnership business is
appreciation of its assets through speculative trading.

(b) The Partnership shall
not:

(1) engage in the pyramiding of its
positions by using unrealized profits on existing positions as
margin for the purchase or sale of additional positions in the same
or related commodities;
 
A-2



(2) utilize borrowings except
short-term borrowings if the Partnership takes delivery of cash
commodities; or

(3) permit the churning of its
account.

(c) The Partnership shall make no
loans. Assets of the Partnership will not be commingled with assets
of any other entity. Deposit of assets with a commodity broker or
dealer as margin shall not constitute commingling.
 



4.


Term,
Dissolution and Fiscal Year.




(a) Term. The term of the
Partnership commenced on the date the initial Certificate of
Limited Partnership was filed with the State of New York Department
of State, and shall end as soon as practicable upon the first to
occur of the following: (1) December 31, 2057;
(2) receipt by the General Partner of an election to dissolve
the Partnership at a specified time by Limited Partners owning more
than 50% of all Classes (as described below) of Units of Limited
Partnership Interest then outstanding (excluding Units of Limited
Partnership Interest owned by the General Partner, an affiliate of
the General Partner or their employees), notice of which is sent by
registered mail to the General Partner not less than 90 days prior
to the effective date of such dissolution; (3) assignment by
the General Partner of all of its interest in the Partnership,
withdrawal, removal, bankruptcy or any other event that causes the
General Partner to cease to be a general partner under the
Partnership Act (unless the Partnership is continued pursuant to
Paragraph 17); (4) the Net Asset Value per Unit of Limited
Partnership Interest of any Class declines on any business day
after trading to less than $400 per Unit; or (5) any event
which shall make it unlawful for the existence of the Partnership
to be continued. As used in this Paragraph 4(a),
“affiliate” shall mean any entity that directly or
indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control
with the General Partner.

(b) Dissolution. Upon
dissolution of the Partnership, the assets of the Partnership shall
be distributed to creditors, including any Partners who may be
creditors, to the extent otherwise permitted by law, in
satisfaction of liabilities of the Partnership (whether by payment
or the making of reasonable provision for payment thereof) other
than liabilities for which reasonable provision for payment has
been made and liabilities for distributions to Partners; to
Partners and former Partners in satisfaction of liabilities for
distributions; and to Partners first for the return of their
contributions and second respecting their Partnership interests, in
the proportions in which the Partners share in distributions.
Following distributions of the assets of the Partnership, a
Certificate of Cancellation for the Partnership shall be filed as
required by the Partnership Act.

(c) Fiscal Year. The fiscal
year of the Partnership will commence on January 1 and end on
December 31 each year (“fiscal year”). Each fiscal
year of the Partnership is divided into four fiscal quarters
commencing on the first day of January, April, July and October
(“fiscal quarter”).
 



5.


Net Worth of
General Partner.




The General Partner shall not be
obligated to maintain a Net Worth in excess of such amount, if any,
as may be required to ensure that the Partnership will continue to
be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. For
the purposes of this Paragraph 5, Net Worth shall be based upon
current fair market value of the assets of the General
Partner.
 
A-3





6.


Capital
Contributions and Units of Partnership Interest.




The General Partner shall not be
obligated to contribute capital to the Partnership unless required
to ensure that the Partnership will continue to be treated as a
partnership for federal income tax purposes. The General
Partner’s contribution shall be evidenced by “Units of
General Partnership Interest.”

Interests in the Partnership, other
than those of the General Partner, shall be evidenced by
Class A or Class Z “Units of Limited Partnership
Interest” which the General Partner on behalf of the
Partnership shall, in accordance with the Private Placement
Offering Memorandum and Disclosure Document (the
“Memorandum”) referred to in Paragraph 11, sell to
persons desiring to become Limited Partners who satisfy the
investment and minimum capital contribution requirements specific
to each Class. Identical rights, powers, duties and obligations
attach to each Class of Units of Limited Partnership Interest,
except that purchasers of Class Z Units may be subject to reduced
ongoing selling agent fees.

The Class of Units of Limited
Partnership Interest that a Limited Partner receives shall
generally depend upon the status of such Limited Partners. Units of
Limited Partnership Interest purchased by certain of the Limited
Partners receiving advisory services from Morgan Stanley Smith
Barney, LLC (doing business as, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management
(“Morgan Stanley Wealth Management”)) (each a
“Consulting Client”) shall be designated as Class Z
Units. Class Z Units may also be offered to certain employees of
Morgan Stanley and/or its subsidiaries (and their family members).
All other Limited Partners who satisfy the applicable investment
and minimum capital contribution requirements shall receive
Class A Units or such other classes of Units of Limited
Partnership Interest (together with Class A Units of Limited
Partnership Interest and Class Z Units of Limited Partnership
Interest, the “Classes”) as the General Partner may
determine in its sole discretion to offer from time to
time.

Consulting Clients shall be bound by
the terms of the consulting agreement they signed with their Morgan
Stanley financial advisor or private wealth advisor (each such
agreement, a “Consulting Agreement”), including the
payment of a consulting fee as set forth in the Consulting
Agreement. In the event, however, that a Consulting Client’s
Consulting Agreement is terminated and the Consulting Client
remains a Limited Partner, the Units shall, beginning on the first
day of the month immediately following the month of termination of
the Consulting Agreement, (i) convert to the appropriate Class
of Units based on investor qualifications and (ii) become
subject to the applicable ongoing selling agent fee as described in
the Memorandum. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such former
Consulting Client is also an employee of Morgan Stanley or a
subsidiary and remains a Limited Partner, such employee will
continue to hold Class Z Units and will not be subject to the
ongoing selling agent fee described in the Memorandum. For the
avoidance of any doubt, Class Z Units are subject to withdrawal
restrictions set forth in this Agreement and the
Memorandum.

For any Unit (or partial unit
rounded to four decimal places) of Limited Partnership Interest
purchased, a Limited Partner shall contribute to the capital of the
Partnership an amount
 
A-4


equal to the Net Asset Value of such Unit of
Limited Partnership Interest (or partial unit, as the case may be)
as of the close of business on the day preceding the effective date
of such purchase, and shall pay in addition the selling commission,
if any, which must be paid with respect to such purchase. The
aggregate of all contributions shall be available to the
Partnership to carry on its business, and no interest shall be paid
on any such contribution. All subscriptions for Units of Limited
Partnership Interest made pursuant to this private placement of the
Units of Limited Partnership Interest (the “Private
Placement”) must be on the form provided in the Memorandum.
All subscribers who have been accepted by the General Partner shall
be deemed admitted as Limited Partners at the time they are
reflected as such in the books and records of the
Partnership.

The General Partner may, without the
consent of the Limited Partners, offer additional classes of Units
of Limited Partnership Interest as it may determine in its sole
discretion to offer from time to time.
 



7.


Allocation
of Profits and Losses.




(a) Capital Accounts. A
capital account shall be established for each Partner. The initial
balance of each Partner’s capital account shall be the amount
of his initial capital contribution to the Partnership.

(b) Allocations. As of the
close of business on the last day of each month during each fiscal
year of the Partnership, the following determinations and
allocations shall be made:

(1) The Net Asset Value per Class
(as defined in Paragraph 7(d)(1)) and the Net Assets of the
Partnership (as defined in Paragraph 7(d)(2)) before any
management, General Partner, and incentive fees payable by the
Partnership as of such date shall be determined.

(2) Monthly management fees, if any,
payable by the Partnership as of such date shall then be charged
against the Net Asset Value per Class, for each outstanding
Class.

(3) Monthly fees, if any, payable by
the Partnership to the General Partner as of such date shall then
be charged against the Net Asset Value per Class, for each
outstanding Class.

(4) Incentive fees, if any, shall
then be charged against the Net Assets of the Partnership and
allocated proportionally to each Class based on the Net Asset Value
per Class.

(5) Any increase or decrease in the
Net Asset Value per Class as of the end of the month (after the
adjustments in subparagraphs (2)-(4) above) shall then be
credited or charged to the capital accounts of each Partner in the
ratio that the balance of each account bears to the balance of all
accounts.

(6) Any amount paid to a Limited
Partner on redemption of Units of Limited Partnership Interest, and
any amount paid to the General Partner on redemption of Units of
General Partnership Interest, shall be charged to that
Partner’s capital account.
 
A-5



(c) Allocation of Profit and Loss
for Federal Income Tax Purposes. The Partnership’s
realized capital gain or loss and ordinary income or loss shall be
allocated among the Partners in the ratio that each Partner’s
capital account bears to all Partners’ capital accounts. Any
Partner who acquires or redeems Units of Limited or General
Partnership Interest during any fiscal year will be allocated his
proportionate share of the capital gain or loss and ordinary income
or loss realized by the Partnership during the period that such
Units of Limited or General Partnership Interest were owned by such
Partner, based on the ratio that the capital accounts allocable to
such acquired or redeemed Units of Limited or General Partnership
Interest bear to the capital accounts allocable to all
Partners’ Units of Limited or General Partnership Interest
for such period. Any Partner who transfers or assigns Units of
Limited or General Partnership Interest during any fiscal year
shall be allocated his proportionate share of the capital gain or
loss and ordinary income or loss realized by the Partnership
through the end of the month in which notice of such transfer or
assignment is given to the General Partner in accordance with
Paragraph 10(a) hereof, and the transferee or assignee of such
Units shall be allocated his proportionate share of the capital
gain or loss and ordinary income or loss realized by the
Partnership commencing with the month next succeeding the month in
which notice of transfer or assignment is given. The method of
allocating gains and losses for tax purposes may be changed by the
General Partner upon receipt of advice from counsel to the
Partnership that such change is required by applicable law or
regulation.

(d) Definitions.

(1) Net Assets per Class. Net
Assets per Class shall mean the total assets attributable to each
Class, as determined by the General Partner, including all cash,
Treasury bills, money market mutual fund securities, accrued
interest and the market value of all open commodity positions
maintained by the Partnership for each Class, less all liabilities
attributable to each Class, as determined by the General Partner,
including brokerage charges, if any, and ongoing selling agent fees
accrued and other liabilities, determined in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles under the accrual basis of
accounting. The value of a commodity futures or option contract is
the unrealized gain or loss on the contract that is determined by
marking it to the current settlement price for a like contract
acquired on the valuation date. Physical commodities, options,
forward contracts and futures contracts, when no market quote is
available, will be valued at their fair market value as determined
in good faith by the General Partner. U.S. Treasury securities and
other interest bearing obligations will be valued at cost plus
accrued interest. Interests in other commodity pools will be valued
at their net asset value as determined by the pool operator, or, if
the General Partner has not received such determination or believes
that fairness so requires, at fair value determined by the General
Partner. Net Assets per Class equals Net Asset Value per
Class.

(2) Net Assets of the
Partnership. The Net Assets of the Partnership equals the sum
of Net Assets per Class, of all outstanding Classes.

(3) Net Asset Value per Unit.
The Net Asset Value per Unit of each Unit of Limited Partnership
Interest and each Unit of General Partnership Interest for each
Class shall be determined by dividing the Net Asset Value per Class
by the aggregate number of Units of Limited and General Partnership
Interest outstanding in such Class.
 
A-6



(e) Expenses and Limitation
Thereof. Subject to the limitations set forth below in this
Paragraph 7(e), the Partnership shall be obligated to pay all
liabilities incurred by it, including, without limitation, all
expenses incurred in connection with its trading activities, and
any management and incentive fees. The General Partner shall bear
all other operating expenses except legal, accounting, filing, data
processing and reporting fees and extraordinary expenses.
Appropriate reserves may be created, accrued and charged against
Net Assets of the Partnership for contingent liabilities, if any,
as of the date any such contingent liability becomes known to the
General Partner.

(f) Limited Liability of Limited
Partners.

(1) Each Unit of Limited Partnership
Interest, when purchased by a Limited Partner, subject to the
qualifications set forth below, shall be fully paid and
non-assessable.

(2) A Limited Partner shall have no
liability in excess of his obligation to make contributions to the
capital of the Partnership and his share of the Partnership’s
assets and undistributed profits, subject to the qualifications
provided in the Partnership Act.

(g) Return of Limited
Partner’s Capital Contribution. Except to the extent that
a Limited Partner shall have the right to withdraw capital through
redemption of Units of Limited Partnership Interest, no Limited
Partner shall have any right to demand the return of his capital
contribution or any profits added thereto, except upon dissolution
and termination of the Partnership. In no event shall a Limited
Partner be entitled to demand and receive property other than
cash.
 



8.


Management
of the Partnership.




(a) General. The General
Partner, to the exclusion of all Limited Partners, shall conduct,
control and manage the business of the Partnership, including,
without limitation, the investment of the funds of the Partnership.
The General Partner may, but is not obliged to, delegate its
rights, duties and powers hereunder, including but not limited to
(i) the power to select trading advisors and allocate assets
among them; and (ii) the duty to make trading decisions for
the Partnership. Except as provided herein, no Partner shall be
entitled to any salary, draw or other compensation from the
Partnership. Each Limited Partner hereby undertakes to advise the
General Partner of such additional information as may be deemed by
the General Partner to be required or appropriate to open and
maintain an account or accounts with commodity brokerage firms for
the purpose of trading in commodity futures contracts.

(b) Subject to Paragraph 5 hereof,
the General Partner may engage in other business activities and
shall not be required to refrain from any other activity nor
disgorge any profits from any such activity, whether as general
partner of additional partnerships for investment in commodity
futures contracts or otherwise. The General Partner may engage and
compensate on behalf of the Partnership from funds of the
Partnership, such persons, firms or corporations, including any
affiliated person or entity, as the General Partner in its sole
judgment, shall deem advisable for the conduct and operation of the
business of the Partnership.
 
A-7



No person dealing with the General
Partner shall be required to determine its authority to make any
undertaking on behalf of the Partnership, nor to determine any fact
or circumstance bearing upon the existence of its
authority.

The General Partner shall monitor
the trading and performance of any trading advisor for the
Partnership and shall not permit the “churning” of the
Partnership’s account. The General Partner has been
authorized to enter into the Customer Agreement with Morgan
Stanley & Co. LLC (“MS & Co.”), as
described in the Memorandum, and to cause the Partnership to pay
MS & Co. the trading and transaction fees described
therein and to negotiate customer agreements in the future on those
or other terms. The General Partner may take such other actions as
it deems necessary or desirable to manage the business of the
Partnership, including, but not limited to, the following: opening
bank accounts with state or national banks; paying, or authorizing
the payment of expenses of the Partnership, such as management and
incentive fees, legal and accounting fees, printing and reporting
fees, and registration and other fees of governmental agencies; and
investing or directing the investment of funds of the Partnership
not being utilized as margin deposits.

The General Partner may, in its
discretion, acting in the best interests of the Partnership,
negotiate with MS & Co. to amend the Customer Agreement so
that the Partnership is charged round-turn brokerage commissions
instead of the monthly flat-rate fee initially to be
charged.

The General Partner shall maintain a
list of the names and addresses of, and interests owned by, all
Partners, a copy of which shall be furnished to Limited Partners
upon request either in person or by mail and upon payment of the
cost of reproduction and mailing for a purpose reasonably related
to such Limi
