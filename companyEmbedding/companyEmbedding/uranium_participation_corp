Uranium Participation Corporation (TSX: U) is a Toronto-based holding company investing nearly all of its assets in uranium, both in the form of uranium oxide (U
3O
8) or uranium hexafluoride (UF
6), with the primary investment objective of achieving capital appreciation in the value of its uranium holdings.[1] The common shares represent an indirect interest in physical uranium owned by UPC. The mission of the corporation is to provide an investment alternative for investors interested in holding uranium. The structure of the corporation allows it to be purely a holding company play on uranium, with no operational details in its consolidated annual filings.
Uranium Participation Corporation was incorporated on March 15, 2005. At least 85% of net proceeds of any equity offering were to be invested in uranium. The UPC buys and holds uranium assets and does not actively speculate on short-term prices.[2] UPC was the brainchild of billionaire financier Eric Sprott,[3] of Sprott School of Business and Sprott Molybdenum Participation Corporation fame.[4]
UPC held a significant stake in Uranium One[3] before the latter was purchased outright by ARMZ Uranium Holding in January 2013 for $1.3bn.[5]
The uranium holdings are physically stored in duly licensed facilities located in Canada, France, and the United States.[6]

Relationship with Denison Mines[edit]
Because Uranium Participation does not have a license to purchase and hold uranium directly, the fund buys and holds the commodity through Denison Mines, which it controls for this purpose. Denison Mines is the manager of the corporation and does not have any ownership interest in UPC. Ron Hochstein, an alumnus of Noranda, has been the CEO of Denison since 2000 as well as the CEO of UPC.[7] The arrangement whereby Denison and UPC occupy the same suite 402[8] is a convenience designed to satisfy sleepy government regulators.
Luxembourg subsidiary UPCL[edit]
In March 2013, the Cyprus government reached an agreement with the Eurogroup to receive a €10 billion loan to refinance its public debt and achieve its macroeconomic targets. As a condition of receiving the Eurogroup loan, Cyprus’s two major banks, Laiki Bank and Bank of Cyprus were restructured to restore their capital requirements. Uninsured deposits greater than €100,000 were subject to conversions into Bank of Cyprus shares. At February 28, 2013, UPC held approximately €13,000 in Cyprus bank accounts therefore these funds should be fully insured and are not anticipated to be impacted by the bank restructurings. UPC's uranium held by Uranium Participation Cyprus Limited’s Luxembourg branch is also not impacted by the Eurogroup bailout of Cyprus.[9]
The substantively enacted future tax rates, in UPC’s various jurisdictions, range from 3.0% to 26.5%. In fiscal 2013, the Corporation incurred current tax recoveries of $13,000 and future tax recoveries of $3,021,000. The combined tax recoveries for the current year of $3,034,000 reflects an effective tax rate of approximately 3.1% compared to tax recoveries of $18,997,000 and an effective tax rate of 7.8% in the prior year. The decline in the effective tax rate is primarily a result of an increase in the proportion of deductible temporary differences arising in the year that have not been benefited as deferred tax assets or used to offset tax liabilities, and an increase in the proportion of inventory held by the Luxembourg branch of UPC’s wholly owned subsidiary, Uranium Participation Cyprus Limited, which is taxed at the lowest rate within the Corporation.[10]

The substantively enacted future tax rates, in UPC’s various jurisdictions, range from 3.0% to 26.5%. In fiscal 2013, the Corporation incurred current tax recoveries of $13,000 and future tax recoveries of $3,021,000. The combined tax recoveries for the current year of $3,034,000 reflects an effective tax rate of approximately 3.1% compared to tax recoveries of $18,997,000 and an effective tax rate of 7.8% in the prior year. The decline in the effective tax rate is primarily a result of an increase in the proportion of deductible temporary differences arising in the year that have not been benefited as deferred tax assets or used to offset tax liabilities, and an increase in the proportion of inventory held by the Luxembourg branch of UPC’s wholly owned subsidiary, Uranium Participation Cyprus Limited, which is taxed at the lowest rate within the Corporation.[10]

Uranium Participation Corporation (TSX: U) is a Toronto-based holding company investing nearly all of its assets in uranium, both in the form of uranium oxide (U
3O
8) or uranium hexafluoride (UF
6), with the primary investment objective of achieving capital appreciation in the value of its uranium holdings.[1] The common shares represent an indirect interest in physical uranium owned by UPC. The mission of the corporation is to provide an investment alternative for investors interested in holding uranium. The structure of the corporation allows it to be purely a holding company play on uranium, with no operational details in its consolidated annual filings.
Uranium Participation Corporation was incorporated on March 15, 2005. At least 85% of net proceeds of any equity offering were to be invested in uranium. The UPC buys and holds uranium assets and does not actively speculate on short-term prices.[2] UPC was the brainchild of billionaire financier Eric Sprott,[3] of Sprott School of Business and Sprott Molybdenum Participation Corporation fame.[4]
UPC held a significant stake in Uranium One[3] before the latter was purchased outright by ARMZ Uranium Holding in January 2013 for $1.3bn.[5]
The uranium holdings are physically stored in duly licensed facilities located in Canada, France, and the United States.[6]

Relationship with Denison Mines[edit]
Because Uranium Participation does not have a license to purchase and hold uranium directly, the fund buys and holds the commodity through Denison Mines, which it controls for this purpose. Denison Mines is the manager of the corporation and does not have any ownership interest in UPC. Ron Hochstein, an alumnus of Noranda, has been the CEO of Denison since 2000 as well as the CEO of UPC.[7] The arrangement whereby Denison and UPC occupy the same suite 402[8] is a convenience designed to satisfy sleepy government regulators.
Luxembourg subsidiary UPCL[edit]
In March 2013, the Cyprus government reached an agreement with the Eurogroup to receive a €10 billion loan to refinance its public debt and achieve its macroeconomic targets. As a condition of receiving the Eurogroup loan, Cyprus’s two major banks, Laiki Bank and Bank of Cyprus were restructured to restore their capital requirements. Uninsured deposits greater than €100,000 were subject to conversions into Bank of Cyprus shares. At February 28, 2013, UPC held approximately €13,000 in Cyprus bank accounts therefore these funds should be fully insured and are not anticipated to be impacted by the bank restructurings. UPC's uranium held by Uranium Participation Cyprus Limited’s Luxembourg branch is also not impacted by the Eurogroup bailout of Cyprus.[9]
The substantively enacted future tax rates, in UPC’s various jurisdictions, range from 3.0% to 26.5%. In fiscal 2013, the Corporation incurred current tax recoveries of $13,000 and future tax recoveries of $3,021,000. The combined tax recoveries for the current year of $3,034,000 reflects an effective tax rate of approximately 3.1% compared to tax recoveries of $18,997,000 and an effective tax rate of 7.8% in the prior year. The decline in the effective tax rate is primarily a result of an increase in the proportion of deductible temporary differences arising in the year that have not been benefited as deferred tax assets or used to offset tax liabilities, and an increase in the proportion of inventory held by the Luxembourg branch of UPC’s wholly owned subsidiary, Uranium Participation Cyprus Limited, which is taxed at the lowest rate within the Corporation.[10]

About Uranium Participation Corporation
UPC was incorporated pursuant to the Business Corporations Act (Ontario) on March 15, 2005 and became a publicly listed company on the Toronto Stock Exchange (the "TSX") on May 10, 2005.  The registered and head office of UPC is located at 1100 - 40 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario M5J 1T1. 

UPC is a company which invests at least 85% of the proceeds of its equity offerings in uranium, with the primary objective of achieving appreciation in the value of its uranium holdings.  The Corporation also lends its uranium to third parties from time to time.  Unless the context requires otherwise, references to "uranium" means uranium oxide in concentrates ("U3O8") and uranium hexafluoride ("UF6").  

Since incorporation to the end of the 2015 fiscal year, the Corporation has completed nine public offerings with aggregate gross proceeds of $704.6 million.  The Corporation received a further $31.2 million from the exercise of warrants issued under the public offerings and approximately $8.0 million from the exercise of options assumed by UPC.  See "About UPC - Operations" for more information.   The net proceeds from the offerings, the exercise of warrants and the options were used to or have been set aside to fund the purchase of uranium, the repurchase of shares pursuant to a normal course issuer bid and general corporate purposes. 

The Corporation's uranium is held directly or indirectly through UPC's only subsidiary, Uranium Participation Bermuda Limited ("UPBL"), which is wholly owned by UPC. UPBL was established effective March 11, 2016 pursuant to a certificate of continuance issued by the Bermuda Register of Companies on the migration of the Corporation's subsidiary Uranium Participation Cyprus Limited ("UPCL") from Cyprus to Bermuda.  UPCL was incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Cyprus on September 10, 2006. In August 2007, UPCL established a branch office in Luxembourg through which the operations of UPCL were conducted and which has been wound up in connection with the migration and formation of UPBL. UPBL directly invests in, and holds, uranium. Unless otherwise indicated or where the context otherwise requires, references herein to UPC or the Corporation include UPBL.

Upon its formation, UPC appointed Denison Mines Inc. (the "Manager"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Denison Mines Corp., to manage UPC pursuant to a management services agreement.  The Manager provides four officers to the Corporation, being the President and Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Vice-President Commercial and the Corporate Secretary.  See "About UPC - Management of UPC" for more information.
