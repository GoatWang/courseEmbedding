Packaging Corporation of America Completes Acquisition of Boise Inc. | Business Wire


























































Packaging Corporation of America Completes Acquisition of Boise Inc.






October 25, 2013 10:50 AM Eastern Daylight Time



LAKE FOREST, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Packaging Corporation of America (NYSE:PKG) today announced the 
      completion of its acquisition of Boise Inc. (NYSE:BZ). After the 
      previously announced completion of the tender offer for all of the 
      outstanding shares of Boise, PCA completed the second step merger under 
      Delaware law, making Boise a wholly-owned subsidiary of PCA.
    

      At the effective time of the merger, all shares of Boise common stock 
      not purchased in the tender offer (excluding those shares for which 
      holders properly exercise appraisal rights under Delaware law and those 
      held by PCA or Boise or their respective wholly owned subsidiaries) were 
      converted into the right to receive $12.55 in cash, without interest and 
      less any required withholding taxes, which is the same price that was 
      paid for shares of Boise common stock purchased in the tender offer. 
      Boise common stock will no longer be listed on the New York Stock 
      Exchange or any other securities exchange.
    

About the new PCA


      The combined company, headquartered in Lake Forest, IL, is the fourth 
      largest producer of containerboard and corrugated packaging products in 
      the United States. PCA will now operate eight mills and 97 corrugated 
      product plants and related facilities. PCA is the third largest producer 
      of uncoated freesheet paper in North America. Paper products include 
      imaging papers for the office and home, printing and converting papers, 
      and papers used in packaging, such as pressure sensitive papers.
    

This news release contains forward-looking statements that are based 
      on PCA's current expectations and beliefs and are subject to a number of 
      risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to 
      differ materially from those described. All statements, other than 
      statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed 
      forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve 
      significant risks and uncertainties, including whether the anticipated 
      benefits of the acquisition of Boise can be achieved and those more 
      fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reports 
      filed by PCA, including PCA’s most recent annual report on Form 10-K and 
      any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. Please refer 
      to PCA’s most recent Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K for additional information 
      on the uncertainties and risk factors related to PCA’s business. Unless 
      otherwise noted, PCA is providing this information as of Oct. 25, 2013, 
      and expressly disclaims any duty to update information contained in this 
      news release.
