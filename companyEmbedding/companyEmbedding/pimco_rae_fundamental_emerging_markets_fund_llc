We’re Bullish on India—and You Should Be Too

Tilting Emerging Market Allocations toward Consumption, Growth & Quality
by Gaurav Sinha
For a global portfolio, emerging markets (EM) play several important roles. Some investors may invest in EM to diversify their global allocations, while others may be looking for faster growth.

Seeking Smarter Exposure to India’s Stock Market
by Gaurav Sinha
Driven by global “risk-on” and a host of local factors that we have covered in depth, the Indian equity markets have been doing very well for the last few months.

Emerging Markets Valuations
by Jeremy Schwartz, Christopher Gannatti & Jeff Weniger

We believe the current environment is setting up an interesting opportunity for the astute investor to capitalize on inexpensive equity valuations in high-dividend-paying Emerging Markets equities. At the same time, those same markets are priced in currencies that in aggregate are at valuations akin to those seen near the beginning of Emerging Market’s large multiyear outperformance run that commenced at the beginning of this century.

by Gaurav Sinha

by Gaurav Sinha
While we are busy discussing policies in the United States, India quietly laid the foundation for a technology empire that is going to digitally connect 17% of humanity.

Seeking Smarter Exposure to India’s Stock Market
by Gaurav Sinha
Driven by global “risk-on” and a host of local factors that we have covered in depth, the Indian equity markets have been doing very well for the last few months.

Emerging Markets Valuations
by Jeremy Schwartz, Christopher Gannatti & Jeff Weniger

We believe the current environment is setting up an interesting opportunity for the astute investor to capitalize on inexpensive equity valuations in high-dividend-paying Emerging Markets equities. At the same time, those same markets are priced in currencies that in aggregate are at valuations akin to those seen near the beginning of Emerging Market’s large multiyear outperformance run that commenced at the beginning of this century.
