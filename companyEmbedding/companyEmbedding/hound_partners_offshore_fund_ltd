          These Are The Stocks That Hedge Funds Are Buying Up Right
          Now



          Introducing Insider Monkey's Billionaire Hedge Fund
          Manager Index



          The 10 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds







Jonathan Auerbach’s Hound Partners
  disclosed a 10.79% stake (2.8 million shares) in Network-1
  Security Solutions (NSSI.OB). On January 13th, Hound Partners Offshore Fund Ltd. disclosed
  the ownership of 1.6 million shares on Form 4. These are
  indirectly owned by Jonathan Auerbach. Yesterday, Hound Partners
  Offshore Fund disposed of 100,000 shares so that it doesn’t
  have to be subject to Section 16 anymore.

  According to Yahoo Finance, Network-1 Security Solutions, Inc.
  engages in the acquisition, development, licensing, and
  protection of intellectual property and proprietary technologies
  in the United States. The company owns six patents covering
  various telecommunications and data networking technologies,
  including patents covering the control of power delivery over
  Ethernet networks for the purpose of remotely powering network
  devices and systems, and methods for the transmission of audio,
  video, and data over local area networks. Network-1 Security
  Solutions, Inc. was incorporated in 1990 and is based in New
  York, New York.

  In a separate 13D filing, Jonathan Auerbach revealed that he
  spent nearly $15 Million on another microcap stock: Avantair Inc
  (AAIR.OB)

  Since these stocks trade over the counter, Hound Partners won’t
  report them on 13F filings. They revealed these positions in 2010
  and current filings pretty much show a reshuffling of these
  shares among different funds controlled by Auerbach.
  Nevertheless, this gave us an opportunity to look into some of
  their “hidden” investments.

  Jonathan Auerbach is seeded by Julian Robertson. He reported a total of
  $381 Million worth of stocks in his portfolio at the end of
  September. His largest holdings were W.R. Grace & Co (GRA),
  Transdigm Group (TDG), Ensco Plc (ESV), Google (GOOG), Liberty
  Media Starz Group (LSTZA), and Compass Minerals Intl (CMP). Ensco
  is also owned by Greenlight’s David Einhorn. Seth Klarman owns Liberty Media Starz.
