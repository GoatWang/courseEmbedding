Whole Foods Market® announces four new members to its board of directors
Company Also Closes Sale of Preferred Stock to Leonard Green & Partners, L.P.
Share:

	 

AUSTIN, TX (December 2, 2008) — Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ: WFMI) announced today that it recently has added four new members to its board of directors, bringing the size of the board to ten. The new board members include Stephanie Kugelman, vice chairman emeritus of Young & Rubicam Inc. and chairman of A Second Opinion strategic consulting group, and Kip Tindell, chairman and CEO of The Container Store. Additionally, Jonathan A. Seiffer, partner, and Jonathan D. Sokoloff, managing partner, both of Leonard Green & Partners, L.P. (LGP), have also joined the board in connection with LGP’s recent preferred stock investment in Whole Foods Market. Whole Foods Market closed its sale of preferred stock to LGP today.

	“These four talented leaders bring unique wisdom and complement the experience of our current board members,” said John Mackey, chairman, chief executive officer, and co-founder of Whole Foods Market. “In this challenging economic environment, we feel fortunate to have this fresh addition of intellectual capital.”

	Ms. Kugelman is vice chairman emeritus of Young & Rubicam Inc. (Y&R) and chairman of A Second Opinion strategic consulting group. Her previous position was vice chairman chief strategic officer of Young and Rubicam brands. Prior to that, she was chairman and CEO of the New York flagship office of Young and Rubicam. Ms. Kugelman was the first account planner to head the lead office of a top-twenty advertising agency. Before that, she was managing director and vice chairman of Y&RNY, as well as the director of the agency’s brand planning group. She was a key player in Y&R’s new business development.

	Mr. Tindell, chairman and CEO of The Container Store, opened the first location in Dallas in 1978. Since then, the company has been named nine years in a row as one of the “100 Best Companies to Work For” in America by FORTUNE magazine, thanks to its progressive, employee-empowering corporate culture. The Container Store now has 46 stores across the country and 2008 fiscal year sales are projected at $650 million. Retail analysts cite the company’s devotion to the original concept as the formula for its success, noting that other retailers haven’t focused on an inventory mix solely devoted to storage and organization products like The Container Store.

	Mr. Seiffer is a partner with Leonard Green & Partners, L.P., and has been at the firm since 1994. He presently serves on the board of directors for David's Bridal, Inc., The Sports Authority, Inc., The Tire Rack, Inc., and Varsity Brands, Inc.

	Mr. Sokoloff is a managing partner with Leonard Green & Partners, L.P., which he joined in 1990. Currently, he serves on the boards of several retail companies including The Container Store, David's Bridal, Inc., Jetro Cash & Carry, Inc., Rite Aid Corporation, The Sports Authority, Inc., The Tire Rack, Inc., and Varsity Brands, Inc.

	On Nov. 5, Whole Foods Market announced an agreement to sell $425 million of its Series A 8.00% Redeemable Convertible Exchangeable Participating Preferred Stock to Green Equity Investors V, L.P., Green Equity Investors Side V, L.P. and Thyme Coinvest, LLC, affiliates of Leonard Green & Partners, L.P.

About Profile Visibility
Profile Visibility is based on the total number of weekly profile views. It provides a weekly snapshot of
            which profiles users are viewing on martindale.com in the form of a ranking. We do not differentiate in
            the case of a tie, which may mean a number of attorneys in the same city display the same
            ranking. For example, if three lawyers each received 20 profiles views last week in Atlanta, and 20 is the
            highest number of profile views for that week, all three lawyers would receive a #1 ranking.

About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings™, please visit our Ratings Page on Martindale.com and our Frequently Asked Questions
Close ×




About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.

Client Reviews 


About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Client Review Ratings, please visit our Client Review Page.
