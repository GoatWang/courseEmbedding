About Us

Two of the most trusted household brands, Reynolds® and Hefty®, joined together as Reynolds Consumer Products in 2010. While the establishment of this new company made it official, the truth is that Reynolds® and Hefty® products have been found side-by-side in the kitchens of American families for more than three generations.The creation of both the Reynolds® and Hefty® brands is the direct result of American ingenuity mixed with a bit of elbow grease. Reynolds Wrap® foil was invented after aluminum was no longer needed for military use; and became a new staple for American kitchens. Hefty® waste bags were first developed with excess material from an early plastics innovator, creating another household essential.

Stephen R Reynolds's Experience
Title: Network Administrator
               Company: Nucor Building Systems
Job Details
               Just who is Nucor? [TOP]Nucor is a nationally known corporation whose businesses are centered on the manufacturing and distribution of steel and construction products.  Nucor places great emphasis on providing the customer with quality products, a timely schedule, and at a competitive price.  Among Nucor divisions are Nucor Steel , Vulcraft, Nucor Fastener, Nucor Cold Finish, Nucor Yamato, Iron Carbide, and of course, Nucor Building Systems.There is a great deal of instability among manufacturers.  Just how stable is Nucor? [TOP]Nucor is a Fortune 500 Company, and is well recognized in the construction industry.  Nucor's solid reputation for growth and profitability has led to its recognition as one of the best-managed corporations in America.Does Nucor Building Systems have a builder network? [TOP]Nucor has the expertise, equipment, material, and human resources to make great buildings, but in order to have a satisfied owner, a local builder must bring the project together.  A qualified builder network to market and construct our products, coupled with our mission to be the low cost producer of quality building systems, form an unbeatable team in the marketplace.I understand that once I become a Nucor Builder, I can buy joist and deck from Vulcraft at a real bargain.  How does this work? [TOP]Nucor Building Systems is completely autonomous.  Nucor Building Systems supplies joist and deck when part of a complete building system, but does not sell or supply these items as separate components.  Nucor Building Systems, Nucor Steel, and Vulcraft all have separate marketing vehicles that rarely overlap.  We respect the loyalty Vulcraft has to their mode of distribution and do not directly compete with their customers on components.Are there advantages to having sister divisions in the steel business? [TOP]Nucor Building Systems receives the same pricing from sister divisions as any other customer for like products.  However, we do have one real advantage.  Intimate knowledge of other divisions' products and processes allows us to work together to accomplish more economical material solutions.  This creativity and close communication, along with our research center in Nebraska, allows us to more effectively integrate raw material options into our building solutions.Is Nucor Building Systems a member of MBMA? [TOP]Yes. Nucor is proud to be a member and is active in many committee functions.A building system is a complicated thing.  What steps does Nucor take to be competitive? [TOP]A building is a complicated thing!  That is why Nucor assembled a great management team with so much industry experience.  In addition, we have people at every level from many competitive companies within the business.  While others were cutting back, Nucor implemented an aggressive expansion program.  This combined with our state of the art manufacturing facilities, allows Nucor to design and produce a complete building package with real efficiency.

While we are an international presence, we're also small enough to know our customers by their first names. We're looking for people that will help us reach our goals.
Please take a few minutes to read what some of our employees think about working here.
