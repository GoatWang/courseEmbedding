A book is the nearest thing we have to telepathy, sending thoughts from the author's mind directly to the readers even over a gap of two thousand years. Even with all our technology, there is no better way to make a brain to brain connection than by simply reading a book. Go Way Back to the BeginningAntique books and manuscripts offer an amazing look into history, you can see the thoughts of the past as they saw them themselves. Antiquarian and collectible books don't just look good on the shelf, they also grow in value. There is nothing like picking up an old book to really feel the past. Explore the Human ConditionThe beauty of fiction and literature is that it lets you explore the human condition in a way that mere recitations of fact can never duplicate. Rather than focusing on the mundane, these books bring out the emotional truth of human experience. They show you who you really are by exposing you to other experiences you could never have discovered yourself. These books are the underpinnings of human culture. See how someone else sees the world. Discover the World Around YouNon fiction books offer the widest range of human experience, joined only by their commitment to the truth. From self-help to space travel, they run the gamut of human thought. Learn how to deal with your family, how to save money for that trip, or how the Egyptians built the pyramids. Follow famous lives, or study esoteric philosophies. It's all there for you to find. Non fiction gives us the foundations of human civilization, the story of how everything works. Keep Learning for LifeEducation is the gateway to success, and textbooks are your key to that door. From elementary readers to calculus texts, these books are the doors to our full potential. Textbooks not only give us facts, they give us the tools to interpret and make use of those facts. They are the key to organizing our thoughts and making our brains work for us. It's not just academia either, mechanics textbooks can help you learn how to fix your car.Tell us what you think - opens in new window or tabSide Refine PanelShop by CategoryAntique Books and ManuscriptsAudiobooksBook & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsSee all in Book & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsBook Wholesale LotsOther Book & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsWholesale AudiobooksWholesale MagazinesBook AccessoriesSee all in Book AccessoriesAddress BooksBlank Diaries & JournalsBook CoversBook LightsBook PlatesBook Stands & HoldersBookendsBookmarksOther Book AccessoriesCatalogsSee all in CatalogsAgriculture CatalogsArt & Exhibitions CatalogsAuction CatalogsClothing & Fashion CatalogsDepartment Stores CatalogsMusic & Instruments CatalogsOther CatalogsOwner's Manuals CatalogsToys & Hobbies CatalogsChildren & Young Adult BooksSee all in Children & Young Adult BooksChildren & YA Non-Fiction BooksChildren's Fiction BooksChildren's Picture BooksOther Children & Young Adult BooksYoung Adult Fiction BooksCookbooksFiction & Literature BooksMagazine Back IssuesNonfiction BooksOther BooksTextbooks & Educational Books

One reason is simple, while the Internet may be everywhere, it's not always accurate, and when it comes to educating people you need to have accurate information. That's why approved textbooks are so important; they give you the facts, not the opinions of someone on the Internet.Help for the Home SchooledNo one needs textbooks more than the parent who home schools their children. There is a growing movement toward home schooling so that parents can focus their children's education on the aspects Engl are most important to them, and tailor the curriculum to their own child's individual learning styles. From science and mathematics to English and history, textbooks are a vital part of any education program.For Every Age LevelNo matter what age or grade level your student is at, there are education textbooks to cover their needs.  Even if they go to a regular grade school, there are supplementary textbooks you can pick up to help them if they need it. Not every book is the right fit for every student, and sometimes the one who is having the most trouble with math in school is the one who flourishes the most as soon as you expose them to a different textbook.Explore Adult EducationEducation isn't just for children; many adults have a need for textbooks too. From those who left school early and are now looking for textbooks so they can get their GED, to professionals looking to further their development, there's a huge demand for textbooks from people in all walks of life. It's not just academic textbooks. You can also get textbooks on practical subjects from financial management, to woodworking, and auto repair.Control Your College EducationCollege is more than just an investment in your future; it's an investment. One way to take charge of your college costs is to look outside your college bookstore for your textbooks. Many textbooks, especially in fields such as English and history do not change much from year to year, so grabbing last  year's engineering handbook may be the best way to go.Tell us what you think - opens in new window or tabSide Refine PanelShop by CategoryBooksTextbooks & Educational BooksBook AccessoriesAntique Books and ManuscriptsAudiobooksCatalogsChildren & Young Adult BooksCookbooksFiction & Literature BooksMagazine Back IssuesNonfiction BooksBook & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsOther BooksFormatsee allHardcoverMixed LotPaperbackNot SpecifiedPublication Yearsee all1900-19491950-19992000-20102011-NowSubjectsee allBusiness & EconomicsEducation, TeachingEngineeringHistoryMathMedicineScience & TechLanguagesee allConditionsee allBrand NewLike NewVery GoodGoodAcceptableNot SpecifiedPricePlease provide a valid price range$-$Buying Formatsee allAll ListingsAuctionBuy It NowItem Locationsee allDefaultWithindistance2 miles5 miles10 miles15 miles20 miles50 miles75 miles100 miles150 miles200 miles500 miles750 miles1000 miles1500 miles2000 milesofGoUS OnlyNorth AmericaWorldwideDelivery Optionssee allFree ShippingFree In-store PickupShow onlysee allReturns AcceptedCompleted ItemsSold ItemsDeals & SavingsMore refinements...

Profile


Chair of the firm's Global Trademarks and Brand Management Group, and Co-Chair of the firm's Global Women’s Initiative, Susan is consistently recognized as having one of the preeminent international trademark practices in the country and for being a game-changer. When the stakes are high and critical brands are at risk, Fortune 500 companies, world champion athletes, high-net-worth individuals, A-list celebrities and highly visible pre-IPO companies turn to Susan for her strategic thought leadership and counsel, honed by her three decades of experience. At the forefront of global strategic management and monetization of big name brands on a worldwide level, she is known for developing cutting-edge branding strategies and solutions, most notably in "bet-the brand," high stakes trademark cases. Susan works directly with CEOs and senior executives, in and out of corporate boardrooms. Her practice has spanned over 30 years across virtually every industry and in most jurisdictions throughout the world.


Most recently, Susan was singled out by Euromoney, naming her "Best in Trademark” at its Americas Women in Business Law Awards. Best Lawyers in America named her the "Lawyer of the Year" in Trademark Law for Los Angeles and the Los Angeles and San Francisco Daily Journal  named her one of the Top 100 Women Attorneys twice and Top 75 IP Attorneys in California from 2003 – 2016. World Trademark Review has repeatedly named Susan one of only two women as top National and California trademark attorneys in its WTR 1000 rankings and National Diversity Council named her one of the Top 50 Women Lawyers in the U.S.  Law360 named Susan to its Intellectual Property Editorial Advisory Board five times and profiled her as one of the "10 Most Admired Intellectual Property Attorneys" in the United States in 2010. The University of California Irvine’s Business School invited Susan to serve on the Dean’s Advisory Board.
Susan helps her clients monetize and optimize their critical IP assets through strategic and creative positioning, management, and enforcement of their worldwide trademark, copyright and domain name portfolios and extensive collateral product licensing. Susan is known for partnering with her clients, working with their legal, marketing and business teams to ensure that marketing strategies and business sensitivities are integrated into her legal analysis and advice. Susan conducts trademark due diligence in M&A transactions and works with corporate and tax attorneys on asset-based financing and the restructuring of IP assets for tax planning.
Susan works directly with senior management teams, in and out of corporate boardrooms, and manages major international roll-outs of critical brands. She routinely confronts and tackles serious registration challenges as well as issues concerning collateral advertising, ecommerce and social media platforms. She pushes the boundaries of traditional protection by navigating her clients through the new frontiers of online brand protection, including the dark web. Susan has been involved in a number of highly sensitive and visible international disputes over U.S. rights to famous marks, including complicated distribution rights cases.

Her understanding of systems and process flow and an ability to leverage them made her a great asset to the company.  In addition, she worked very hard to become a good mentor to junior employees within the companySee moreSee lessSusan was one of the best production cordinators that I ever worked with.  She was highly organized and on top of time and action with excellent attention to detail.  Once the order was placed with her, as long as the details where provided correctly, I felt confident that the goods would arrive on time and with no mistakes which could cause costly charge backs.  I wish I could use her today in my business, as she would be an excellent asset to any organization.See moreSee lessSign up to see who recommended SusanGroupsAPPAREL & ACCESSORY JOBSView Susan’s full profile to...See who you know in commonGet introducedContact Susan directlyView Susan’s Full ProfileNot the Susan you’re looking for?
