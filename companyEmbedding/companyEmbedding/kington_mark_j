Education








Of the Student, By the Student, For the Student™ - Service Learning Projects
One of the ways The Journey Through Hallowed Ground Partnership helps students develop an appreciation for the past and a responsibility for the future is through its groundbreaking service learning programs. The Of the Student, By the Student, For the Student™ Program is a nationally recognized, award-winning program that offers students a full immersion in American history and heritage. Middle School students find themselves onsite at the Journey Through Hallowed Ground National Heritage Area, bringing the stories of those who came before them to life in videos that they write, produce, shoot, and edit themselves. The resulting mini-movies, or Vodcasts, become part of the official interpretive materials at partnering National Parks. You donation is essential to helping kids learn about the history in their own backyards! 




Extreme Journey Camps
The Extreme 
Journey Camp is our innovative, award-winning summer camp where middle school students join the Journey Through Hallowed Ground “Intelligence Agency”. After receiving their top-secret briefing packets, agents are ready to accept their mission.

Agents literally canoe, bike and walk in the footsteps of the great leaders from this region that came before them. During their exploration, we ask them the question, “what does leadership mean to you?” Using cutting edge technology, students create vodcasts using the experience of iconic figures to answer this question. Your support helps the JTHG Partnership continue offering camp scholarships to local kids who want to learn more!
