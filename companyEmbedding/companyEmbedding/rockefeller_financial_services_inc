Rockefeller & Co. Participates in Operation Backpack 2016As part of our community outreach initiative, Rockefeller & Co. again participated in Operation Backpack 2016.Thousands of children live in New York City’s homeless and domestic violence shelters. One of the most devastating consequences of homelessness is the impact it has on a child's education.   Each year since 2001, Volunteers of America-Greater New York has been giving new backpacks filled with grade-specific school supplies to children who are homeless throughout New York City and in need school supplies for the upcoming school year. A filled backpack relieves parents of a financial burden and these children, who face otherwise chaotic lives, look and feel more like their classmates. Most importantly, a filled backpack allows these children to start the school year feeling prepared and confident, with the knowledge that their education is just as important.Thank you to everyone who donated; we collected over 50 backpacks for this year’s Operation Backpack.

People Spotlight
Elisabeth “Lisi” Madden, Vice President, Rockefeller Trust Company, N.A.
Elisabeth “Lisi” Madden, Vice President, Rockefeller Trust Company, N.A.French Influence: Lisi grew up in Manhattan and moved with her family to Paris, France at age eleven. Being exposed to a new culture at an early age taught Lisi a number of valuable lessons and skills, especially learning to speak French.  Her favorite memory of her time in France is visiting Provence in the springtime. Lisi and her family moved back to New York City after her freshman year of high school. On her time in Africa: After taking the bar exam, Lisi decided to take a little time off. Her idea of “time off,” however, was a tad more adventurous than others as she embarked on a journey to Africa. For a month, Lisi was hosted by a family in Arusha, Tanzania and spent time visiting various communities. On attending Law School at Vanderbilt University: Lisi loved everything about going to Law School in Nashville, Tennessee. One of her favorite places to spend time was the Blue Bird Café, which is an iconic spot that features performances by country music singers and songwriters. Perhaps this is why Lisi can always be found listening to country music; especially, George Strait, her favorite country singer.   On her favorite part of New York City: Brooklyn. Lisi laughed while explaining, “It feels like the suburbs to me.”Outside of work: Lisi is a mother to two children, ages five and three. She loves reading, spending time outdoors and running. Lisi modestly admitted that she competed in her first marathon while in college.    Favorite food: Just like her children, Lisi’s favorite foods are pizza and ice cream.  Why Trusts and Estates: Lisi enjoys the trusts and estates area of the law, as it involves not only the understanding of complex legal issues, but also requires substantial interactions with individuals and families.
