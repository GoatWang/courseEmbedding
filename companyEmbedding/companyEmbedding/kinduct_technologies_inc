Kinduct Technologies Brings Performance Software to High School











































































 






 






























Kinduct Technologies Brings Performance Software to Elite High School Athletics

 SportTechie Wire July 12, 2016July 13, 2016  Guest 



This section of SportTechie, “Sports Tech Wire”, contains original press releases issued by various companies and industry organizations. The releases are reviewed by the SportTechie editorial staff to ensure relevancy to the sports technology industry.  For information and access, send your name and email address to [email protected]
HALIFAX, NS – July 12, 2016 – As high school strength and conditioning coaches increasingly adopt the methods of professional sports teams, Kinduct Technologies has been helping elite coaches implement industry-leading technology solutions for athlete management. Some of Kinduct’s high school clients include Oak Hill Academy (famous for its exceptional basketball alumni like Carmelo Anthony, Josh Smith, and Kevin Durant.), AC Flora High School, Bradley-Bourbonnais High School, Battle Ground Academy, and Greater Atlanta Christian Academy.
“As sport technology and sports science continue to evolve, it is my goal to provide our athletes with the absolute best in athlete management data”, said Micah Kurtz (2016 National High School Strength and Conditioning Coach of the Year), a strength & conditioning coach and consultant for both Oak Hill Academy and AC Flora High School. “Kinduct has given our staff the ability to collect our athlete’s performance and health data in one location. Phil Anderson (Sales Executive) and the rest of the staff at Kinduct have been unbelievable in walking us through the setup process and answering any questions that have arisen. We are excited to be partnered with Kinduct and the opportunity to give our athletes’ every possible advantage over the competition.”
Coaches like Gary Schofield (2012 National High School Strength and Conditioning Coach of the Year) from Greater Atlanta Christian Academy have been using the Kinduct platform to collect, visualize and analyze their performance data. Through the platform, these coaches gain actionable insights that help them maximize game-readiness and keep their teams performing at the peak of their abilities. “Data can help drive coaching and connections with athletes but only if it can be managed and applied.  Kinduct has allowed us to manage daily training loads, stress levels, hydration, nutrition and sleep in regards to level of recovery and readiness levels”, said Schofield. “With Kinduct monitoring, we are able to apply the appropriate dosage of exercise that allows each student-athlete to maximize benefits and reduce training risks. Meeting the individual needs of an athlete in a team setting like ours would be impossible without Kinduct. Our overuse injury rates have dropped dramatically in the past year and we celebrated 9 Final Four Finishes and 2 State Championship teams!”
Coach Fred Eaves (2015 National High School Strength and Conditioning Coach of the Year) of Battleground Academy has been using the platform for over a year. “We have implemented daily monitoring our students with the Kinduct platform, and it has dramatically increased our students’ awareness of their behaviors outside of our training and the regular school day. Readiness scores have improved dramatically in the 6 months we have used the program. Our students feel better and they are learning life-long sustainable habits that lead to both increased health and performance”.
“Our software is a perfect fit for many high schools because it allows them to place a stronger focus on athletics and the health, well-being, and performance of their athletes” said Phil Anderson, sales executive at Kinduct. “The majority of High School coaches understand how important it is to provide their athletes with the tools they need to stay healthy and perform to the best of their abilities. Through our technology, coaches can easily track and monitor athlete performance as well as athlete readiness to perform. The demand for our high school-specific software has grown exponentially and we expect this trend to continue.”
