Zebrafish Labs Inc. Key Developments

Imgix Announces Enhanced Service in Brazil
May 10 17
imgix announced enhanced service in Brazil with a new edge node located in Sao Paulo, Brazil. This new edge node joins recent additions in Dubai, Madrid, Paris, Johannesburg, Montreal and Toronto, improving speed and reliability of the image optimization and delivery service in those regions. The addition of the Sao Paulo node positions imgix for expansion in Brazil, one of the hottest emerging technology markets in the world.


imgix Unveils Second Generation of Popular Page Weight Tool
May 3 17
imgix announced the next generation of a popular online tool that helps developers assess the speed and responsiveness of their websites. The new version of the tool, which has already been used to grade thousands of websites, makes it easier than ever to pinpoint problem images that drag down site performance. A heavy page contains elements that make its file size very large, which takes a long time to download on most connections and can be especially troublesome on mobile. Since images make up 65% of a site’s page weight on average, they’re often a good place to focus when trying to lighten the load. The second generation of imgix’s pageweight tool was designed to be especially useful for finding and fixing heavy images. In addition to analysis of overall site performance, the tool provides a complete breakdown of all images on a site, including existing performance statistics and also how those same images would be presented if imgix’s proprietary technologies were used for further optimization. An additional summary section visually illustrates how image optimization can help reduce the overall page weight of a web page. In this second iteration of the tool, imgix paid particular attention to enhancing its reporting, offering more succinct analyses and providing a more narrative style explanation of how an unoptimized image and heavy page are affecting a given site. Customers can also now receive reports through desktop or mobile. imgix Page Weight Tool: Key Product Updates: Easier Reporting: Receive to-the-point narrative style reports that are less verbose, formatted for mobile, desktop and shareable PDF. Detailed Analysis: Understand what images are performing poorly, and visualize which images are heaviest and lightest on a site.
