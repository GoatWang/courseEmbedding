Cirro Energy Privacy Policy
We know that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so
 carefully and sensibly. This Privacy Policy outlines the information Cirro Energy will collect and how we will use that
 information. This statement will also explain how you can make your preferences known regarding when Cirro Energy may send
 marketing communications to you.
What Information We Collect
Cirro Energy's primary goals in collecting information are to allow us to enroll you for energy service and to offer
 products and services which are relevant to consumers like you. Personal information also allows us to provide services
 and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our service to make your experience smooth and efficient. Any
 personal information that we collect will only be used to render service to you (including administering the rewards associated
 with your account) and for internal marketing purposes of Cirro Energy, except as otherwise required by law or as disclosed to you
 in this Privacy Policy. The information we collect is set out below.
We may ask you to provide:


Contact and identification information including your name, address, government-issued identification card number, social
security number, telephone number, email address, date and place of birth or mother's maiden name;
Product and service related information, such as information on your energy use, the characteristics of your home, your age,
gender and family size, or we may ask you to state your opinion about potential products and services;
Credit and financial information, such as billing, credit history or payment history, credit card numbers, banking information
and employment and income information; and
Rewards and partner information necessary for Cirro Energy to administer the rewards associated with your account, if any.

Whether or not you choose to provide us with the requested information is your choice, but, if you opt not to provide us with
personal information, we may be unable to deliver certain promotions or product information to you that you have requested, or in
some instances, service. You may opt out by contacting us at the address listed in the section below entitled "How to Make Your
Preferences Known."
Non-personal, Aggregate and Statistical Data:
Cirro Energy may collect certain non-personal or aggregate data. For example, we may use web log information (such as your web
browser, operating system, pages visited, etc.) and use "cookies," as defined below, when you visit many of our web pages. For
instance, when you visit one of our websites, our web server will automatically recognize some non-personal information, including
but not limited to the date and time you visited our site, the pages you visited, the referrer (the website you came from), the
type of browser you are using (e.g. Internet Explorer or Safari), the type of operating system you are using (e.g. Windows or Mac),
and the domain name and address of your Internet service provider (e.g. AT&T or Comcast).
Email Addresses:
Cirro Energy requests an email address from you so we can respond to your requests for service or information or matters
relative to your Cirro Energy account. We may also offer products and services which are relevant to consumers like you, but you
may always opt out by contacting us if you do not wish to receive email solicitations at the address listed in the section below
entitled "How to Make Your Preferences Known."
Information from Other Sources:
For reasons such as providing better product recommendations or special offers that we think will interest you and to identify
persons not already an Cirro Energy customer, we may receive information from other sources, including our partners, and add it to
our information. The sources that provide this information have obtained it from public sources or from voluntary submissions. The
type of information we receive may include (but is not limited to) your name, address, telephone number, and in some cases, type
and characteristics of your home, your age, and statistical estimates of your family size, income and home value. We also sometimes
receive updated delivery and address information so that we can correct our records and deliver your next communication more easily.

How We Collect Information
Information You Give Us:
Cirro Energy does not require potential customers or visitors to our websites to provide personal information, except as
necessary to be enrolled as a customer and administer the rewards associated with your account, if any. You may voluntarily choose
to enter contests, vote in polls or otherwise express an opinion, or subscribe to one of our products or services. These programs
may require you to submit some information in order to participate. These programs and the types of information required are
described in more detail below.
Registration/Subscriptions:
To be eligible for certain products or services, visitors may need to register using our online registration forms, where
visitors may be required to provide us with some personal information. Visitors may also be asked to select a user ID and password.
We may ask visitors to submit their name, email address, home address, and zip code. You can always decide not to receive or stop
receiving any targeted solicitations from Cirro Energy that you do not want by contacting us at the address listed in the section
below entitled "How to Make Your Preferences Known."
Contests/Sweepstakes:
Cirro Energy may run voluntary contests, sweepstakes and other promotions. We may ask you to provide personal information that
is needed in order to administer the contest, sweepstakes or promotion and to notify winners.
Referrals:
Occasionally, you will have the opportunity to forward promotional opportunities or other information on the website to friends
and/or relatives or to send messages from our websites to friends and/or relatives. This personal referral information you provide
to facilitate this communication is used on a one-time basis and is not further retained by Cirro Energy except in circumstances
where we obtain consent from the people you have referred to receive communications from us.
Questionnaires, Surveys and Profile Data:
Cirro Energy may occasionally ask you to complete surveys and opinion polls about your interests, needs, and attitudes. Surveys
help us provide better services and products that meet customer needs. Participation is voluntary and these surveys are optional.
Customer Services and Contact Information: If you provide our customer service representatives with feedback on your experiences
with our products or services or otherwise submit questions to our customer service representatives or webmasters, you will be
asked to supply and/or verify personal information for our record keeping and follow-up.
How We Use Your Information
Personal Information:
We may use your personal information to contact you. For example, we may send you marketing or promotional materials including
emails or other information; we may respond to your comments or requests for information; or we may contact you if needed in the
course of fulfilling your service request. We may also use your personal information to confirm and verify your customer enrollment
status, and for credit approval. We may also use your personal information as necessary to provide service to you (including, but
not limited to, providing information to our partners, credit card processing or financial institutions to process your payments).

Cirro Energy may combine non-personal information collected automatically (e.g., through cookies and web beacons) with your
previously submitted personal information. We may also enhance or merge personal information with data obtained from third parties
for the same purposes. We use this personal and statistical information about you to improve our marketing and promotional efforts;
to statistically analyze site usage; to improve our content and product offerings; and to customize our sites' content, layout and
services. We may also use your information to deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests, such
as targeted banners, new services and promotions, or to request that you complete an action that you started but did not yet
complete on our website, such as finishing your enrollment request. We believe these uses allow us to improve our site and better
tailor it to meet our visitors' needs. Cirro Energy occasionally sends emails describing new products, new services, promotions or
events. You may contact us if you do not wish to receive email solicitations from us at the address listed in the section below
entitled "How to Make Your Preferences Known."
Non-personal, Aggregate and Statistical Data:
Cirro Energy uses web log information (such as your web browser, operating system, pages visited, etc.) to help us design our
website, to identify popular features, and for other managerial purposes. However, web logs may be used if necessary to help
identify any person attempting to break into or damage our website. We may share web log information with law enforcement agencies
if we believe that we have evidence of a violation of computer security or related laws.

How We May Share Your Information
Except as described in this statement, we will not disclose your personal information outside of Cirro Energy and its
subsidiaries and affiliates without your consent.

For Promotional Purposes:
Except in the event of a business transfer, we will not share, trade or sell personal information about you, other than with our
subsidiaries and affiliates, for promotional use by any business without giving you an opportunity to opt out of such uses.
However, we may sometimes send offers to Cirro Energy customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that
business the name, address, telephone number or email address of our customers. When companies acquire other businesses, sell all,
or portions of their business, customer information generally is one of the transferred assets. If Cirro Energy or substantially
all of its assets are transferred through merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or any other change of corporate control then, customer
information will of course be one of the transferred assets. Aggregated and statistical data from our website visitors may be
shared with our partners and our subsidiaries and affiliates. For example, we may let a partner know that approximately "20,000
people visited a web page regarding a specific joint promotion." All employees, contractors and other companies engaged by Cirro
Energy for work that involves access to personal information are contractually required to keep the information confidential and
not to use it in any way other than what is necessary to perform their work for Cirro Energy.

For Protection of Cirro Energy and Others:
We may release personal data, including account information, when we believe
release is appropriate to comply with laws, regulations or judicial orders; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Cirro
Energy, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for our protection
against fraud and credit risk reduction. Cirro Energy also reserves the right to share the information to respond to duly
authorized information requests of governmental authorities or where required by law or regulation.

Cookies and Web Beacons
When you view one of our websites, we may collect some non-personal information about you. The collection of this non-personal
information is done either through the "cookie" technology or with "web beacons" (also called "single-pixel gif" or "web pings").
Neither our cookies nor web beacons nor web log information collects any personal information. They do not contain personal
information such as your name or email address.

Cookies:
When you view one of our websites or interactive advertisements, we may store some information on your computer. This
information will be in the form of a small text file, also called a "cookie". Cookies help us in many ways to make your visit to
our website more enjoyable and meaningful to you. For example, cookies avoid you having to log in every time you come back to one
of our websites. They also allow us to tailor a website or advertisement to better match your interests and preferences. Most
browsers can be configured not to accept cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.

Web Beacons:
Web beacons are site instrumentation that help us to determine, for instance, whether a page has been viewed or not and, if so,
how many times. When you ask us to send you information on a promotion or a newsletter, we may use web beacons to establish how
many of the emails are actually opened. In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page or email, including an ad
banner, can act as a web beacon. Third party advertising networks that serve ads onto any Cirro Energy website may use cookies and/
or web beacons in their advertisements. Cirro Energy retains no control over such third party cookies and/or web beacons and does
not have access to the information related to third party cookies and/or web beacons.

Children's Privacy
Cirro Energy believes that it is especially important to protect children's privacy online. The Cirro Energy websites are not
directed at children and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

Data Security
Cirro Energy is committed to keeping the data you provide us secure and will take reasonable precautions to protect your
personal information from loss, misuse or alteration, including limiting access to such information within Cirro Energy to
authorized individuals and destroying personal information that we decide not to retain in a manner designed to make it unreadable
or undecipherable. Agents, contractors, or partners of Cirro Energy who have access to your personal information in connection with
providing services for Cirro Energy are required to keep the information confidential and are not permitted to use this information
for any other purpose than to carry out the services they are performing for Cirro Energy.

Accuracy of Your Personal Information
It is important that the personal information you supply to Cirro Energy is accurate and current. Please keep Cirro Energy
informed of any changes to your personal information by contacting us at the address listed in the section below entitled "How
to Make Your Preferences Known."
Accessing Your Personal Information
If you want to know what personal information Cirro Energy holds about you, or you wish to change personal information that is
inaccurate or out of date, please contact us at the address listed below in the section entitled "How to Make Your Preferences
Known." Please note that it may not always be possible to modify or remove completely information in our databases, although we
will make reasonable efforts to do so upon your written request.

Disposal of Your Personal Information
For personal information not to be retained by Cirro Energy (due to applicable law or regulation), we will destroy or arrange
for the destruction of the records that contain your personal information. Cirro Energy will take reasonable steps to safeguard and
properly dispose of your personal information.

Your Preferences
Cirro Energy allows you to choose to receive or stop receiving solicitations from us. We accomplish this by maintaining a
solicitation preference list in which we record your preferences to receive or not receive solicitations from us. We also use
suppression files provided by the Direct Marketing Association and we use the National Do Not Call Registry.

How to Make Your Preferences Known
To Cirro Energy:
You may inform us of your preference not to receive solicitations from us in one of the following ways.

Email us at: support@cirroenergy.com
Write us at: Cirro Energy, Solicitation Preferences, P.O. Box 38611, Philadelphia, PA 19104

addresses:

Be sure to include your complete name, address and telephone number and sign the request. The Mail Preference Service and
Telephone Preference Service are consumer services provided by the Direct Marketing Association. When you register for these
services, direct marketers will use the information you provide to purge your name, address and telephone number from their

changes to this section of our Privacy Policy to notify you of these changes and provide you with the ability to opt out of these
new uses. Initially, we will only use information collected from the time of the policy change forward for the new purposes.
However, after a reasonable time has transpired, we will use for the new purpose the information collected before the policy change
from those who do not opt out.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/type.object.type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).
