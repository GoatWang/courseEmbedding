Our Focus








Cancer Immunotherapy
a potentially transformative approach to treating cancer
Our initial focus in cancer immunotherapy is on delivering sustainable and effective T cell therapies to patients with cancer. We are leveraging our core expertise in gene transfer technology and our experience in implementing gene therapy clinical trials to build a broad, fully integrated immuno-oncology franchise.
For years, the standard of care for treating cancer was surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. For a variety of cancers, cancer immunotherapy, based on CAR T cells presents a promising new treatment option.
Our cancer immunotherapy research group is focused on the next generation of T cell engineering and creating a pipeline of T cell product candidates to treat a wide variety of liquid and solid tumor cancers.
CAR T program
leveraging our gene therapy expertise to treat cancer
Our gene therapy technology can genetically modify a patient’s own T cells to target and destroy cancer cells. In advanced clinical studies, academic researchers have shown that modified T cells, called chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR T cells, can provide a potentially curative option for patients with a variety of lymphomas (blood tumors), after other treatment approaches have failed.
Like our programs for hematopoietic stem cells (stem cells from the patient) in rare genetic disorders, our CAR T technology uses a customized lentiviral vector to alter T cells so the T cells can recognize specific proteins on the surface of cancer cells or other diseased cells and kill them.













With our CAR T technology, we harvest a patient’s white blood cells (a process called leukapheresis) and activate certain T cells to grow. The gene sequences for the CAR construct are transferred into the T cell DNA using a lentiviral vector. T cells are then grown to numbers sufficient for the desired patient dose. These genetically engineered cells, which will express the receptors that can recognize the exact proteins that are characteristic of specific cancers, are then infused back into the patient. The genetically engineered CAR T cells are designed to supplement a patient’s immune system and can be further engineered to overcome immune evasion mechanisms used by cancer cells.
our immunotherapy focus
We currently have active clinical and pre-clinical research programs targeting multiple different, novel oncology antigens, including B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) and the human papillomavirus type 16 E6 (HPV-16 E6) oncoprotein. These programs include various T cell therapies with significant academic and industry collaborations.
Our lead CAR T program, bb2121, in collaboration with Celgene, is being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical study, CRB-401, for the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. In February 2016, we announced the first patient treated in the study. At the 57th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting in December 2015, we announced the first pre-clinical data from our anti-BCMA program, including for bb2121, in three poster presentations, covering critical basic research, translational and manufacturing aspects of our T cell oncology pipeline.
We presented the first, interim data for bb2121 at the 28th EORTC-NCI-AACR Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics Symposium in December 2016.

immune system and T cells
We believe the use of human cells as therapeutic entities to re-energize the immune system will be the next significant advancement in the treatment of cancer. These cellular therapies are designed to avoid the long-term side effects associated with current treatments and have the potential to be effective regardless of the previous treatments patients have experienced. Our CAR T cell technology, based on our lentiviral vector technology and experience, is designed with the intent to deliver a payload of potent T cells that can kill cancer cells, specifically and directly.
learn more about cancer immunotherapy

The immune system recognizes danger signals and responds to threats at a cellular level. It is often described as having two arms. The first is the innate immune system, which recognizes non-specific signals of infection or abnormalities as a first line of defense and creates the initial response. The response is the same every time regardless of prior exposure to the infectious agent. The second arm is the adaptive immune system, composed of highly specific, targeted cells. It provides long-term recognition and protection from infectious agents and abnormal processes such as cancer. The adaptive immune response can be humoral, antibody-based, or cellular, which includes T cell-based immune responses.
The most significant cellular components of the adaptive immune response are T cells, so called because they typically mature in the thymus. T cells are involved in sensing and killing infected or abnormal cells, as well as coordinating the activation of other cells in an immune response. These cells are classified into two major subsets: CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells, based on cell surface expression of the CD4 or CD8 glycoproteins. Both subsets of T cells have specific functions in mounting an immune response to clear an infection or eliminate cancerous cells. CD4+ T cells, or helper T cells, are involved in coordinating the immune response by enhancing the activation, expansion, migration, and effector functions of other types of immune cells. CD8+ T cells, or cytotoxic T cells, can directly attack and kill cells they recognize as infected or otherwise abnormal, and are aided by CD4+ T cells. Both types of T cells are activated when their T cell receptor recognizes and binds to a specific protein structure on the surface of another cell. This protein structure is composed of the major histocompatibility complex, or MHC, and a small protein fragment, or peptide, derived from proteins inside the cell or on the cell surface. Circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells survey the body, differentiating between MHC/peptide structures containing “foreign” peptides and those containing “self” peptides. A foreign peptide may signal the presence of an immune threat, such as an infection or cancer, causing the T cell to activate, recruit other immune cells, and eliminate the targeted cell.
Although the immune system is designed to identify foreign or abnormal proteins expressed on tumor cells, this process is either ineffective or defective in cancer patients. The defective process sometimes occurs when cancer cells closely resemble healthy cells and go unnoticed or if tumors lose their MHC protein expression. Additionally, cancer cells employ a number of mechanisms to escape immune detection to suppress the effect of the immune response. Some tumors also encourage the production of regulatory T cells that block cytotoxic T cells that would normally attack the cancer.

Our Focus








severe diseases
Each person inherits features in the form of genes, which are made up of a molecule called DNA. Genetic diseases involve problems with the functioning genes. Our gene therapy technology intends to make up for genetic defects by creating a functioning copy of the genes that express functional proteins and correct or address the underlying cause of the disease. We believe gene therapy has the potential to provide transformative, disease-modifying effects – potentially with life-long clinical benefits, based on a single administration.
leading the revolution –
how our gene therapy works
Our gene therapy process works by genetically modifying a patient’s own cells by adding a functional copy of the gene of interest. We have extensive expertise in viral vector design and manufacturing and transduction, which we have developed into a potent gene therapy platform with potentially broad applications in a wide variety of indications with significant medical needs.













Lenti-D
Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a rare X-linked metabolic disorder caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene which result in a deficiency in adrenoleukodystrophy protein (ALDP) and subsequent accumulation of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA). VLCFA accumulation occurs in plasma and all tissue types but primarily affects the adrenal cortex and white matter of the brain and spinal cord, leading to a range of clinical outcomes. The most severe form of ALD, the inflammatory cerebral phenotype known as cerebral ALD (CALD), involves a progressive destruction of myelin, the protective sheath of the nerve cells in the brain that are responsible for thinking and muscle control. Symptoms of CALD usually occur in early childhood and progress rapidly if untreated, leading to severe loss of neurological function and eventual death in most patients.
bluebird bio is developing the investigational gene therapy Lenti-D drug product for the treatment of CALD. The Phase 2/3 Starbeam Clinical Study (ALD-102) is assessing the efficacy and safety of Lenti-D in boys up to 17 years of age with CALD. The study involves transplantation with a patient’s own stem cells, which are modified to contain a functioning copy of the ABCD1 gene. This gene addition should result in the production of functional ALDP, a protein critical for the breakdown of VLCFAs. Buildup of VLCFAs in the central nervous system contributes to neurodegeneration in CALD.
The primary efficacy endpoint for the Starbeam Clinical Study (ALD-102) is the proportion of patients who are alive and have none of six major functional disabilities (MFDs) at 24 months post treatment. MFDs are the six most severe disabilities from the Neurologic Function Score (NFS) and are of particular clinical importance, because they severely compromise a patient’s ability to function independently. They are: loss of communication, cortical blindness, tube feeding, total incontinence, wheelchair dependence, and complete loss of voluntary movement.
We presented  the first, interim data from 17 treated patients in the Starbeam study at the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Annual Meeting 2016.

LentiGlobin
encouraging clinical data support our gene therapy’s potential
Our LentiGlobin® BB305 product candidate aims to treat transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (also known as β-thalassemia major) and severe sickle cell disease (SCD). LentiGlobin works by inserting a functional human beta-globin gene into a patient’s own hematopoietic stem cells outside the body (ex vivo) and then transplanting those modified cells into the patient’s blood stream through infusion, also known as autologous stem cell transplantation.
A unique amino acid substitution in the beta-globin gene in LentiGlobin confers important anti-sickling properties to help potentially address the most severe forms of sickle cell disease. Promising results from a preclinical proof-of-concept study using gene therapy to treat sickle cell disease were published in Science.
We currently have four ongoing studies evaluating our LentiGlobin therapy for the treatment of transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia and severe SCD – the Northstar study in transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia, the Northstar-2 study in patients with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia and non-β0/β0 genotypes, the HGB-205 study in transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia or severe SCD, the HGB-206 study in severe SCD, and the Phase 3 HGB-207 study in transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia and non- β0/ β0 genotypes. As we continue to gather a growing body of data for LentiGlobin, we are learning and better understanding the potential clinical benefit our therapy can have on patients suffering from these diseases.
We recently presented data from the HGB-205, HGB-206 and HGB-207 studies of LentiGlobin at the 2016 American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting. Learn more about the data we presented here and here.

Gene Editing
gene editing: the next frontier in gene therapy
Gene editing has generated a lot of excitement in academia and drug development. Its promise is two-fold: the unique ability to correct genetic mutations that may cause disease; and its utility in creating and controlling genetic information within patient cells. Emerging science suggests that permanently fixing or “editing” mutated cells, or creating safer and more potent cell-based products with this technology could provide curative, one-time treatments for patients suffering from a broad range of diseases.
In June 2014, we acquired Precision Genome Engineering Inc., or Pregenen, a company with a sophisticated, advanced gene editing technology platform and research team. Our integrated teams are expanding our discovery research efforts in this emerging field. We are testing homing endonuclease and megaTAL gene editing technologies in a variety of potential applications and disease areas, including hematology and oncology. Reprogrammed homing endonucleases and megaTALs are novel enzymes that provide a highly specific and efficient way to potentially treat a variety of diseases by silencing, editing or inserting genetic components into a cell.

Structural depiction of a homing endonuclease bound to its DNA target. Homing endonucleases are compact proteins able to wrap around and effectively ‘saddle’ DNA. When they identify a DNA sequence that fits into their pattern of amino acid chemistries, they are able to cleave that DNA sequence. Such DNA recognition chemistries can be reprogrammed by our protein engineers to operate on DNA target sequences of our choosing.

Homing endonucleases can be paired with TAL arrays – modular and therefore easily reprogrammable DNA recognition components – creating hybrid “megaTAL” proteins with advanced DNA recognition characteristics. megaTALs are the most efficient genome editing ‘machines’ yet devised, landing at and modifying their target sites with extreme precision and efficiency.
why megaTALs and homing endonucleases?
All the gene editing technologies currently being explored by the pharmaceutical industry, including zinc finger nucleases, CRISPR (clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas9 (CRISPR associated protein 9) and TALENs (transcription activator-like effector nucleases), share DNA recognition and DNA cutting functions. They all differ in specificity, size, ease of delivery, and the detailed biochemistry that underlies their DNA recognition, cleavage, and repair mechanisms. Homing endonucleases are the only monomeric, naturally occurring proteins to bind and cleave DNA in a highly sequenced specific fashion. megaTALs are fusion proteins that combine homing endonucleases with the modular DNA binding domains of TALENs, resulting in improved DNA sequence targeting and unparalleled gene editing efficiencies. Since these hybrid nucleases still cut DNA using homing endonuclease cleavage biochemistry, they engage DNA repair pathways in a manner distinct from all other gene editing nucleases. The compact format and ultra-efficient nature of our nucleases make them powerful tools in our ongoing effort to build advanced gene editing processes and products for a broad range of therapeutic applications.

Complimentary to existing indications










putting gene editing to work
In collaboration with leading academic institutions, we are using our gene editing platform to potentially discover and develop new, more advanced versions of our current ex vivo gene therapy product candidates, and to explore expansions into new disease indications.
Our CAR T cell technology also brings gene editing tools to the immunotherapy field. Our homing endonuclease and megaTAL technology offer a number of additional options to manipulate the gene of a cancer patient’s T cells in hopes of further increasing the specificity of anti-tumor activity and potentially make them more potent. Specificity and potency are essential to the development of CAR T cell therapies for effectively treating solid tumor cancers such as breast, prostate and colon cancer.

Our Company









our partnering strategy
We are developing therapies that, administered just once, have the potential to transform the lives of people with severe genetic and rare diseases and cancer. Our current platform is just the beginning. We are committed to continuing to develop gene therapy technologies and capabilities that have broad potential beyond the core indications.
We are actively seeking collaborators and licensing opportunities in the U.S. and around the world to explore the therapeutic potential of our technologies in new cell types and diseases.








our current partners
In March 2013, we teamed up with Celgene Corporation to develop chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies to target and destroy cancer cells. In June 2015, we amended and restated our collaboration to focus on developing product candidates targeting B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) during a three-year term. BCMA is the first target selected to advance to the clinic under this collaboration. BCMA is a cell surface protein that is expressed in normal plasma cells and in most multiple myeloma cells, but is absent from other normal tissues.
We are working in collaboration with Celgene on the initial, lead anti-BCMA product candidate (bb2121), and develop next-generation anti-BCMA product candidates. We will retain sole rights to develop all other chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell programs developed by us under the collaboration, including ongoing undisclosed preclinical programs with opportunities in both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies.


We entered a strategic collaboration with Kite Pharma in June 2015 to co-develop and co-commercialize second generation T cell receptor (TCR) product candidates directed against the human papillomavirus type 16 E6 (HPV-16 E6) oncoprotein, incorporating our gene editing and lentiviral technologies. Under the terms of the agreement, we will jointly develop and commercialize second-generation TCR product candidates directed against the HPV-16 E6 oncoprotein, incorporating gene editing to efficiently modify certain genes to enhance T cell function. In addition, we will explore using lentiviral vectors to optimize delivery of HPV-16 E6 TCRs into patients’ T cells.



In December 2015, we entered into an exclusive license agreement to research, develop and commercialize chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies using ViroMed’s proprietary humanized antibody to an undisclosed cancer target for solid tumors.
Under the terms of the agreement, ViroMed will provide us exclusive rights to its novel humanized antibody to the target, and we will leverage our proprietary lentiviral gene therapy platform and CAR T capabilities to develop CAR T therapies against the target. Financial terms of the agreement include a $1 million upfront payment and subsequent milestone payments to ViroMed, which together could total over $48 million per licensed product if certain development and regulatory milestones are achieved. ViroMed is also eligible to receive tiered royalties on product sales. bluebird bio will conduct and fund clinical development as well as regulatory and commercial activities.



In June 2016, we entered into a strategic manufacturing agreement with Lonza Houston, Inc., providing for the future commercial production of our Lenti-D™ and LentiGlobin™ drug products.
This agreement follows a successful multi-year clinical manufacturing relationship and provides us with a path to commercial supply including dedicated production suites within Lonza’s state-of-the-art facility. Under this multi-year agreement, Lonza will complete the suite design, construction and validation along with process validation prior to anticipated commercial launch.

In September 2016, we entered into a strategic research and development collaboration and licensing agreement with Medigene AG for T cell receptor (TCR) immunotherapies against four targets. In this partnership, Medigene will be responsible for the generation and delivery of the TCRs using its TCR isolation and characterization platform. Following the collaborative preclinical development, bluebird bio will assume sole responsibility for the clinical development and commercialization of the TCR product candidates and will receive an exclusive license for the intellectual property covering the resulting TCRs.



In December 2016, we entered into a strategic manufacturing agreement with apceth Biopharma for the future European commercial production of our Lenti-D™ product candidate for cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy and our LentiGlobin™ product candidate for transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia.
Under this multi-year agreement, apceth Biopharma will perform clinical manufacturing, process validation activities and commercial manufacturing for LentiGlobin and Lenti-D drug product to support the treatment of European patients with transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia and cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy, respectively. This agreement follows a successful multi-year manufacturing relationship and provides us with European commercial manufacturing capabilities, including dedicated production suites within apceth Biopharma’s state-of-the-art GMP facility.

UPDATE: Bluebird Bio stock rises 7.4% on positive data from ongoing early-stage clinical trial
Bluebird Bio Inc.  shares rose 7.4% in heavy morning trade Monday after the company released updated results from an ongoing early-stage clinical trial in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Relapsed multiple myeloma refers to when the cancer returns after treatment, while refractory multiple myeloma means the cancer isn't responding to treatment. The drug, bb2121, which is being jointly developed by Bluebird Bio and Celgene Corp. , had a 100% overall response rate in three of four groups of dosed patients, with the other group having an overall response rate of 33%. The 31 patients who were enrolled in the trial as of early May (the company plans to enroll up to 50 patients total) got several types of treatment prior to bb2121, with a median of 7 lines of prior therapy, with the range varying between three and 14 lines of therapy, the company said. None of the patients in the active dose groups saw the cancer progress, said Celgene's  Michael Pehl, president, hematology and oncology. "The consistency, depth and durability of these patients' responses coupled with a manageable safety profile is very exciting, and we believe will provide hope for patients in this setting," Pehl said. "The efficacy and safety profile of bb2121 continues to look very strong," said Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt. "We believe these data position BLUE (and partner CELG [MP]) well among companies developing CAR-T products in multiple myeloma and provide additional validation for bb2121 and BLUE's emerging CAR-T platform," referring to CAR-T cell therapy, a type of cancer immunotherapy that uses a patient's blood cells to fight cancer. Bluebird Bio shares have risen 7% to $91.45 over the last three months, compared with a 2.2% rise in the S&P 500 .

Bluebird Bio stock jumps 7% after Maxim Group upgrades to buy
Bluebird Bio Inc.  shares jumped 7.3% in premarket trade Friday after the company was upgraded to buy from hold at Maxim Group, with a price target of $100, above the company's $79.20 share price as of Thursday's close. The American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting, which begins Friday and runs through Tuesday, could be a big opportunity for the company's shares, with the company scheduled to present data on multiple myeloma, said Maxim Group analyst Jason Kolbert. Kolbert said he believes positive data from December for Bluebird Bio's bb2121 -- which is being developed in partnership with Celgene Corp.  -- along with positive results for the same type of cancer approach in May from another biotech company, "increase the probability for positive data for bb2121 at ASCO." Bluebird Bio is scheduled to present safety and efficacy data from a trial enrolling 18 patients on Monday, with the results including one-year follow-up data for the first nine patients. Bluebird Bio shares have dropped 9% over the last three months, compared with a 2% rise in the S&P 500 .

UPDATE: Bluebird Bio stock rises 7.4% on positive data from ongoing early-stage clinical trial
Bluebird Bio Inc.  shares rose 7.4% in heavy morning trade Monday after the company released updated results from an ongoing early-stage clinical trial in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Relapsed multiple myeloma refers to when the cancer returns after treatment, while refractory multiple myeloma means the cancer isn't responding to treatment. The drug, bb2121, which is being jointly developed by Bluebird Bio and Celgene Corp. , had a 100% overall response rate in three of four groups of dosed patients, with the other group having an overall response rate of 33%. The 31 patients who were enrolled in the trial as of early May (the company plans to enroll up to 50 patients total) got several types of treatment prior to bb2121, with a median of 7 lines of prior therapy, with the range varying between three and 14 lines of therapy, the company said. None of the patients in the active dose groups saw the cancer progress, said Celgene's  Michael Pehl, president, hematology and oncology. "The consistency, depth and durability of these patients' responses coupled with a manageable safety profile is very exciting, and we believe will provide hope for patients in this setting," Pehl said. "The efficacy and safety profile of bb2121 continues to look very strong," said Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt. "We believe these data position BLUE (and partner CELG [MP]) well among companies developing CAR-T products in multiple myeloma and provide additional validation for bb2121 and BLUE's emerging CAR-T platform," referring to CAR-T cell therapy, a type of cancer immunotherapy that uses a patient's blood cells to fight cancer. Bluebird Bio shares have risen 7% to $91.45 over the last three months, compared with a 2.2% rise in the S&P 500 .

Bluebird Bio stock jumps 7% after Maxim Group upgrades to buy
Bluebird Bio Inc.  shares jumped 7.3% in premarket trade Friday after the company was upgraded to buy from hold at Maxim Group, with a price target of $100, above the company's $79.20 share price as of Thursday's close. The American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting, which begins Friday and runs through Tuesday, could be a big opportunity for the company's shares, with the company scheduled to present data on multiple myeloma, said Maxim Group analyst Jason Kolbert. Kolbert said he believes positive data from December for Bluebird Bio's bb2121 -- which is being developed in partnership with Celgene Corp.  -- along with positive results for the same type of cancer approach in May from another biotech company, "increase the probability for positive data for bb2121 at ASCO." Bluebird Bio is scheduled to present safety and efficacy data from a trial enrolling 18 patients on Monday, with the results including one-year follow-up data for the first nine patients. Bluebird Bio shares have dropped 9% over the last three months, compared with a 2% rise in the S&P 500 .

How Novartis' FDA Win In Cancer Also Could Be A Boon For Its Rivals

Novartis Grabs Key FDA Panel Approval Of Experimental Cancer Drug

Novartis' drug, known as CTL019, will go before the full FDA in early October, a spokesperson previously told IBD.

Novartis Is Going Before The FDA — But Kite Could Benefit More
Kite Pharma (KITE) should benefit from a Food and Drug Administration panel hearing on an experimental cancer treatment from rival Novartis (NVS) later this month, an analyst said Thursday, though shares of both dipped.

Can Celgene, Bluebird Keep Their Lead As Rivals Champ At The Bit?
Celgene (CELG) and Bluebird Bio (BLUE) stocks sustained downgrades Friday as rivals like Kite Pharma (KITE) and Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) look likely to chip away at their lead in immuno-oncology drugs. The duo is about a year ahead with a drug called bb2121, part of a class of treatments that aim to "reprogram" the immune system to fight cancer using what are known as CAR-T therapies. Their drug does this by targeting an antigen called BCMA. But

The usual steps are taken — one or two rounds of chemotherapy, perhaps a stem-cell transplant — but all of it could be to no avail. Half of all patients diagnosed with aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a form of blood cancer, will die within six months, says Christine Cassiano, spokeswoman for Kite Pharma (KITE), a developer of cancer treatments.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--bluebird bio, Inc. (Nasdaq: 
      BLUE), a clinical-stage company committed to developing potentially 
      transformative gene therapies for severe genetic diseases and T 
      cell-based immunotherapies for cancer, announced that interim data from 
      its ongoing Phase 1 clinical study of bb2121, the company’s 
      investigational anti-BCMA CAR T cell product candidate in patients with 
      relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, will be presented on Thursday, 
      December 1, 2016 at the 28th EORTC-NCI-AACR Molecular Targets 
      and Cancer Therapeutics Symposium in Munich, Germany. bluebird bio is 
      developing bb2121 in collaboration with Celgene Corporation.
    

      “We are pleased that these early data from our ongoing Phase 1 study of 
      bb2121 demonstrate objective anti-tumor responses in heavily pre-treated 
      patients with multiple myeloma, with all patients in the 15.0 x 107 
      and 45.0 x 107 CAR+ T cell dose cohorts achieving responses, 
      including among them, patients with stringent complete responses and 
      elimination of minimal residual disease,” said David Davidson, M.D., 
      chief medical officer, bluebird bio. “We are also encouraged by the 
      safety profile to date, particularly the lack of severe cytokine release 
      syndrome or neurotoxicity. In light of these positive data, and thanks

Clinical remissions and limited toxicity in a first-in-human 
      multicenter study of bb2121, a novel anti-BCMA CAR T cell therapy for 
      relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (Abstract #14, LBA)


Presenter: Yi Lin, M.D., Ph.D., Assistant Professor of Medicine 
      and Oncology, Mayo Clinic Division of Hematology, Rochester, MNDate: 
      Thursday, December 1, 2016, 18:00 CET (12:00 pm ET)Session: Plenary 
      Session 7
    

      The open-label Phase 1 CRB-401 study (NCT02658929) is investigating the 
      administration of bb2121 anti-BCMA CAR T cells in patients with relapsed 
      and/or refractory multiple myeloma. The primary endpoint of the study is 
      incidence of adverse events (AEs) and abnormal laboratory test results, 
      including dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). The study also seeks to 
      assess disease-specific response criteria including: complete response 
      (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), and partial response (PR) 
      according to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Uniform 
      Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma. The study also seeks to 
      determine the recommended dose for further clinical trials. Patients on 
      study were heavily pre-treated, with a median of six prior therapies 
      (range: 5 - 13). As of the November 18th, 2016 data cut-off, 
      11 patients had been enrolled and dosed in four dose cohorts: 5.0 x 107, 
      15.0 x 107, 45.0 x 107 and 80 x 107 CAR+ 
      T cells. All 11 dosed patients were evaluable for safety, and the first 
      nine patients (5.0 x 107, 15.0 x 107, 45.0 x 107 
      dose cohorts) have undergone their first multiple myeloma tumor 
      restaging and were evaluable for efficacy. This study is currently 
      enrolling patients at seven sites in the U.S., with an anticipated total 
      enrollment of 50 patients.
    

      Patients received a conditioning regimen of cyclophosphamide and 
      fludarabine, followed by an infusion of bb2121 anti-BCMA CAR T cells. 
      The CAR T cells were produced from each patient’s own blood cells, which 
      were modified using a lentiviral vector encoding the anti-BCMA CAR.

Why Repair?
By repairing your own household appliances and electronics, you are giving them a second chance and saving them from the landfill. You'll also reduce the amount of waste, power and gas it requires to manufacture and deliver new products.


 



							Where’s My Bluebird Model Number?						



							If you don’t already know what your Bluebird model number is, you’ll need to locate it before you can start shopping for parts. We do this to make sure that the parts we send to the customer are compatible with their model. So, if you’re not sure where to start looking for your model number, allow us to help.

First off, your products model number will always be located in your owner’s manual. If you still have this laying around, we recommend finding your model number here to save time. If you lost your owner’s manual years ago, it’s okay. You can still locate your model number on your Bluebird product itself. 

You’ll need to have your Bluebird model in front of you. Search for a white/yellow identification sticker on your unit. Most of the time, Bluebird will place this in an area on your unit that’s free from wear and tear. Try looking on the engine housing, frame, or even on the undercarriage. There isn’t a regular place for this sticker, so make sure you look around. 

You’ll know you’ve found the correct sticker when you see the Bluebird logo at the top and model/serial information below it. Bluebird requires both the model and serial number to look up parts. Make sure you grab both of these numbers. Some examples of the model/serial number for Bluebird models include: SC16 (1999), SG1314A (968999439), and CL550A (968999383).

						Customer Feedback					

						Nice site. Quick and easy to use.					

						Edward C.					

						Florida, USA					


					The Leader in Turf Care				

					If you’re not familiar with the Bluebird brand, it’s no surprise. Their products are typically used in commercial settings and only get used behind the scenes. Your favorite baseball team likely uses the Bluebird brand to manicure their field. Bluebird makes grass look better. Period.
