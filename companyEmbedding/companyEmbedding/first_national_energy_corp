Self Powered Autonomous Vehicle Charging Stations


First National is developing completely independent Electric Vehicle Recharging Stations to be installed in Urban areas as well as in completely remote zones in order to increase the freedom of travel throughout all of North America.

























Urban and Remote Autonomous Outdoor Billboards


First National has already been working with major Advertising and Visual Communications companies, Big Box Retailers and Regional Sales Centers to implement Self Powered LED Advertising signs.

 





Autonomous Micro Grid


First National is planning to assist Farmers Unions in USA and Canada to create an independent Micro Grid to their over 230,000 family farm members in arranging long term flat rate power agreements at discount rates.   VRTB/FNEC Turbines would be installed at no cost to the farmers and therefore they would realize savings after the first month.

EXPLANATORY
NOTE

 

First
National Energy Corporation (the “Company”) is
filing this Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-K/A to our annual report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, originally filed on
April 19, 2010 (the “Original Form 10-K”), to restate
our financial statements and corresponding financial information
for the year ended December 31, 2009, in response to various
comments from the Division of Corporate Finance of the Securities
and Exchange Commission ("SEC").

 

The
Company also intends to amend its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q
for the subsequent periods ended June 30, 2010.  Please
refer to those amended reports for further discussion of the
revised information provided by the registrant for those respective
periods.

 

This
amendment incorporates various changes to Form 10-K which were not
in the Original Form 10-K filed by the Company, and includes
certain information which was inadvertently omitted from the
Original Form 10-K filed by the Company. The Company is including
currently dated Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 302 and Section 906
certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer that are attached to this Form 10-K/A as Exhibits 31.1,
31.2, 32.1 and 32.2.

 

Except as
otherwise expressly set forth herein, a ll of the information in
this Form 10-K/A is as of April 19, 2010, the date the Company
filed the Original Form 10-K with the SEC. This Form 10-K/A
continues to speak as of the date of the Original Form 10-K and
does not reflect any subsequent information or events other than as
expressly set forth otherwise in this Form 10-K/A. Accordingly,
this Form 10-K/A should be read in conjunction with our filings
made with the SEC subsequent to the filing of the Original Form
10-K, including any amendments to those filings.  Among
other things, forward-looking statements made in the Original Form
10-K have not been revised to reflect events, results or
developments that occurred or facts that became known to us after
the date of the Original Form 10-K, other than this
amendment.

 

For the
convenience of the reader, this Form 10-K/A sets forth the Original
Form 10-K in its entirety.  No attempt has been made in
this Form 10-K/A to modify or update the disclosures in the
Original Form 10-K except as required to follow the proper format
of the currently applicable Form 10-K and to address the concerns
expressed in the comments from the Division of Corporate Finance of
the SEC. However, changes have been made to the following items
solely as a result of, and to reflect, the changes made by the
registrant in response to comments from the Division of Corporate
Finance of the SEC, and no other information in the Form 10-K/A is
amended hereby as a result of such changes:

SPECIAL
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

 

Some of
the statements contained in this Annual Report that are not
historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning
of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
“Exchange Act”). We intend such forward-looking
statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for
forward-looking statements contained in Section 21E of the
Exchange Act. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on
these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date
this Annual Report is filed with the SEC. All statements other than
statements of historical fact are statements that could be deemed
forward-looking statements, including statements regarding:
projections of revenue, profit margins, expenses, tax provisions
and tax rates, earnings or losses from operations, impact of
foreign exchange rates, cash flows, pension and benefit obligations
and funding requirements, synergies or other financial items;
plans, strategies and objectives of management for future
operations including statements relating to potential acquisitions,
compensation plans, purchase commitments; developments, performance
or industry or market rankings relating to products or services;
future economic conditions or performance; the outcome of
outstanding claims or legal; potential gains and recoveries of
costs; assumptions underlying any of the foregoing; and any other
statements that address activities, events or developments that we
intend, expect, project, believe or anticipate will or may occur in
the future. Forward-looking statements may be characterized by
terminology such as “believe,”
“anticipate,” “should,”
“would,” “intend,” “plan,”
“will,” “expect,” “estimate,”
“project,” “positioned,”
“strategy,” and similar expressions. These statements
are based on assumptions and assessments made by our management in
light of their experience and perception of historical trends,
current conditions, expected future developments and other factors
we believe to be appropriate. These forward-looking statements are
subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including but not
limited to the following:

 




 



●



risks
associated with our international operations;




 




 



●



significant
movements in foreign currency exchange rates;




 




 



●



changes in
the general economy, including the current global economic
downturn, as well as the cyclical nature of global alternative
energy markets;




 




 



●



availability
and cost of raw materials, parts and components that may be used in
our products;




 




 



●



the
competitive environment in our industry;




 




 



●



our
ability to identify, finance, acquire and successfully integrate
attractive installation targets;




 




 



●



our
ability to manage and grow our business and the execution of our
business and growth strategies;




 




 



●



loss of
key management;




 




 



●



our
ability and the ability of our strategic partners to access
required capital at a reasonable cost;




 




 



●



our
ability to expand our business in our targeted markets;




  




 



●



our
financial performance;




 




 



●



our
ability to identify, address and remediate any material weaknesses
in our internal control over financial reporting; and




 




 



●



others
risks and factors, listed in Item 1A. Risk Factors in Part I of
this Form 10-K/A.




 

Any such
forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance
and actual results; future developments and business decisions may
differ materially from those envisaged by such forward-looking
statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the
date the Original Form 10-K was filed with the SEC. We do not
assume any obligation and do not intend to update any
forward-looking statement except as required by law. See Item IA.
Risk Factors in Part I of this Form 10-K/A for a further discussion
regarding some of the reasons that actual results may be materially
different from those that we anticipate.

1.  First
National Energy Corporation (the “Registrant”) was
incorporated as Capstone International Corporation on November 16,
2000, in the state of Delaware, and has a class of shares
registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form SB-2
as SEC File No. 333-62588, filed on June 8, 2001. The
Registrant’s name was changed to “First National Power
Corporation” on January 28, 2004, and was changed again to
“First National Energy Corporation” on February 12,
2009, at which time the Registrant effected a reverse stock split,
adopted a holding company structure, and relocated its corporate
charter from Delaware to Nevada as part of the reorganization
described in the next succeeding paragraph.

 

As
described in the definitive information statement on Form DEF 14-C
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 22,
2009, and pursuant to the approval of the Registrant’s board
of directors and a majority of its stockholders, on February 12,
2009, the Registrant effected a reorganization pursuant to that
certain Agreement and Plan of Merger to Form Holding Company, dated
as of December 10, 2009 (a true and complete copy of which is
included in the Form DEF 14-C information statement described
above) , which had the effect of (1) implementing a reverse stock
split of its issued and outstanding common shares at the rate of
100 to 1, thereby reducing the number of issued and outstanding
common shares from 76,522,760 to 765,228, with no effect on the
number of authorized common shares; (2) merging the Registrant with
and into First National Power Corporation, a Nevada corporation and
a wholly-owned indirect (second tier) subsidiary of the Registrant,
such that First National Energy Corporation, a Nevada corporation
and a wholly-owned direct (first tier) subsidiary of the
Registrant, succeeded the Registrant as a successor issuer of its
registered securities, pursuant to Rule 12g-3 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, and continued the business of the Registrant
for all purposes; (3) exchanging each issued and outstanding share
of the Registrant (bearing CUSIP number 32113F 10 3) on the record
date (and after giving effect to the reverse stock split described
above) into one new common share of the successor issuer

(bearing
CUSIP number 321129 108); (4) shifting the Registrant’s
charter from the State of Delaware to the State of Nevada; (5)
increasing the authorized capital of the Registrant from 100
million common shares to 300 million common shares; (6) changing
the Registrant’s name from “First National Power
Corporation” to “First National Energy
Corporation”; and (7) changing the Registrant’s stock
symbol from FNPR to FNEC.

2.  The
Registrant has not at any time been the subject of any bankruptcy,
receivership or similar proceeding.

 

3.  On
April 20, 2009, the Registrant acquired a territorial license to
certain rights in alternative wind energy technology in exchange
for 98,800,000 newly issued common shares of the Registrant, which
resulted in a change in control of the Registrant, all as more
particularly described in the definitive information statement on
Form DEF 14-C filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on
May 4, 2009. The Registrant has valued the technology license
received in such transaction at $1,855,605 after consulting with an
outside valuation expert. As a result of such transaction, the
Registrant was after such date no longer deemed to be a "shell
company" as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934.

 

4.  Business
of Issuer

 

(i)
Principal products or services and their markets
.

 

Since
acquiring the technology license described above, management of the
Registrant has expended significant time seeking sources of capital
to implement its business plan, which is primarily designed to
exploit the licensed technology throughout the United States and
Canada for commercial gain by building, installing and operating
its proprietary supplemental wind generation devices. The
Registrant is also evaluating other alternatives in order to
improve the Registrant's financial condition, including merger and
acquisition opportunities. There is no assurance that the
Registrant will be successful in raising capital or closing any
such merger or acquisition transactions.

 

(ii)
Distribution methods of the products or services
.

 

The
Registrant intends to market and distribute its licensed
proprietary supplemental wind generation devices by achieving
strategic alliances with wind industry participants operating
construction and maintenance enterprises in the licensed
territories.

 

(iii)
Status of any publicly announced new product or
service.

 

The
publicly announced licensed proprietary supplemental wind
generation devices of the Registrant are the subject of intense
research and development efforts by the Registrant, with the object
of achieving optimum performance, facilitating large scale
manufacturing at multiple locations, and protecting the
Registrant's unique product designs.

 

(iv)
Competitive business conditions and the smaller reporting
company's competitive position in the industry and methods of
competition .

 

For a
discussion of competitive business conditions and the Registrant's
competitive position in the industry and methods of competition,
please see "Risk Factors - RISKS RELATED TO WIND ENERGY INDUSTRY "
below.

 

(v)
Sources and availability of raw materials and the names of
principal suppliers.

 

The
Registrant has identified ready sources and availability of raw
materials and multiple suppliers of the materials and components to
be incorporated in its licensed proprietary supplemental wind
generation devices, and does not foresee any dependence on any sole
source or supplier for such materials and components.

 

(vi)
Dependence on one or a few major customers .

 

The
Registrant does not foresee any likely dependence on one or a few

Item
1A.  Risk Factors.

 

An
investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You
should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described
below, together with the information included elsewhere in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K/A and other documents we file with the
SEC. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business,
financial condition or operating results could suffer. As a result,
the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could
lose all or part of your investment in our common stock. The risks
and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified
as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us
and we caution that this list of risk factors may not be
exhaustive. Our business is also subject to general risks and
uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as overall
U.S. and non-U.S. economic and industry conditions, a global
economic slowdown, geopolitical events, changes in laws or
accounting rules, fluctuations in interest rates, terrorism,
international conflicts, natural disasters or other disruptions of
expected economic or business conditions. We operate in a
continually changing business environment, and new risk factors
emerge from time to time which we cannot predict. Additional risks
and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently
believe are immaterial also may impair our business, including our
results of operations, liquidity and financial
condition.

FIRST
NATIONAL ENERGY COMPANY IS A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY WITH A
LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY THAT MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO RELIABLY
PREDICT FUTURE GROWTH AND OPERATING RESULTS.

 

The
Company has not demonstrated that it can:

 




 



●



manufacture
products in a manner that will enable it to be
profitable;





 



●



establish
many of the business functions necessary to operate, including
sales, marketing, manufacturing, administrative and financial
functions;





 



●



establish
appropriate financial controls;





 



●



respond
effectively to competitive pressures; or





 



●



raise the
capital necessary to implement its business plan.




 

FIRST
NATIONAL ENERGY COMPANY HAS INCURRED OPERATING LOSSES SINCE
INCEPTION.

 

Since its
inception in 2000, the Company has incurred losses every quarter.
The extent of the Company’s future operating losses and the
timing of profitability are highly uncertain, and it may never
achieve or sustain profitability.  The Company has
incurred a net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 of
($194,354).  At September 30, 2010, the Company had an
accumulated deficit of ($990,004). The Company anticipates that it
will continue to incur operating loses for the foreseeable future
and it is possible that the Company will never generate substantial
revenues from its products.

 

THE
COMPANY’S FUTURE CAPITAL NEEDS ARE UNCERTAIN. THE COMPANY
WILL NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS NOW AND IN THE FUTURE AND THESE
FUNDS MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR AT
ALL.

 

The
Company believes that its current cash will not be sufficient to
meet projected operating requirements for at least the next 3
months and it is therefore necessary that the Company will need to
seek additional funds from public and/or private stock offerings,
borrowings under credit lines or other sources. The Company’s
capital requirements will depend on many factors,
including:

 




 



●



the
revenues generated by products that it manufactures;





 



●



the costs
required to develop its manufacturing processes;





 



●



the
expenses it incurs in manufacturing and placing its
products;





 



●



the costs
associated with any expansion of its business;





 



●



the costs
associated with capital expenditures; and





 



●



the number
and timing of any acquisitions or other strategic
transactions.




                      

As a
result of these factors, the Company will need to raise additional
funds, and these funds may not be available on favorable terms, or
at all. Furthermore, if the Company issues equity or debt
securities to raise additional funds, its existing shareholders may
experience dilution, and the new equity or debt securities may have
rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of its existing
shareholders. If the Company cannot raise funds on acceptable
terms, it may not be able to develop or enhance its products,
execute its business plan, take advantage of future opportunities,
or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated counterparty
requirements.

 

THE
COMPANY’S SUCCESS WILL DEPEND ON ITS ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND
RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL AND TECHNICAL STAFF.

 

The
Company believes future success will depend on its ability to
manage its growth successfully, including attracting and retaining
skilled personnel for its manufacturing and site maintenance
operations. Hiring qualified management and technical personnel may
be difficult.  If the Company fails to attract and retain
personnel, particularly management and technical personnel, it may
not be able to succeed in its planned operations.

 

Our
executive officers, board of directors and key employees are
crucial to our business, and we may not be able to recruit,
integrate and retain the personnel we need to succeed.
 

Our
success will depend upon a number of key management, sales,
technical and other critical personnel, including our executive
officers, our board of directors and key employees with expertise
in the industry. The loss of the services of any key personnel, or
our inability to attract, integrate and retain highly skilled
technical, management, sales and marketing personnel could result
in significant disruption to our operations, including our
inability or limited success in locating new sites, effectiveness
of sales efforts, quality of customer service, and completion of
our initiatives, including growth plans and the results of our
operations. Any failure by us to find suitable replacements for our
key senior management may be disruptive to our operations.
Competition for such personnel in the technology industries is
intense, and we may be unable to attract, integrate and retain such
personnel successfully.

 

We may
have to depend on outside advisors for some of our primary business
operations.

 

 

4

  

 

 

To
supplement the business experience of our officers and directors,
we may be required to employ accountants, technical experts,
appraisers and attorneys or engage other consultants or advisors.
The selection of any such advisors will be made by our directors
and officers without any input from shareholders. Furthermore, it
is anticipated that such persons may be engaged on an “as
needed” basis without a continuing fiduciary or other
obligation to us. In the event management considers it necessary to
hire outside advisors, they may elect to hire persons who are
affiliates, if they are able to provide the required
services.

 

IF THE
COMPANY DOES NOT EFFECTIVELY MANAGE ITS GROWTH, ITS BUSINESS
RESOURCES MAY BECOME STRAINED AND ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE
ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

 

The
Company expects to rapidly increase its employee base proportionate
to expansion of its manufacturing capabilities. This may provide
challenges to the Company’s organization and may strain its
management and operations. The Company may misjudge the amount of
time or resources that will be required to effectively manage any
anticipated or unanticipated growth in its business or it may not
be able to attract, hire and retain sufficient personnel to meet
its needs. If the Company cannot scale its business appropriately,
maintain control over expenses or otherwise adapt to anticipated
and unanticipated growth, its business resources may become
strained, it may not be able to deliver contracted products in a
timely manner and its results of operations may be adversely
affected

 

THE
COMPANY MAY BE SUBJECT TO POTENTIAL PRODUCT LIABILITY AND OTHER
CLAIMS AND IT MAY NOT HAVE THE INSURANCE OR OTHER RESOURCES TO
COVER THE COSTS OF ANY SUCCESSFUL CLAIM.

 

Defects in
the Company's products could subject it to potential product
liability claims for damage to property or personal
injuries.  The Company’s product liability
insurance, if available at reasonable cost, may not be adequate to
cover future claims. Product liability insurance is expensive and,
in the future, may not be available on terms that are acceptable to
the Company, if it is available to it at all. Plaintiffs may also
advance other legal theories supporting their claims that the
Company's products or actions resulted in some harm.  A
successful claim brought against the Company in excess of its
insurance coverage could significantly harm its business and
financial condition.

 

RISKS
RELATED TO CAPITAL STRUCTURE

 

THERE IS
NO ASSURANCE OF AN ESTABLISHED PUBLIC TRADING MARKET.

 

Although
the Company's common stock trades on the OTC Bulletin Board, a
regular trading market for the securities may not be sustained in
the future. The OTC Bulletin Board is an inter-dealer,
over-the-counter market that provides significantly less liquidity
than other exchanges. Quotes for stocks included on the OTC
Bulletin Board are not listed in the financial sections of
newspapers as are those for other major exchanges. Therefore,
prices for securities traded solely on the OTC Bulletin Board may
be difficult to obtain and holders of common stock may be unable to
resell their securities at or near their original offering price or
at any price. Market prices for the Company's common stock will be
influenced by a number of factors, including:

 




 



●



the
issuance of new equity securities pursuant to its recent issuance
of shares for a technology license, or a future
offering;





 



●



changes in
interest rates;





 



●



competitive
developments, including announcements by competitors of new
products or services or significant contracts, acquisitions,
strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital
commitments;





 



●



variations
in quarterly operating results;





 



●



changes in
financial estimates by securities analysts;





 



●



the depth
and liquidity of the market for the Company's common
stock;





 



●



investor
perceptions of the Company and the alternative energy industry
generally; and





 



●



general
economic and other national conditions.




 

THE
COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK IS CONSIDERED A "PENNY STOCK."

 

The
Company's common stock is considered to be a "penny stock" since it
meets one or more of the definitions in Rules 15g-2 through 15g-6
promulgated under Section 15(g) of the Exchange Act. These include
but are not limited to the following: (i) the stock trades at a
price less than $5.00 per share; (ii) it is not traded on a
"recognized" national exchange; (iii) it is not quoted on the
NASDAQ Stock Market, or even if so, has a price less than $5.00 per
share; or (iv) is issued by a company with net tangible assets less
than $2.0 million, if in business more than three years, or with
average revenues of less than $6.0 million for the past three
years. The principal result or effect of being designated a "penny
stock" is that securities broker-dealers cannot recommend the stock
but must trade in it on an unsolicited basis.

 

 

5

  

 

 

BROKER-DEALER
REQUIREMENTS MAY AFFECT TRADING AND LIQUIDITY.

 

Section
15(g) of the Exchange Act and Rule 15g-2 promulgated thereunder by
the SEC require broker-dealers dealing in penny stocks to provide
potential investors with a document disclosing the risks of penny
stocks and to obtain a manually signed and dated written receipt of
the document before effecting any transaction in a penny stock for
the investor's account.

 

Potential
investors in the Company's common stock are urged to obtain and
read such disclosure carefully before purchasing any shares that
are deemed to be "penny stock." Moreover, Rule 15g-9 requires
broker-dealers in penny stocks to approve the account of any
investor for transactions in such stocks before selling any penny
stock to that investor. This procedure requires the broker-dealer
to (i) obtain from the investor information concerning his or her
financial situation, investment experience and investment
objectives; (ii) reasonably determine, based on that information,
that transactions in penny stocks are suitable for the investor and
that the investor has sufficient knowledge and experience as to be
reasonably capable of evaluating the risks of penny stock
transactions; (iii) provide the investor with a written statement
setting forth the basis on which the broker-dealer made the
determination in (ii) above; and (iv) receive a signed and dated
copy of such statement from the investor, confirming that it
accurately reflects the investor's financial situation, investment
experience and investment objectives. Compliance with these
requirements may make it more difficult for holders of the
Company's common stock to resell their shares to third parties or
to otherwise dispose of them in the market or otherwise.

 

FOLLOWING
THE COMPANY’S RECENT TECHNOLOGY LICENSE TRANSACTION, THE
PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS OF THE LICENSOR WILL HAVE SIGNIFICANT
INFLUENCE OVER THE COMPANY.

 

The
officers, directors and insiders of the Company beneficially own,
in the aggregate, 86.4% of the Company's outstanding voting stock.
As a result, the principal shareholders of Boreas Research
Corporation, the Company’s technology licensor, will possess
significant influence over the Company, giving them the ability,
among other things, to elect a majority of the Company's Board of
Directors and to approve significant corporate transactions. Such
stock ownership and control may also have the effect of delaying or
preventing a future change in control of the Company, impeding an
acquisition, consolidation, takeover or other business combination
or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or
otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company.

 

THE
COMPANY DOES NOT FORESEE PAYING CASH DIVIDENDS IN THE FORESEEABLE
FUTURE.

 

We
currently intend to retain our future earnings to support
operations and to finance expansion and, therefore, we do not
anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the
foreseeable future.  The Company has not paid any
dividends since its inception.

  

ANTICIPATED
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

 

The
Company’s management anticipates that substantial additional
capital will be required to implement its business plan. However,
there can be no assurance that management will be successful in
raising such necessary additional capital. If additional funds are
raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt
securities, the percentage ownership of our shareholders will be
reduced, shareholders may experience additional dilution and such
securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to
those of our common stock. There can be no assurance that
additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us or
at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on
acceptable terms, we may not be able to implement our business
plan, fund expansion, take advantage of unanticipated acquisition
opportunities, develop or enhance services or products or respond
to competitive pressures. Such inability could harm the
Company’s business, results of operations and financial
condition.

 

RISKS
RELATED TO WIND ENERGY INDUSTRY

 

We have a
limited operating history and we have not demonstrated that we can
develop, market, install and manage our licensed supplemental
energy generating systems on a large scale.

 
 

We have a
limited history of managing supplemental energy generating systems
and limited data upon which you can evaluate our business. Our
prospects for success must be considered in the context of a new
company in a developing industry. The risks we face include
developing and acquiring successful relationships with large scale
wind farms, reliance on third parties, operating in a competitive
environment in which electricity rates will be set by the operation
of market forces and regulatory constraints, uncertain performance
of our supplemental energy generating systems, financing our
business and meeting the challenges of the other risk factors
described herein. If we are unable to address all of these risks,
our business, results of operations and financial condition may
suffer.

 

 

6

  

 

 

The
revenues generated by wind farms depend on market prices of energy
in competitive wholesale energy markets. Market prices for both
energy and capacity are volatile and depend on numerous factors
outside our control including economic conditions, population
growth, electrical load growth, government and regulatory policy,
weather, the availability of alternate generation and transmission
facilities, balance of supply and demand, seasonality, transmission
and transportation constraints and the price of natural gas and
alternative fuels or energy sources. The wholesale power markets
are also subject to market regulation by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission, independent system operators, and regional
transmission operators which can impact market prices for energy
and capacity sold in such markets, including by imposing price
caps, mechanisms to address price volatility or illiquidity in the
markets or system instability and market power mitigation measures.
We cannot assure you that market prices will be at levels that
enable us to operate profitably or as anticipated. A decline in
electricity or capacity market prices below anticipated levels
could have a material adverse impact on our revenues or results of
operations. In markets where wind farms qualify to receive capacity
payments, it is typical that only a portion of the wind
farm’s capacity is eligible to receive capacity payments.
This portion is typically based on the previous year’s
average net capacity factor during peak periods. In addition,
changes to regulatory policy or market rules regarding the
qualification of wind generation as a capacity resource could limit
or eliminate a wind farm’s ability to receive payments for
its generating capacity.

 

The
governments of the United States and Canada may not extend or may
decrease existing tax incentives for renewable energy, including
wind energy, which would have an adverse impact on our development
strategy.
 

Tax
incentives applicable to the wind energy industry currently in
effect include the production tax credit (“PTC”) and
accelerated tax depreciation for certain assets of wind farms. The
current version of the PTC provides the owner of a wind turbine
with a credit against its federal income tax obligations based on
the amount of electricity generated by the wind turbine. The
accelerated depreciation for certain assets of wind farms provides
for a five-year depreciable life for these assets, rather than the
15 to 25 year depreciable lives of many non-renewable energy
assets. We also cannot assure you that the tax laws providing for
accelerated depreciation of wind farm assets will not be modified,
amended or repealed in the future. If the current tax incentives
are not extended or renewed, or are extended or renewed at a lower
rate, financing options for wind farms may be reduced and
development plans for additional wind farms could be adversely
affected, thereby severely restricting the number of potential
sites for the Company’s products.
 

Tax equity
investors have limited funds, and wind energy producers compete
with other renewable energy producers for tax equity financing. In
the current rapidly expanding market, the cost of tax equity
financing may increase and there may not be sufficient tax equity
financing available to meet the total demand in any year. In
addition, one or more current tax equity investors may decide to
withdraw from this market thereby depleting the pool of funds
available for tax equity financing. Alternative financing will be
more expensive and there may not be sufficient liquidity in
alternate financial markets. As a result, development of additional
wind farms and the Company’s growth potential would both be
adversely affected.

 

The
performance of wind farms and, by extension, the Company’s
products, are dependent upon meteorological and atmospheric
conditions that fluctuate over time. The production of electricity
generated by our supplemental wind energy systems will be the
source of substantially all of our revenues. As a result, our
results of operations will be highly dependent on meteorological
and atmospheric conditions.
 

Operational
factors may reduce energy production from the Company’s
supplemental wind energy generation systems below projections,
causing a reduction in revenue. The amount of electricity generated
depends upon many factors in addition to the quality of the wind
resources, including but not limited to turbine performance,
aerodynamic losses resulting from wear on the wind turbine,
degradation of other components, icing or soiling of the blades and
the number of times an individual turbine or an entire wind farm
may need to be shut down for maintenance or to avoid damage due to
extreme weather conditions. In addition, conditions on the
electrical transmission network can impact the amount of energy a
wind farm can deliver to the network. We cannot assure you that any
of our supplemental wind energy generation systems will meet energy
production expectations in any given time period.

 

As with
all power generation facilities, operation of our supplemental wind
energy generation systems will involve operating risks,
including:

 




 



●



our
possible inability to achieve the output and efficiency levels for
our supplemental wind energy generation systems that we have
projected; and





 



●



shutdown
due to a breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, violation
of permit requirements (whether through operations or change in
law), operator error or catastrophic events such as fires,
explosions, floods or other similar occurrences affecting us, our
supplemental wind energy generation systems or third parties upon
which our business may depend.




 

 

7

  

 

 

The
occurrence of one or more of these events could significantly
reduce revenues expected to be produced by our supplemental wind
energy generation systems or significantly increase the expenses of
our supplemental wind energy generation systems, thereby adversely
affecting our business, results of operations and financial
condition.
 

Our
financial projections assume that we will be able to operate our
supplemental wind energy generation systems nearly continually and
we may have trouble meeting our obligations if we are not
successful.
 

We will
need to achieve high levels of availability and dispatch for our
supplemental wind energy generation systems to operate profitably.
We operate under the assumption that we will achieve high levels of
availability and dispatch in developing the revenue figures
included in our financial projections. However, developments could
affect the dispatch rate of our supplemental wind energy generation
systems, including the following:

 




 



●



equipment
problems or other problems which affect the ability of our
supplemental wind energy generation systems to operate;





 



●



implementation
of additional or more stringent environmental compliance measures;
or





 



●



the market
introduction of new and competing products which may be more
efficient and cost effective than our supplemental wind energy
generation systems.




 

Changes in
energy laws or regulations or interpretations of these laws or
regulations could result in increased compliance costs or result in
additional expenditures for us. Failure by us to comply or failure
to satisfy requirements could also subject us to the imposition of
penalties and fines. Governmental laws, regulations and policies
applicable to alternative energy sources are currently subject to
modifications and are expected to continue to evolve. Resulting
laws and policies may restrict the structuring of the sales of the
power generated by wind farms. Federal law regulates wholesale
sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity in
interstate commerce by public utilities. We cannot predict whether
federal or state governmental entities or regulatory authorities
will adopt new laws or regulations or modify existing laws
affecting the generation and/or transmission of electricity, or the
ability of our counterparty wind farm operators to comply with
them. Such new laws or regulations could have a material adverse
impact on our business, results of operations or financial
condition.
 

Various
state governments may not extend or may decrease incentives for
renewable energy, including wind energy, which would have an
adverse impact on our development strategy.
 

Various
types of incentives which support the sale of electricity generated
from wind energy presently exist in regions where we plan to
market, install and operate our products on existing wind farms. We
cannot assure you that governmental support for alternative energy
sources will continue at current levels or that the wind farms we
partner with will qualify for such incentives. Any decrease in such
state-level incentives could have an adverse impact on our
development strategy.

 

We depend
on our ability to locate and develop new sources of wind power in a
timely and consistent manner, and failure to do so would adversely
affect our operations and financial performance.
 

Our
success in the industry requires additional and continuing
development to become and remain competitive. We expect to continue
to make substantial investments in development activities. Our
future success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to
locate additional wind power sites. This development activity will
require continued investment in order to maintain and grow our
market position. We may experience unforeseen problems in our
development endeavors. We may not achieve widespread market
acceptance of our supplemental wind energy generation systems.
These factors could materially affect our ability to forecast
operations and negatively affect our stock price, results of
operations, cash flow and financial condition.
 

The number
of desirable sites available for successful wind farms is limited,
and our inability to successfully negotiate for access with the
owners and operators of such sites would limit our ability to
implement our development strategy.

 

We are a
small company, and we will be operating in a highly competitive
market, and this competition may accelerate in the future.
Potential competitors have, or may have, substantially greater
financial, marketing or technical resources, and in some cases,
greater name recognition and experience than we have. Such
potential competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or
emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, and may
also be able to devote greater resources to the development and
promotion of supplemental wind energy generation systems than we
can. Potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or
establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third
parties that enhance their ability to address the needs of our
prospective counterparties. It is possible that new competitors or
alliances among potential competitors may emerge and rapidly gain
significant market share. This would in turn reduce our market
share, reduce our overall revenues and require us to invest
additional funds in new technology development. If we cannot
compete successfully against competitors, this will have a negative
impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations
and cash flow.

 

 

8

  

 

 

We will
depend on electric transmission facilities owned and operated by
third parties to deliver the electricity that we sell. We will
typically connect to transmission networks through the facilities
owned and controlled by our counterparty wind farm owners and
operators. The capacity of the local transmission network may be
limited or constrained, and the owner of the network may not allow
us to interconnect our supplemental wind energy system without
first constructing any necessary system upgrades. Many wind farms
are located in remote areas with limited transmission networks
where intense competition exists for access to, and use of capacity
on, the existing transmission facilities. We cannot assure you that
we will obtain sufficient network connections for all future
installations within planned timetables and budgetary
constraints.

 

Our
counterparty wind farm owners and operators are required to meet
certain technical specifications in order to be connected to the
transmission network. If any wind farm does not meet, or ceases to
comply with, these specifications, we will not be able to connect,
to or remain connected, to the transmission network. We may also
incur liabilities and penalties, including disconnection from the
network, if the transmission of electricity by one or more of such
host wind farms does not comply with applicable technical
requirements. In the interconnection agreements between wind farms
and the applicable transmission owner or operator, the transmission
owner or operator retains the right to interrupt or curtail
transmission deliveries as required in order to maintain the
reliability of the transmission network. We cannot assure you that
the Company will not be adversely impacted by any such interruption
or curtailment.

Utilities Company Research Reports


The Utilities Industry is involved in the supply of such public services as water, electricity, and conventional gas, as well as in taking waste salvage and sewage disposal measures. The sector encompasses such establishments as manufacturing businesses and consultancy firms, standard power and water companies, maintenance organizations, and also a pool of governance bodies, among others. The utilities infrastructure is rather dear to create; hence companies involved tend to consolidate to become quite large, but few in quantity, organisms.  
The global Utilities Market is evolving in line with the comeback of most economies and global-scale swell in population, to eventually reach a value of EUR 3.4 trillion by end-2015. Drivers include ascending fuel costs, quest for greener environment, alongside the competitive advantages in the Utilities marketplace. Some of the major Utilities Companies include E.ON AG; AES Corporation; GDF SUEZ; Veolia Environnement S.A.; Iberdrola SA, Centrica plc; National Grid plc; and Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg AG, among lots of others. 
This Catalogue contains a valuable collection of research reports concentrating on in-depth financial assessments of Utilities Companies’ performance, both in global and regional surroundings. Company rankings are provided in the research reports, in terms of sales gain, trade stability, revenue position, working assets, debt/equity ratio, and effective liquidity. Alongside varying Utilities Companies’ evaluations, the research reports comprehensively examine the market itself.
