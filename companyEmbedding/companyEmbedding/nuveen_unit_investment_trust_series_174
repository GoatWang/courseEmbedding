Investing involves risk; principal loss is possible.


There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in a unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in a trust.


Past performance is no indication of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. Units when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost.


Teachers Advisors, Inc., Nuveen Asset Management, LLC, Symphony Asset Management LLC, and NWQ Investment Management Company, LLC, registered investment advisers and affiliates of Nuveen, LLC serve as the portfolio consultants responsible for recommending a portfolio of securities for certain unit investment trusts.  Argus Investors Counsel, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Morningstar Investment Services, Inc., Prospect Capital Management L.P., Zacks Investment Research, ARK Investment Management (“ARK”), and KKM Financial, LLC also provide portfolio consulting services for various unit investment trusts but are not affiliated with Nuveen, LLC or its affiliates.

CHICAGO, Jan. 15, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Incapital LLC and Nuveen Asset Management today announced that they have brought to market the next series of an equity unit trust based on the 2015 predictions of well-known Nuveen portfolio manager and strategist Bob Doll. This is the second consecutive year these two investment firms have partnered to bring such a portfolio to market.
The Nuveen 2015 Equity Outlook Portfolio, deposited on January 14, is designed to offer: 

The potential for capital appreciation for investors willing to accept associated equity market risks 
A high-conviction portfolio from an experienced portfolio manager and widely followed market strategist 
A portfolio approach seeking to limit uncompensated risk 
Investment opportunities not fully reflected in today's stock market valuations
More information about the Nuveen 2015 Equity Outlook Portfolio and other Incapital Unit Trusts is available at incapital.com/UnitTrusts.
Bob Doll, CFA, Senior Portfolio Manager and Chief Equity Strategist for Nuveen Asset Management, is a highly respected authority on the equity markets and regularly provides timely market perspectives to investors, advisors and the media.
The Nuveen 2015 Equity Outlook Portfolio is designed to capitalize on the economic and market environment described by Doll's 2015 Ten Predictions, released on January 7th. Incapital serves as the Trust's sponsor and Nuveen Asset Management serves as the Trust's portfolio consultant.
"We are pleased to partner again with Nuveen Asset Management to offer an equity trust product designed specifically for the upcoming market environment," said Phil Johnson, President of Incapital. "This partnership reflects our commitment to deliver diversified investment options to help investors meet their goals."
"Bob Doll's portfolio investment expertise, market insights, and Ten Predictions are highly respected and sought after in the investment community," said William T. Huffman, President of Nuveen Asset Management. "The Nuveen 2015 Equity Outlook Portfolio addresses the needs of investors seeking an equity trust option from an experienced portfolio manager and strategist, as well as two firms with a proven track record of innovative product development."  
The partnership between Incapital and Nuveen Asset Management and its affiliates, which kicked off at the end of 2013, has already resulted in the formation of four new unit trust strategies.

Incapital and Nuveen Investments Expand Unit Trust Partnership




















June 10, 2015 08:30 ET

		New Unit Trusts Leverage Expertise of Nuveen's Multi-Affiliate Model

		Enhanced by Incapital Additions to Unit Trust Business

		Nuveen Expands Specialist Sales Support Team for Unit Trusts

CHICAGO, June 10, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Incapital LLC and Nuveen Investments, today announced the expansion of their joint-distribution and portfolio consultant unit trust partnership with the addition of new unit trusts and expanded sales resources at both firms to support the growth of the unit trust business and better serve the financial advisor community and their clients. Since the beginning of 2014, Nuveen and Incapital have partnered together on key aspects of unit trust product development, marketing, distribution and client relationship management. In this partnership, Incapital serves as trust underwriter and sponsor, providing units to the public through broker-dealers and other firms.  Nuveen Investments, through its several affiliates, serves as portfolio consultant responsible for developing investment strategies and constructing model portfolios for the unit trusts.

	Commenting on the partnership, John DesPrez, Incapital's Chief Executive Officer, said, "Incapital's relationship with Nuveen Investments continues to deepen. With the expansion of our joint-distribution agreement, we will be offering a wider range of investment strategies to thousands of additional financial advisors and their clients."

INCAPITAL UNIT TRUSTS FEATURING NUVEEN'S INVESTMENT EXPERTISE

	Since inception of the partnership, Incapital has offered five equity unit trust strategies that draw upon the deep and specialized expertise of Nuveen Investments' affiliates:


		Nuveen Equity Outlook Portfolios

		Nuveen Large Cap Dividend Portfolios

		Nuveen Core Real Estate Securities Portfolios

		Nuveen NWQ Global Dividend Value Portfolios

		Nuveen Tradewinds Global Energy Revolution Portfolio


	To further broaden its platform for clients, Incapital has been working closely with Nuveen this year to develop a robust pipeline of new unit trusts employing a variety of strategies and themes. Capitalizing on the recently closed Nuveen 2015 Equity Outlook Portfolio, Series 68, which more than doubled in assets from the prior year's series, Incapital filed an initial registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the Nuveen 2015 Mid-Year Equity Outlook Portfolio, Series 86. This new unit trust's portfolio selection is led by Bob Doll, Nuveen Asset Management's Senior Portfolio Manager and Chief Equity Strategist, and seeks to include a mid-year update in which Bob Doll reassesses his investment outlook as expressed in his 2015 Ten Predictions.

	Additionally, Incapital filed an initial registration statement with the SEC for the Nuveen Symphony Low Volatility Equity Portfolio, Series 88, which employs the investment expertise of Symphony Asset Management, an affiliate of Nuveen Investments. Recognized for their rigorous fundamental research and alternative investment/hedge fund expertise, Symphony applies a team-based approach to valuation and risk analysis, which seeks to identify and translate relative value into desired risk/reward portfolio outcomes. 

	Bill Adams, Nuveen Investments' Senior Executive Vice President and Head of Global Structured Products added, "We are very pleased to expand our relationship with Incapital as we work to bring innovative investment options to investors. We believe unit trusts can expand the ability of investors and their advisors to access the specialized investment expertise of our affiliates across a broad range of asset classes to help them better achieve their financial objectives." 

JOINT-DISTRIBUTION EFFORT

	Incapital has recently appointed Hugh McHaffie as Managing Director who will soon oversee the origination and distribution of a range of wealth management solutions, including Unit Trust, Market Linked and Annuity offerings. McHaffie is supported by a veteran Unit Trust origination team in Chicago, headed by John Browning, Managing Director and Randy Watts, Executive Director. Pat Dwyer, National Sales Manager, will soon lead Incapital's nation-wide distribution network supporting financial advisors seeking wealth management investment solutions for their clients.

	Given the performance of the current unit trust offerings, strong interest from the market, and robust pipeline of new offerings currently under consideration, Nuveen Investments is also enhancing its unit trust distribution efforts with the appointment of Melissa Roe as Managing Director, National Head of Unit Trust Sales. Overseeing a team of external and internal unit trust specialists, Roe will act as a liaison between Nuveen Investments and Incapital to represent the capabilities of Nuveen Investments' affiliates and ensure that the needs of financial advisors and their investor clients are being served.

Investment opportunities not fully reflected in today's stock market valuations

Overview

Featuring the
            investment expertise of  






Investment Strategy
The portfolio’s securities are selected utilizing the proprietary quantitative models and academic investment research employed by Zacks Investment Research, founded in 1978 and one of the largest providers of independent research in the US.
Zacks Investment Research collects earnings and other data on approximately 4,400 stocks (daily and intra-daily) from analysts at approximately 150 brokerage firms.
This data is used in the Zacks Rank quantitative methodology which is based on the following four factors:

Agreement of analysts’ revised earnings per share (EPS) estimates
Magnitude or “size” of recent EPS estimate revisions
Upside or the difference between the most accurate analyst estimate and the consensus of all analyst estimates
Surprise meaning a positive or negative earnings surprise



Zacks Rank
The Zacks Rank quantitative methodology assigns each stock a Rank based on a composite score of the four factors as illustrated in the table below:



Screening Process
The securities in the portfolio are selected based upon the following pre-set quantitative investment criteria as of the Security Selection Date:


1P/B ratio is calculated as price divided by book value per share. Book value is reported shareholder equity attributable to common stock, capital surplus or additional paid-in capital, retained earnings minus treasury stock.


Risk Considerations
There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. You can lose money investing in this trust.

Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer’s board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time.

A portfolio concentrated in a single market sector may present more risk than a portfolio broadly diversified over several sectors.

This trust is concentrated in the Information Technology sector. There are certain risks specific to information technology stocks such as volatile stock prices, rapid product obsolescence, and speculative trading.

Stocks of small and mid-cap companies are often more volatile than those of larger companies as a result of several factors such as limited trading volumes, products or financial resources, management inexperience and less publicly available information.

This trust invests in Master Limited Partnerships (“MLPs”). Most MLPs operate in the energy, natural resources, or real estate sectors and are subject to the risks generally applicable to those sectors, including commodity price risk, supply and demand risk, depletion risk and exploration risk. MLPs are also subject to the risk that U.S. taxing authorities could challenge the tax treatment of MLPs for federal income tax purposes, which could have a negative impact on the after-tax income available for distribution by the MLPs.

Investing in foreign securities involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the United States. This may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries, U.S. or foreign tax treatment, and the potential lack of liquidity, government supervision and regulation.

Investing in emerging markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with foreign investments.

Although this trust’s life is approximately 15 months, this strategy should be considered as part of a long-term investment strategy and investors should consider their ability to pursue investing in successive portfolios at the applicable sales charge, if available. There may be tax consequences associated with an investment from one series to the next unless units are purchased in an IRA or other qualified tax-deferred account. Investors should consult their tax advisor or attorney to determine tax consequences associated with an investment from one portfolio to the next.

NOT FDIC INSURED - NOT BANK GUARANTEED - MAY LOSE VALUE

The prospectus contains this and other information about this unit investment trust. To obtain a prospectus, please request one from your financial advisor or visit nuveen.com/UIT.

LIQ is the Liquidation Price.  Represents the value per unit that a unitholder would receive if the unitholder redeemed or sold units.  This price is equal to the net asset value per unit plus any remaining organization costs and creation & development fee.  This price reflects any remaining non-contingent deferred sales charges payable in connection with a liquidation of units.
Past performance is no indication of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. Units when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost. 
This page contains historical pricing or historical distributions information for the unit investment trust listed above. It should not be used for federal or state tax purposes, please contact your financial advisor for tax information.




Risk Considerations
There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. You can lose money investing in this trust.

Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer’s board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time.

A portfolio concentrated in a single market sector may present more risk than a portfolio broadly diversified over several sectors.

This trust is concentrated in the Information Technology sector. There are certain risks specific to information technology stocks such as volatile stock prices, rapid product obsolescence, and speculative trading.

Stocks of small and mid-cap companies are often more volatile than those of larger companies as a result of several factors such as limited trading volumes, products or financial resources, management inexperience and less publicly available information.

This trust invests in Master Limited Partnerships (“MLPs”). Most MLPs operate in the energy, natural resources, or real estate sectors and are subject to the risks generally applicable to those sectors, including commodity price risk, supply and demand risk, depletion risk and exploration risk. MLPs are also subject to the risk that U.S. taxing authorities could challenge the tax treatment of MLPs for federal income tax purposes, which could have a negative impact on the after-tax income available for distribution by the MLPs.

Investing in foreign securities involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the United States. This may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries, U.S. or foreign tax treatment, and the potential lack of liquidity, government supervision and regulation.

Investing in emerging markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with foreign investments.

Although this trust’s life is approximately 15 months, this strategy should be considered as part of a long-term investment strategy and investors should consider their ability to pursue investing in successive portfolios at the applicable sales charge, if available. There may be tax consequences associated with an investment from one series to the next unless units are purchased in an IRA or other qualified tax-deferred account. Investors should consult their tax advisor or attorney to determine tax consequences associated with an investment from one portfolio to the next.

Returns With Transactional Sales Charge reflect the maximum transactional sales charge that would be payable by an investor upon sale or redemption of units at the end of the applicable period(s). The transactional sales charge includes any initial or deferred sales charges other than the creation and development fee. These returns do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment by a trust.

Returns Without Transactional Sales Charge do not reflect any transactional sales charge and do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment by a trust.
Returns are cumulative total returns (not annualized) unless labeled as average annual returns.  Distribution Received in Cash returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume income and principal distributions are paid out in cash on the payable date.  Distributions Reinvested returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume income and principal distributions are reinvested on the reinvestment date.

Past performance is no indication of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. Units when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost.

All returns are historical and do not represent potential future performance.  A trust’s performance, especially for short time periods, should not be the sole factor in making your investment decision.

Data used for the Portfolio Holdings and Portfolio Allocation Characteristics is from Bloomberg Finance L.P. Portfolio holdings are provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell individual securities. Portfolio Holdings and Portfolio Allocation Characteristics are as of deposit day and are subject to change and may vary thereafter.
The style and capitalization characteristics are designed to help investors understand how they fit into an overall investment plan. Value, blend and growth are types of investment styles. Growth Investing generally seeks stocks that offer the potential for greater-than-average earnings growth, and may entail greater risk than value or blend investing. Value investing generally seeks stocks that may be sound investments but are temporarily out of favor in the marketplace, and may entail less risk than growth investing. A blend investment combines the two styles. Market capitalization is determined by the following criteria: Large Cap: Greater than $10 billion, Mid Cap: $2 billion-$10 billion, Small Cap: $250 million-$2 billion Micro Cap: Below $250 million.


Risk Considerations
There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. You can lose money investing in this trust.

Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer’s board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time.

A portfolio concentrated in a single market sector may present more risk than a portfolio broadly diversified over several sectors.

This trust is concentrated in the Information Technology sector. There are certain risks specific to information technology stocks such as volatile stock prices, rapid product obsolescence, and speculative trading.

Stocks of small and mid-cap companies are often more volatile than those of larger companies as a result of several factors such as limited trading volumes, products or financial resources, management inexperience and less publicly available information.

This trust invests in Master Limited Partnerships (“MLPs”). Most MLPs operate in the energy, natural resources, or real estate sectors and are subject to the risks generally applicable to those sectors, including commodity price risk, supply and demand risk, depletion risk and exploration risk. MLPs are also subject to the risk that U.S. taxing authorities could challenge the tax treatment of MLPs for federal income tax purposes, which could have a negative impact on the after-tax income available for distribution by the MLPs.

Investing in foreign securities involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the United States. This may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries, U.S. or foreign tax treatment, and the potential lack of liquidity, government supervision and regulation.

Investing in emerging markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with foreign investments.

Although this trust’s life is approximately 15 months, this strategy should be considered as part of a long-term investment strategy and investors should consider their ability to pursue investing in successive portfolios at the applicable sales charge, if available. There may be tax consequences associated with an investment from one series to the next unless units are purchased in an IRA or other qualified tax-deferred account. Investors should consult their tax advisor or attorney to determine tax consequences associated with an investment from one portfolio to the next.

Income distributions will vary with changes in dividends or interest received on the underlying securities and with changes in the trust's fees and expenses. Principal distributions will be made only when the trust receives principal cash and will therefore vary. Both income and principal distributions may be affected by the sale of securities in the portfolio. See the prospectus for a more detailed description of the factors which could affect income and principal distributions.

1. LIQ is the Liquidation Price.  Represents the value per unit that a unitholder would receive if the unitholder redeemed or sold units.  This price is equal to the net asset value per unit plus any remaining organization costs and creation & development fee.  This price reflects any remaining non-contingent deferred sales charges payable in connection with a liquidation of units.
2. There is no guarantee that any distributions will be made.  The estimated net annual income is per unit as of deposit day and based on the most recently declared dividends, distributions or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes of the portfolio’s holdings.  The actual net annual income distributions you receive will vary from the estimate with changes in the portfolio’s fees and expenses, income received, currency fluctuations, and with the call, redemption, maturity, or sale of securities. 
3. The historical annual dividend distribution was calculated as of the day of deposit based on the trailing 12-month dividends or distributions paid by each issuer of securities in the trust portfolio and is net of the deferred sales charge and operating expenses charged by the trust. The trailing 12-month dividend for each issuer includes net dividend amounts for all fixed schedule dividends that have been declared over the past 12 months, excluding special distributions like special cash and return of capital, taxes, any related dividend fees and tax related credits. The amount of distributions you receive will vary from the above-stated amount due to changes in the dividends or distributions paid by issuers, changes in the trust's fees and expenses, income received, currency fluctuations, and with the call, redemption, maturity or sale of portfolio securities. Fees and expenses of the trust may vary as a result of the trust's size, redemption activity, brokerage and other transaction costs and extraordinary expenses among other factors.

Data used for the Portfolio Holdings and Portfolio Allocation Characteristics is from Bloomberg Finance L.P. Portfolio holdings are provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell individual securities. Portfolio Holdings and Portfolio Allocation Characteristics are as of deposit day and are subject to change and may vary thereafter.
The style and capitalization characteristics are designed to help investors understand how they fit into an overall investment plan. Value, blend and growth are types of investment styles. Growth Investing generally seeks stocks that offer the potential for greater-than-average earnings growth, and may entail greater risk than value or blend investing. Value investing generally seeks stocks that may be sound investments but are temporarily out of favor in the marketplace, and may entail less risk than growth investing. A blend investment combines the two styles. Market capitalization is determined by the following criteria: Large Cap: Greater than $10 billion, Mid Cap: $2 billion-$10 billion, Small Cap: $250 million-$2 billion Micro Cap: Below $250 million.


This material is not intended to be a recommendation or investment advice, does not constitute a solicitation to buy or sell securities, and is not provided in a fiduciary capacity. The information provided does not take into account the specific objectives or circumstances of any particular investor, or suggest any specific course of action. Investment decisions should be made based on an investor’s objectives and circumstances and in consultation with his or her advisors.


Risk Considerations
				There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. You can lose money investing in this trust. This trust terminates approximately 2 years from the initial date of deposit.

				Investing in the trust units may involve a high degree of risk and is highly speculative and aggressive, and therefore an investment in trust units may not be suitable for someone with low risk tolerance.

				Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer’s board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time.

				A portfolio concentrated in a single market sector may present more risk than a portfolio broadly diversified over several sectors. This trust is concentrated in the financials sector, particularly in business development companies ("BDCs") and real estate investment trusts ("REITs"). There are certain risks specific to the financials sector, and in particular, BDCs and REITs, including the potential adverse effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, and state and federal regulations.
				 
				This trust is concentrated in the financials sector, particularly in business development companies ("BDCs") and real estate investment trusts ("REITs"). There are certain risks specific to the financials sector, and in particular, BDCs and REITs, including the potential adverse effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, and state and federal regulations.

				This trust invests in BDCs and will be subject to risks associated with BDCs. BDCs are closed-end funds that have elected to be treated as business development companies and their ability to grow their overall financial condition is impacted significantly by their ability to raise capital, engage in borrowing, acquire suitable investments, and maintain their status as a BDC. Failure to do so will adversely affect the value of a BDC’s shares. BDCs generally employ leverage in their portfolios. While leverage often increases the yield of a portfolio, it may magnify the potential for gains and losses on amounts invested, and accordingly, may increase the volatility and/or risks associated with those shares. A BDC’s investments are frequently not publicly traded, and as a result, there is uncertainty as to the value and liquidity of those investments. BDCs are subject to laws or regulations governing BDCs that could negatively affect the value of the BDC shares. Shares of BDCs frequently trade at a discount to their net asset value in the secondary market and the net asset value of a BDC’s shares may decrease.

				This trust invests in REITs and real estate companies. Many factors can have an impact on the performance of REITs and real estate companies, including cash available for distribution, the credit quality of a particular REIT, or the real estate industry in general. Risks associated with ownership of real estate include global and local economic conditions, decline in real estate values, changes in interest rates, and the strength or weakness of the real estate market.

				You will bear not only your share of the trust’s expenses, but also those of the underlying BDCs and REITs, which frequently have high expenses including but not limited to management fees and operational expenses. By investing in BDCs and REITs through the trust, investors incur greater expenses than they would incur if they invested directly in the BDCs and REITs.

				BDCs and REITs may invest in foreign securities which involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the United States. This may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries, U.S. or foreign tax treatment, and the potential lack of liquidity, government supervision and regulation.

				BDCs may invest in securities of small and mid-cap companies. Securities of small and mid-cap companies are often more volatile than those of larger companies as a result of several factors such as limited trading volumes, products or financial resources, management inexperience and less publicly available information.

				BDCs and REITs may invest in fixed income securities. Fixed income securities are subject to various risks, including interest rate, credit, call, and quality risk. In general, the value of the fixed income securities will fall if interest rates rise. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. A security issuer may be unable to make interest and/or principal payments in the future. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.

				BDCs may invest in high yield debt securities. High yield debt securities are generally below investment grade quality (“non-investment grade” debt). Investing in such debt should be viewed as speculative and you should review your ability to assume the risks associated with investments which utilize such debt. Non-investment grade debt is subject to numerous risks including higher interest rates, economic recession, deterioration of the non-investment grade debt markets, possible downgrades and payment defaults of interest and/or principal. Non-investment grade debt prices tend to fluctuate more than higher rated debt and are affected by short-term credit developments to a greater degree.

				BDCs and REITs operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities, and REITs and BDCs must raise additional capital to grow because they distribute most of their income.

                    0.500%
                



The table above shows the initial offering period sales charges. Percentages are based on a $10.00 per unit offering price. For unit prices other than $10.00, percentages of initial sales charge, creation and development fee, and deferred sales charge will vary. The maximum sales charge is comprised of the initial sales charge, creation and development fee and deferred sales charge. The Trust is also subject to annual operating expenses and organization costs, which are not included in the sales charges. The creation and development fee is a charge of $0.05 per unit collected at the end of the initial offering period. If the price you pay exceeds $10.00 per unit, the creation and development fee will be less than 0.50%; if the price you pay is less than $10.00 per unit, the creation and development fee will exceed 0.50%. Investors will not be assessed the initial and deferred sales charge for eligible fee-based accounts and must purchase units utilizing a Fee CUSIP. Please see the prospectus for sales charge details.


Risk Considerations
There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. You can lose money investing in this trust. This trust terminates approximately two years from the initial date of deposit.

Investing in the trust units may involve a high degree of risk and is highly speculative and aggressive, and therefore an investment in trust units may not be suitable for someone with low risk tolerance.

Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer’s board of directors and the amount of any issuer’s dividend may vary from time to time.

Investing in foreign securities involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the United States. This may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries, U.S. or foreign tax treatment, and the potential lack of liquidity, government supervision and regulation.

Stocks of small companies are often more volatile than those of larger companies as a result of several factors such as limited trading volumes, products or financial resources, management inexperience and less publicly available information.

A portfolio concentrated in a single market sector may present more risk than a portfolio broadly diversified over several sectors. This trust is concentrated in the consumer products sectors. Some of the general risks of companies in the consumer products sectors include cyclicality of revenues and earnings, economic recession, currency fluctuations, changing consumer tastes, extensive competition, product liability litigation and increased government regulation.

No one can predict whether oil and natural gas prices will rise or fall in the future. This may have an adverse impact on the value of certain securities in the Trust and on the value of your units. Oil and natural gas prices are strongly affected by oil and gas supply and demand, government regulations and policies, oil and gas production and conservation efforts, and technological change. The oil and gas industry is cyclical and from time to time may experience a shortage of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, or qualified personnel, or due to significant demand, such as services, may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. Prices and supplies of oil and gas may fluctuate significantly over short and long periods of time due to national and international charges, OPEC policies, changes in relationships among OPEC members, and between OPEC and oil importing nations, the regulatory environment, taxation policies, and the economies of key energy-consuming countries. Disruptions in the oil subindustry or shifts in energy consumption may significantly impact oil and gas prices.

LIQ is the Liquidation Price.  Represents the value per unit that a unitholder would receive if the unitholder redeemed or sold units.  This price is equal to the net asset value per unit plus any remaining organization costs and creation & development fee.  This price reflects any remaining non-contingent deferred sales charges payable in connection with a liquidation of units.
Past performance is no indication of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. Units when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost. 
This page contains historical pricing or historical distributions information for the unit investment trust listed above. It should not be used for federal or state tax purposes, please contact your financial advisor for tax information.




Risk Considerations
There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. You can lose money investing in this trust. This trust terminates approximately two years from the initial date of deposit.

Investing in the trust units may involve a high degree of risk and is highly speculative and aggressive, and therefore an investment in trust units may not be suitable for someone with low risk tolerance.

Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer’s board of directors and the amount of any issuer’s dividend may vary from time to time.

Investing in foreign securities involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the United States. This may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries, U.S. or foreign tax treatment, and the potential lack of liquidity, government supervision and regulation.

Stocks of small companies are often more volatile than those of larger companies as a result of several factors such as limited trading volumes, products or financial resources, management inexperience and less publicly available information.

A portfolio concentrated in a single market sector may present more risk than a portfolio broadly diversified over several sectors. This trust is concentrated in the consumer products sectors. Some of the general risks of companies in the consumer products sectors include cyclicality of revenues and earnings, economic recession, currency fluctuations, changing consumer tastes, extensive competition, product liability litigation and increased government regulation.

No one can predict whether oil and natural gas prices will rise or fall in the future. This may have an adverse impact on the value of certain securities in the Trust and on the value of your units. Oil and natural gas prices are strongly affected by oil and gas supply and demand, government regulations and policies, oil and gas production and conservation efforts, and technological change. The oil and gas industry is cyclical and from time to time may experience a shortage of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, or qualified personnel, or due to significant demand, such as services, may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. Prices and supplies of oil and gas may fluctuate significantly over short and long periods of time due to national and international charges, OPEC policies, changes in relationships among OPEC members, and between OPEC and oil importing nations, the regulatory environment, taxation policies, and the economies of key energy-consuming countries. Disruptions in the oil subindustry or shifts in energy consumption may significantly impact oil and gas prices.

Returns With Transactional Sales Charge reflect the maximum transactional sales charge that would be payable by an investor upon sale or redemption of units at the end of the applicable period(s). The transactional sales charge includes any initial or deferred sales charges other than the creation and development fee. These returns do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment by a trust.

Returns Without Transactional Sales Charge do not reflect any transactional sales charge and do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment by a trust.
Returns are cumulative total returns (not annualized) unless labeled as average annual returns.  Distribution Received in Cash returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume income and principal distributions are paid out in cash on the payable date.  Distributions Reinvested returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume income and principal distributions are reinvested on the reinvestment date.

Past performance is no indication of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. Units when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost.

All returns are historical and do not represent potential future performance.  A trust’s performance, especially for short time periods, should not be the sole factor in making your investment decision.

Data used for the Portfolio Holdings and Portfolio Allocation Characteristics is from Bloomberg Finance L.P. Portfolio holdings are provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell individual securities. Portfolio Holdings and Portfolio Allocation Characteristics are as of deposit day and are subject to change and may vary thereafter.
The style and capitalization characteristics are designed to help investors understand how they fit into an overall investment plan. Value, blend and growth are types of investment styles. Growth Investing generally seeks stocks that offer the potential for greater-than-average earnings growth, and may entail greater risk than value or blend investing. Value investing generally seeks stocks that may be sound investments but are temporarily out of favor in the marketplace, and may entail less risk than growth investing. A blend investment combines the two styles. Market capitalization is determined by the following criteria: Large Cap: Greater than $10 billion, Mid Cap: $2 billion-$10 billion, Small Cap: $250 million-$2 billion Micro Cap: Below $250 million.


Risk Considerations
There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. You can lose money investing in this trust. This trust terminates approximately two years from the initial date of deposit.

Investing in the trust units may involve a high degree of risk and is highly speculative and aggressive, and therefore an investment in trust units may not be suitable for someone with low risk tolerance.

Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer’s board of directors and the amount of any issuer’s dividend may vary from time to time.

Investing in foreign securities involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the United States. This may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries, U.S. or foreign tax treatment, and the potential lack of liquidity, government supervision and regulation.

Stocks of small companies are often more volatile than those of larger companies as a result of several factors such as limited trading volumes, products or financial resources, management inexperience and less publicly available information.

A portfolio concentrated in a single market sector may present more risk than a portfolio broadly diversified over several sectors. This trust is concentrated in the consumer products sectors. Some of the general risks of companies in the consumer products sectors include cyclicality of revenues and earnings, economic recession, currency fluctuations, changing consumer tastes, extensive competition, product liability litigation and increased government regulation.

No one can predict whether oil and natural gas prices will rise or fall in the future. This may have an adverse impact on the value of certain securities in the Trust and on the value of your units. Oil and natural gas prices are strongly affected by oil and gas supply and demand, government regulations and policies, oil and gas production and conservation efforts, and technological change. The oil and gas industry is cyclical and from time to time may experience a shortage of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, or qualified personnel, or due to significant demand, such as services, may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. Prices and supplies of oil and gas may fluctuate significantly over short and long periods of time due to national and international charges, OPEC policies, changes in relationships among OPEC members, and between OPEC and oil importing nations, the regulatory environment, taxation policies, and the economies of key energy-consuming countries. Disruptions in the oil subindustry or shifts in energy consumption may significantly impact oil and gas prices.

Income distributions will vary with changes in dividends or interest received on the underlying securities and with changes in the trust's fees and expenses. Principal distributions will be made only when the trust receives principal cash and will therefore vary. Both income and principal distributions may be affected by the sale of securities in the portfolio. See the prospectus for a more detailed description of the factors which could affect income and principal distributions.

Principal Investment Strategy
The trust invests in equity securities of issuers that may be well positioned to benefit directly from current cyclical opportunities such as a period of lower oil prices. Such companies identified operate within
multiple industries including airlines, chemicals, auto components, retail, and oil refining.


Prospect Capital Management L.P.
The portfolio is designed by Prospect Capital Management L.P. (“Prospect”), an SEC-registered investment advisor with over 26 years of experience (along with its predecessors and affiliates). Prospect currently manages Prospect Capital Corporation, a publicly-traded Business Development Corporation with $6.33 billion of investments across 130 investment counterparties as of December 31, 2015.


Cyclical Momentum Portfolio Opportunities

Capital Appreciation Potential: Market opportunities arising from the primary and the secondary side effects of lower oil prices may present a compelling profit driver for select companies identified.
Sector Diversification: Immediate access to multiple sectors that may possess attractive tailwinds to a prolonged oil and natural gas price compression environment.
Industry Fundamentals: Concentrated mix of companies that may save on their own energy costs or companies that cater to consumers who might be inclined to spend money saved on lower energy prices.

Thematic Catalysts

Selection criteria is focused on businesses that may benefit from a sustained period of lower oil prices.
Reduced oil prices may create meaningful cost efficiencies or spur greater sales volumes and maximize profits of companies in the portfolio.
Increased oil production and slower consumption have coincided with the price of WTI crude falling over 60% from its high of $107/bbl in June 2014.1
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) reduced its forecast for oil prices and now expects WTI crude oil to average $34/bbl in 2016 imputing a continued extension of depressed oil prices.2
Sustained lower prices are a net plus for the economy, which derives 68% of GDP from consumer spending.3
Lower oil prices may act as a tax cut for consumers as every one cent drop in gas prices has the potential to create $1 billion in discretionary spending in the U.S. economy.4
Cost-structures heavily levered to fuel costs may also stand to benefit from improved profit margins.

1. LIQ is the Liquidation Price.  Represents the value per unit that a unitholder would receive if the unitholder redeemed or sold units.  This price is equal to the net asset value per unit plus any remaining organization costs and creation & development fee.  This price reflects any remaining non-contingent deferred sales charges payable in connection with a liquidation of units.
2. There is no guarantee that any distributions will be made.  The estimated net annual income is per unit as of deposit day and based on the most recently declared dividends, distributions or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes of the portfolio’s holdings.  The actual net annual income distributions you receive will vary from the estimate with changes in the portfolio’s fees and expenses, income received, currency fluctuations, and with the call, redemption, maturity, or sale of securities. 
3. The historical annual dividend distribution was calculated as of the day of deposit based on the trailing 12-month dividends or distributions paid by each issuer of securities in the trust portfolio and is net of the deferred sales charge and operating expenses charged by the trust. The trailing 12-month dividend for each issuer includes net dividend amounts for all fixed schedule dividends that have been declared over the past 12 months, excluding special distributions like special cash and return of capital, taxes, any related dividend fees and tax related credits. The amount of distributions you receive will vary from the above-stated amount due to changes in the dividends or distributions paid by issuers, changes in the trust's fees and expenses, income received, currency fluctuations, and with the call, redemption, maturity or sale of portfolio securities. Fees and expenses of the trust may vary as a result of the trust's size, redemption activity, brokerage and other transaction costs and extraordinary expenses among other factors.

TRUST SUMMARY AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS




THE TRUST



Arizona Insured Trust 62 (the "Trust") consists of a portfolio of
interest-bearing obligations issued by or on behalf of the State of Arizona,
certain United States Territories or authorities and political subdivisions
thereof which, in the opinion of recognized bond counsel to the issuing
authorities, provide income which is exempt from Federal income tax and Arizona
income tax, to the extent indicated below.



INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES



The objectives of the Trust are income exempt from Federal and state income
taxes, and conservation of capital. The objectives are, of course, dependent
upon the continuing ability of the issuers, obligors and/or insurers to meet
their respective obligations.



THE PORTFOLIO



The Portfolio of the Trust consists of 7 obligations issued by entities
located in Arizona. The bonds in the Trust are either general obligations of the
governmental entity issuing them and are backed by the taxing power thereof or
are payable as to principal and interest from the income of a specific project
or authority and are not supported by the issuer's power to levy taxes. The
sources of payment for the bonds are divided as follows:








   NUMBER OF                                              PORTFOLIO
    ISSUES                PURPOSE OF ISSUE                PERCENTAGE
---------------  ----------------------------------------------------
       2         Health Care Facility Revenue                    28.6%
       2         Education Revenue                               28.5
       1         Dedicated-Tax Supported Revenue                 14.3
       1         Multi-Family Housing Revenue                    14.3
       1         Transportation                                  14.3








All of the bonds in the Trust are covered by policies of insurance obtained
from the MBIA Insurance Corporation guaranteeing payment of principal and
interest when due. As a result of such insurance, the bonds in the Trust have
received a rating of "Aaa" by Moody's, "AAA" by Fitch, and/or "AAA" by Standard
& Poor's. Insurance does not guarantee the market value of the bonds or of Trust
Units.

NOTES TO ESSENTIAL INFORMATION:



BECAUSE CERTAIN OF THE BONDS IN THE TRUST WILL NOT BE DELIVERED TO THE TRUSTEE
UNTIL AFTER THE SETTLEMENT DATE FOR A PURCHASE OF UNITS MADE ON THE DATE OF
DEPOSIT, INTEREST THAT ACCRUES ON THOSE BONDS BETWEEN THE DATE OF DEPOSIT AND
SUCH DELIVERY DATE WILL BE TREATED AS A RETURN OF PRINCIPAL RATHER THAN AS
TAX-EXEMPT INCOME. THE AMOUNT OF ANY SUCH RETURN OF PRINCIPAL IS NOT INCLUDED IN
THE ANNUAL INTEREST INCOME SHOWN ABOVE. FOR THE TRUST, THE FOLLOWING SETS FORTH




THE LATEST SCHEDULED BOND DELIVERY DATE, THE AMOUNT PER UNIT THAT WILL BE
TREATED AS A RETURN OF PRINCIPAL TO UNITHOLDERS WHO PURCHASE ON THE DATE OF
DEPOSIT, AND THE ESTIMATED CURRENT RETURN UNDER THE MONTHLY DISTRIBUTION PLAN
AFTER THE FIRST YEAR, ASSUMING THE PORTFOLIO AND ESTIMATED ANNUAL EXPENSES DO
NOT VARY FROM THAT SET FORTH ABOVE (SEE "WHAT ARE NORMAL TRUST OPERATING
EXPENSES?" IN PART B OF THIS PROSPECTUS AND THE "SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS"). THE
ESTIMATED CURRENT RETURN AFTER THE FIRST YEAR WILL ALSO BE HIGHER UNDER THE
QUARTERLY AND SEMI-ANNUAL DISTRIBUTION PLANS:






                                 LATEST SCHEDULED         PER UNIT         ESTIMATED CURRENT RETURN
                                  DELIVERY DATE     RETURN OF PRINCIPAL      AFTER THE FIRST YEAR
                                ------------------  --------------------   -------------------------
ARIZONA INSURED TRUST.........   NOVEMBER 9, 1999   $          .03                              5.31%








(1) A portion of the Public Offering Price consists of an amount sufficient to
reimburse the Sponsor for all or a portion of the costs of establishing the
Trust. These costs have been estimated at $.25000 per Unit for the Trust. A
payment will be made as of the earlier of six months after the Initial Date
of Deposit or the end of the initial offering period to an account
maintained by the Trustee from which the obligations of the investors to the
Sponsor are dispensed. To the extent that actual organization costs are
greater than the estimated amount, only the estimated organization costs
added to the Public Offering Price will be reimbursed to the Sponsor and
deducted from the assets of the Trust.


(2) Units are offered at the Public Offering Price plus accrued interest from
the preceding Record Date to, but not including, the date of settlement
(normally three business days after purchase). The Date of Deposit of the
Fund has been designated as the First Record Date for all plans of
distribution of the Trust and, accordingly, for Units purchased on the Date
of Deposit, $.04 of accrued interest to the Settlement Date will be added to
the Public Offering Price. (See "WHAT IS ACCRUED INTEREST?" in Part B of
this Prospectus.) The evaluation time for purpose of sale, purchase or
redemption of Units is 4 p.m. Eastern time or as of any earlier time at
which the New York Stock Exchange closes. (See "HOW IS THE PUBLIC OFFERING
PRICE DETERMINED?" in Part B of this Prospectus.)


(3) The Average Maturity of bonds in the Trust is calculated based upon the
stated maturities of the bonds in the Trust (or, with respect to bonds for
which funds or securities have been placed in escrow to redeem such bonds on
a stated call date, based upon such call date). The Average Maturity of
bonds in the Trust may increase or decrease from time to time as bonds
mature or are called or sold.


(4) Assumes delivery of all bonds. (See "COMPOSITION OF TRUSTS" appearing in
Part B of this Prospectus.) Interest income does not include accretion of
original issue discount on "zero coupon" bonds, Stripped Obligations or
other original issue discount bonds. (See "SUMMARY OF PORTFOLIOS" in Part B
of this Prospectus.)


(5) The amount and timing of interest distributions from the Trust under the
various plans of distribution are set forth below. It is anticipated that
the amount of interest to be distributed per Unit in each year under each
plan of distribution will initially be substantially equal to the Estimated
Net Annual Interest Income per Unit for that plan. The amount of interest to
be distributed annually per Unit, will generally change as bonds are
redeemed, mature or are sold or as fees and expenses increase or decrease.


(6) Estimated Long Term Return for the Trust represents the average of the
yields to maturity (or call) of the bonds in the Trust's portfolio
calculated in accordance with accepted bond practices and adjusted to
reflect a compounding factor, expenses and sales charges. Estimated Current
Return is computed by dividing the Net Annual Interest Income per Unit by
the Public Offering Price, and in contrast to Estimated Long Term Return
does not reflect the amortization of premium or accretion of discount, if
any. For more information see "WHAT ARE ESTIMATED LONG TERM RETURN AND
ESTIMATED CURRENT RETURN?" in Part B of this Prospectus.


(7) Each Trustee annual fee is per $1,000 principal amount of the underlying
bonds in the Trust for that portion of the Trust that represents a
particular plan of distribution.


(8) The Sponsor's Annual Evaluation Fee may, from time to time, be adjusted
provided that the total adjustment upward does not, at the time of such
adjustment, exceed the percentage of the total increase, after the date
hereof, in consumer prices for services as measured by the United States
Department of Labor Consumer Price Index entitled "All Services Less Rent"
or if such index no longer exists, a comparable index. The consent or
concurrence of any Unitholder shall not be required for any such adjustment
or increase.

RISK FACTORS



Risk is inherent in all investing. Investing in a unit trust involves risk,
including the risk that you may receive little or no return on your investment
or even that you may lose part or all of your investment. Therefore, before
investing you should consider carefully the following risks that you assume when
you invest in this Trust. Because of these and other risks, the Trust should
only represent a portion of your overall portfolio and you should consider an
investment in the Trust to be a part of a longer term investment strategy that
will provide the best results when followed over a number of years. There is no
guarantee that the Trust will achieve its investment objective.


MARKET RISK: the risk that the market value of a bond or the Trust may
change rapidly and unpredictably, causing the bond or the Trust to be worth less
than its original price. Volatility in the market price of the bonds in the
Trust changes the value of the Units of the Trust. Market value may be affected
by a variety of factors including, among others, changes in the perceptions
about the issuers, changes in interest rates or inflation, changes in the
ratings of the issuers or changes in the financial condition of the issuers of
the bonds. Because the Trust is not managed, bonds in the Trust will generally
not be sold in response to market fluctuations, although bonds may be sold in
certain limited circumstances. Accordingly, an investor in the Trust may be
exposed to more market risk than an investor in certain managed investment
vehicles.


INFLATION RISK: the risk that the value of assets or income from investments
will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As
inflation increases, the value of the Trust's assets can decline as can the
value of the Trust's distributions.


INTEREST RATE RISK: the risk that bonds will decline in value because of a
rise in interest rates. Generally, bonds will increase in value when interest
rates decline and decrease in value when interest rates rise. Typically, bonds
with longer periods before maturity are more sensitive to interest rate changes.


CREDIT RISK: the risk that an issuer of a bond or an insurer is unable to
meet its obligation to make interest and principal payments.


CALL RISK: the risk that bonds can be prepaid or "called" by the issuer
before their stated maturity. If bonds are called, your income will decline and
you may not be able to reinvest the money you receive at as high a yield. Also,
an early call at par of a premium bond will reduce your return. Bonds in the
Trust are more likely to be called when interest rates decline. This would
result in early returns of principal to you and may result in early termination
of the Trust. The dates and prices upon which the bonds are first subject to
optional calls are provided in "Schedule of Investments." The bonds may also be
subject to special or extraordinary call provisions and "mandatory put" features
that may cause the bonds to be removed from the Trust prior to maturity.


LIQUIDITY RISK: the risk that the value of the bonds may be reduced if
trading in the bonds is limited or absent. Because the bonds will generally
trade in the over-the-counter market, there can be no assurance that a liquid
trading market will exist.


BOND QUALITY RISK: the risk that a reduction in a bond's rating may decrease
its value and the value of your investment in the Trust.


REDUCED DIVERSIFICATION RISK: the risk that the diversification of your
investment is reduced as bonds in the Trust are called, sold or mature. This
reduction in diversification may increase the risk of loss and increase your
share of Trust expenses.


LITIGATION AND LEGISLATION RISKS: the risk that future litigation or
legislation could affect the value of the Trust. In particular, future tax
legislation could affect the value of the Trust by reducing tax rates, imposing
a flat or other form of tax, exempting investment income from tax or changing
the tax status of the bonds.


5





YEAR 2000 RISK: Like other investment companies, financial and business
organizations and individuals around the world the Trust could be adversely
affected if the computer systems used by the Sponsor or Trustee or other service
providers to the Trust do not properly process and calculate date-related
information and data from and after January 1, 2000. This is commonly known as
the "Year 2000 Problem." The Sponsor and Trustee are taking steps that they
believe are reasonably designed to address the Year 2000 Problem with respect to
computer systems that they use and to obtain reasonable assurances that
comparable steps are being taken by the Trust's other service providers. At this
time, however, there can be no assurance that these steps will be sufficient to
avoid any adverse impact to the Trust.


The Year 2000 Problem is expected to impact corporations and other parties,
which may include issuers of the bonds contained in the Trust, to varying
degrees based upon various factors, including, but not limited to, their
industry sector and degree of technological sophistication. The Sponsor is
unable to predict what impact, if any, the Year 2000 Problem will have on
issuers or insurers of the bonds contained in the Trust.


CONCENTRATION RISK: the risk that the Trust is less diversified, and
therefore subject to greater risk of loss, because the Trust is concentrated in
a certain type of bond. Typically, when a certain type of bond makes up 25% or
more of the portfolio, the Trust is considered to be "concentrated" in that bond
type.


The Trust is considered to be concentrated in bonds of Health Care Facility
Revenue Issuers whose revenues are subject to certain risks including increased
governmental regulation, fluctuating occupancy levels and increased competition.
In addition, the Trust is considered to be concentrated in bonds of Education
Revenue Issuers whose revenues are subject to certain risks including declines
in "college age" individuals and the possible inability to raise tuition and
fees.


The Trust is concentrated in the bonds of issuers located in the State of
Arizona. Such concentration may expose Unitholders to additional risks. The
financial condition of the State of Arizona is affected by various national and
local, economic, social and environmental policies and conditions and may have
an effect on the value of the Units. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory
limitations imposed on the State and its local governments concerning taxes,
bond indebtedness and other matters may constrain the revenue-generating
capacity of the State and its local governments and, therefore, the ability of
the issuers of the bonds to satisfy their obligations. Historically, the State
has experienced significant revenue shortfalls.


The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and, therefore,
the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the bonds, are
affected by numerous factors. The economy of the State continues to be dependent
on services, tourism and manufacturing. These sectors tend to be cyclical. In
1986, the value of Arizona real estate began a steady decline, reflecting a
market which had been overbuilt in the previous decade with a resulting surplus
of completed inventory. This decline adversely affected both the construction
industry and those Arizona financial institutions which had aggressively pursued
many facets of real estate lending. In the near future, Arizona's financial
institutions are likely to continue to experience problems until the excess
inventories of commercial and residential properties are resolved.


The State is a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final decision
could materially affect the State's governmental operations and consequently its
ability to pay debt service on its obligations.


Further information concerning the various types of bonds contained in the
Trust is available in "SUMMARY OF PORTFOLIOS" in Part B of the Prospectus. An
additional discussion of potential risks may be obtained upon written or
telephonic request to the Trustee as described in "OTHER
INFORMATION--Supplemental Information" appearing in Part B of this Prospectus.



TAX STATUS



For a discussion of the Federal tax status of income earned on Trust Units,
see "WHAT IS THE TAX STATUS OF UNITHOLDERS?" in Part B of this Prospectus.


The assets of the Trust will consist of interest-bearing obligations issued
by or on behalf of the State of Arizona (the "State"), its political
subdivisions and authorities (the "Arizona Bonds"), and certain bonds issued by
Puerto Rico authorities (the "Possession Bonds") (collectively the Arizona Bonds
and Possession Bonds shall be referred to herein as the "Bonds"), provided the
interest on such Bonds received by the Trust is exempt from State income taxes.


Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel have independently examined the Bonds to
be deposited in and held in the Trust. However, although no opinion is expressed
herein regarding such matters, it is assumed that: (i) the Bonds were validly
issued, (ii) the interest thereon is excludable from gross income for federal
income tax purposes and (iii) interest on the Bonds, if received directly by a
Unitholder would be exempt from the Arizona income tax (the "Arizona Income
Tax"). We have assumed that at the respective times of issuance of the Bonds,
opinions relating to the validity thereof and to the exemption of interest
thereon from Federal income tax were rendered by bond counsel to the respective
issuing authorities. In addition, with respect to the Arizona Bonds, bond
counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions that the interest on the
Bonds is exempt from the Arizona Income Tax. Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel
has made any review for the Trust of the proceedings relating to the issuance of
the Bonds or of the bases for the opinions rendered in connection therewith.


6





In the opinion of Chapman and Cutler counsel to the Sponsor, under existing
law:


For Arizona income tax purposes, each Unitholder will be treated as the
owner of a pro rata portion of the Trust, and the income of the Trust
therefore will be treated as the income of the Unitholder under State law.


For Arizona income tax purposes, interest on the Arizona Bonds which is
excludable from Federal gross income and which is exempt from Arizona income
taxes when received by the Trust, and which would be excludable from Federal
gross income and exempt from Arizona income taxes if received directly by a
Unitholder, will retain its status as tax-exempt interest when received by
the Trust and distributed to the Unitholders.


To the extent that interest derived from the Trust by a Unitholder with
respect to the Arizona Bonds is excludable from Federal gross income, such
interest will not be subject to Arizona income taxes.


Interest on the Possession Bonds which is excludible from gross income
for federal income tax purposes and is exempt from state and local taxation
pursuant to federal law when received by the Trust will be exempt from
Arizona income taxation and therefore will not be includible in the income
of the Unitholders for income tax purposes when distributed by the Trust and
received by the Unitholders.


Each Unitholder will receive taxable gain or loss for Arizona income tax
purposes when Bonds held in the Trust are sold, exchanged, redeemed or paid
at maturity, or when the Unitholder redeems or sells Units, at a price that
differs from original cost as adjusted for amortization of Bond discount or
premium and other basis adjustments, including any basis reduction that may
be required to reflect a Unitholder's share of interest, if any, accruing on
Bonds during the interval between the Unitholder's settlement date and the
date such Bonds are delivered to the Trust, if later.


Amounts paid by the Insurer under an insurance policy or policies issued
to the Trust, if any, with respect to the Bonds in the Trust which represent
maturing interest on defaulted Bonds held by the Trustee will be exempt from
State income taxes if, and to the same extent as, such interest would have
been so exempt if paid by the issuer of the defaulted Bonds provided that,
at the time such policies are purchased, the amounts paid for such policies
are reasonable, customary and consistent with the reasonable expectation
that the issuer of the Bonds, rather than the insurer, will pay debt service
on the Bonds.


Arizona law does not permit a deduction for interest paid or incurred on
indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry Units in the Trust,
the interest on which is exempt from Arizona income taxes. Special rules
apply to financial institutions, and such institutions should consult their
own tax advisors with respect to deductions of interest.


Neither the Bonds nor the Units will be subject to Arizona property
taxes, sales tax or use tax.


Chapman and Cutler has expressed no opinion with respect to taxation
under any other provision of Arizona law. Ownership of the Units may result
in collateral Arizona tax consequences to certain taxpayers. Prospective
investors should consult their tax advisors as to the applicability of any
such collateral consequences.



VOLUME INCENTIVES



The Sponsor has made substantial enhancements to the volume incentive
program for dealer firms currently described in Part B of this Prospectus. The
following information replaces any discussion of volume incentives in Part B.
Volume incentives can be earned as a marketing allowance by eligible dealer
firms who reach cumulative firm sales or sales arrangement levels of a specified
dollar amount of Nuveen unit trusts (other than any series of the Nuveen--The
Dow 5-SM- Portfolios and Nuveen--The Dow 10-SM- Portfolios) sold in the primary
or secondary market during any quarter as set forth in the table below. Eligible
dealer firms are dealers that are providing marketing support for Nuveen unit
trusts in the form of 1) distributing or permitting the distribution of
marketing materials and other product information, 2) providing Nuveen
representatives access to the dealer's branch offices, and 3) generally
facilitating the placement of orders by the dealer's registered representatives
such as putting Nuveen unit trusts on their order entry screens. Eligible firms
will not include firms that solely provide clearing services to broker/dealer
firms. For purposes of determining the applicable volume incentive rate for a
given quarter, the dollar amount of all units sold over the current and three
previous quarters (the "Measuring Period") is aggregated. The volume incentive
received by the dealer firm will equal the dollar amount of units sold during
the current quarter times the highest applicable rate for the Measuring Period.
For firms that meet the necessary volume level, volume incentives may be given
on all applicable trades originated from or by that firm.








       TOTAL DOLLAR AMOUNT SOLD
         OVER MEASURING PERIOD                          VOLUME INCENTIVE
---------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------
$ 5,000,000 to $ 9,999,999               0.10% of current quarter sales
$10,000,000 to $19,999,999               0.125% of current quarter sales
$20,000,000 to $49,999,999               0.1375% of current quarter sales
$50,000,000 or more                      0.15% of current quarter sales








7





Only sales through the Sponsor qualify for volume incentives and for meeting
minimum requirements. The Sponsor reserves the right to modify or change the
volume incentive schedule at any time and make the determination as to which
firms qualify for the marketing allowance and the amount paid.



PURCHASE PROGRAMS



Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Part B of the Prospectus:


1.  Units may NOT be purchased at the Public Offering Price without a
sales charge by officers or directors and by bona fide, full-time employees
of Nuveen, Nuveen Advisory Corp., Nuveen Institutional Advisory Corp.,
Rittenhouse Financial Services, Inc. and The John Nuveen Company, including
in each case these individuals and their immediate family members (as
defined in this Prospectus).


2.  Units may be purchased in the primary market with sales charges of
1.70% of the Public Offering Price for National and State Long Term Trusts,
1.35% of the Public Offering Price for Long Intermediate Trusts, 1.20% of
the Public Offering Price for National and State Intermediate Trusts, 1.0%
of the Public Offering Price for National and State Short Intermediate
Trusts and 1.0% of the Public Offering Price for Short Term Trusts by:

(1) investors who purchase Units through registered investment advisers,
certified financial planners and registered broker-dealers who in each case
either charge periodic fees for financial planning, investment advisory or
asset management services, or provide such services in connection with the
establishment of an investment account for which a comprehensive "wrap fee"
charge is imposed, (2) bank trust departments investing funds over which
they exercise exclusive discretionary investment authority and that are held
in a fiduciary, agency, custodial or similar capacity; (3) any person who
for at least 90 days, has been an officer, director or bona fide employee of
any firm offering Units for sale to investors, (4) officers and directors of
bank holding companies that make Units available directly or through
subsidiaries or bank affiliates, (5) officers or directors and bona fide,
full-time employees of Nuveen, Nuveen Advisory Corp., Nuveen Institutional
Advisory Corp., Rittenhouse Financial Services, Inc., and The John Nuveen
Company, including in each case these individuals and their spouses, minor
children, and parents, however, purchases by parents must be made through a
registered broker-dealer, and (6) any person who for at least 90 days, has
been an officer, director or bona fide employee of any vendor who provides
services to the Sponsor and who purchases Units through a registered
broker-dealer (collectively, the "Discounted Purchases"). In addition, such
investors may purchase Units in the secondary market at the Public Offering
Price for non-breakpoint purchases minus the concession the Sponsor
typically allows to brokers and dealers for non-breakpoint purchases.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Prospectus, investors who
purchase Units as described in this paragraph will not receive sales charge
reductions for quantity purchases.



ORGANIZATION EXPENSES



You will bear all or a portion of the expenses incurred in organizing your
Trust including the costs of preparing the registration statement, the trust
indenture and other closing documents, registering Units with the Securities and
Exchange Commission and states, the initial audit of the Trust portfolio, the
initial evaluation, legal fees, the initial fees and expenses of the Trustee and
any nonmaterial out-of-pocket expenses. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in Part B of the Prospectus:


1.  During the period ending with the earlier of six months after the
Initial Date of Deposit or the end of the initial offering period, the
Public Offering Price includes organization costs incurred in establishing
your Trust. The Trustee will deduct these expenses from your Trust at the
close of this period. Also during this period, the price at which the
Sponsor expects to repurchase Units and the redemption price per Unit
include estimated organization costs. After this period, the Sponsor's
repurchase price and the redemption price per Unit do not include these
costs.


2.  If bonds are purchased with the portion of the Public Offering Price
intended to be used to reimburse the Sponsor for the Trust's organization
costs, the bonds will be purchased in the same proportionate relationship as
all the bonds contained in the Trust. These bonds will be sold to reimburse
the Sponsor for the Trust's organization costs at the earlier of six months
after the Initial Date of Deposit or the end of the initial offering period.
Also, any cash received for these purposes will be paid to the Sponsor at
the earlier of six months after the Initial Date of Deposit or the end of
the initial offering period. The bonds may decrease in value during this
period. If proceeds from the sale of these bonds or any cash reserved is
insufficient to repay the Sponsor for these costs, the Trustee will sell
additional bonds. If this occurs, the net asset value per Unit will be
reduced by the amount of additional bonds sold. Although the dollar amount
of the Sponsor's reimbursement will remain fixed and never exceed the amount
per Unit set forth under "Statement of Condition" herein, this will result
in a greater effective cost per Unit to you. When bonds are sold to
reimburse the Sponsor for organization costs, the Trustee will sell the
bonds to maintain the same proportionate relationship among the bonds
contained in the Trust that existed prior to the sale.


3.  The Sponsor deducts unpaid organization costs when determining the
value of the Trust.

* These bonds, or a portion thereof, have delivery dates beyond the normal
settlement date. Their expected delivery date is November 9, 1999. Contracts
relating to bonds with delivery dates after the date of settlement for
purchase made on the Date of Deposit constitute approximately 14% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Trust. (See "COMPOSITION OF TRUSTS" in Part
B of this Prospectus.)




(1) The Sponsor's contracts to purchase bonds were entered into during the
period from October 20, 1999 to October 22, 1999. Other information regarding
the bonds in the Trust on the Date of Deposit is as follows:








                                                         PROFIT (OR

In addition, the difference between the Trustee's determination of Offering
Price and Bid Price (as a percentage of principal amount) is .40%. Neither cost
to Sponsor nor profit (or loss) to Sponsor reflects underwriting profits or
losses received or incurred by the Sponsor through its participation in
underwriting syndicates. The Sponsor did not participate as either the sole
underwriter or as a manager or member of a syndicate that acted as the original
underwriter of any of the bonds.


(2) The bonds are first subject to optional redemption in the years, and at
the prices, shown. Unless otherwise indicated, the bonds, except for bonds
issued at a substantial original issue discount, are redeemable at declining
prices (but not below par value) in subsequent years. Original issue discount
bonds, including zero coupon bonds, are generally redeemable at prices based on
the issue price plus the amount of original issue discount accreted to
redemption plus, if applicable, some premium, the amount of which will decline
in subsequent years. The bonds may also be subject to sinking fund redemption
without premium prior to the dates shown. Certain bonds may be subject to
redemption without premium prior to the date shown pursuant to special or
mandatory call provisions specified in the instruments setting forth the terms
and provisions of such bonds. See "Risk Factors" herein and "COMPOSITION OF
TRUSTS" and "WHAT IS THE TAX STATUS OF UNITHOLDERS?" in Part B of this

Prospectus.


(3) All the bonds in the Insured Trusts, as insured by the Insurer, are
rated AAA by Standard & Poor's, AAA by Fitch and/or Aaa by Moody's. The
insurance obtained by the Trust guarantees the payment of interest and principal
on the bonds when due but does not cover certain market risks associated with
fixed income securities such as accelerated payments, premiums payable on
mandatory redemptions or interest rate risks. (See "WHY AND HOW ARE THE BONDS
INSURED?" in Part B of this Prospectus and "Description of Ratings" in the
Information Supplement.)

any cash deposited exceeds the amount necessary for the purchase of the
bonds plus accrued interest to the Date of Deposit. At the Date of Deposit,
bonds may have been delivered to the Sponsor pursuant to certain of these
contracts; the Sponsor has assigned to the Trustee all of its rights, title
and interest in and to such bonds.


(2) Aggregate value (at offering prices) as of the Date of Deposit of the bonds
listed under "Schedule of Investments" herein, and their aggregate cost to
the Trust are the same. Such offering prices were determined by Kenny S&P
Evaluation Services, a division of J. J. Kenny Co., Inc., as of the close of
business on the business day prior to the Date of Deposit. (See "HOW WAS THE
PRICE OF THE BONDS DETERMINED AT THE DATE OF DEPOSIT?" in Part B of this
Prospectus.) Insurance coverage providing for the timely payment, when due,
of all principal of and interest on the bonds in an Insured Trust has been
obtained by the Sponsor or by the issuers of such bonds. Such insurance does
not guarantee the market value of the bonds or the value of the Units. Both
the bid and the offering prices of the underlying bonds and of the Units may
include value attributable to such policies of insurance.


(3) A portion of the Public Offering Price consists of an amount sufficient to
reimburse the Sponsor for all or a portion of the costs of establishing the
Trust. These costs have been estimated at $.25000 per Unit for the Trust. A
payment will be made as of the earlier of six months after the Initial Date
of Deposit or the end of the initial offering period to an account
maintained by the Trustee from which the obligations of the investors to the
Sponsor are dispensed. To the extent that actual organization costs are
greater than the estimated amount, only the estimated organization costs
added to the Public Offering Price will be reimbursed to the Sponsor and
deducted from the assets of the Trust.


(4) Representing, as set forth in "WHAT IS ACCRUED INTEREST?" in Part B of this
Prospectus, advancement by the Trustee of an amount equal to the accrued
bond interest as of the Date of Deposit.


(5) Aggregate Public Offering Price (exclusive of accrued interest) computed as
set forth under "HOW IS THE PUBLIC OFFERING PRICE DETERMINED?" in Part B of
this Prospectus.


(6) The gross underwriting commission of 4.90% of the Public Offering Price has
been calculated on the assumption that the Units sold are not subject to a
reduction of sales charge for quantity purchases. In single transactions
involving 500 Units or more, the sales charge is reduced. (See "HOW IS THE
PUBLIC OFFERING PRICE DETERMINED?" in Part B of this Prospectus.)

TRUST SUMMARY AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS




THE TRUST



Colorado Insured Trust 82 (the "Trust") consists of a portfolio of
interest-bearing obligations issued by or on behalf of the State of Colorado,
certain United States Territories or authorities and political subdivisions
thereof which, in the opinion of recognized bond counsel to the issuing
authorities, provide income which is exempt from Federal income tax and Colorado
income tax, to the extent indicated below.



INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES



The objectives of the Trust are income exempt from Federal and state income
taxes, and conservation of capital. The objectives are, of course, dependent
upon the continuing ability of the issuers, obligors and/or insurers to meet
their respective obligations.



THE PORTFOLIO



The Portfolio of the Trust consists of 7 obligations issued by entities
located in Colorado. The bonds in the Trust are either general obligations of
the governmental entity issuing them and are backed by the taxing power thereof
or are payable as to principal and interest from the income of a specific
project or authority and are not supported by the issuer's power to levy taxes.
The sources of payment for the bonds are divided as follows:








   NUMBER OF                                              PORTFOLIO
    ISSUES                PURPOSE OF ISSUE                PERCENTAGE
---------------  ----------------------------------------------------
       3         Education Revenue                               42.8%
       1         Health Care Facility Revenue                    14.3
       1         Transportation                                  14.3
       1         Utilities                                       14.3
       1         Municipal Lease Revenue                         14.3








All of the bonds in the Trust are covered by policies of insurance obtained
from the MBIA Insurance Corporation guaranteeing payment of principal and
interest when due. As a result of such insurance, the bonds in the Trust have
received a rating of "Aaa" by Moody's, "AAA" by Fitch, and/or "AAA" by Standard
& Poor's. Insurance does not guarantee the market value of the bonds or of Trust
Units.

NOTES TO ESSENTIAL INFORMATION:



(1) A portion of the Public Offering Price consists of an amount sufficient to
reimburse the Sponsor for all or a portion of the costs of establishing the
Trust. These costs have been estimated at $.25000 per Unit for the Trust. A
payment will be made as of the earlier of six months after the Initial Date
of Deposit or the end of the initial offering period to an account
maintained by the Trustee from which the obligations of the investors to the
Sponsor are dispensed. To the extent that actual organization costs are
greater than the estimated amount, only the estimated organization costs
added to the Public Offering Price will be reimbursed to the Sponsor and
deducted from the assets of the Trust.


(2) Units are offered at the Public Offering Price plus accrued interest from
the preceding Record Date to, but not including, the date of settlement
(normally three business days after purchase). The Date of Deposit of the
Fund has been designated as the First Record Date for all plans of
distribution of the Trust and, accordingly, for Units purchased on the Date
of Deposit, $.04 of accrued interest to the Settlement Date will be added to
the Public Offering Price. (See "WHAT IS ACCRUED INTEREST?" in Part B of
this Prospectus.) The evaluation time for purpose of sale, purchase or
redemption of Units is 4 p.m. Eastern time or as of any earlier time at
which the New York Stock Exchange closes. (See "HOW IS THE PUBLIC OFFERING
PRICE DETERMINED?" in Part B of this Prospectus.)


(3) The Average Maturity of bonds in the Trust is calculated based upon the
stated maturities of the bonds in the Trust (or, with respect to bonds for
which funds or securities have been placed in escrow to redeem such bonds on
a stated call date, based upon such call date). The Average Maturity of
bonds in the Trust may increase or decrease from time to time as bonds
mature or are called or sold.


(4) Assumes delivery of all bonds. (See "COMPOSITION OF TRUSTS" appearing in
Part B of this Prospectus.) Interest income does not include accretion of
original issue discount on "zero coupon" bonds, Stripped Obligations or
other original issue discount bonds. (See "SUMMARY OF PORTFOLIOS" in Part B
of this Prospectus.)


(5) The amount and timing of interest distributions from the Trust under the
various plans of distribution are set forth below. It is anticipated that
the amount of interest to be distributed per Unit in each year under each
plan of distribution will initially be substantially equal to the Estimated
Net Annual Interest Income per Unit for that plan. The amount of interest to
be distributed annually per Unit, will generally change as bonds are
redeemed, mature or are sold or as fees and expenses increase or decrease.


(6) Estimated Long Term Return for the Trust represents the average of the
yields to maturity (or call) of the bonds in the Trust's portfolio
calculated in accordance with accepted bond practices and adjusted to
reflect a compounding factor, expenses and sales charges. Estimated Current
Return is computed by dividing the Net Annual Interest Income per Unit by
the Public Offering Price, and in contrast to Estimated Long Term Return
does not reflect the amortization of premium or accretion of discount, if
any. For more information see "WHAT ARE ESTIMATED LONG TERM RETURN AND
ESTIMATED CURRENT RETURN?" in Part B of this Prospectus.


(7) Each Trustee annual fee is per $1,000 principal amount of the underlying
bonds in the Trust for that portion of the Trust that represents a
particular plan of distribution.


(8) The Sponsor's Annual Evaluation Fee may, from time to time, be adjusted
provided that the total adjustment upward does not, at the time of such
adjustment, exceed the percentage of the total increase, after the date
hereof, in consumer prices for services as measured by the United States
Department of Labor Consumer Price Index entitled "All Services Less Rent"
or if such index no longer exists, a comparable index. The consent or
concurrence of any Unitholder shall not be required for any such adjustment
or increase.

* Record Dates for semi-annual distributions are May 1 and November 1; for
quarterly distributions, they are February 1, May 1, August 1 and November 1.
Record Dates for monthly distributions are the first day of each month.
Distribution Dates under each distribution plan are the fifteenth day of the
month in which the respective Record Date occurred. For additional
information see "WHEN ARE DISTRIBUTIONS MADE TO UNITHOLDERS?" in Part B of
this Prospectus.

(1) The first distribution will be paid to all Unitholders, regardless of the
distribution plan selected. Such distribution may be more or less than a
regular monthly distribution.


(2) The second distribution under the quarterly distribution plan represents a
2-month distribution; subsequent quarterly distributions will be regular
3-month distributions.


(3) The second distribution under the semi-annual distribution plan represents a
5-month distribution; subsequent semi-annual distributions will be regular
6-month distributions.



RISK FACTORS



Risk is inherent in all investing. Investing in a unit trust involves risk,
including the risk that you may receive little or no return on your investment
or even that you may lose part or all of your investment. Therefore, before
investing you should consider carefully the following risks that you assume when
you invest in this Trust. Because of these and other risks, the Trust should
only represent a portion of your overall portfolio and you should consider an
investment in the Trust to be a part of a longer term investment strategy that
will provide the best results when followed over a number of years. There is no
guarantee that the Trust will achieve its investment objective.


MARKET RISK: the risk that the market value of a bond or the Trust may
change rapidly and unpredictably, causing the bond or the Trust to be worth less
than its original price. Volatility in the market price of the bonds in the
Trust changes the value of the Units of the Trust. Market value may be affected
by a variety of factors including, among others, changes in the perceptions
about the issuers, changes in interest rates or inflation, changes in the
ratings of the issuers or changes in the financial condition of the issuers of
the bonds. Because the Trust is not managed, bonds in the Trust will generally
not be sold in response to market fluctuations, although bonds may be sold in
certain limited circumstances. Accordingly, an investor in the Trust may be
exposed to more market risk than an investor in certain managed investment
vehicles.


INFLATION RISK: the risk that the value of assets or income from investments
will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As
inflation increases, the value of the Trust's assets can decline as can the
value of the Trust's distributions.


INTEREST RATE RISK: the risk that bonds will decline in value because of a
rise in interest rates. Generally, bonds will increase in value when interest
rates decline and decrease in value when interest rates rise. Typically, bonds
with longer periods before maturity are more sensitive to interest rate changes.


CREDIT RISK: the risk that an issuer of a bond or an insurer is unable to
meet its obligation to make interest and principal payments.


CALL RISK: the risk that bonds can be prepaid or "called" by the issuer
before their stated maturity. If bonds are called, your income will decline and
you may not be able to reinvest the money you receive at as high a yield. Also,
an early call at par of a premium bond will reduce your return. Bonds in the
Trust are more likely to be called when interest rates decline. This would
result in early returns of principal to you and may result in early termination
of the Trust. The dates and prices upon which the bonds are first subject to
optional calls are provided in "Schedule of Investments." The bonds may also be
subject to special or extraordinary call provisions and "mandatory put" features
that may cause the bonds to be removed from the Trust prior to maturity.


LIQUIDITY RISK: the risk that the value of the bonds may be reduced if
trading in the bonds is limited or absent. Because the bonds will generally
trade in the over-the-counter market, there can be no assurance that a liquid
trading market will exist.


BOND QUALITY RISK: the risk that a reduction in a bond's rating may decrease
its value and the value of your investment in the Trust.


REDUCED DIVERSIFICATION RISK: the risk that the diversification of your
investment is reduced as bonds in the Trust are called, sold or mature. This
reduction in diversification may increase the risk of loss and increase your
share of Trust expenses.

LITIGATION AND LEGISLATION RISKS: the risk that future litigation or
legislation could affect the value of the Trust. In particular, future tax
legislation could affect the value of the Trust by reducing tax rates, imposing
a flat or other form of tax, exempting investment income from tax or changing
the tax status of the bonds.


YEAR 2000 RISK: Like other investment companies, financial and business
organizations and individuals around the world the Trust could be adversely
affected if the computer systems used by the Sponsor or Trustee or other service
providers to the Trust do not properly process and calculate date-related
information and data from and after January 1, 2000. This is commonly known as
the "Year 2000 Problem." The Sponsor and Trustee are taking steps that they
believe are reasonably designed to address the Year 2000 Problem with respect to
computer systems that they use and to obtain reasonable assurances that
comparable steps are being taken by the Trust's other service providers. At this
time, however, there can be no assurance that these steps will be sufficient to
avoid any adverse impact to the Trust.


The Year 2000 Problem is expected to impact corporations and other parties,
which may include issuers of the bonds contained in the Trust, to varying
degrees based upon various factors, including, but not limited to, their
industry sector and degree of technological sophistication. The Sponsor is
unable to predict what impact, if any, the Year 2000 Problem will have on
issuers or insurers of the bonds contained in the Trust.


CONCENTRATION RISK: the risk that the Trust is less diversified, and
therefore subject to greater risk of loss, because the Trust is concentrated in
a certain type of bond. Typically, when a certain type of bond makes up 25% or
more of the portfolio, the Trust is considered to be "concentrated" in that bond
type.


The Trust is considered to be concentrated in bonds of Education Revenue
Issuers whose revenues are subject to certain risks including declines in
"college age" individuals and the possible inability to raise tuition and fees.


The Trust is concentrated in the bonds of issuers located in the State of
Colorado. Such concentration may expose Unitholders to additional risks. The
financial condition of the State of Colorado is affected by various national and
local, economic, social and environmental policies and conditions and may have
an effect on the value of the Units. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory
limitations imposed on the State and its local governments concerning taxes,
bond indebtedness and other matters may constrain the revenue-generating
capacity of the State and its local governments and, therefore, the ability of
the issuers of the bonds to satisfy their obligations. Historically, the State
has experienced significant revenue shortfalls. A recently passed, but somewhat
ambiguous Constitutional Amendment requires voter approval prior to tax
increases, creation of debt, or until levy or valuation for assessment ratio
increases. The Amendment also limits increases in government spending and
property tax revenues to specified percentages.


The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and, therefore,
the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the bonds, are
affected by numerous factors. The economy of the State continues to be dependent
on tourism and its position as a transportation hub. These sectors tend to be
cyclical.


The State is a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final decision
could materially affect the State's governmental operations and consequently its
ability to pay debt service on its obligations.


Further information concerning the various types of bonds contained in the
Trust is available in "SUMMARY OF PORTFOLIOS" in Part B of the Prospectus. An
additional discussion of potential risks may be obtained upon written or
telephonic request to the Trustee as described in "OTHER
INFORMATION--Supplemental Information" appearing in Part B of this Prospectus.



TAX STATUS



For a discussion of the Federal tax status of income earned on Trust Units,
see "WHAT IS THE TAX STATUS OF UNITHOLDERS?" in Part B of this Prospectus.


In the opinion of Sherman & Howard L.L.C., special Colorado counsel to the
Trust, under existing law:


A Trust will consist of obligations which were issued by the State of
Colorado or its political subdivisions or by the United States or
possessions of the United States including Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands
and Guam ("Colorado Bonds").


Because Colorado income tax law is based upon the Federal law and in
light of the opinion of Chapman and Cutler, the Trust is not an association
taxable as a corporation for purposes of Colorado income taxation.


With respect to Colorado Unitholders, in view of the relationship
between Federal and Colorado tax computations described above and the
opinion of Chapman and Cutler referred to above:


Each Colorado Unitholder will be treated as owning a share of each asset
of the Trust for Colorado income tax purposes, in the proportion that the
number of Units of such Trust held by him bears to the total number of
outstanding Units of the Trust, and the income of the Trust will therefore
be treated as the income of each Colorado Unitholder under Colorado law in
the proportion described.


6





Interest on Colorado Bonds that would not be subject to Colorado income
tax or Colorado alternative minimum tax when paid directly to a Colorado
Unitholder will not be subject to Colorado income tax or alternative minimum
tax when received by the Trust and attributed to such Colorado Unitholder
and when distributed to such Colorado Unitholder.


Any proceeds paid under an insurance policy issued to the issuer of the
Colorado Bonds involved, to the Depositor prior to deposit of the Colorado
Bonds in the Trust, or to the Trust, which proceeds represent maturing
interest on defaulted Colorado Bonds and which proceeds would not be subject
to Colorado income tax or alternative minimum tax when paid directly to a
Colorado Unitholder will not be subject to Colorado income and alternative
minimum tax when received by the Trust and attributed to such Colorado
Unitholder and when distributed to such Colorado Unitholder.


Generally, each Colorado Unitholder will realize gain or loss taxable in
Colorado when the Trust disposes of a Colorado Bond (whether by sale,
exchange, redemption or payment at maturity) or when the Colorado Unitholder
redeems or sells Units at a price that differs from original cost as
adjusted for amortization of bond discount or premium and other basis
adjustments (including any basis reduction that may be required to reflect a
Colorado Unitholder's share of interest, if any, accruing on Colorado Bonds
during the interval between the Colorado Unitholder's settlement date and
the date such Colorado Bonds are delivered to the Trust, if later). However,
beginning in 2000, a Colorado Unitholder who is an individual, a trust or an
estate may be able to exclude from Colorado taxable income up to $1,200 per
year ($2,400 for a married couple filing jointly) of gains from the Trust's
diposition of Bonds or from the redemption or sale of the Colorado
Unitholder's Units. Under legislation enacted by Colorado in 1999, interest
income, dividend income and net capital gains (as defined in

Section 1222(11) of the Code) otherwise includable in taxable income qualify
for the exclusion. The exclusion will be available only in years during
which state revenues exceed by $220 million (indexed annually to reflect the
rate of growth in Colorado personal income) state spending limits mandated
by the Colorado Constitution, as such revenue and spending limits are
described in the Appendix to the Information Supplement entitled "Colorado
Disclosure," under the caption "Economic Factors--Colorado--Restrictions on
Appropriations and Revenues".


Tax cost reduction requirements relating to amortization of bond premium
may, under some circumstances, result in Colorado Unitholders realizing gain
taxable in Colorado when their Units are sold or redeemed for an amount
equal to or less than their original cost. Such gain may qualify for the
exclusion from Colorado taxable income described in the preceding paragraph
during years in which the exclusion becomes available.


If interest on indebtedness incurred or continued by a Colorado
Unitholder to purchase Units in the Trust is not deductible for Federal
income tax purposes, it will not be deductible for Colorado income tax
purposes.



VOLUME INCENTIVES



The Sponsor has made substantial enhancements to the volume incentive
program for dealer firms currently described in Part B of this Prospectus. The
following information replaces any discussion of volume incentives in Part B.
Volume incentives can be earned as a marketing allowance by eligible dealer
firms who reach cumulative firm sales or sales arrangement levels of a specified
dollar amount of Nuveen unit trusts (other than any series of the Nuveen--The
Dow 5-SM- Portfolios and Nuveen--The Dow 10-SM- Portfolios) sold in the primary
or secondary market during any quarter as set forth in the table below. Eligible
dealer firms are dealers that are providing marketing support for Nuveen unit
trusts in the form of 1) distributing or permitting the distribution of
marketing materials and other product information, 2) providing Nuveen
representatives access to the dealer's branch offices, and 3) generally
facilitating the placement of orders by the dealer's registered representatives
such as putting Nuveen unit trusts on their order entry screens. Eligible firms
will not include firms that solely provide clearing services to broker/dealer
firms. For purposes of determining the applicable volume incentive rate for a
given quarter, the dollar amount of all units sold over the current and three
previous quarters (the "Measuring Period") is aggregated. The volume incentive
received by the dealer firm will equal the dollar amount of units sold during
the current quarter times the highest applicable rate for the Measuring Period.
For firms that meet the necessary volume level, volume incentives may be given
on all applicable trades originated from or by that firm.








       TOTAL DOLLAR AMOUNT SOLD
         OVER MEASURING PERIOD                          VOLUME INCENTIVE
---------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------
$ 5,000,000 to $ 9,999,999               0.10% of current quarter sales
$10,000,000 to $19,999,999               0.125% of current quarter sales
$20,000,000 to $49,999,999               0.1375% of current quarter sales
$50,000,000 or more                      0.15% of current quarter sales








Only sales through the Sponsor qualify for volume incentives and for meeting
minimum requirements. The Sponsor reserves the right to modify or change the
volume incentive schedule at any time and make the determination as to which
firms qualify for the marketing allowance and the amount paid.

PURCHASE PROGRAMS



Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Part B of the Prospectus:


1.  Units may NOT be purchased at the Public Offering Price without a
sales charge by officers or directors and by bona fide, full-time employees
of Nuveen, Nuveen Advisory Corp., Nuveen Institutional Advisory Corp.,
Rittenhouse Financial Services, Inc. and The John Nuveen Company, including
in each case these individuals and their immediate family members (as
defined in this Prospectus).


2.  Units may be purchased in the primary market with sales charges of
1.70% of the Public Offering Price for National and State Long Term Trusts,
1.35% of the Public Offering Price for Long Intermediate Trusts, 1.20% of
the Public Offering Price for National and State Intermediate Trusts, 1.0%
of the Public Offering Price for National and State Short Intermediate
Trusts and 1.0% of the Public Offering Price for Short Term Trusts by:

(1) investors who purchase Units through registered investment advisers,
certified financial planners and registered broker-dealers who in each case
either charge periodic fees for financial planning, investment advisory or
asset management services, or provide such services in connection with the
establishment of an investment account for which a comprehensive "wrap fee"
charge is imposed, (2) bank trust departments investing funds over which
they exercise exclusive discretionary investment authority and that are held
in a fiduciary, agency, custodial or similar capacity; (3) any person who
for at least 90 days, has been an officer, director or bona fide employee of
any firm offering Units for sale to investors, (4) officers and directors of
bank holding companies that make Units available directly or through
subsidiaries or bank affiliates, (5) officers or directors and bona fide,
full-time employees of Nuveen, Nuveen Advisory Corp., Nuveen Institutional
Advisory Corp., Rittenhouse Financial Services, Inc., and The John Nuveen
Company, including in each case these individuals and their spouses, minor
children, and parents, however, purchases by parents must be made through a
registered broker-dealer, and (6) any person who for at least 90 days, has
been an officer, director or bona fide employee of any vendor who provides
services to the Sponsor and who purchases Units through a registered
broker-dealer (collectively, the "Discounted Purchases"). In addition, such
investors may purchase Units in the secondary market at the Public Offering
Price for non-breakpoint purchases minus the concession the Sponsor
typically allows to brokers and dealers for non-breakpoint purchases.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Prospectus, investors who
purchase Units as described in this paragraph will not receive sales charge
reductions for quantity purchases.



ORGANIZATION EXPENSES



You will bear all or a portion of the expenses incurred in organizing your
Trust including the costs of preparing the registration statement, the trust
indenture and other closing documents, registering Units with the Securities and
Exchange Commission and states, the initial audit of the Trust portfolio, the
initial evaluation, legal fees, the initial fees and expenses of the Trustee and
any nonmaterial out-of-pocket expenses. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in Part B of the Prospectus:


1.  During the period ending with the earlier of six months after the
Initial Date of Deposit or the end of the initial offering period, the
Public Offering Price includes organization costs incurred in establishing
your Trust. The Trustee will deduct these expenses from your Trust at the
close of this period. Also during this period, the price at which the
Sponsor expects to repurchase Units and the redemption price per Unit
include estimated organization costs. After this period, the Sponsor's
repurchase price and the redemption price per Unit do not include these
costs.


2.  If bonds are purchased with the portion of the Public Offering Price
intended to be used to reimburse the Sponsor for the Trust's organization
costs, the bonds will be purchased in the same proportionate relationship as
all the bonds contained in the Trust. These bonds will be sold to reimburse
the Sponsor for the Trust's organization costs at the earlier of six months
after the Initial Date of Deposit or the end of the initial offering period.
Also, any cash received for these purposes will be paid to the Sponsor at
the earlier of six months after the Initial Date of Deposit or the end of
the initial offering period. The bonds may decrease in value during this
period. If proceeds from the sale of these bonds or any cash reserved is
insufficient to repay the Sponsor for these costs, the Trustee will sell
additional bonds. If this occurs, the net asset value per Unit will be
reduced by the amount of additional bonds sold. Although the dollar amount
of the Sponsor's reimbursement will remain fixed and never exceed the amount
per Unit set forth under "Statement of Condition" herein, this will result
in a greater effective cost per Unit to you. When bonds are sold to
reimburse the Sponsor for organization costs, the Trustee will sell the
bonds to maintain the same proportionate relationship among the bonds
contained in the Trust that existed prior to the sale.


3.  The Sponsor deducts unpaid organization costs when determining the
value of the Trust.

(1) The Sponsor's contracts to purchase bonds were entered into during the
period from October 21, 1999 to October 22, 1999. Other information regarding
the bonds in the Trust on the Date of Deposit is as follows:








                                                         PROFIT (OR
                                            COST TO         LOSS)       ANNUAL INTEREST   BID PRICE

In addition, the difference between the Trustee's determination of Offering
Price and Bid Price (as a percentage of principal amount) is .40%. Neither cost
to Sponsor nor profit (or loss) to Sponsor reflects underwriting profits or
losses received or incurred by the Sponsor through its participation in
underwriting syndicates. The Sponsor did not participate as either the sole
underwriter or as a manager or member of a syndicate that acted as the original
underwriter of any of the bonds.


(2) The bonds are first subject to optional redemption in the years, and at
the prices, shown. Unless otherwise indicated, the bonds, except for bonds
issued at a substantial original issue discount, are redeemable at declining
prices (but not below par value) in subsequent years. Original issue discount
bonds, including zero coupon bonds, are generally redeemable at prices based on
the issue price plus the amount of original issue discount accreted to
redemption plus, if applicable, some premium, the amount of which will decline
in subsequent years. The bonds may also be subject to sinking fund redemption
without premium prior to the dates shown. Certain bonds may be subject to
redemption without premium prior to the date shown pursuant to special or
mandatory call provisions specified in the instruments setting forth the terms
and provisions of such bonds. See "Risk Factors" herein and "COMPOSITION OF
TRUSTS" and "WHAT IS THE TAX STATUS OF UNITHOLDERS?" in Part B of this

Prospectus.


(3) All the bonds in the Insured Trusts, as insured by the Insurer, are
rated AAA by Standard & Poor's, AAA by Fitch and/or Aaa by Moody's. The
insurance obtained by the Trust guarantees the payment of interest and principal
on the bonds when due but does not cover certain market risks associated with
fixed income securities such as accelerated payments, premiums payable on
mandatory redemptions or interest rate risks. (See "WHY AND HOW ARE THE BONDS
INSURED?" in Part B of this Prospectus and "Description of Ratings" in the
Information Supplement.)

------------








(1) Represented by contracts to purchase bonds which include "when issued" or
"regular way" or "delayed delivery" contracts for which an irrevocable
letter of credit issued by a major commercial bank has been deposited with
the Trustee on the Date of Deposit. The amount of such letter of credit and
any cash deposited exceeds the amount necessary for the purchase of the
bonds plus accrued interest to the Date of Deposit. At the Date of Deposit,
bonds may have been delivered to the Sponsor pursuant to certain of these
contracts; the Sponsor has assigned to the Trustee all of its rights, title
and interest in and to such bonds.


(2) Aggregate value (at offering prices) as of the Date of Deposit of the bonds
listed under "Schedule of Investments" herein, and their aggregate cost to
the Trust are the same. Such offering prices were determined by Kenny S&P
Evaluation Services, a division of J. J. Kenny Co., Inc., as of the close of
business on the business day prior to the Date of Deposit. (See "HOW WAS THE
PRICE OF THE BONDS DETERMINED AT THE DATE OF DEPOSIT?" in Part B of this
Prospectus.) Insurance coverage providing for the timely payment, when due,
of all principal of and interest on the bonds in an Insured Trust has been
obtained by the Sponsor or by the issuers of such bonds. Such insurance does
not guarantee the market value of the bonds or the value of the Units. Both
the bid and the offering prices of the underlying bonds and of the Units may
include value attributable to such policies of insurance.


(3) A portion of the Public Offering Price consists of an amount sufficient to
reimburse the Sponsor for all or a portion of the costs of establishing the
Trust. These costs have been estimated at $.25000 per Unit for the Trust. A
payment will be made as of the earlier of six months after the Initial Date
of Deposit or the end of the initial offering period to an account
maintained by the Trustee from which the obligations of the investors to the
Sponsor are dispensed. To the extent that actual organization costs are
greater than the estimated amount, only the estimated organization costs
added to the Public Offering Price will be reimbursed to the Sponsor and
deducted from the assets of the Trust.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS




TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF JOHN NUVEEN & CO. INCORPORATED AND UNITHOLDERS OF
COLORADO INSURED TRUST 82:



We have audited the accompanying statement of condition and the schedule of
investments at date of deposit (included in Part A of this Prospectus) of
Colorado Insured Trust 82 (contained in Nuveen Tax-Free Unit Trust,
Series 1124), as of October 25, 1999. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Sponsor. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audit.


We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included
confirmation of the irrevocable letter of credit arrangement for the purchase of
securities, described in Note (1) to the statement of condition, by
correspondence with the Trustee. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by the Sponsor, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.


In our opinion, the statement of condition and the schedule of investments
at date of deposit referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Colorado Insured Trust 82 as of October 25, 1999, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

TRUST SUMMARY AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS




THE TRUST



Florida Insured Trust 283 (the "Trust") consists of a portfolio of
interest-bearing obligations issued by or on behalf of the State of Florida,
certain United States Territories or authorities and political subdivisions
thereof which, in the opinion of recognized bond counsel to the issuing
authorities, provide income which is exempt from Federal income tax and Florida
intangibles tax, to the extent indicated below.



INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES



The objectives of the Trust are income exempt from Federal income tax and
Florida intangibles tax, and conservation of capital. The objectives are, of
course, dependent upon the continuing ability of the issuers, obligors and/or
insurers to meet their respective obligations.



THE PORTFOLIO



The Portfolio of the Trust consists of 7 obligations issued by entities
located in Florida. The bonds in the Trust are either general obligations of the
governmental entity issuing them and are backed by the taxing power thereof or
are payable as to principal and interest from the income of a specific project
or authority and are not supported by the issuer's power to levy taxes. The
sources of payment for the bonds are divided as follows:








   NUMBER OF                                              PORTFOLIO
    ISSUES                PURPOSE OF ISSUE                PERCENTAGE
---------------  ----------------------------------------------------
       3         Water and/or Sewer Revenue                      42.8%
       1         Education Revenue                               14.3
       1         Health Care Facility Revenue                    14.3
       1         Municipal Lease Revenue                         14.3
       1         Dedicated-Tax Supported Revenue                 14.3








All of the bonds in the Trust are covered by policies of insurance obtained
from the MBIA Insurance Corporation guaranteeing payment of principal and
interest when due. As a result of such insurance, the bonds in the Trust have
received a rating of "Aaa" by Moody's, "AAA" by Fitch, and/or "AAA" by Standard
& Poor's. Insurance does not guarantee the market value of the bonds or of Trust
Units.

NOTES TO ESSENTIAL INFORMATION:



BECAUSE CERTAIN OF THE BONDS IN THE TRUST WILL NOT BE DELIVERED TO THE TRUSTEE
UNTIL AFTER THE SETTLEMENT DATE FOR A PURCHASE OF UNITS MADE ON THE DATE OF
DEPOSIT, INTEREST THAT ACCRUES ON THOSE BONDS BETWEEN THE DATE OF DEPOSIT AND
SUCH DELIVERY DATE WILL BE TREATED AS A RETURN OF PRINCIPAL RATHER THAN AS
TAX-EXEMPT INCOME. THE AMOUNT OF ANY SUCH RETURN OF PRINCIPAL IS NOT INCLUDED IN
THE ANNUAL INTEREST INCOME SHOWN ABOVE. FOR THE TRUST, THE FOLLOWING SETS FORTH




THE LATEST SCHEDULED BOND DELIVERY DATE, THE AMOUNT PER UNIT THAT WILL BE
TREATED AS A RETURN OF PRINCIPAL TO UNITHOLDERS WHO PURCHASE ON THE DATE OF
DEPOSIT, AND THE ESTIMATED CURRENT RETURN UNDER THE MONTHLY DISTRIBUTION PLAN
AFTER THE FIRST YEAR, ASSUMING THE PORTFOLIO AND ESTIMATED ANNUAL EXPENSES DO
NOT VARY FROM THAT SET FORTH ABOVE (SEE "WHAT ARE NORMAL TRUST OPERATING
EXPENSES?" IN PART B OF THIS PROSPECTUS AND THE "SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS"). THE
ESTIMATED CURRENT RETURN AFTER THE FIRST YEAR WILL ALSO BE HIGHER UNDER THE
QUARTERLY AND SEMI-ANNUAL DISTRIBUTION PLANS:






                                 LATEST SCHEDULED         PER UNIT         ESTIMATED CURRENT RETURN

                                ------------------  --------------------   -------------------------
FLORIDA INSURED TRUST.........   NOVEMBER 1, 1999   $          .01                              5.35%








(1) A portion of the Public Offering Price consists of an amount sufficient to
reimburse the Sponsor for all or a portion of the costs of establishing the
Trust. These costs have been estimated at $.25000 per Unit for the Trust. A
payment will be made as of the earlier of six months after the Initial Date
of Deposit or the end of the initial offering period to an account
maintained by the Trustee from which the obligations of the investors to the
Sponsor are dispensed. To the extent that actual organization costs are
greater than the estimated amount, only the estimated organization costs
added to the Public Offering Price will be reimbursed to the Sponsor and
deducted from the assets of the Trust.


(2) Units are offered at the Public Offering Price plus accrued interest from
the preceding Record Date to, but not including, the date of settlement
(normally three business days after purchase). The Date of Deposit of the
Fund has been designated as the First Record Date for all plans of
distribution of the Trust and, accordingly, for Units purchased on the Date
of Deposit, $.04 of accrued interest to the Settlement Date will be added to
the Public Offering Price. (See "WHAT IS ACCRUED INTEREST?" in Part B of
this Prospectus.) The evaluation time for purpose of sale, purchase or
redemption of Units is 4 p.m. Eastern time or as of any earlier time at
which the New York Stock Exchange closes. (See "HOW IS THE PUBLIC OFFERING
PRICE DETERMINED?" in Part B of this Prospectus.)


(3) The Average Maturity of bonds in the Trust is calculated based upon the
stated maturities of the bonds in the Trust (or, with respect to bonds for
which funds or securities have been placed in escrow to redeem such bonds on
a stated call date, based upon such call date). The Average Maturity of
bonds in the Trust may increase or decrease from time to time as bonds
mature or are called or sold.


(4) Assumes delivery of all bonds. (See "COMPOSITION OF TRUSTS" appearing in
Part B of this Prospectus.) Interest income does not include accretion of
original issue discount on "zero coupon" bonds, Stripped Obligations or
other original issue discount bonds. (See "SUMMARY OF PORTFOLIOS" in Part B
of this Prospectus.)


(5) The amount and timing of interest distributions from the Trust under the
various plans of distribution are set forth below. It is anticipated that
the amount of interest to be distributed per Unit in each year under each
plan of distribution will initially be substantially equal to the Estimated
Net Annual Interest Income per Unit for that plan. The amount of interest to
be distributed annually per Unit, will generally change as bonds are
redeemed, mature or are sold or as fees and expenses increase or decrease.


(6) Estimated Long Term Return for the Trust represents the average of the
yields to maturity (or call) of the bonds in the Trust's portfolio
calculated in accordance with accepted bond practices and adjusted to
reflect a compounding factor, expenses and sales charges. Estimated Current
Return is computed by dividing the Net Annual Interest Income per Unit by
the Public Offering Price, and in contrast to Estimated Long Term Return
does not reflect the amortization of premium or accretion of discount, if
any. For more information see "WHAT ARE ESTIMATED LONG TERM RETURN AND
ESTIMATED CURRENT RETURN?" in Part B of this Prospectus.


(7) Each Trustee annual fee is per $1,000 principal amount of the underlying
bonds in the Trust for that portion of the Trust that represents a
particular plan of distribution.


(8) The Sponsor's Annual Evaluation Fee may, from time to time, be adjusted
provided that the total adjustment upward does not, at the time of such
adjustment, exceed the percentage of the total increase, after the date
hereof, in consumer prices for services as measured by the United States
Department of Labor Consumer Price Index entitled "All Services Less Rent"
or if such index no longer exists, a comparable index. The consent or
concurrence of any Unitholder shall not be required for any such adjustment
or increase.

RISK FACTORS



Risk is inherent in all investing. Investing in a unit trust involves risk,
including the risk that you may receive little or no return on your investment
or even that you may lose part or all of your investment. Therefore, before
investing you should consider carefully the following risks that you assume when
you invest in this Trust. Because of these and other risks, the Trust should
only represent a portion of your overall portfolio and you should consider an
investment in the Trust to be a part of a longer term investment strategy that
will provide the best results when followed over a number of years. There is no
guarantee that the Trust will achieve its investment objective.


MARKET RISK: the risk that the market value of a bond or the Trust may
change rapidly and unpredictably, causing the bond or the Trust to be worth less
than its original price. Volatility in the market price of the bonds in the
Trust changes the value of the Units of the Trust. Market value may be affected
by a variety of factors including, among others, changes in the perceptions
about the issuers, changes in interest rates or inflation, changes in the
ratings of the issuers or changes in the financial condition of the issuers of
the bonds. Because the Trust is not managed, bonds in the Trust will generally
not be sold in response to market fluctuations, although bonds may be sold in
certain limited circumstances. Accordingly, an investor in the Trust may be
exposed to more market risk than an investor in certain managed investment
vehicles.


INFLATION RISK: the risk that the value of assets or income from investments
will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As
inflation increases, the value of the Trust's assets can decline as can the
value of the Trust's distributions.


INTEREST RATE RISK: the risk that bonds will decline in value because of a
rise in interest rates. Generally, bonds will increase in value when interest
rates decline and decrease in value when interest rates rise. Typically, bonds
with longer periods before maturity are more sensitive to interest rate changes.


CREDIT RISK: the risk that an issuer of a bond or an insurer is unable to
meet its obligation to make interest and principal payments.


CALL RISK: the risk that bonds can be prepaid or "called" by the issuer
before their stated maturity. If bonds are called, your income will decline and
you may not be able to reinvest the money you receive at as high a yield. Also,
an early call at par of a premium bond will reduce your return. Bonds in the
Trust are more likely to be called when interest rates decline. This would
result in early returns of principal to you and may result in early termination
of the Trust. The dates and prices upon which the bonds are first subject to
optional calls are provided in "Schedule of Investments." The bonds may also be
subject to special or extraordinary call provisions and "mandatory put" features
that may cause the bonds to be removed from the Trust prior to maturity.


LIQUIDITY RISK: the risk that the value of the bonds may be reduced if
trading in the bonds is limited or absent. Because the bonds will generally
trade in the over-the-counter market, there can be no assurance that a liquid
trading market will exist.


BOND QUALITY RISK: the risk that a reduction in a bond's rating may decrease
its value and the value of your investment in the Trust.


5





REDUCED DIVERSIFICATION RISK: the risk that the diversification of your
investment is reduced as bonds in the Trust are called, sold or mature. This
reduction in diversification may increase the risk of loss and increase your
share of Trust expenses.


LITIGATION AND LEGISLATION RISKS: the risk that future litigation or
legislation could affect the value of the Trust. In particular, future tax
legislation could affect the value of the Trust by reducing tax rates, imposing
a flat or other form of tax, exempting investment income from tax or changing
the tax status of the bonds.


YEAR 2000 RISK: Like other investment companies, financial and business
organizations and individuals around the world the Trust could be adversely
affected if the computer systems used by the Sponsor or Trustee or other service
providers to the Trust do not properly process and calculate date-related
information and data from and after January 1, 2000. This is commonly known as
the "Year 2000 Problem." The Sponsor and Trustee are taking steps that they
believe are reasonably designed to address the Year 2000 Problem with respect to
computer systems that they use and to obtain reasonable assurances that
comparable steps are being taken by the Trust's other service providers. At this
time, however, there can be no assurance that these steps will be sufficient to
avoid any adverse impact to the Trust.


The Year 2000 Problem is expected to impact corporations and other parties,
which may include issuers of the bonds contained in the Trust, to varying
degrees based upon various factors, including, but not limited to, their
industry sector and degree of technological sophistication. The Sponsor is
unable to predict what impact, if any, the Year 2000 Problem will have on
issuers or insurers of the bonds contained in the Trust.


CONCENTRATION RISK: the risk that the Trust is less diversified, and
therefore subject to greater risk of loss, because the Trust is concentrated in
a certain type of bond. Typically, when a certain type of bond makes up 25% or
more of the portfolio, the Trust is considered to be "concentrated" in that bond
type.


The Trust is considered to be concentrated in bonds of Water and/or Sewer
Revenue Issuers whose revenues are subject to certain risks including problems
obtaining timely and adequate rate increases and population decline resulting in
decreased user fees.


The Trust is concentrated in the bonds of issuers located in the State of
Florida. Such concentration may expose Unitholders to additional risks. The
financial condition of the State of Florida is affected by various national and
local, economic, social and environmental policies and conditions and may have
an effect on the value of the Units. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory
limitations imposed on the State and its local governments concerning taxes,
bond indebtedness and other matters may constrain the revenue-generating
capacity of the State and its local governments and, therefore, the ability of
the issuers of the bonds to satisfy their obligations. The State Constitution
and statutes mandate that the State budget, as a whole, and each separate fund
within the State budget, be kept in balance from currently available revenues
each fiscal year. Additionally, the State Constitution prohibits issuance of
State obligations to fund State operations.


The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and, therefore,
the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the bonds, are
affected by numerous factors. The State continues to be dependent on the
construction and construction related manufacturing industries. These industries
tend to be highly cyclical and there is no assurance that Florida's rapid
population growth, which drove these industries in the past, will continue.
Tourism is also one of the State's most important industries. Because many
international travelers visit Florida, an increase in the value of the U.S.
dollar adversely affects this industry. Moreover, Florida could be impacted by
problems in the agricultural sector, including crop failures, severe weather
conditions or other agricultural-related problems, particularly with regard to
the citrus and sugar industries.


The State is a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final decision
could materially affect the State's governmental operations and consequently its
ability to pay debt service on its obligations.


The State maintains a bond rating of Aa2, AA+ and AA from Moody's,
Standard & Poor's and Fitch, respectively, on the majority of its general
obligation bonds, although the rating of a particular series of revenue bonds
relates primarily to the project, facility, or other revenue resource from which
such series derives funds for repayment.


Further information concerning the various types of bonds contained in the
Trust is available in "SUMMARY OF PORTFOLIOS" in Part B of the Prospectus. An
additional discussion of potential risks may be obtained upon written or
telephonic request to the Trustee as described in "OTHER
INFORMATION--Supplemental Information" appearing in Part B of this Prospectus.



TAX STATUS



For a discussion of the Federal tax status of income earned on Trust Units,
see "WHAT IS THE TAX STATUS OF UNITHOLDERS?" appearing in Part B of this
Prospectus.


6





The assets of the Trust will consist solely of interest-bearing obligations
issued by or on behalf of the State of Florida, its political subdivisions and
authorities or by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands,
American Samoa, or the Northern Mariana Islands (the "Florida Bonds").


In the opinion of Carlton, Fields, Ward, Emmanuel, Smith & Cutler, P.A.,
special counsel for the Trust for Florida tax matters, under existing law:


For Florida state income tax purposes, the Trust will not be subject to the
Florida income tax imposed by the Florida Code so long as the Trust has no
income subject to federal taxation. In addition, political subdivisions of
Florida do not impose any income taxes.


Because Florida does not impose an income tax on individuals, non-corporate
Unitholders will not be subject to any Florida income tax on income realized by
the Trust. Each corporate Unitholder will be subject to Florida income taxation
on its share of the income realized by the Trust notwithstanding the tax exempt
status of the interest received from any bonds under Section 103(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or any other federal law, unless the interest
income constitutes nonbusiness income. Nevertheless, any corporate Unitholder
that has its commercial domicile in Florida will be taxable under the Florida
Code on its share of the Trust income which constitutes nonbusiness income.


Trust Units will be subject to Florida estate tax only if owned by Florida
residents, certain natural persons not domiciled in Florida, or certain natural
persons not residents of the United States. However, the Florida estate tax is
limited to the amount of the credit allowable under the applicable Federal
Revenue Act (currently Section 2011 [and in some cases Section 2102] of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) for death taxes actually paid to the
several states.


Neither the Florida Bonds nor the Units will be subject to the Florida ad
valorem property tax or Florida sales or use tax.


Because Bonds issued by the State of Florida or its political subdivisions
or by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa
and the Northern Mariana Islands are exempt from Florida intangible personal
property taxation under Chapter 199, Florida Statutes, as amended, the Trust
will not be subject to Florida intangible personal property tax. In addition,
the Unitholders will not be subject to Florida intangible personal property tax
on the Units.



VOLUME INCENTIVES



The Sponsor has made substantial enhancements to the volume incentive
program for dealer firms currently described in Part B of this Prospectus. The
following information replaces any discussion of volume incentives in Part B.
Volume incentives can be earned as a marketing allowance by eligible dealer
firms who reach cumulative firm sales or sales arrangement levels of a specified
dollar amount of Nuveen unit trusts (other than any series of the Nuveen--The
Dow 5-SM- Portfolios and Nuveen--The Dow 10-SM- Portfolios) sold in the primary
or secondary market during any quarter as set forth in the table below. Eligible
dealer firms are dealers that are providing marketing support for Nuveen unit
trusts in the form of 1) distributing or permitting the distribution of
marketing materials and other product information, 2) providing Nuveen
representatives access to the dealer's branch offices, and 3) generally
facilitating the placement of orders by the dealer's registered representatives
such as putting Nuveen unit trusts on their order entry screens. Eligible firms
will not include firms that solely provide clearing services to broker/dealer
firms. For purposes of determining the applicable volume incentive rate for a
given quarter, the dollar amount of all units sold over the current and three
previous quarters (the "Measuring Period") is aggregated. The volume incentive
received by the dealer firm will equal the dollar amount of units sold during
the current quarter times the highest applicable rate for the Measuring Period.
For firms that meet the necessary volume level, volume incentives may be given
on all applicable trades originated from or by that firm.








       TOTAL DOLLAR AMOUNT SOLD
         OVER MEASURING PERIOD                          VOLUME INCENTIVE
---------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------
$ 5,000,000 to $ 9,999,999               0.10% of current quarter sales
$10,000,000 to $19,999,999               0.125% of current quarter sales
$20,000,000 to $49,999,999               0.1375% of current quarter sales
$50,000,000 or more                      0.15% of current quarter sales








Only sales through the Sponsor qualify for volume incentives and for meeting
minimum requirements. The Sponsor reserves the right to modify or change the
volume incentive schedule at any time and make the determination as to which
firms qualify for the marketing allowance and the amount paid.

PURCHASE PROGRAMS



Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Part B of the Prospectus:


1.  Units may NOT be purchased at the Public Offering Price without a
sales charge by officers or directors and by bona fide, full-time employees
of Nuveen, Nuveen Advisory Corp., Nuveen Institutional Advisory Corp.,
Rittenhouse Financial Services, Inc. and The John Nuveen Company, including
in each case these individuals and their immediate family members (as
defined in this Prospectus).


2.  Units may be purchased in the primary market with sales charges of
1.70% of the Public Offering Price for National and State Long Term Trusts,
1.35% of the Public Offering Price for Long Intermediate Trusts, 1.20% of
the Public Offering Price for National and State Intermediate Trusts, 1.0%
of the Public Offering Price for National and State Short Intermediate
Trusts and 1.0% of the Public Offering Price for Short Term Trusts by:

(1) investors who purchase Units through registered investment advisers,
certified financial planners and registered broker-dealers who in each case
either charge periodic fees for financial planning, investment advisory or
asset management services, or provide such services in connection with the
establishment of an investment account for which a comprehensive "wrap fee"
charge is imposed, (2) bank trust departments investing funds over which
they exercise exclusive discretionary investment authority and that are held
in a fiduciary, agency, custodial or similar capacity; (3) any person who
for at least 90 days, has been an officer, director or bona fide employee of
any firm offering Units for sale to investors, (4) officers and directors of
bank holding companies that make Units available directly or through
subsidiaries or bank affiliates, (5) officers or directors and bona fide,
full-time employees of Nuveen, Nuveen Advisory Corp., Nuveen Institutional
Advisory Corp., Rittenhouse Financial Services, Inc., and The John Nuveen
Company, including in each case these individuals and their spouses, minor
children, and parents, however, purchases by parents must be made through a
registered broker-dealer, and (6) any person who for at least 90 days, has
been an officer, director or bona fide employee of any vendor who provides
services to the Sponsor and who purchases Units through a registered
broker-dealer (collectively, the "Discounted Purchases"). In addition, such
investors may purchase Units in the secondary market at the Public Offering
Price for non-breakpoint purchases minus the concession the Sponsor
typically allows to brokers and dealers for non-breakpoint purchases.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Prospectus, investors who
purchase Units as described in this paragraph will not receive sales charge
reductions for quantity purchases.



ORGANIZATION EXPENSES



You will bear all or a portion of the expenses incurred in organizing your
Trust including the costs of preparing the registration statement, the trust
indenture and other closing documents, registering Units with the Securities and
Exchange Commission and states, the initial audit of the Trust portfolio, the
initial evaluation, legal fees, the initial fees and expenses of the Trustee and
any nonmaterial out-of-pocket expenses. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in Part B of the Prospectus:


1.  During the period ending with the earlier of six months after the
Initial Date of Deposit or the end of the initial offering period, the
Public Offering Price includes organization costs incurred in establishing
your Trust. The Trustee will deduct these expenses from your Trust at the
close of this period. Also during this period, the price at which the
Sponsor expects to repurchase Units and the redemption price per Unit
include estimated organization costs. After this period, the Sponsor's
repurchase price and the redemption price per Unit do not include these
costs.


2.  If bonds are purchased with the portion of the Public Offering Price
intended to be used to reimburse the Sponsor for the Trust's organization
costs, the bonds will be purchased in the same proportionate relationship as
all the bonds contained in the Trust. These bonds will be sold to reimburse
the Sponsor for the Trust's organization costs at the earlier of six months
after the Initial Date of Deposit or the end of the initial offering period.
Also, any cash received for these purposes will be paid to the Sponsor at
the earlier of six months after the Initial Date of Deposit or the end of
the initial offering period. The bonds may decrease in value during this
period. If proceeds from the sale of these bonds or any cash reserved is
insufficient to repay the Sponsor for these costs, the Trustee will sell
additional bonds. If this occurs, the net asset value per Unit will be
reduced by the amount of additional bonds sold. Although the dollar amount
of the Sponsor's reimbursement will remain fixed and never exceed the amount
per Unit set forth under "Statement of Condition" herein, this will result
in a greater effective cost per Unit to you. When bonds are sold to
reimburse the Sponsor for organization costs, the Trustee will sell the
bonds to maintain the same proportionate relationship among the bonds
contained in the Trust that existed prior to the sale.


3.  The Sponsor deducts unpaid organization costs when determining the
value of the Trust.

* These bonds, or a portion thereof, have delivery dates beyond the normal
settlement date. Their expected delivery date is November 1, 1999. Contracts
relating to bonds with delivery dates after the date of settlement for
purchase made on the Date of Deposit constitute approximately 29% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Trust. (See "COMPOSITION OF TRUSTS" in Part
B of this Prospectus.)




(1) The Sponsor's contracts to purchase bonds were entered into during the
period from October 14, 1999 to October 22, 1999. Other information regarding
the bonds in the Trust on the Date of Deposit is as follows:








                                                         PROFIT (OR

In addition, the difference between the Trustee's determination of Offering
Price and Bid Price (as a percentage of principal amount) is .39%. Neither cost
to Sponsor nor profit (or loss) to Sponsor reflects underwriting profits or
losses received or incurred by the Sponsor through its participation in
underwriting syndicates. The Sponsor did not participate as either the sole
underwriter or as a manager or member of a syndicate that acted as the original
underwriter of any of the bonds.


(2) The bonds are first subject to optional redemption in the years, and at
the prices, shown. Unless otherwise indicated, the bonds, except for bonds
issued at a substantial original issue discount, are redeemable at declining
prices (but not below par value) in subsequent years. Original issue discount
bonds, including zero coupon bonds, are generally redeemable at prices based on
the issue price plus the amount of original issue discount accreted to
redemption plus, if applicable, some premium, the amount of which will decline
in subsequent years. The bonds may also be subject to sinking fund redemption
without premium prior to the dates shown. Certain bonds may be subject to
redemption without premium prior to the date shown pursuant to special or
mandatory call provisions specified in the instruments setting forth the terms
and provisions of such bonds. See "Risk Factors" herein and "COMPOSITION OF
TRUSTS" and "WHAT IS THE TAX STATUS OF UNITHOLDERS?" in Part B of this

Prospectus.


(3) All the bonds in the Insured Trusts, as insured by the Insurer, are
rated AAA by Standard & Poor's, AAA by Fitch and/or Aaa by Moody's. The
insurance obtained by the Trust guarantees the payment of interest and principal
on the bonds when due but does not cover certain market risks associated with
fixed income securities such as accelerated payments, premiums payable on
mandatory redemptions or interest rate risks. (See "WHY AND HOW ARE THE BONDS
INSURED?" in Part B of this Prospectus and "Description of Ratings" in the
Information Supplement.)

------------








(1) Represented by contracts to purchase bonds which include "when issued" or
"regular way" or "delayed delivery" contracts for which an irrevocable
letter of credit issued by a major commercial bank has been deposited with
the Trustee on the Date of Deposit. The amount of such letter of credit and
any cash deposited exceeds the amount necessary for the purchase of the
bonds plus accrued interest to the Date of Deposit. At the Date of Deposit,
bonds may have been delivered to the Sponsor pursuant to certain of these
contracts; the Sponsor has assigned to the Trustee all of its rights, title
and interest in and to such bonds.


(2) Aggregate value (at offering prices) as of the Date of Deposit of the bonds
listed under "Schedule of Investments" herein, and their aggregate cost to
the Trust are the same. Such offering prices were determined by Kenny S&P
Evaluation Services, a division of J. J. Kenny Co., Inc., as of the close of
business on the business day prior to the Date of Deposit. (See "HOW WAS THE
PRICE OF THE BONDS DETERMINED AT THE DATE OF DEPOSIT?" in Part B of this
Prospectus.) Insurance coverage providing for the timely payment, when due,
of all principal of and interest on the bonds in an Insured Trust has been
obtained by the Sponsor or by the issuers of such bonds. Such insurance does
not guarantee the market value of the bonds or the value of the Units. Both
the bid and the offering prices of the underlying bonds and of the Units may
include value attributable to such policies of insurance.


(3) A portion of the Public Offering Price consists of an amount sufficient to
reimburse the Sponsor for all or a portion of the costs of establishing the
Trust. These costs have been estimated at $.25000 per Unit for the Trust. A
payment will be made as of the earlier of six months after the Initial Date
of Deposit or the end of the initial offering period to an account
maintained by the Trustee from which the obligations of the investors to the
Sponsor are dispensed. To the extent that actual organization costs are
greater than the estimated amount, only the estimated organization costs
added to the Public Offering Price will be reimbursed to the Sponsor and
deducted from the assets of the Trust.


(4) Representing, as set forth in "WHAT IS ACCRUED INTEREST?" in Part B of this
Prospectus, advancement by the Trustee of an amount equal to the accrued
bond interest as of the Date of Deposit.


(5) Aggregate Public Offering Price (exclusive of accrued interest) computed as
set forth under "HOW IS THE PUBLIC OFFERING PRICE DETERMINED?" in Part B of
this Prospectus.


(6) The gross underwriting commission of 4.90% of the Public Offering Price has
been calculated on the assumption that the Units sold are not subject to a
reduction of sales charge for quantity purchases. In single transactions
involving 500 Units or more, the sales charge is reduced. (See "HOW IS THE
PUBLIC OFFERING PRICE DETERMINED?" in Part B of this Prospectus.)

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS




TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF JOHN NUVEEN & CO. INCORPORATED AND UNITHOLDERS OF
FLORIDA INSURED TRUST 283:



We have audited the accompanying statement of condition and the schedule of
investments at date of deposit (included in Part A of this Prospectus) of
Florida Insured Trust 283 (contained in Nuveen Tax-Free Unit Trust,
Series 1124), as of October 25, 1999. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Sponsor. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audit.


We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included
confirmation of the irrevocable letter of credit arrangement for the purchase of
securities, described in Note (1) to the statement of condition, by
correspondence with the Trustee. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by the Sponsor, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.


In our opinion, the statement of condition and the schedule of investments
at date of deposit referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Florida Insured Trust 283 as of October 25, 1999, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

and  tax  status. Part  B of  the Prospectus  provides more  general information
regarding the Nuveen  Tax-Free Unit Trusts.  You should read  both Parts of  the

the  Prospectus, the  information contained  in this Part  B will  apply to each
Trust.


Additional information  about  the Trusts  is  provided in  the  Information

Manhattan Bank (the "TRUSTEE") at (800) 257-8787.



NUVEEN DEFINED PORTFOLIOS



TAX-FREE INCOME.   Each Nuveen  Tax-Free Unit  Trust consists  of a  diversified
portfolio  of municipal bonds. (See  "Schedule of Investments" in  Part A of the
Prospectus for a list of the Bonds included in a Trust.) Under existing law, the
interest income to a Trust and to Unitholders is exempt from federal income tax.
In addition, interest income of a State Trust is exempt to the extent  indicated
in Part A of the Prospectus from state and, in some cases, local income taxes.


INSURED TRUSTS.  All Bonds in each Nuveen Insured Trust are covered by insurance
policies  obtained from MBIA Insurance Corporation. These policies guarantee the
payment of  principal  and interest  when  due. The  insurance  policies  remain
effective  for the entire life of a Bond. Because of the insurance, the Bonds in
an Insured Trust receive a "AAA" rating from Standard & Poor's Ratings  Service,
a  division of The  McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. ("STANDARD  & POOR'S") and Fitch
IBCA, Inc. ("FITCH") and "Aaa"  by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.  ("MOODY'S").
Please  note that the insurance relates only  to the Bonds in the Insured Trusts
and not to the Units or the market value of the Units. (See "Why and How are the
Bonds Insured?")


TRADITIONAL TRUSTS.  Each Traditional Trust consists of a diversified  portfolio
of Bonds rated in the category of "A" or better by Standard & Poor's, Moody's or
Fitch.


MINIMUM INVESTMENT--$5,000 or 50 Units, whichever is less.


REDEEMABLE UNITS.  Units of a Trust are redeemable at the offices of the Trustee
at  prices  based upon  the bid  prices of  the  Bonds. (See  "How Units  May be
Redeemed Without Charge.")


DISTRIBUTIONS.  Interest received by a Trust will be paid semi-annually,  unless
you  elect to receive distributions monthly or quarterly. Distributions of funds
in the principal account will ordinarily  be made semi-annually. (See "When  are
Distributions Made to Unitholders?")


PUBLIC  OFFERING PRICE.   Public  Offering Price of  a Trust  during the Initial
Offering Period is based upon the offering prices of the Bonds in the Trust plus
an upfront sales charge. For Units purchased in the secondary market, the Public
Offering Price is based upon the bid  prices of the Bonds in the Trust.  Accrued
interest  on the Bonds in  the Portfolio from the  preceding Record Date to, but
not including, the Settlement Date (normally three business days after purchase)
is added to the Public  Offering Price. (See "How  is the Public Offering  Price
Determined?")




THE  SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE  COMMISSION HAS NOT  APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED OF
THESE  SECURITIES  OR  PASSED  UPON   THE  ADEQUACY  OF  THIS  PROSPECTUS.   ANY
REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.

WHAT IS THE NUVEEN TAX-FREE UNIT TRUST?



This  Nuveen Tax-Free  Unit Trust  is one  of a  series of  separate but similar
investment companies created by  the Sponsor, each of  which is designated by  a
different Series number. The underlying unit investment trusts contained in this
Series   are  combined  under  one   Trust  Indenture  and  Agreement.  Specific
information regarding this Trust is set forth in Part A of this Prospectus.  The
various  Nuveen Tax-Free Unit Trusts are  collectively referred to herein as the
"Trusts"; the trusts in which few or none of the Bonds are insured are sometimes
referred to as the "Traditional  Trusts," the trusts in  which all of the  Bonds
are  insured  as described  herein  are sometimes  referred  to as  the "Insured
Trusts," and  the state  trusts  (both Traditional  and Insured)  are  sometimes
referred to as the "State Trusts." This Series was created under the laws of the
State  of New York pursuant to a Trust Indenture and Agreement dated the Date of
Deposit (the "Indenture") between  John Nuveen &  Co. Incorporated ("Nuveen"  or
the "Sponsor") and The Chase Manhattan Bank (the "Trustee").


Sponsor  has  deposited with  the  Trustee delivery  statements  relating to
contracts for the  purchase of  municipal debt obligations  together with  funds
represented by an irrevocable letter of credit issued by a major commercial bank
in  the amount, including accrued interest,  required for their purchase (or the
obligations themselves) (the "Bonds"). See  "Schedule of Investments" in Part  A
of  this Prospectus, for  a description of  the Bonds deposited  in a Trust. See
"SUMMARY OF PORTFOLIOS" herein  and "RISK FACTORS" in  Part A of the  Prospectus
for  a discussion of zero coupon bonds  and stripped obligations included in the
Trusts, if any. Some of the delivery statements may relate to contracts for  the
purchase  of "when issued" or other Bonds  with delivery dates after the date of
settlement for a  purchase made on  the Date  of Deposit. See  the "Schedule  of
Investments"  in Part A  of this Prospectus  and "COMPOSITION OF  TRUSTS." For a
discussion of  the  Sponsor's obligations  in  the event  of  a failure  of  any
contract  for  the  purchase  of any  of  the  Bonds and  its  limited  right to
substitute other  bonds to  replace  any failed  contract, see  "COMPOSITION  OF
TRUSTS."


Payment  of interest on the Bonds in each Insured Trust, and of principal at
maturity, is guaranteed under policies of  insurance obtained by the Sponsor  or
by  the issuers of  the Bonds. (See "WHY  AND HOW ARE THE  BONDS INSURED?") AS A
GENERAL MATTER, NEITHER THE ISSUER NOR  THE SPONSOR HAS OBTAINED INSURANCE  WITH
RESPECT TO THE BONDS IN ANY TRADITIONAL TRUST.


The  Trustee has delivered  to the Sponsor  registered Units which represent
ownership of  the  entire  Trust,  and  which  are  offered  for  sale  by  this
Prospectus.  Each Unit of a Trust  represents a fractional undivided interest in
the principal and net income of such Trust in the ratio set forth in  "Essential
Information"  in Part A of this Prospectus. Units  may only be sold in states in
which they  are registered.  To  the extent  that any  Units  of any  Trust  are
redeemed by the Trustee, the aggregate value of the Trust's assets will decrease
by  the amount  paid to the  redeeming Unitholder, but  the fractional undivided
interest of each unredeemed  Unit in such  Trust will increase  proportionately.
The  Sponsor will  initially, and  from time to  time thereafter,  hold Units in
connection with their offering.



WHAT ARE THE OBJECTIVES OF THE TRUSTS?



The objectives of the Trusts are income  exempt from Federal income tax and,  in
the  case of State Trusts, where applicable, state income and intangibles taxes,
and conservation of capital, through an  investment in obligations issued by  or
on  behalf of states  and territories of  the United States  and authorities and
political subdivisions thereof,  the interest  on which  is, in  the opinion  of
recognized  bond counsel  to the  issuing governmental  authorities, exempt from
Federal income tax under existing law  and for State Trusts, from certain  state
income  taxes  and intangibles  taxes,  if any,  for  purchasers who  qualify as
residents of that State  in which Bonds are  issued. Insurance guaranteeing  the
timely  payment, when due,  of all principal  and interest on  the Bonds in each
Insured Trust has been obtained by the  Sponsor or by the issuers of such  Bonds
from  MBIA Insurance Corporation, and as a result of such insurance the Bonds in
the Insured Trusts are rated  "Aaa" by Moody's, "AAA"  by Fitch and/or "AAA"  by
Standard & Poor's. (See "WHY AND HOW ARE THE BONDS INSURED?") All obligations in
each  Traditional Trust are rated in the category  "A" or better (SP-1, MIG 2 or
F-2 or better, respectively, in the case of short term obligations included in a
Short Term  Traditional  Trust)  by  Standard &  Poor's,  Moody's  and/or  Fitch
(including  provisional or conditional  ratings). In addition,  certain Bonds in
certain Traditional Trusts may be  covered by insurance guaranteeing the  timely
payment,  when  due, of  all principal  and  interest. There  is, of  course, no
guarantee that the Trusts' objectives will be achieved. For a comparison of  net
after-tax return for various tax brackets, see the "TAXABLE EQUIVALENT ESTIMATED
CURRENT  RETURN TABLES" included in the Appendices to the Information Supplement
of this Prospectus.



SUMMARY OF PORTFOLIOS



In selecting  Bonds for  the  respective Trusts,  the following  factors,  among
others, were considered: (i) the Standard & Poor's, Moody's and/or Fitch ratings
of  the Bonds (see "WHAT ARE THE OBJECTIVES OF THE TRUSTS?" for a description of
minimum rating standards), (ii) the prices of the Bonds relative to other  bonds
of  comparable quality  and maturity, (iii)  the diversification of  Bonds as to
purpose of issue and location of issuer,  (iv) the maturity dates of the  Bonds,
and  (v)  in the  case  of the  Insured Trusts  only,  the availability  of MBIA
Insurance Corporation insurance on such Bonds.  (See "WHY AND HOW ARE THE  BONDS
INSURED?")

Each Trust consists of municipal bonds. As set forth in "RISK FACTORS" in Part A
of  this Prospectus, the Trusts may contain or be concentrated in one or more of
the types of  bonds discussed  below. The following  paragraphs briefly  discuss
certain circumstances which may adversely affect the ability of issuers of Bonds
held  in the portfolio of a Trust to  make payments of principal and interest or
the ratings of such Bonds. For economic risks specific to the individual Trusts,
see "RISK  FACTORS" in  Part A  of this  Prospectus and  the Appendices  to  the
Information Supplement of this Prospectus.


ESCROW  SECURED OBLIGATIONS are  typically secured by  direct obligations of
the U.S.  Government  or  in  some cases  obligations  guaranteed  by  the  U.S.
Government  placed in  an escrow  account maintained  by an  independent trustee
until maturity  or  a  predetermined  redemption  date.  These  obligations  are
generally noncallable prior to maturity or the predetermined redemption date. In
a  few isolated instances, however,  bonds which were thought  to be escrowed to
maturity have been called for redemption prior to maturity.


HEALTH CARE FACILITY OBLIGATIONS are  obligations of issuers whose  revenues
are derived from services provided by hospitals or other health care facilities,
including  nursing  homes. The  ability  of such  issuers  to make  debt service
payments on  these  obligations  is  dependent  on  various  factors,  including
occupancy  levels  of the  facility, demand  for  services, wages  of employees,
overhead  expenses,  competition  from   other  similar  providers,   government
regulation,  the cost of  malpractice insurance, and  the degree of governmental
financial assistance, including Medicare and Medicaid.


HOUSING OBLIGATIONS are obligations of issuers whose revenues are  primarily
derived  from mortgage loans on single family residences or housing projects for
low to moderate income families. Housing obligations are generally prepayable at
any time and  therefore their average  life will ordinarily  be less than  their
stated  maturities. The ability of such issuers to make debt service payments on
these obligations is dependent on  various factors, including occupancy  levels,
rental  income, mortgage default rates,  taxes, operating expenses, governmental
regulations and the appropriation of subsidies.


INDUSTRIAL  REVENUE  OBLIGATIONS  are  industrial  revenue  bonds  ("IRBs"),
including  pollution  control  revenue bonds,  which  are  tax-exempt securities
issued by  states, municipalities,  public authorities  or similar  entities  to
finance  the  cost of  acquiring, constructing  or improving  various industrial
projects. Debt  service  payment on  IRBs  is dependent  upon  various  factors,
including  the creditworthiness of the corporate operator of the project and, if
applicable, corporate guarantor, revenues  generated from the project,  expenses
associated with the project and regulatory and environmental restrictions.


UTILITY  OBLIGATIONS are obligations of issuers whose revenues are primarily
derived from the sale of several types of energy, including electric and natural
gas. The  ability  of  such issuers  to  make  debt service  payments  on  these
obligations is dependent on various factors, including the rates for electricity
and  natural gas,  the demand  for electricity  and natural  gas, the  degree of
competition, governmental regulation, overhead expenses and variable costs, such
as fuel.


TRANSPORTATION FACILITY REVENUE OBLIGATIONS are obligations of issuers which
are payable  from  and  secured  by revenues  derived  from  the  ownership  and
operation  of airports, public transit systems and ports. The ability of issuers
to make  debt  service payments  on  airport  obligations is  dependent  on  the
capability  of airlines to  meet their obligations under  use agreements. Due to
increased competition,  deregulation, increased  fuel costs  and other  factors,
many  airlines may  have difficulty  meeting their  obligations under  these use
agreements. Bonds  that are  secured primarily  by the  revenue collected  by  a
public  transit system typically  are additionally secured by  a pledge of sales
tax receipts collected  at the state  or local level,  or of other  governmental
financial  assistance. The revenue of issuers of transit system obligations will
be affected by variations in utilization, which  in turn may be affected by  the
degree  of  local governmental  subsidization, competition  from other  forms of
transportation, and  increased costs.  Port  authorities derive  their  revenues
primarily  from fees imposed  on ships using the  facilities which may fluctuate
depending on  the local  economy  and on  competition  from competing  forms  of
transportation  such  as air,  rail and  trucks. The  revenues of  issuers which
derive their  payments  from bridge,  road  or  tunnel toll  revenues  could  be
adversely  affected  by  increases  in fuel  costs,  competition  from toll-free
vehicular bridges and roads and alternative modes of transportation.


WATER AND/OR SEWERAGE OBLIGATIONS are obligations of issuers whose  revenues
are  payable from user fees from the sale of water and/or sewerage services. The
problems  of  such  issuers  include  the  ability  to  obtain  rate  increases,
population  declines,  the limitations  on  operations and  increased  costs and
delays attributable to environmental considerations, the difficulties  obtaining
new supplies of fresh water, the effect of conservation programs and "no-growth"
zoning ordinances.


UNIVERSITY  AND COLLEGE REVENUE OBLIGATIONS are obligations of issuers whose
revenues are  derived  mainly  from  tuition,  dormitory  revenues,  grants  and
endowments.  General  problems faced  by such  issuers  include declines  in the
number of "college" age  individuals, possible inability  to raise tuitions  and
fees,  the uncertainty of continued receipt of Federal grants and state funding,
and government  legislation  or  regulations  which  may  adversely  affect  the
revenues or costs of such issuers.


DEDICATED-TAX  SUPPORTED OBLIGATIONS  are obligations  of issuers  which are
payable from  and  secured by  tax  revenues  from a  designated  source,  which
revenues  are pledged to secure the bonds.  The various types of Bonds described


5





below differ in structure and with respect  to the rights of the bondholders  to
the  underlying property. Each type of dedicated-tax supported Bond has distinct
risks, only  some  of which  are  set forth  below.  One type  of  dedicated-tax
supported  Bond  is  secured by  the  incremental  tax received  on  either real
property or on sales within a  specifically defined geographical area; such  tax
generally will not provide bondholders with a lien on the underlying property or
revenues.  Another type of dedicated-tax supported  Bond is secured by a special
tax levied on real property within a defined geographical area in such a  manner
that  the  tax is  levied  on those  who benefit  from  the project;  such bonds
typically provide for  a statutory lien  on the underlying  property for  unpaid
taxes.  A third  type of dedicated-tax  supported Bond  may be secured  by a tax
levied upon the  manufacture, sale  or consumption  of commodities  or upon  the
license  to pursue  certain occupations  or upon  corporate privileges  within a
taxing jurisdiction. As  to any  of these  types of  Bonds, the  ability of  the
designated revenues to satisfy the interest and principal payments on such bonds
may  be affected by changes  in the local economy,  the financial success of the
enterprise responsible for the payment of  the taxes, the value of any  property
on which taxes may be assessed and the ability to collect such taxes in a timely
fashion.  Each of these  factors will have  a different affect  on each distinct
type of dedicated-tax supported bonds.


MUNICIPAL LEASE  OBLIGATIONS  are  obligations that  are  secured  by  lease
payments  of a  governmental entity  and are  normally subject  to annual budget
appropriations of the  leasing governmental entity.  A governmental entity  that
enters  into  such  a  lease agreement  cannot  obligate  future  governments to
appropriate for and make lease payments but covenants to take such action as  is
necessary  to include  any lease  payments due  in its  budgets and  to make the
appropriations therefor. A governmental entity's failure to appropriate for  and
to  make payments under its lease  obligation could result in insufficient funds
available for payment of the obligations secured thereby.


ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT OBLIGATIONS AND STRIPPED OBLIGATIONS are bonds which
were issued with  nominal interest  rates less than  the rates  then offered  by
comparable  securities and as  a consequence were originally  sold at a discount
from their face,  or par,  values. In a  stable interest  rate environment,  the
market  value of  an original  issue discount bond  would tend  to increase more
slowly in early years and in greater increments as the bond approached maturity.


Certain of the original  issue discount obligations in  a Trust may be  zero
coupon  bonds. Zero coupon bonds  do not provide for  the payment of any current
interest; the buyer receives only  the right to receive  a final payment of  the
face  amount  of the  bond at  its maturity.  Zero coupon  bonds are  subject to
substantially greater  price  fluctuations  during periods  of  changing  market
interest  rates  than are  securities of  comparable  quality that  pay interest
currently.


Original issue discount  obligations, including  zero coupon  bonds, may  be
subject  to redemption  at prices based  on the  issue price plus  the amount of
original issue discount accreted to  redemption (the "accreted value") plus,  if
applicable,  some premium. Pursuant  to such call  provisions, an original issue
discount bond may be called prior to its maturity date at a price less than  its
face  value.  See the  "Schedule of  Investments"  appearing in  Part A  of this
Prospectus for more information about the call provisions of portfolio Bonds.


Certain of the Bonds in a Trust may be stripped obligations, which represent
evidences of  ownership with  respect to  either the  principal amount  of or  a
payment  of interest on  a tax-exempt obligation  ("Stripped Obligations"). Each
Stripped Obligation has been purchased at a discount from the amount payable  at
maturity.  A Stripped Obligation therefore  has economic characteristics similar
to zero coupon bonds, as described above.


Unitholders should consult their own tax advisers with respect to the  state
and  local tax consequences of owning  original issue discount bonds or Stripped
Obligations. Under applicable  provisions governing determination  of state  and
local  taxes,  interest  on  original  issue  discount  obligations  or Stripped
Obligations may be  deemed to be  received in  the year of  accrual even  though
there is no corresponding cash payment.



COMPOSITION OF TRUSTS



Each  Trust initially consists  of delivery statements  relating to contracts to
purchase Bonds (or of such Bonds) as are listed under "Schedule of  Investments"
in  Part A of this Prospectus and, thereafter,  of such Bonds as may continue to
be held from time to time  (including certain securities deposited in the  Trust
in  substitution  for  Bonds  not  delivered  to  a  Trust  or  in  exchange  or
substitution for  Bonds  upon certain  refundings),  together with  accrued  and
undistributed   interest  thereon  and  undistributed  cash  realized  from  the
disposition of Bonds.


"WHEN-ISSUED"  AND  "DELAYED  DELIVERY"  TRANSACTIONS.    The  contracts  to
purchase  Bonds delivered to  the Trustee represent an  obligation by issuers or
dealers to deliver Bonds to  the Sponsor for deposit  in the Trusts. Certain  of
the  contracts relate  to Bonds  which have not  been issued  as of  the Date of
Deposit and which are commonly referred to as "when issued" or "when, as and  if
issued"  Bonds. Although  the Sponsor  believes it  unlikely, if  such Bonds, or
replacement bonds  described below,  are not  acquired by  a Trust  or if  their
delivery  is  delayed, the  Estimated Current  Returns  and Estimated  Long Term
Returns shown  in Part  A of  this Prospectus  may be  reduced. Certain  of  the
contracts for the purchase of Bonds provide for delivery dates after the date of
settlement  for purchases made  on the Date  of Deposit. Interest  on such "when
issued" and  "delayed delivery"  Bonds  accrues to  the benefit  of  Unitholders
commencing with the first settlement


6





date for the Units. However, in the opinion of counsel, Unitholders who purchase
their  Units prior to the date such  Bonds are actually delivered to the Trustee
must reduce the tax  basis of their  Units for interest  accruing on such  Bonds
during  the interval  between their  purchase of Units  and the  delivery of the
Bonds because such amounts constitute a return of principal. As a result of such
adjustment, the Estimated Current Returns set forth in Part A of this Prospectus
(which are based on the  Public Offering Price as of  the business day prior  to
the  Date of  Deposit) may  be slightly lower  than that  which Unitholders will
receive after  the  first year,  assuming  the  Portfolio does  not  change  and
estimated  annual expense  does not  vary from  that set  forth under "Essential
Information" in Part A of this  Prospectus. Those Bonds in each Trust  purchased
with  delivery dates after the date of settlement for purchases made on the Date
of Deposit are  so noted  in the  "Schedule of Investments"  in Part  A of  this
Prospectus.


LIMITED  REPLACEMENT OF CERTAIN BONDS.   Neither the Sponsor nor the Trustee
shall be liable in any  way for any default, failure  or defect in any Bond.  In
the  event of a failure to deliver any  Bond that has been purchased for a Trust
under a contract, including those  Bonds purchased on a  when, as and if  issued
basis  ("Failed Bonds"), the Sponsor is authorized under the Indenture to direct
the Trustee to acquire  other specified Bonds ("Replacement  Bonds") to make  up
the  original corpus of the Trust within 20 days after delivery of notice of the
failed contract and the  cost to the Trust  (exclusive of accrued interest)  may
not  exceed the amount of  funds reserved for the  purchase of the Failed Bonds.
The Replacement Bonds  must satisfy  the criteria previously  described for  the
Trusts  and shall be substantially identical to the Failed Bonds they replace in
terms of (i) the exemption from  federal and state taxation; (ii) maturity  and;

(iii)  cost to the Trust. In addition,  Replacement Bonds shall not be "when, as
and if issued" Bonds. Whenever a Replacement Bond has been acquired for a Trust,
the Trustee shall, within five days after the delivery thereof, mail or  deliver
a  notice of such acquisition to all Unitholders of the Trust involved. Once the
original corpus of the Trust is acquired, the Trustee will have no power to vary
the investment of the Trust.


To the extent Replacement Bonds are  not acquired, the Sponsor shall  refund
to  all Unitholders of the Trust involved  the sales charge attributable to such
Failed Bonds not replaced, and  the principal and accrued interest  attributable
to such Bonds shall be distributed not more than 30 days after the determination
of  such failure or at  such earlier time as the  Trustee in its sole discretion
deems to be in the interest of  the Unitholders. Any such accrued interest  paid
to Unitholders will be paid by the Sponsor and, accordingly, will not be treated
as  tax-exempt  income.  In the  event  Failed Bonds  in  a Trust  could  not be
replaced, the  Net Annual  Interest Income  per  Unit for  such Trust  would  be
reduced and the Estimated Current Return thereon might be lowered.


SALE,  MATURITY AND REDEMPTION OF BONDS.  Certain of the Bonds may from time
to time  under certain  circumstances be  sold  or redeemed  or will  mature  in
accordance  with their terms. The proceeds from  such events will be used to pay
for  Units  redeemed   or  distributed  to   Unitholders  and  not   reinvested;
accordingly,  no assurance can be given that  a Trust will retain for any length
of time its present size and composition.


All of the Bonds in  each Trust are subject to  being called or redeemed  in
whole  or in  part prior  to their  stated maturities  pursuant to  the optional
redemption provisions described in  the "Schedule of Investments"  in Part A  of
this  Prospectus and  in most  cases pursuant  to a  sinking fund  or special or
extraordinary redemption provisions. See the discussion of the various types  of
bond  issues,  above, for  information  on the  call  provisions of  such bonds,
particularly single family  mortgage revenue  bonds. Certain Bonds  may carry  a
"mandatory  put"  (also  referred  to  as  a  "mandatory  tender"  or "mandatory
repurchase") feature pursuant  to which the  holder of such  Bonds will  receive
payment  of the  full principal  amount thereof  on a  stated date  prior to the
maturity date unless  such holder  affirmatively acts  to retain  the Bond.  The
Trustee  does not have the authority to  act to retain Bonds with such features;
accordingly, it will receive  payment of the full  principal amount of any  such
Bonds  on the stated put date and such date is therefore treated as the maturity
date of such Bonds in selecting Bonds for the respective Trusts and for purposes
of calculating the average maturity of the Bonds in any Trust.


The exercise of redemption or call provisions will (except to the extent the
proceeds of the called Bonds are used to pay for Unit redemptions) result in the
distribution of  principal  and may  result  in a  reduction  in the  amount  of
subsequent  interest distributions;  it may  also affect  the current  return on
Units of the Trust  involved. The exercise of  redemption or call provisions  is
more  likely  to occur  in  situations where  the  Bonds have  an  offering side
evaluation which represents a  premium over par (as  opposed to a discount  from
par).  (In  the  case  of  original issue  discount  bonds,  such  redemption is
generally to  be made  at the  issue price  plus the  amount of  original  issue
discount accreted to the date of redemption; such price is referred to herein as
"accreted  value"). Because Bonds may have been  valued at prices above or below
par value or the then current accreted  value at the time Units were  purchased,
Unitholders  may realize  gain or loss  upon the redemption  of portfolio Bonds.

(See "WHAT IS THE TAX STATUS  OF UNITHOLDERS?" and "WHEN ARE DISTRIBUTIONS  MADE

TO  UNITHOLDERS?" in Part B and the "Schedule  of Investments" in Part A of this
Prospectus.)


CERTAIN TAX  MATTERS;  LITIGATION.    Certain of  the  Bonds  in  a  Trust's
portfolio  may be subject to continuing requirements regarding the actual use of
bond proceeds,  the  manner of  operation  of  the project  financed  from  bond
proceeds  or the rebate  of excess earnings  on bond proceeds,  any of which may
affect   the   exemption    of   interest   on    such   Bonds   from    Federal


7





income  taxation. Although at the time of issuance  of each of the Bonds in each
Trust an opinion of bond counsel was rendered as to the exemption of interest on
such obligations from  Federal income  taxation, and the  issuers covenanted  to
comply  with all requirements  necessary to retain the  tax-exempt status of the
Bonds, there can be no assurance  that the respective issuers or other  obligors
on such obligations will fulfill the various continuing requirements established
upon issuance of the Bonds. A failure to comply with such requirements may cause
a  determination that interest on such  obligations is subject to Federal income
taxation, perhaps even retroactively  from the date of  issuance of such  Bonds,
thereby   reducing  the  value  of  the  Bonds  and  subjecting  Unitholders  to
unanticipated tax liabilities.


To the best knowledge of the Sponsor,  there is no litigation pending as  of
the  Date of Deposit in respect of  any Bonds which might reasonably be expected
to have a  material adverse effect  on any of  the Trusts. It  is possible  that
after  the Date of Deposit, litigation may be initiated with respect to Bonds in
any Trust. Any  such litigation may  affect the  validity of such  Bonds or  the
tax-exempt  nature of the interest thereon,  but while the outcome of litigation
of such nature can never be entirely predicted, the opinions of bond counsel  to
the  issuer of  each Bond  on the date  of issuance  state that  such Bonds were
validly issued and that the interest thereon is, to the extent indicated, exempt
from Federal income tax.



WHY AND HOW ARE THE BONDS INSURED?



Insurance guaranteeing  the  timely payment,  when  due, of  all  principal  and
interest  on the Bonds in each Insured Trust has been obtained by the Sponsor or
by the issuers or underwriters of the Bonds from the MBIA Insurance  Corporation
(the  "Insurer"). Certain of the  Bonds in an Insured Trust  may be covered by a
policy or policies of insurance obtained  by the issuers or underwriters of  the
Bonds  from  Municipal Bond  Insurance Association  (the "Association")  or Bond
Investors Guaranty Insurance Company ("BIG"). The claims-paying ability of  both
the  Insurer  and the  Association was  rated  "AAA Prime  Grade" by  Standard &
Poor's. Moody's  rates all  bond issues  insured by  either the  Insurer or  the
Association  "Aaa" and short-term loans "MIG  1." Fitch, upon request, rates all
bond issues insured by the Insurer or the Association "AAA" and short-term loans
"F-1." All such ratings designate the highest quality. The Insurer has issued  a
policy  or  policies of  insurance covering  each  of the  Bonds in  the Insured
Trusts, each policy to remain in force  until the payment in full of such  Bonds
and  whether or not  the Bonds continue to  be held by an  Insured Trust. By the
terms of each policy the Insurer  will unconditionally guarantee to the  holders
or  owners of  the Bonds the  payment, when due,  required of the  issuer of the
Bonds of an amount equal to the principal  of and interest on the Bonds as  such
payments  shall become  due but  not be paid  (except that  in the  event of any
acceleration of the  due date of  principal by reason  of mandatory or  optional
redemption,  default or otherwise, the payments  guaranteed will be made in such
amounts and  at  such times  as  would  have been  due  had there  not  been  an
acceleration).


Insurance  guaranteeing the timely  payment, when due,  of all principal and
interest on certain Bonds in a Traditional  Trust may have been obtained by  the
Sponsor,  issuer or underwriter  of the particular Bonds  involved or by another
party. Such insurance, which  provides coverage substantially  the same as  that
obtained  with  respect  to  Bonds  in Insured  Trusts  as  described  above, is
effective so long as the insured Bond is outstanding and the insurer remains  in
business.  Insurance relates only  to the particular  Bond and not  to the Units
offered hereby or to their market value. Insured Bonds have received a rating of
"Aaa" by  Moody's,  "AAA"  by  Fitch  and/or  "AAA"  by  Standard  &  Poor's  in
recognition of such insurance.


If  a Bond in a Traditional Trust  is insured, the "Schedule of Investments"
appearing in Part A of this Prospectus  will identify the insurer. There can  be
no  assurance  that any  insurer  listed therein  will  be able  to  satisfy its
commitments in the  event claims  are made in  the future.  However, Standard  &
Poor's,  Fitch  and/or  Moody's have  rated  the claims-paying  ability  of each
insurer "AAA," "AAA" or "Aaa," respectively.


The Insurer is the principal operating subsidiary of MBIA, Inc., a New  York
Stock  Exchange listed company. MBIA, Inc. is  not obligated to pay the debts of
or claims against the Insurer. The Insurer is domiciled in the State of New York
and licensed to do business in and  subject to regulation under the laws of  all
50  states,  the District  of  Columbia, the  Commonwealth  of Puerto  Rico, the
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands,  the Virgin Islands of the  United
States  and the Territory of Guam. The Insurer has two European branches, one in
the Republic of France and the other in the Kingdom of Spain. New York has  laws
prescribing minimum capital requirements, limiting classes and concentrations of
investments  and requiring  the approval of  policy rates and  forms. State laws
also regulate the amount of both the aggregate and individual risks that may  be
insured,  the  payment  of dividends  by  the  insurer, changes  in  control and
transactions among affiliates. Additionally, the Insurer is required to maintain
contingency reserves  on its  liabilities  in certain  amounts and  for  certain
periods of time.


Effective  February 17,  1998, MBIA,  Inc. acquired  all of  the outstanding
stock of Capital Markets  Assurance Corporation ("CMAC"),  a New York  domiciled
financial  guarantee insurance company, through a merger with its parent, CapMAC
Holdings, Inc. Pursuant to  a reinsurance agreement, CMAC  has ceded all of  its
net  insured  risks  (including any  amounts  due  but unpaid  from  third party
reinsurers), as well as its unearned  premiums and contingency reserves, to  the
Insurer.  The Company  is not obligated  to pay  the debts of  or claims against
CMAC.

Insurance  companies  are subject  to  extensive regulation  and supervision
where they  do  business  by  state insurance  commissioners  who  regulate  the
standards of solvency which must be maintained, the nature of and limitations on
investments, reports of financial condition, and requirements regarding reserves
for  unearned premiums, losses  and other matters. A  significant portion of the
assets of insurance companies is required by  law to be held in reserve  against
potential claims on policies and is not available to general creditors. Although
the  federal government  does not  regulate the  business of  insurance, federal
initiatives including  pension  regulation,  controls  on  medical  care  costs,
minimum  standards for no-fault automobile insurance, national health insurance,
tax law changes affecting life insurance  companies and repeal of the  antitrust
exemption  for  the insurance  business can  significantly impact  the insurance
business.


The above ratings are  not recommendations to buy,  sell or hold the  Bonds,
and  such ratings may  be subject to revision  or withdrawal at  any time by the
rating agencies. Any downward revision or  withdrawal of either or both  ratings
may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Bonds. See the Information
Supplement for further information concerning insurance.


Because the insurance on the Bonds, if any, will be effective so long as the
Bonds  are outstanding, such insurance will be taken into account in determining
the market value  of the  Bonds and therefore  some value  attributable to  such
insurance  will be included in the value of the Units of the Insured Trusts. The
insurance does not, however, guarantee the market  value of the Bonds or of  the
Units.



HOW IS THE PUBLIC OFFERING PRICE DETERMINED?



The  Public Offering Price of the Units of  each Trust is equal to the Trustee's
determination of the aggregate  OFFERING prices of  the Bonds deposited  therein
(minus  any  advancement to  the  principal account  of  the Trust  made  by the
Trustee) plus a sales charge set forth  in "Essential Information" in Part A  of
this  Prospectus, in  each case  adding to  the total  thereof cash  held by the
Trust, if  any,  and  dividing the  sum  so  obtained by  the  number  of  Units
outstanding in the Trust. See "UNIT VALUE AND EVALUATION."


The  sales charge applicable to quantity purchases is reduced on a graduated
scale for sales to any  purchaser of at least $50,000  or 500 Units and will  be
applied  on whichever basis is more favorable  to the purchaser. For purposes of
calculating the applicable  sales charge,  purchasers who  have indicated  their
intent  to purchase a specified  amount of Units of any  Trust in the primary or
secondary offering period by executing and delivering a letter of intent to  the
Sponsor,  which letter of intent must be in a form acceptable to the Sponsor and
shall have a maximum duration of thirteen months, will be eligible to receive  a
reduced  sales charge according to  the following tables based  on the amount of
intended aggregate  purchases as  expressed  in the  letter  of intent.  Due  to
administrative  limitations and in  order to permit  adequate tracking, the only
secondary market  purchases that  will be  permitted to  be applied  toward  the
intended specified amount and that will

receive the corresponding reduced sales charge are those Units that are acquired
through  or from the Sponsor.  By establishing a letter  of intent, a Unitholder
agrees that the first purchase of  Units following the execution of such  letter
of  intent will  be at least  5% of the  total amount of  the intended aggregate
purchases expressed in such Unitholder's letter of intent. Further, through  the
establishment  of  the  letter  of intent,  such  Unitholder  agrees  that Units
representing 5% of the total  amount of the intended  purchases will be held  in
escrow  by the Trustee pending completion  of these purchases. All distributions
on Units held in escrow will be credited to such Unitholder's account. If  total
purchases prior to the expiration of the letter of intent period equal or exceed
the  amount specified  in a  Unitholder's letter  of intent,  the Units  held in
escrow will  be  transferred to  such  Unitholder's account.  A  Unitholder  who
purchases  Units during the letter  of intent period in  excess of the number of
Units specified in a  Unitholder's letter of intent,  the amount of which  would
cause  the  Unitholder to  be  eligible to  receive  an additional  sales charge
reduction, will  be  allowed  such  additional sales  charge  reduction  on  the
purchase of Units which caused the Unitholder to reach such new breakpoint level
and  on all additional purchases of Units during the letter of intent period. If
the total purchases are less than the amount specified, the Unitholder  involved
must  pay the Sponsor an amount equal to the difference between the amounts paid
for these purchases and  the amounts which  would have been  paid if the  higher
sales  charge had been applied; the Unitholder will, however, be entitled to any
reduced sales charge qualified  for by reaching any  lower breakpoint level.  If
such  Unitholder does not pay the additional amount within 20 days after written
request by  the  Sponsor  or the  Unitholder's  securities  representative,  the
Sponsor  will  instruct  the Trustee  to  redeem  an appropriate  number  of the
escrowed Units to meet the required payment. By establishing a letter of intent,
a Unitholder irrevocably appoints the  Sponsor as attorney to give  instructions
to  redeem any or  all of such  Unitholder's escrowed Units,  with full power of
substitution in the premises. A Unitholder or his securities representative must
notify the Sponsor whenever  such Unitholder makes a  purchase of Units that  he
wishes  to  be counted  towards the  intended amount.  Sales charges  during the
primary offering period are as follows:

*Breakpoint sales charges are computed both on  a dollar basis and on the  basis
of the number of Units purchased, using the equivalent of 500 Units to $50,000,
2,500  Units to $250,000 etc., and will be  applied on that basis which is more
favorable to the purchaser.


For "secondary market"  sales the  Public Offering  Price per  Unit of  each
Trust is determined by adding to the Trustee's determination of the BID price of
each  Bond in the Trust  a sales charge determined  in accordance with the table
set forth below based upon the number of years remaining to the maturity of each
such Bond. See "UNIT VALUE AND EVALUATION."  The effect of this method of  sales
charge  calculation will be that different sales charge rates will be applied to
the various Bonds in a Trust portfolio based upon the maturities of such  Bonds.
As shown, the sales charge on Bonds in each


10





maturity  range (and  therefore the aggregate  sales charge on  the purchase) is
reduced with respect to purchases of at least $50,000 or 500 Units:

*Breakpoint sales charges are computed both on a dollar basis and on the  basis
of  the  number of  Units  purchased, using  the  equivalent of  500  Units to

which is more favorable to the purchaser.


The  secondary market sales charges above  are expressed as a percent of
the net amount invested;  expressed as a percent  of the Public Offering  Price,
the  maximum sales charge  on a Trust,  for instance one  consisting entirely of
Bonds with 16  years or  more to  maturity, would be  5.50% (5.820%  of the  net
amount  invested).  The actual  secondary market  sales  charge included  in the
Public Offering Price of any particular  Trust will depend on the maturities  of
the Bonds in the portfolio of such Trust.


Pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the Trustee may terminate a Trust if
the  net asset value of such Trust, as shown by any evaluation, is less than 20%
of the original principal amount of the Trust.


At all  times while  Units are  being  offered for  sale, the  Sponsor  will
appraise  or cause to  be appraised daily  the value of  the underlying Bonds in
each Trust as of 4:00 p.m. eastern time, or as of any earlier closing time on  a
day  on  which the  New York  Stock  Exchange (the  "Exchange") is  scheduled in
advance to close at such earlier time and will adjust the Public Offering  Price
of  the Units commensurate with such  appraisal. Such Public Offering Price will
be effective for all orders received by a  dealer or the Sponsor at or prior  to
4:00  p.m. eastern time on each such day or  as of any earlier closing time on a
day on which the Exchange is scheduled in advance to close at such earlier time.
Orders received after that time, or on a  day when the Exchange is closed for  a
scheduled  holiday  or weekend,  will be  held until  the next  determination of
price.


Accrued interest from the preceding Record  Date to, but not including,  the
settlement  date of the transaction (three business days after purchase) will be
added to the Public Offering Price to determine the purchase price of Units. See
"WHAT IS ACCRUED INTEREST?"


The graduated sales  charges set forth  above will apply  on all  applicable
purchases  of Nuveen investment  company securities on  any one day  by the same
purchaser in the amounts stated, and  for this purpose purchases of this  Series
will be aggregated with concurrent purchases of any other Series or of shares of
any  open-end management  investment company of  which the  Sponsor is principal
underwriter and with respect to the purchase of which a sales charge is imposed.
Purchases by  or for  the account  of individuals  and their  spouses,  parents,
children, grandchildren, grandparents, parents-in-law, sons- and
daughters-in-law,   siblings,  a  sibling's  spouse   and  a  spouse's  siblings
("immediate family  members") will  be aggregated  to determine  the  applicable
sales  charge. The graduated sales  charges are also applicable  to a trustee or
other fiduciary  purchasing  securities for  a  single trust  estate  or  single
fiduciary account. Units may be purchased at the Public Offering Price without a
sales  charge by officers or directors and  by bona fide, full-time employees of
Nuveen, Nuveen Advisory Corp., Nuveen Institutional Advisory Corp. and The  John
Nuveen  Company, including  in each case  these individuals  and their immediate
family members (as defined above).


Units may be purchased in the primary market with sales charges of 1.70%  of
the  Public Offering Price for National and State Long Term Trusts, 1.35% of the
Public Offering Price for Long Intermediate Trusts, 1.20% of the Public Offering
Price for National and  State Intermediate Trusts, 1.0%  of the Public  Offering
Price  for National and State  Short Intermediate Trusts and  1.0% of the Public
Offering Price for Short Term Trusts by (1) investors who purchase Units through
registered investment  advisers,  certified financial  planners  and  registered
broker-dealers  who  in  each case  either  charge periodic  fees  for financial
planning, investment  advisory or  asset management  services, or  provide  such
services in connection with the establishment of an investment account for which
a  comprehensive  "wrap  fee"  charge is  imposed,  (2)  bank  trust departments
investing funds  over which  they  exercise exclusive  discretionary  investment
authority  and  that  are held  in  a  fiduciary, agency,  custodial  or similar
capacity, (3) any person who for at least 90 days, has been an officer, director
or bona fide employee of any firm offering Units for sale to investors or  their
immediate  family members (as  defined above) and (4)  officers and directors of
bank  holding  companies   that  make  Units   available  directly  or   through
subsidiaries  or bank affiliates (collectively,  the "Discounted Purchases"). In
addition, such  investors may  purchase Units  in the  secondary market  at  the


11





Public  Offering  Price for  non-breakpoint purchases  minus the  concession the
Sponsor typically allows  to brokers and  dealers for non-breakpoint  purchases.
Notwithstanding  anything  to the  contrary  in this  Prospectus,  investors who
purchase Units as  described in  this paragraph  will not  receive sales  charge
reductions for quantity purchases.


The  initial or primary Public Offering Price  of the Units in each Trust is
based upon a pro rata share of the OFFERING prices per Unit of the Bonds in such
Trust plus the  applicable sales  charge. The secondary  market Public  Offering
Price of each Trust is based upon a pro rata share of the BID prices per Unit of
the Bonds in such Trust plus the applicable sales charge. The OFFERING prices of
Bonds in a Trust may be expected to average between 1/2% to 2% more than the BID
prices  of such Bonds.  The difference between  the bid side  evaluation and the
offering side evaluation of the Bonds in each Trust on the business day prior to
the Date of Deposit is shown in the discussion of each Trust portfolio.


Whether or not Units are being offered for sale, the Sponsor will  determine
the aggregate value of each Trust as of 4:00 p.m. eastern time: (i) on each June
30 or December 31 (or, if such date is not a business day, the last business day
prior  thereto), (ii) on any day on which  a Unit is tendered for redemption (or
the next succeeding business day  if the date of  tender is a non-business  day)
and (iii) at such other times as may be necessary. For this purpose, a "business
day"  shall be any day on which the  Exchange is normally open. (See "UNIT VALUE
AND EVALUATION.")



MARKET FOR UNITS



During the  initial public  offering period,  the Sponsor  intends to  offer  to
purchase  Units of each  Trust at a price  equivalent to the  pro rata share per
Unit of the OFFERING prices of the Bonds in such Trust (plus accrued  interest).
Afterward,  although  it is  not  obligated to  do  so, the  Sponsor  intends to
maintain a secondary  market for  Units of  each Trust  at its  own expense  and
continuously  to offer  to purchase  Units of each  Trust at  prices, subject to
change at  any time,  which  are based  upon  the BID  prices  of Bonds  in  the
respective  portfolios of the  Trusts. UNITHOLDERS WHO WISH  TO DISPOSE OF THEIR
UNITS SHOULD INQUIRE OF THE TRUSTEE OR THEIR BROKER AS TO THE CURRENT REDEMPTION
PRICE. (See "HOW UNITS MAY BE REDEEMED WITHOUT CHARGE?") In connection with  its
secondary  marketmaking activities, the Sponsor may from time to time enter into
secondary market  joint  account  agreements with  other  brokers  and  dealers.
Pursuant  to such an agreement, the Sponsor  will purchase Units from the broker
or dealer at the bid price and will place the Units into a joint account managed
by the Sponsor; sales from the account will be made in accordance with the  then
current  prospectus and the Sponsor and the  broker or dealer will share profits
and losses in  the joint account  in accordance  with the terms  of their  joint
account agreement.


Certificates,  if any, for Units are  delivered to the purchaser as promptly
after the date of settlement (three business days after purchase) as the Trustee
can complete  the mechanics  of  registration, normally  within 48  hours  after
registration instructions are received. Purchasers of Units to whom Certificates
are  issued will be unable  to exercise any right  of redemption until they have
received their Certificates, properly endorsed for transfer. (See "HOW UNITS MAY
BE REDEEMED WITHOUT CHARGE?")



WHAT IS ACCRUED INTEREST?



Accrued interest is the accumulation of unpaid interest on a bond from the  last
day  on which  interest thereon  was paid.  Interest on  Bonds in  each Trust is
accounted for daily on an accrual basis. For this reason, the purchase price  of
Units  of a Trust will  include not only the Public  Offering Price but also the
proportionate share  of accrued  interest  to the  date of  settlement.  Accrued
interest  does not  include accrual  of original  issue discount  on zero coupon
bonds, Stripped Obligations  or other  original issue  discount bonds.  Interest
accrues  to the  benefit of Unitholders  commencing with the  settlement date of
their purchase transaction.


In an effort to reduce the  amount of accrued interest that investors  would
have  to pay in addition to the Public Offering Price, the Trustee has agreed to
advance to each Trust the amount of accrued interest due on the Bonds as of  the
Date  of Deposit (which has been designated  the first Record Date for all plans
of distribution).  This accrued  interest will  be paid  to the  Sponsor as  the
holder  of record of all Units on  the Date of Deposit. Consequently, the amount
of accrued interest  to be  added to  the Public  Offering Price  of Units  will
include  only accrued interest from  the Date of Deposit  to, but not including,
the date of  settlement of the  investor's purchase (three  business days  after
purchase), less any distributions from the related Interest Account. The Trustee
will  recover its  advancements (without interest  or other cost  to the Trusts)
from interest received on the Bonds deposited in each Trust.


The Trustee has no  cash for distribution to  Unitholders until it  receives
interest  payments on the Bonds in the  Trusts. Since municipal bond interest is
accrued daily but  paid only  semi-annually, during  the initial  months of  the
Trusts,  the Interest Accounts,  consisting of accrued  but uncollected interest
and collected interest  (cash), will  be predominantly  the uncollected  accrued
interest that is not available for distribution. However, due to advances by the
Trustee,  the Trustee will provide a first distribution between approximately 30
and 60 days after the Date of Deposit. Assuming each Trust retains its  original
size  and composition  and expenses  and fees  remain the  same, annual interest
collected and distributed  will approximate  the estimated  Net Annual  Interest
Income  stated herein. However, the  amount of accrued interest  at any point in
time


12





will be greater than the amount that the Trustee will have actually received and
distributed to the Unitholders. Therefore, there  will always remain an item  of
accrued interest that is included in the Purchase Price and the redemption price
of the Units.


Interest  is accounted  for daily and  a proportionate share  of accrued and
undistributed interest computed from the preceding  Record Date is added to  the
daily  valuation of each Unit of each Trust.  (See Part A of this Prospectus and
"WHEN ARE DISTRIBUTIONS MADE TO UNITHOLDERS?") As Bonds mature, or are  redeemed
or  sold,  the  accrued  interest  applicable to  such  bonds  is  collected and
subsequently distributed to Unitholders. Unitholders who sell or redeem all or a
portion of their Units will be  paid their proportionate share of the  remaining
accrued  interest to,  but not including,  the third business  day following the
date of sale or tender.



WHAT ARE ESTIMATED LONG TERM RETURN AND ESTIMATED CURRENT RETURN?



The Estimated Long Term Return for each Trust is a measure of the return to  the
investor  expected  to be  earned  over the  estimated  life of  the  Trust. The
Estimated Long Term Return represents an  average of the yields to maturity  (or
call)  of  the Bonds  in  the Trust's  portfolio  calculated in  accordance with
accepted bond practice and adjusted to reflect expenses and sales charges. Under
accepted bond practice, tax-exempt bonds are customarily offered to investors on
a "yield price" basis, which involves computation of yield to maturity or to  an
earlier  call date  (whichever produces the  lower yield), and  which takes into
account not only the interest payable on the bonds but also the amortization  or
accretion  of  any premium  over,  or discount  from,  the par  (maturity) value
inherent in the bond's purchase price. In the calculation of Estimated Long Term
Return, the average yield for a  Trust's portfolio is derived by weighting  each
Bond's yield by the market value of the Bond and by the amount of time remaining
to  the date to  which the Bond is  priced. This weighted  average yield is then
adjusted to  reflect estimated  expenses, is  compounded, and  is reduced  by  a
factor  which represents the amortization of  the sales charge over the expected
average life of  a Trust. The  Estimated Long Term  Return calculation does  not
take  into account the effect  of a first distribution which  may be less than a
regular distribution or may  be paid at  some point after 30  days (or a  second
distribution  which may be  less than a normal  distribution for Unitholders who
choose quarterly or  semi-annual plans of  distribution), and it  also does  not
take into account the difference in timing of payments to Unitholders who choose
quarterly  or semi-annual plans  of distribution, each of  which will reduce the
return.


Estimated Current Return  is computed  by dividing the  Net Annual  Interest
Income per Unit by the Public Offering Price. In contrast to Estimated Long Term
Return, Estimated Current Return does not reflect the amortization of premium or
accretion  of discount, if any, on the  Bonds in a Trust's portfolio. Net Annual
Interest Income per Unit is calculated by dividing the annual interest income to
a Trust, less estimated expenses, by the number of Units outstanding.


Net Annual Interest  Income per  Unit, used to  calculate Estimated  Current
Return,  will vary  with changes  in fees  and expenses  of the  Trustee and the
Evaluator and  with the  redemption,  maturity, exchange  or  sale of  Bonds.  A
Unitholder's  actual return may vary  significantly from the Estimated Long-Term
Return, based  on their  holding  period, market  interest rate  changes,  other
factors  affecting  the  prices  of  individual  bonds  in  the  portfolio,  and
differences between  the expected  remaining  life of  portfolio bonds  and  the
actual  length of time that they remain  in a Trust; such actual holding periods
may be reduced by termination of  a Trust, as described in "OTHER  INFORMATION."
Since  both  the Estimated  Current Return  and the  Estimated Long  Term Return
quoted herein are  based on  the market  value of  the underlying  Bonds on  the
business  day prior  to the  Date of  Deposit, subsequent  calculations of these
performance  measures  will  reflect  the  then  current  market  value  of  the
underlying  Bonds and may be higher or lower. The Sponsor will provide estimated
cash flow  information relating  to a  Trust without  charge to  each  potential
investor  in a Trust who  receives this prospectus and  makes an oral or written
request to the Sponsor for such information.


A portion of the  monies received by  a Trust may be  treated, in the  first
year  only, as a return of principal due to the inclusion in the Trust portfolio
of "when-issued"  or  other  Bonds  having delivery  dates  after  the  date  of
settlement  for purchases  made on  the Date of  Deposit. A  consequence of this
treatment is that in the computation  of Estimated Current Return for the  first
year, such monies are excluded from Net Annual Interest Income and treated as an
adjustment  to the Public Offering Price. (See "Essential Information" appearing
in Part A  of this  Prospectus, "COMPOSITION  OF TRUSTS"  and "WHAT  IS THE  TAX

STATUS OF UNITHOLDERS?")


A  comparison of tax-free  and equivalent taxable  estimated current returns
with the returns on  various taxable investments is  one element to consider  in
making  an  investment  decision. The  Sponsor  may  from time  to  time  in its
advertising and sales materials compare the then current estimated returns on  a
Trust  and returns  over specified periods  on other similar  Nuveen Trusts with
returns on taxable investments such as corporate or U.S. Government bonds,  bank
CD's  and  money  market accounts  or  money  market funds,  each  of  which has
investment characteristics  that  may  differ  from those  of  the  Trust.  U.S.
Government  bonds, for example, are  backed by the full  faith and credit of the
U.S. Government and bank CD's and money market accounts are insured by an agency
of   the    federal    government.    Money   market    accounts    and    money


13





market funds provide stability of principal, but pay interest at rates that vary
with the condition of the short-term debt market. The investment characteristics
of the Trusts are described more fully elsewhere in the Prospectus.



HOW WAS THE PRICE OF THE BONDS DETERMINED AT THE DATE OF DEPOSIT?



The prices at which the Bonds deposited in the Trusts would have been offered to
the  public on the business day prior to  the Date of Deposit were determined by
the Trustee on the basis  of an evaluation of such  Bonds prepared by Kenny  S&P
Evaluation  Services, a division of J. J.  Kenny Co., Inc. ("Kenny S&P"), a firm
regularly  engaged  in  the  business  of  evaluating,  quoting  or   appraising
comparable  bonds. With respect to Bonds in  Insured Trusts and insured Bonds in
Traditional Trusts, Kenny S&P evaluated the  Bonds as so insured. (See "WHY  AND
HOW ARE THE BONDS INSURED?")


The  amount by which  the Trustee's determination of  the OFFERING PRICES of
the Bonds deposited  in the Trusts  was greater or  less than the  cost of  such
Bonds  to  the  Sponsor was  PROFIT  OR LOSS  to  the Sponsor  exclusive  of any
underwriting profit.  (See Part  A of  this Prospectus.)  The Sponsor  also  may
realize  FURTHER PROFIT OR SUSTAIN  FURTHER LOSS as a  result of fluctuations in
the Public Offering  Price of the  Units. Cash,  if any, made  available to  the
Sponsor  prior to the settlement  date for a purchase of  Units, or prior to the
acquisition of all Portfolio securities by a Trust, may be available for use  in
the Sponsor's business, and may be of benefit to the Sponsor.



WHAT IS THE TAX STATUS OF UNITHOLDERS?



At  the respective  times of  issuance of  the Bonds,  opinions relating  to the
validity thereof and  to the exclusion  of interest thereon  from Federal  gross
income  were rendered by bond counsel  to the respective issuing authorities. In
addition, with respect to  State Trusts, where applicable,  bond counsel to  the
issuing  authorities rendered opinions  as to the exemption  of interest on such
Bonds, when held by residents  of the state in which  the issuers of such  Bonds
are  located, from state income taxes and certain state or local intangibles and
local income taxes. For a discussion of the tax status of State Trusts, see Part
A of this Prospectus. Neither  the Sponsor nor Chapman  and Cutler has made  any
review of the Trusts proceedings relating to the issuance of the Bonds or of the
basis  for the opinions rendered  in connection therewith. If  the interest on a
Bond should be determined  to be taxable,  the Bond would  generally have to  be
sold  at a substantial discount. In addition, investors could be required to pay
income tax  on  interest  received  prior  to the  date  of  which  interest  is
determined to be taxable.


Gain  realized on the sale or redemption of the Bonds by the Trustee or of a
Unit by  a Unitholder  is includable  in  gross income  for Federal  income  tax
purposes,  and may be includable  in gross income for  state tax purposes. (Such
gain does not  include any amounts  received in respect  of accrued interest  or
accrued original issue discount, if any.)


For purposes of the following opinions, it is assumed that each asset of the
Trusts  is  debt, the  interest  on which  is  excluded for  Federal  income tax
purposes.


In the opinion of Chapman and Cutler, Counsel to the Sponsor, under existing
law as of the date of this Prospectus:


(1) the Trusts  are not  associations taxable  as corporations  for  Federal
income tax purposes, and interest and accrued original issue discount on
Bonds  which is excludable from gross  income under the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") will retain its status for Federal
income tax purposes when received by the Trusts and when distributed  to
the  Unitholders; however  such interest  may be  taken into  account in
computing the alternative minimum tax, an additional tax on branches  of
foreign  corporations and  the environmental tax  (the "Superfund Tax").

See "CERTAIN TAX MATTERS APPLICABLE TO CORPORATE UNITHOLDERS", below;


(2) each Unitholder of a Trust is considered  to be the owner of a pro  rata
portion  of each asset  of such Trust  under Subpart E,  subchapter J of
Chapter 1 of  the Code and  will have  a taxable event  when such  Trust
disposes of a Bond or when the Unitholder redeems or sells Units. If the
Unitholder  disposes of a Unit, he is deemed thereby to have disposed of
his entire pro  rata interest in  all the assets  of the Trust  involved
including his pro rata portion of all the Bonds represented by the Unit.
The  Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997  includes provisions that treat certain
transactions  designed  to  reduce  or   eliminate  risk  of  loss   and
opportunities for gain (e.g., short sales, offsetting notional principal
contracts,  futures or  forward contracts,  or similar  transactions) as
constructive sales for purposes  of recognition of  gain (but not  loss)
and  for purposes of determining  the holding period. Unitholders should
consult their  own tax  advisors with  regard to  any such  constructive
sales  rules. Unitholders must  reduce the tax basis  of their Units for
their share of  accrued interest  received by the  respective Trust,  if
any,  on Bonds  delivered after the  date the Unitholders  pay for their
Units to the extent that such interest accrued on such Bonds before  the
date  the Trust acquired ownership of the  Bonds (and the amount of this
reduction may exceed the amount of accrued interest paid to the  seller)
and, consequently, such Unitholders may have an increase in taxable gain
or reduction in capital loss upon the disposition of such Units. Gain or
loss  upon the sale or redemption of  Units is measured by comparing the
proceeds of  such sale  or redemption  with the  adjusted basis  of  the
Units.  If the  Trustee disposes of  Bonds (whether by  sale, payment at
maturity, redemption or otherwise),  gain or loss  is recognized to  the
Unitholder


14





(subject  to various non-recognition provisions of the Code). The amount
of any such gain or loss  is measured by comparing the Unitholder's  pro
rata  share  of  the  total  proceeds  from  such  disposition  with the
Unitholder's basis  for his  or  her fractional  interest in  the  asset
disposed of. In the case of a Unitholder who purchases Units, such basis
(before  adjustment for  accrued original  issue discount  and amortized
bond premium, if  any) is  determined by  apportioning the  cost of  the
Units  among each of the  Trust assets ratably according  to value as of
the valuation date nearest the date of acquisition of the Units. The tax
basis reduction requirements  of the  Code relating  to amortization  of
bond  premium may,  under some  circumstances, result  in the Unitholder
realizing a taxable gain when his or her Units are sold or redeemed  for
an  amount less than or equal to their original cost; Unitholders should
consult their own tax advisors with regard to the calculation of  basis;
and


(3) any  amounts paid on defaulted Bonds  held by the Trustee under policies
of insurance issued with respect to such Bonds which represent  maturing
interest  on defaulted Bonds held by the Trustee will be excludable from
Federal gross income if, and to the same extent as, such interest  would
have  been so excludable if  paid in the normal  course by the issuer of
the defaulted  Bonds  provided  that,  at the  time  such  policies  are
purchased,  the amounts paid for such policies are reasonable, customary
and consistent with the  reasonable expectation that  the issuer of  the
Bonds, rather than the insurer, will pay debt service on the Bonds.


Sections 1288 and 1272 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code")  provide a complex set of rules  governing the accrual of original issue
discount. These rules provide that original issue discount accrues either on the
basis of a constant compound interest rate or ratably over the term of the Bond,
depending on the date the Bond was  issued. In addition, special rules apply  if
the purchase price of a Bond exceeds the original issue price plus the amount of
original issue discount which would have previously accrued based upon its issue
price  (its "adjusted issue price") to prior  owners. If a Bond is acquired with
accrued interest, that  portion of the  price paid for  the accrued interest  is
added  to the tax basis of the Bond.  When this accrued interest is received, it
is treated as a return of  capital and reduces the tax  basis of the Bond. If  a
Bond  is purchased for a premium, the amount  of the premium is added to the tax
basis of the  Bond. Bond premium  is amortized  over the remaining  term of  the
Bond,  and the tax basis of  the Bond is reduced each  tax year by the amount of
the premium amortized in that tax year. The application of these rules will also
vary depending on the value of the  Bonds on the date a Unitholder acquires  his
Units  and  the price  the  Unitholder pays  for  his Units.  Unitholders should
consult with their tax advisers regarding these rules and their application.


The "Revenue  Reconciliation Act  of  1993" (the  "1993 Tax  Act")  subjects
tax-exempt  bonds to the market discount rules  of the Code, effective for bonds
purchased after April 30,  1993. In general, market  discount is the amount  (if
any)  by which  the stated  redemption price  at maturity  exceeds an investor's
purchase  price  (except  to  the  extent  that  such  difference,  if  any,  is
attributable to original issue discount not yet accrued), subject to a statutory
DE MINIMIS rule. Market discount can arise based on the price the Trust pays for
the  Bonds or the price a  Unitholder pays for his or  her Units. Under the 1993
Tax Act, accretion of market discount is taxable as ordinary income; under prior
law, the  accretion had  been  treated as  capital  gain. Market  discount  that
accretes  while the Trust holds a Bond would be recognized as ordinary income by
the Unitholders when principal payments are  received on the Bond, upon sale  or
at  redemption (including early  redemption), or upon the  sale or redemption of
his or  her Units,  unless a  Unitholder elects  to include  market discount  in
taxable  income  as  it  accrues.  The market  discount  rules  are  complex and
Unitholders should consult their  tax advisors regarding  these rules and  their
application.


CERTAIN  TAX MATTERS  APPLICABLE TO  CORPORATE UNITHOLDERS.  In the  case of
certain corporations,  the alternative  minimum tax  and the  Superfund Tax  for
taxable  years beginning after  December 31, 1986  depend upon the corporation's
alternative minimum taxable income ("AMTI"), which is the corporation's  taxable
income  with certain adjustments. One of  the adjustment items used in computing
AMTI of  a  corporation  (other  than an  S  corporation,  Regulated  Investment
Company, Real Estate Investment Trust, REMIC or FASIT) is an amount equal to 75%
of  the excess of such corporation's  "adjusted current earnings" over an amount
equal to  its AMTI  (before such  adjustment item  and the  alternative tax  net
operating  loss deduction). "Adjusted current  earnings" includes all tax-exempt
interest, including  interest on  all Bonds  in the  Trust. Under  current  Code
provisions,  the Superfund Tax does not apply to tax years beginning on or after
January 1, 1996. Legislative proposals have been introduced that would reinstate
the Superfund Tax for taxable years  after December 31, 1997 and before  January
1,  2009. Under the provisions of Section 884  of the Code, a branch profits tax
is levied on the "effectively connected earnings and profits" of certain foreign
corporations which include tax-exempt interest such as interest on the Bonds  in
the  Trust. Unitholders  should consult their  tax advisors with  respect to the
particular tax consequences to them including the corporate alternative  minimum
tax,  the Superfund Tax and the branch profits tax imposed by Section 884 of the
Code.


Counsel for the Sponsor has also advised that under Section 265 of the Code,
interest on indebtedness incurred or continued  to purchase or carry Units of  a
Trust  is not deductible  for Federal income tax  purposes. The Internal Revenue
Service has  taken the  position that  such indebtedness  need not  be  directly
traceable to the purchase or carrying of Units


15





(however,  these rules generally  do not apply to  interest paid on indebtedness
incurred to purchase or improve a  personal residence). Also, under Section  265
of  the Code, certain financial institutions  that acquire Units would generally
not be able to deduct any of  the interest expense attributable to ownership  of
such Units. Legislative proposals have been made that would extend the financial
institution  rules to  certain other corporations,  including securities dealers
and other  financial intermediaries.  Investors  with questions  regarding  this
issue should consult with their tax advisers.


In  the case  of certain  of the Bonds  in the  Trust, the  opinions of bond
counsel indicate that interest on such Bonds received by a "substantial user" of
the facilities  being financed  with the  proceeds of  these Bonds,  or  persons
related thereto, for periods while such Bonds are held by such a user or related
person,  will not be excludable from  Federal gross income, although interest on
such Bonds received  by others would  be excludable from  Federal gross  income.
"Substantial  user" and  "related person"  are defined  under the  Code and U.S.
Treasury Regulations.  Any  person  who  believes  that  he  or  she  may  be  a
"substantial user" or a "related person" as so defined should contact his or her
tax adviser.


ALL  STATEMENTS IN THE PROSPECTUS CONCERNING EXCLUSION FROM GROSS INCOME FOR
FEDERAL, STATE OR OTHER TAX PURPOSES ARE THE OPINION OF COUNSEL AND ARE TO BE SO
CONSTRUED.


At the respective times of issuance  of the Bonds, opinions relating to  the
validity  thereof and  to the exclusion  of interest thereon  from Federal gross
income are  rendered by  bond  counsel to  the respective  issuing  authorities.
Neither  the Sponsor nor Chapman and Cutler  has made any special review for the
Fund of the proceedings relating  to the issuance of the  Bonds or of the  basis
for such opinions.


The Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 (the "1998
TAX  ACT") provides that for taxpayers other than corporations, net capital gain
(which is defined as net long-term capital gain over net short-term capital loss
for the  taxable  year) realized  from  property (with  certain  exclusions)  is
subject to a maximum marginal stated tax rate of 20% (10% in the case of certain
taxpayers  in the lowest tax bracket). Capital  gain or loss is long-term if the
holding period for the  asset is more  than one year, and  is short-term if  the
holding  period for the asset is  one year or less. The  date on which a Unit is
acquired (i.e., the "trade date") is  excluded for purposes for determining  the
holding period of the Unit. The legislation is generally effective retroactively
for  amounts properly taken  into account on  or after January  1, 1998. Capital
gains realized from assets held for one year or less are taxed at the same rates
as ordinary income.


In addition,  please  note that  capital  gains may  be  recharacterized  as
ordinary  income  in  the  case  of  certain  financial  transactions  that  are
considered "conversion  transactions" effective  for transactions  entered  into
after  April 30, 1993. Unitholders and prospective investors should consult with
their tax advisers  regarding the potential  effect of this  provision on  their
investment in Units.


For  purposes of computing  the alternative minimum  tax for individuals and
corporations and the Superfund Tax for corporations, interest on certain private
activity bonds (which includes most industrial and housing revenue bonds) issued
on or after August 8,  1996 is included as an  item of tax preference.  However,
the assets of the Trust do not include any such private activity bonds issued on
or after that date.


In  general, Section 86  of the Code,  provides that 50%  of Social Security
benefits are includible in gross income to the extent that the sum of  "modified
adjusted gross income" plus 50% of the Social Security benefits received exceeds
a "base amount." The base amount is $25,000 for unmarried taxpayers, $32,000 for
married  taxpayers filing a joint  return and zero for  married taxpayers who do
not live  apart at  all times  during the  taxable year  and who  file  separate
returns.  Modified  adjusted gross  income is  adjusted gross  income determined
without regard to  certain otherwise  allowable deductions  and exclusions  from
gross  income and  by including tax-exempt  interest. To the  extent that Social
Security benefits are includible  in gross income, they  will be treated as  any
other item of gross income.


In  addition,  under the  1993 Tax  Act, for  taxable years  beginning after
December 31, 1993, up to 85% of Social Security benefits are includible in gross
income to the extent that the sum  of "modified adjusted gross income" plus  50%
of  Social Security  benefits received  exceeds an  "adjusted base  amount." The
adjusted base amount  is $34,000  for unmarried taxpayers,  $44,000 for  married
taxpayers  filing a joint return, and zero for married taxpayers who do not live
apart at all times during the taxable year and who file separate returns.


Although tax-exempt interest is included  in modified adjusted gross  income
solely  for the purpose of determining what  portion, if any, of Social Security
benefits will be  included in  gross income, no  tax-exempt interest,  including
that received from the Trusts, will be subject to tax. A taxpayer whose adjusted
gross  income already exceeds the  base amount or the  adjusted base amount must
include 50%  or 85%,  respectively, of  his Social  Security benefits  in  gross
income  whether or  not he  receives any  tax-exempt interest.  A taxpayer whose
modified adjusted gross income (after inclusion of tax-exempt interest) does not
exceed the base amount  need not include any  Social Security benefits in  gross
income.


Ownership  of  the  Units  may  result  in  collateral  federal  income  tax
consequences to certain taxpayers,  including, without limitation,  corporations
subject  to either  the environmental tax  or the branch  profits tax, financial
institutions, certain


16





insurance companies,  certain S  corporations, individual  recipients of  Social
Security or Railroad Retirement benefits and taxpayers who may be deemed to have
incurred   (or  continued)   indebtedness  to   purchase  or   carry  tax-exempt
obligations. Prospective investors should consult  their tax advisers as to  the
applicability of any such collateral consequences.


EXCEPT  AS NOTED ABOVE  AND IN PART  A OF THIS  PROSPECTUS, THE EXEMPTION OF
INTEREST ON  STATE  AND  LOCAL  OBLIGATIONS  FOR  FEDERAL  INCOME  TAX  PURPOSES
DISCUSSED  ABOVE DOES  NOT NECESSARILY RESULT  IN EXEMPTION UNDER  THE INCOME OR
OTHER TAX LAWS OF ANY  STATE OR CITY. THE LAWS  OF THE SEVERAL STATES VARY  WITH
RESPECT TO THE TAXATION OF SUCH OBLIGATIONS.


In the opinion of Carter, Ledyard & Milburn, counsel to the Trustee, and, in the
absence  of a New York Trust from the Series, special counsel for the Series for
New York tax matters, under existing law:


Under the income tax laws of the State and City of New York, each  Trust
is  not an association taxable as a corporation and the income of each Trust
will be treated as the income of the Unitholders.


For a summary of each opinion of special counsel to the respective State
Trusts for state tax matters, see Part A of this Prospectus.

No annual advisory fee is charged to the Trusts by the Sponsor. The  Sponsor
does, however, receive a fee as set forth in "Essential Information" in Part
A  of this Prospectus for regularly evaluating the Bonds and for maintaining
surveillance over the portfolio (the "Sponsor's Evaluation Fee").


The Trustee receives for ordinary  recurring services an annual fee  for
each  plan  of  distribution  for  each Trust  as  set  forth  in "Essential
Information" appearing in Part A of this Prospectus. Each annual fee is  per
$1,000  principal amount of the underlying Bonds in a Trust for that portion
of the Trust that  represents a particular  plan of distribution,  provided,
however, that for services performed prior to the record date for the second
distribution   from   the   Interest  Account   indicated   under  "Interest
Distributions" in Part A of the Prospectus, the Trustee's compensation shall
be computed in respect  of all Units outstanding  at the rate specified  for
the monthly plan of distribution. The Trustee's compensation with respect to
each Trust is computed on the basis of the largest principal amount of Bonds
in  the  Trust at  any time  during the  period with  respect to  which such
compensation is  being  computed.  The Trustee's  fee  may  be  periodically
adjusted   in  response   to  fluctuations  in   short-term  interest  rates
(reflecting the cost to the  Trustee of advancing funds  to a Trust to  meet
scheduled  distributions). In addition, the Sponsor's Evaluation Fee and the
Trustee's Fee may be adjusted  in accordance with the cumulative  percentage
increase  of the  United States Department  of Labor's  Consumer Price Index
entitled "All Services Less Rent of Shelter" since the establishment of  the
Trusts  or if such index  no longer exists, a  comparable index. The Trustee
has the use  of funds,  if any,  being held  in the  Interest and  Principal
Accounts  of each  Trust for future  distributions, payment  of expenses and
redemptions.  These  Accounts  are  non-interest  bearing  to   Unitholders.
Pursuant  to normal banking procedures, the Trustee benefits from the use of
funds held therein. Part of the  Trustee's compensation for its services  to
the Trusts is expected to result from such use of these funds.


Premiums for the policies of insurance obtained by the Sponsor or by the
Bond  issuers  with respect  to the  Bonds  in the  Insured Trusts  and with
respect to insured Bonds in Traditional Trusts have been paid in full  prior
to  the deposit of the Bonds in the  Trusts, and the value of such insurance
has been  included  in  the  evaluation  of the  Bonds  in  each  Trust  and
accordingly  in the Public Offering Price of  Units of each Trust. There are
no annual continuing premiums for such insurance.


The Trusts (and  therefore Unitholders) will  bear all or  a portion  of
their  offering  costs,  including  costs  of  registering  Units  with  the
Securities and  Exchange  Commission  and  states and  legal  fees  but  not
including  the expenses  incurred in the  printing of  preliminary and final
prospectuses, and  expenses  incurred in  the  preparation and  printing  of
brochures and other advertising materials and any other selling expenses) as
is  common for mutual funds. Total offering costs will be amortized over the
first five years of  such Trusts. The following  are additional expenses  of
the  Trusts and, when paid by  or are owed to the  Trustee, are secured by a
lien on  the assets  of  the Trust  or Trusts  to  which such  expenses  are
allocable:  (1)  the expenses  and  costs of  any  action undertaken  by the
Trustee  to  protect  the  Trusts  and  the  rights  and  interests  of  the
Unitholders;  (2) all taxes and other governmental charges upon the Bonds or
any part of the Trusts  (no such taxes or charges  are being levied or  made
or,  to the knowledge of the  Sponsor, contemplated); (3) amounts payable to
the Trustee as fees  for ordinary recurring  services and for  extraordinary
non-recurring services rendered pursuant to the Indenture, all disbursements
and  expenses including counsel  fees (including fees  of bond counsel which
the Trustee may retain) sustained or  incurred by the Trustee in  connection
therewith; and (4) any losses or liabilities accruing to the Trustee without
negligence,  bad faith  or willful  misconduct on  its part.  The Trustee is
empowered to sell  Bonds in  order to  pay these  amounts if  funds are  not
otherwise available in the applicable Interest and Principal Accounts.


17





The  Indenture requires each Trust  to be audited on  an annual basis at
the expense of the Trust by  independent public accountants selected by  the
Sponsor.  The Trustee shall not be required, however, to cause such an audit
to be performed  if its cost  to a Trust  shall exceed $.05  per Unit on  an
annual  basis. Unitholders of a Trust covered  by an audit may obtain a copy
of the audited financial statements upon request.



WHEN ARE DISTRIBUTIONS MADE TO UNITHOLDERS?



Interest received by the Trustee on the Bonds in each Trust, including  that
part  of the proceeds  of any disposition of  Bonds which represents accrued
interest and including any insurance  proceeds representing interest due  on
defaulted  Bonds, shall be credited to  the "Interest Account" of such Trust
and all  other moneys  received by  the  Trustee shall  be credited  to  the
"Principal Account" of such Trust.


The  pro rata share of cash in  the Principal Account in each Trust will
be computed as  of each  semi-annual Record  Date and  distributions to  the
Unitholders  as of  such Record Date  will be  made on or  shortly after the
fifteenth  day  of  the  month.  Proceeds  received  from  the  disposition,
including  sale, call or maturity, of any  of the Bonds and all amounts paid
with respect to zero coupon bonds  and Stripped Obligations will be held  in
the  Principal  Account  and  either  used  to  pay  for  Units  redeemed or
distributed on the Distribution Date  following the next semi-annual  Record
Date.  The Trustee is not required to make a distribution from the Principal
Account of any Trust  unless the amount available  for distribution in  such
account equals at least ten cents per Unit.


The  pro  rata share  of  the Interest  Account  in each  Trust  will be
computed by the Trustee each month as of each Record Date and  distributions
will  be  made  on  or shortly  after  the  fifteenth day  of  the  month to
Unitholders of  such  Trust  as of  the  Record  Date who  are  entitled  to
distributions  at that time  under the plan  of distribution chosen. Persons
who purchase  Units between  a  Record Date  and  a Distribution  Date  will
receive their first distribution on the Distribution Date following the next
Record Date under the applicable plan of distribution.


Purchasers  of Units who  desire to receive  interest distributions on a
monthly or quarterly basis may elect to do so at the time of purchase during
the initial  public offering  period.  Those indicating  no choice  will  be
deemed  to have chosen  the semi-annual distribution  plan. All Unitholders,
however, who purchase Units  during the initial  public offering period  and
who  hold them  of record on  the first  Record Date will  receive the first
distribution of interest. Thereafter, Record Dates for monthly distributions
will  be  the  first  day  of   each  month;  Record  Dates  for   quarterly
distributions  will be the first day  of February, May, August and November;
and Record Dates for semi-annual distributions will be the first day of  May
and November. See Part A of this Prospectus for details of distributions per
Unit  of each Trust under the various  plans based upon estimated Net Annual
Interest  Income  at  the  Date  of  Deposit.  The  amount  of  the  regular
distributions  will generally change when Bonds  are redeemed, mature or are
sold or when  fees and  expenses increase or  decrease. For  the purpose  of
minimizing  fluctuations in the distributions from the Interest Account of a
Trust, the Trustee is authorized to advance such amounts as may be necessary
to provide for  interest distributions of  approximately equal amounts.  The
Trustee  shall be reimbursed,  without interest, for  any such advances from
funds in the Interest  Account of such Trust.  The Trustee's fee takes  into
account  the costs attributable to the outlay of capital needed to make such
advances.


The plan of distribution selected by a Unitholder will remain in  effect
until  changed. Unitholders  purchasing Units  in the  secondary market will
initially receive distributions in accordance with the election of the prior
owner. Unitholders desiring to change their  plan of distribution may do  so
by  sending  a  written  notice requesting  the  change,  together  with any
Certificate(s), to the Trustee.  The notice and  any Certificate(s) must  be
received  by the Trustee  not later than  the semi-annual Record  Date to be
effective as  of  the  semi-annual  distribution  following  the  subsequent
semi-annual  Record Date. Unitholders are requested to make any such changes
within 45 days prior to the applicable Record Date. Certificates should only
be sent by registered or certified mail to minimize the possibility of their
being lost or stolen. (See "OWNERSHIP AND TRANSFER OF UNITS.")


As of the  first day  of each  month the  Trustee will  deduct from  the
Interest  Account of  a Trust  or, to  the extent  funds are  not sufficient
therein, from the Principal Account of  a Trust, amounts needed for  payment
of  expenses of such Trust. The Trustee also may withdraw from said accounts
such amount, if any, as  it deems necessary to  establish a reserve for  any
governmental  charges payable out of such  Trust. Amounts so withdrawn shall
not be considered a part of a Trust's assets until such time as the  Trustee
shall  return all or any part of such amounts to the appropriate account. In
addition, the  Trustee shall  withdraw  from the  Interest Account  and  the
Principal  Account of  a Trust  such amounts  as may  be necessary  to cover
redemptions of Units of such Trust by the Trustee. Funds which are available
for future distributions, redemptions  and payment of  expenses are held  in
accounts which are non-interest bearing to Unitholders and are available for
use by the Trustee pursuant to normal banking procedures.


18






ACCUMULATION PLAN



The  Sponsor is  also the principal  underwriter of  several open-end mutual
funds (the  "Accumulation  Funds")  into which  Unitholders  may  choose  to
reinvest  Trust distributions.  Unitholders may elect  to reinvest principal
distributions or interest and principal distributions automatically, without
any sales charge.  Each Accumulation  Fund has  investment objectives  which
differ  in  certain respects  from those  of  the Trusts  and may  invest in
securities which would not  be eligible for deposit  in the Trusts.  Further
information  concerning  the Accumulation  Plan and  a list  of Accumulation
Funds is set forth in the  Information Supplement of this Prospectus,  which
may  be obtained by contacting the Trustee at the phone number listed on the
back cover of this Prospectus.


Participants may at any  time, by so notifying  the Trustee in  writing,
elect  to change  the Accumulation Fund  into which  their distributions are
being reinvested, to change from principal only reinvestment to reinvestment
of both  principal  and  interest  or vice  versa,  or  to  terminate  their
participation  in  the  Accumulation  Plan  altogether  and  receive  future
distributions on  their Units  in cash.  There will  be no  charge or  other
penalty  for such change of election  or termination. The character of Trust
distributions for income tax purposes will remain unchanged even if they are
reinvested in an Accumulation Fund.



HOW DETAILED ARE REPORTS TO UNITHOLDERS?



The Trustee shall  furnish Unitholders of  a Trust in  connection with  each
distribution,  a statement of the amount of interest, if any, and the amount
of  other  receipts  (received  since  the  preceding  distribution)   being
distributed,  expressed in each case as a dollar amount representing the pro
rata share of each Unit of a Trust outstanding and a year to date summary of
all distributions paid  on said Units.  Within a reasonable  period of  time
after  the end  of each  calendar year,  the Trustee  shall furnish  to each
person, who at any time during the calendar year was a registered Unitholder
of a Trust, a statement  with respect to such Trust  (i) as to the  Interest
Account: interest received (including amounts representing interest received
upon  any  disposition  of Bonds),  and,  except  for any  State  Trust, the
percentage of such interest by states in which the issuers of the Bonds  are
located, deductions for fees and expenses of such Trust, redemption of Units
and the balance remaining after such distributions and deductions, expressed
in  each  case  both  as  a  total dollar  amount  and  as  a  dollar amount
representing the  pro  rata share  of  each  Unit outstanding  on  the  last
business  day of such calendar  year; (ii) as to  the Principal Account: the
dates of disposition of  any Bonds and the  net proceeds received  therefrom
(excluding  any portion representing accrued  interest), the amount paid for
purchase of Replacement  Bonds, the  amount paid upon  redemption of  Units,
deductions  for payment  of applicable  taxes and  fees and  expenses of the
Trustee, and the balance remaining  after such distributions and  deductions
expressed  both as a total dollar amount and as a dollar amount representing
the pro rata share of each Unit outstanding on the last business day of such
calendar year;  (iii) a  list of  the Bonds  held and  the number  of  Units
outstanding  on the last business  day of such calendar  year; (iv) the Unit
Value based  upon the  last computation  thereof made  during such  calendar
year;  and (v) amounts  actually distributed during  such calendar year from
the Interest  Account and  from the  Principal Account,  separately  stated,
expressed  both as total  dollar amounts and  as dollar amounts representing
the pro rata  share of  each Unit  outstanding. Each  annual statement  will
reflect  pertinent information  in respect of  all plans  of distribution so
that Unitholders may  be informed regarding  the results of  other plans  of
distribution.



UNIT VALUE AND EVALUATION



The value of each Trust is determined by the Sponsor on the basis of (1) the
cash  on hand in the Trust or moneys  in the process of being collected, (2)
the value of the Bonds in the Trust based on the BID prices of the Bonds and

(3) interest accrued  thereon not  subject to collection,  LESS (1)  amounts
representing  taxes or governmental charges payable out of the Trust and (2)
the accrued expenses of the Trust. The result of such computation is divided
by the number of Units of such  Trust outstanding as of the date thereof  to
determine  the per Unit value ("Unit Value")  of such Trust. The Sponsor may
determine the value of the Bonds in  each Trust (1) on the basis of  current
BID  prices of  the Bonds obtained  from dealers or  brokers who customarily
deal in bonds comparable to those held by a Trust, (2) if bid prices are not
available for any of the  Bonds, on the basis  of bid prices for  comparable
bonds,  (3) by  causing the value  of the  Bonds to be  determined by others
engaged in  the practice  of evaluating,  quoting or  appraising  comparable
bonds  or (4) by  any combination of  the above. Although  the Unit Value of
each Trust is  based on  the BID  prices of the  Bonds, the  Units are  sold
initially  to the public at the Public  Offering Price based on the OFFERING
prices of the Bonds.


Because the insurance obtained by the Sponsor or by the issuers of Bonds
with respect to the Bonds in the Insured Trusts and with respect to  insured
Bonds  in  Traditional  Trusts  is  effective  so  long  as  such  Bonds are
outstanding, such insurance will  be taken into  account in determining  the
bid  and offering prices of such Bonds and therefore some value attributable
to such insurance  will be included  in the  value of Units  of Trusts  that
include such Bonds.

HOW UNITS OF THE TRUSTS ARE DISTRIBUTED TO THE PUBLIC



Nuveen,  in addition to  being the Sponsor,  is the sole  Underwriter of the
Units. It is the intention of the Sponsor to qualify Units of National, Long
Intermediate, Intermediate,  Short Intermediate  and Short  Term Trusts  for
sale  under the laws of substantially all of the states of the United States
of America, and Units of State Trusts only in the state for which the  Trust
is named and selected other states.


Promptly  following the  deposit of Bonds  in exchange for  Units of the
Trusts, it is  the practice  of the  Sponsor to place  all of  the Units  as
collateral  for a letter  or letters of  credit from one  or more commercial
banks under an agreement to release such  Units from time to time as  needed
for  distribution. Under  such an  arrangement the  Sponsor pays  such banks
compensation based  on the  then current  interest rate.  This is  a  normal
warehousing  arrangement during the  period of distribution  of the Units to
public investors. To facilitate the handling of transactions, sales of Units
shall be limited to transactions involving a minimum of either $5,000 or  50
Units, whichever is less. The Sponsor reserves the right to reject, in whole
or in part, any order for the purchase of Units.


The  Sponsor  plans  to  allow  a discount  to  brokers  and  dealers in
connection with  the primary  distribution of  Units and  also in  secondary
market transactions. The primary market discounts are as follows:








                                                         DISCOUNT PER UNIT

*Breakpoint  sales charges and related  dealer concessions are computed both
on a dollar basis and on the basis of the number of Units purchased,  using
the  equivalent of 500 Units  to $50,000, 2,500 Units  to $250,000 etc. and
will be applied on that basis which is more favorable to the purchaser.


The Sponsor currently intends to  maintain a secondary market for  Units
of  each Trust. See "MARKET FOR UNITS."  The amount of the dealer concession
on secondary market  purchases of Trust  Units through the  Sponsor will  be
computed based upon the value of the Bonds in the Trust portfolio, including
the  sales charge computed as described in "HOW IS THE PUBLIC OFFERING PRICE
DETERMINED?", and  adjusted  to  reflect  the cash  position  of  the  Trust
principal  account, and will vary with the  size of the purchase as shown in
the following table:

*Breakpoint sales charges and related dealer concessions are computed both
on a dollar  basis and on  the basis  of the number  of Units  purchased,
using  the equivalent of  500 Units to $50,000,  2,500 Units to $250,000,
etc., and will be applied  on that basis which  is more favorable to  the
purchaser.


The   Sponsor  reserves  the  right   to  change  the  foregoing  dealer
concessions from time to time.


At the discretion of the Sponsor,  volume incentives can be earned as  a
marketing allowance by dealer firms who reach cumulative firm sales or sales
arrangement  levels of  a specified number  of Units of  an individual Trust
during the primary  offering period  as set forth  in the  table below.  For
firms  that meet the  necessary volume level for  a Trust, volume incentives
may be given on all trades involving  that Trust originated from or by  that
firm during the primary offering period.

In addition, a volume incentive of $2.50 per $1,000 of Units sold can be
earned  by dealer firms as a  marketing allowance for secondary market sales
of at least $1 million of Nuveen Unit Trust units per calendar quarter.


Only sales through  the Sponsor  qualify for volume  incentives and  for
meeting  minimum requirements. The  Sponsor reserves the  right to modify or
change the volume incentive schedule at any time and make the  determination
as to which firms qualify for the marketing allowance and the amount paid.

account  for which  a comprehensive "wrap  fee" charge is  imposed, and bank
trust  departments  investing  funds  over  which  they  exercise  exclusive
discretionary investment authority and that are held in a fiduciary, agency,
custodial  or  similar  capacity, are  not  entitled to  receive  any dealer
concession for any sales  made to investors  which qualified as  "Discounted
Purchases"  during the primary or secondary  market. (See "HOW IS THE PUBLIC
OFFERING PRICE DETERMINED?")


Certain commercial banks  are making  Units of the  Trusts available  to
their  customers on an agency  basis. A portion of  the sales charge paid by
these customers is retained by or remitted to the banks in the amounts shown
in the above table. The Glass-Steagall Act prohibits banks from underwriting
Trust Units; the Act does,  however, permit certain agency transactions  and
banking   regulators  have  not  indicated   that  these  particular  agency
transactions are not permitted under the Act. In Texas and in certain  other
states,  any bank  making Units  available must  be registered  as a broker-
dealer under state law.



OWNERSHIP AND TRANSFER OF UNITS



The ownership  of  Units  is  evidenced  in  Certificated  form  unless  the
Unitholder  expressly requests that the purchased Units be evidenced by book
entry positions  recorded on  the  books and  records  of the  Trustee.  The
Trustee  is authorized to treat as the owner of Units that person who at the
time is registered as such on the  books of the Trustee. Any Unitholder  who
holds  a Certificate may change to book entry ownership by submitting to the
Trustee the  Certificate  along  with  a  written  request  that  the  Units
represented  by such  Certificate be  held in  book entry  form. Likewise, a
Unitholder who holds Units in book  entry form may obtain a Certificate  for
such  Units  by  written  request  to the  Trustee.  Units  may  be  held in
denominations of one Unit or any multiple or fraction thereof. Fractions  of
Units  are computed to three decimal places. Any Certificates issued will be
numbered serially for  identification, and  are issued  in fully  registered
form,  transferable only on the books of the Trustee. Book entry Unitholders
will receive a Book Entry Position Confirmation reflecting their ownership.


For Trusts  allowing optional  plans of  distribution, Certificates  for
Units  will bear an appropriate notation on their face indicating which plan
of distribution  has been  selected. When  a change  is made,  the  existing
Certificates  must be surrendered to the Trustee and new Certificates issued
to reflect the currently  effective plan of distribution.  There will be  no
charge  for this service. Holders of book  entry Units can change their plan
of distribution by making a written request to the Trustee, which will issue
a new Book Entry Position Confirmation to reflect such change.


Units are transferable by making a  written request to the Trustee  and,
in  the  case  of  Units  evidenced  by  Certificate(s),  by  presenting and
surrendering such Certificate(s) to  the Trustee, at  its address listed  on
the  back  cover of  this Part  B  of the  Prospectus, properly  endorsed or
accompanied  by  a  written  instrument  or  instruments  of  transfer.  The
Certificate(s)   should  be  sent  registered  or  certified  mail  for  the
protection of  the  Unitholder.  Each  Unitholder  must  sign  such  written
request, and such Certificate(s) or transfer instrument, exactly as his name
appears  on (a) the face of the  Certificate(s) representing the Units to be
transferred, or (b) the Book Entry Position Confirmation(s) relating to  the
Units to be transferred. Such signature(s) must be guaranteed by a guarantor
acceptable  to the  Trustee. In  certain instances  the Trustee  may require
additional documents  such  as,  but  not  limited  to,  trust  instruments,
certificates   of  death,  appointments  as  executor  or  administrator  or
certificates  of  corporate  authority.   Mutilated  Certificates  must   be
surrendered  to the  Trustee in  order for  a replacement  Certificate to be
issued. Although  at  the  date  hereof  no  charge  is  made  and  none  is
contemplated,  a Unitholder may be required to  pay $2.00 to the Trustee for
each Certificate reissued  or transfer  of Units  requested and  to pay  any
governmental charge which may be imposed in connection therewith.


21






REPLACEMENT OF LOST, STOLEN OR DESTROYED CERTIFICATES.



To  obtain a new  Certificate replacing one  that has been  lost, stolen, or
destroyed,  the  Unitholder  must   furnish  the  Trustee  with   sufficient
indemnification  and  pay  such  expenses as  the  Trustee  may  incur. This
indemnification  must  be  in   the  form  of  an   Open  Penalty  Bond   of
Indemnification.  The  premium  for such  an  indemnity bond  may  vary, but
currently amounts to 1% of the market value of the Units represented by  the
Certificate.  In  the  case  however,  of a  Trust  as  to  which  notice of
termination has been  given, the premium  currently amounts to  0.5% of  the
market value of the Units represented by such Certificate.



HOW UNITS MAY BE REDEEMED WITHOUT CHARGE



Unitholders  may redeem  all or  a portion  of their  Units by  (1) making a
written request  for such  redemption (book  entry Unitholders  may use  the
redemption   form  on  the  reverse  side   of  their  Book  Entry  Position
Confirmation) to the Trustee at its address listed on the back cover of this
Part B of the Prospectus (redemptions of 1,000 Units or more will require  a
signature  guarantee), (2) in the case  of Units evidenced by a Certificate,
by also  tendering  such  Certificate  to  the  Trustee,  duly  endorsed  or
accompanied  by proper instruments of transfer with signatures guaranteed as
explained above, or  provide satisfactory indemnity  required in  connection
with  lost, stolen or  destroyed Certificates and  (3) payment of applicable
governmental charges, if any. Certificates should be sent only by registered
or certified mail to minimize the possibility of their being lost or stolen.
(See "OWNERSHIP AND TRANSFER OF UNITS.") No redemption fee will be  charged.
A  Unitholder may authorize the Trustee  to honor telephone instructions for
the redemption  of Units  held  in book  entry  form. Units  represented  by
Certificates  may  not  be  redeemed by  telephone.  The  proceeds  of Units
redeemed by telephone will be sent by check either to the Unitholder at  the
address  specified on his account or to a financial institution specified by
the Unitholder for  credit to the  account of the  Unitholder. A  Unitholder
wishing  to  use  this  method  of  redemption  must  complete  a  Telephone
Redemption Authorization Form and furnish the Form to the Trustee. Telephone
Redemption  Authorization  Forms  can   be  obtained  from  a   Unitholder's
registered representative or by calling the Trustee. Once the completed Form
is  on file,  the Trustee  will honor  telephone redemption  requests by any
authorized person.  The  time a  telephone  redemption request  is  received
determines  the "date of tender" as discussed below. The redemption proceeds
will be mailed within three business days following the telephone redemption
request. Only  Units held  in the  name of  individuals may  be redeemed  by
telephone;  accounts registered in broker  name, or accounts of corporations
or fiduciaries (including among  others, trustees, guardians, executors  and
administrators) may not use the telephone redemption privilege.


On  the third business day following  the date of tender, the Unitholder
will be entitled to receive in cash  for each Unit tendered an amount  equal
to  the Unit Value of such Trust determined  by the Trustee, as of 4:00 p.m.
eastern time,  or as  of any  earlier closing  time on  a day  on which  the
Exchange  is scheduled in advance to close at such earlier time, on the date
of tender as defined hereafter, plus accrued interest to, but not including,
the third business day  after the date of  tender ("Redemption Price").  The
price  received upon redemption may be more  or less than the amount paid by
the Unitholder depending on the  value of the Bonds  on the date of  tender.
Unitholders  should check with the Trustee  or their broker to determine the
Redemption Price before tendering Units.


The "date of tender" is deemed to  be the date on which the request  for
redemption  of Units is received in proper  form by the Trustee, except that
as regards a redemption request received after 4:00 p.m. eastern time, or as
of any earlier closing time on a  day on which the Exchange is scheduled  in
advance  to close at such earlier time, or  on any day on which the Exchange
is normally  closed, the  date  of tender  is the  next  day on  which  such
Exchange  is normally open  for trading and  such request will  be deemed to
have been  made on  such day  and the  redemption will  be effected  at  the
Redemption Price computed on that day.


Accrued interest paid on redemption shall be withdrawn from the Interest
Account of the appropriate Trust or, if the balance therein is insufficient,
from  the  Principal  Account  of  such Trust.  All  other  amounts  paid on
redemption shall be  withdrawn from  the Principal Account.  The Trustee  is
empowered  to  sell underlying  Bonds  of a  Trust  in order  to  make funds
available for redemption. (See "HOW BONDS MAY BE REMOVED FROM THE  TRUSTS.")
Units so redeemed shall be cancelled. To the extent that Bonds are sold from
a  Trust, the size and  diversity of such Trust  will be reduced. Such sales
may be required at a time when  Bonds would not otherwise be sold and  might
result in lower prices than might otherwise be realized.


The Redemption Price is determined on the basis of the BID prices of the
Bonds  in each Trust, while the initial  Public Offering Price of Units will
be determined on the basis  of the OFFERING prices of  the Bonds as of  4:00

p.m.  eastern time  on any day  on which  the Exchange is  normally open for
trading, or as of any earlier closing time on a day on which the Exchange is
scheduled in advance to close at  such earlier time, and such  determination
is  made. As of any given time,  the difference between the bid and offering
prices of such  Bonds may be  expected to  average 1/2% to  2% of  principal
amount.  In the  case of  actively traded  Bonds, the  difference may  be as
little as 1/4 to 1/2 of 1%, and in the case of inactively traded Bonds  such
difference usually will not exceed 3%.


22





The  right of redemption may be  suspended and payment postponed for any
period during which the Securities  and Exchange Commission determines  that
trading  in the municipal bond market  is restricted or an emergency exists,
as a result of which disposal or  evaluation of the Bonds is not  reasonably
practicable,  or  for  such other  periods  as the  Securities  and Exchange
Commission may by order permit.


Under regulations issued  by the Internal  Revenue Service, the  Trustee
will  be required to withhold a specified percentage of the principal amount
of a Unit  redemption if the  Trustee has not  been furnished the  redeeming
Unitholder's  tax  identification  number  in the  manner  required  by such
regulations. Any amount so withheld  is transmitted to the Internal  Revenue
Service  and may be recovered by the  Unitholder only when filing his or her
tax return. Under normal circumstances the Trustee obtains the  Unitholder's
tax   identification  number  from  the  selling  broker  at  the  time  the
Certificate or Book Entry Return Confirmation is issued, and this number  is
printed  on  the  Certificate  or  Book  Entry  Return  Confirmation  and on
distribution statements. If  a Unitholder's tax  identification number  does
not  appear as described above, or if it is incorrect, the Unitholder should
contact the Trustee before redeeming Units to determine what action, if any,
is required to avoid this "back-up withholding."



HOW UNITS MAY BE PURCHASED BY THE SPONSOR



The Trustee will notify the Sponsor  of any tender of Units for  redemption.
If  the Sponsor's bid in the secondary market at that time equals or exceeds
the Redemption Price  it may purchase  such Units by  notifying the  Trustee
before  the close of business  on the second succeeding  business day and by
making payment therefor to  the Unitholder not later  than the day on  which
payment  would otherwise have been made by  the Trustee. (See "HOW UNITS MAY
BE REDEEMED WITHOUT CHARGE.")  The Sponsor's current practice  is to bid  at
the  Redemption Price in the secondary market. Units held by the Sponsor may
be tendered to the Trustee for redemption as any other Units.



HOW BONDS MAY BE REMOVED FROM THE TRUSTS



Bonds will be removed  from a Trust  as they mature or  are redeemed by  the
issuers  thereof.  See  "RISK FACTORS"  in  Part  A of  this  Prospectus and
"SUMMARY OF  PORTFOLIOS"  herein for  a  discussion of  call  provisions  of
portfolio Bonds.


The Indenture also empowers the Trustee to sell Bonds for the purpose of
redeeming  Units tendered by any Unitholder, and for the payment of expenses
for which income may not be  available. Under the Indenture, the Sponsor  is
obligated  to provide the Trustee with a current list of Bonds in each Trust
to be sold in such circumstances. In deciding which Bonds should be sold the
Sponsor intends to consider, among other things, such factors as: (1) market
conditions; (2)  market  prices of  the  Bonds;  (3) the  effect  on  income
distributions to Unitholders of the sale of various Bonds; (4) the effect on
principal  amount of underlying Bonds per Unit of the sale of various Bonds;

(5) the financial condition of the issuers;  and (6) the effect of the  sale
of  various Bonds on the  investment character of the  Trust. Such sales, if
required, could result in the  sale of Bonds by  the Trustee at prices  less
than  original cost to the Trust. To the extent Bonds are sold, the size and
diversity of such Trust will be reduced.


In addition, the Sponsor is empowered to direct the Trustee to liquidate
Bonds upon the  happening of certain  other events, such  as default in  the
payment  of principal  and/or interest,  an action  of the  issuer that will
adversely affect its  ability to continue  payment of the  principal of  and
interest  on its Bonds,  or an adverse  change in market,  revenue or credit
factors affecting the investment character of the Bonds. If a default in the
payment of the principal of and/or interest on any of the Bonds occurs,  and
if  the Sponsor fails to instruct the Trustee whether to sell or continue to
hold such Bonds  within 30  days after notification  by the  Trustee to  the
Sponsor  of  such default,  the Indenture  provides  that the  Trustee shall
liquidate said  Bonds forthwith  and shall  not be  liable for  any loss  so
incurred.  The Sponsor may also  direct the Trustee to  liquidate Bonds in a
Trust if the Bonds in  the Trust are the  subject of an advanced  refunding,
generally  considered to be when refunding bonds are issued and the proceeds
thereof are deposited in irrevocable trust  to retire the refunded Bonds  on
their redemption date.


Except  as stated in "COMPOSITION OF TRUSTS" regarding the limited right
of substitution  of  Replacement Bonds  for  Failed Bonds,  and  except  for
refunding   securities  that  may  be  exchanged  for  Bonds  under  certain
conditions specified in the Indenture, the Indenture does not permit  either
the  Sponsor or the Trustee  to acquire or deposit  bonds either in addition
to, or in substitution for, any of the Bonds initially deposited in a Trust.



INFORMATION ABOUT THE TRUSTEE



The Trustee and its address are stated on  the back cover of this Part B  of
the Prospectus. The Trustee is subject to supervision and examination by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve  System and either the Comptroller  of the Currency or state banking
authorities.


The Trustee has assumed no responsibility for the accuracy, adequacy and
completeness of  the  information not  furnished  by it  contained  in  this
Prospectus.


23






LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITIES OF SPONSOR AND TRUSTEE



The  Sponsor and the Trustee shall be  under no liability to Unitholders for
taking any action or for refraining  from any action in good faith  pursuant
to  the Indenture, or for  errors in judgment, but  shall be liable only for
their own negligence, lack of good faith or willful misconduct. The  Trustee
shall  not be liable for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the sale
by the Trustee  of any  of the Bonds.  In the  event of the  failure of  the
Sponsor to act under the Indenture, the Trustee may act thereunder and shall
not be liable for any action taken by it in good faith under the Indenture.


The  Trustee shall  not be  liable for  any taxes  or other governmental
charges imposed upon or in respect of the Bonds or upon the interest thereon
or upon it as Trustee under the Indenture or upon or in respect of any Trust
which the Trustee may be required to pay under any present or future law  of
the  United  States  of America  or  of  any other  taxing  authority having
jurisdiction. In addition, the Indenture contains other customary provisions
limiting the liability of the Trustee.



SUCCESSOR TRUSTEES AND SPONSORS



The Trustee or any successor trustee  may resign by executing an  instrument
of  resignation in writing  and filing same  with the Sponsor  and mailing a
copy of a  notice of  resignation to all  Unitholders then  of record.  Upon
receiving  such  notice,  the  Sponsor is  required  to  promptly  appoint a
successor trustee. If the Trustee becomes incapable of acting or is adjudged
a bankrupt or insolvent,  or a receiver or  other public officer shall  take
charge  of its property or  affairs, the Sponsor may  remove the Trustee and
appoint a successor by written instrument.  The resignation or removal of  a
trustee  and the appointment  of a successor  trustee shall become effective
only when  the  successor  trustee  accepts its  appointment  as  such.  Any
successor  trustee shall be  a corporation authorized  to exercise corporate
trust powers, having capital, surplus and undivided profits of not less than
$5,000,000. Any corporation into which a trustee may be merged or with which
it may be  consolidated, or  any corporation  resulting from  any merger  or
consolidation  to which a trustee  shall be a party,  shall be the successor
trustee.


If upon resignation of a trustee no successor has been appointed and has
accepted the appointment  within 30  days after  notification, the  retiring
trustee  may apply to a court  of competent jurisdiction for the appointment
of a successor.


If the Sponsor fails to undertake any of its duties under the Indenture,
and no express provision is  made for action by  the Trustee in such  event,
the  Trustee may, in  addition to its  other powers under  the Indenture (1)
appoint a successor sponsor or (2) terminate the Indenture and liquidate the
Trusts.

OTHER INFORMATION

AMENDMENT OF INDENTURE



The  Indenture may  be amended  by the Trustee  and the  Sponsor without the
consent of any of the Unitholders (1) to cure any ambiguity or to correct or
supplement any provision thereof which may be defective or inconsistent,  or

(2)  to  make  such  other  provisions as  shall  not  adversely  affect the
Unitholders, provided, however,  that the  Indenture may not  be amended  to
increase  the  number of  Units in  any Trust  or to  permit the  deposit or
acquisition of bonds either  in addition to, or  in substitution for any  of
the  Bonds initially deposited in any Trust except as stated in "COMPOSITION
OF TRUSTS" regarding the limited right of substitution of Replacement  Bonds
and   except  for  the   substitution  of  refunding   bonds  under  certain
circumstances. The Trustee  shall advise  the Unitholders  of any  amendment
promptly after execution thereof.



TERMINATION OF INDENTURE



Each  Trust may be liquidated at any time  by written consent of 100% of the
Unitholders or by the Trustee when the value of such Trust, as shown by  any
evaluation,  is less than 20% of the original principal amount of such Trust
and will be liquidated by the Trustee  in the event that Units not yet  sold
aggregating  more than 60% of the  Units originally created are tendered for
redemption by the Sponsor  thereby reducing the net  worth of such Trust  to
less  than 40% of the principal amount  of the Bonds originally deposited in
the portfolio.  (See "Essential  Information" appearing  in Part  A of  this
Prospectus.)  The sale of Bonds from  the Trusts upon termination may result
in realization of a lesser amount  than might otherwise be realized if  such
sale  were not  required at  such time. For  this reason,  among others, the
amount realized  by a  Unitholder  upon termination  may  be less  than  the
principal  amount of Bonds originally represented  by the Units held by such
Unitholder. The Indenture will terminate upon the redemption, sale or  other
disposition  of the  last Bond  held thereunder,  but in  no event  shall it
continue beyond  the  end  of  the  calendar  year  preceding  the  fiftieth
anniversary  of its execution for National  and State Trusts, beyond the end
of the calendar year  preceding the twentieth  anniversary of its  execution
for  Long Intermediate,  and Intermediate  Trusts or  beyond the  end of the
calendar year preceding  the tenth  anniversary of its  execution for  Short
Intermediate and Short Term Trusts.


Written  notice of any termination specifying the time or times at which
Unitholders may surrender their Certificates, if any, for cancellation shall
be given by the Trustee to each  Unitholder at the address appearing on  the
registration books of a Trust maintained by the Trustee. Within a reasonable
time  thereafter, the  Trustee shall liquidate  any Bonds in  the Trust then
held and  shall deduct  from the  assets  of the  Trust any  accrued  costs,
expenses  or indemnities  provided by the  Indenture which  are allocable to
such Trust, including  estimated compensation  of the Trustee  and costs  of
liquidation  and any amounts required as a reserve to provide for payment of
any applicable taxes or other  governmental charges. The Trustee shall  then
distribute  to Unitholders of such Trust their pro rata share of the balance
of  the  Interest  and  Principal  Accounts.  With  such  distribution,  the
Unitholders   shall  be   furnished  a  final   distribution  statement,  in
substantially the same  form as  the annual distribution  statement, of  the
amount  distributable. At  such time as  the Trustee in  its sole discretion
shall determine that any amounts held in reserve are no longer necessary, it
shall make distribution thereof to Unitholders in the same manner.

GENERAL RISK DISCLOSURE



An investment in Units of any Trust should be made with an understanding of
the risks that such an investment may entail. These include the ability of the
issuer, or, if applicable, an insurer, to make payments of interest and
principal when due, the effects of changes in interest rates generally, early
call provisions and the potential for changes in the tax status of the Bonds. As
set forth in the portfolio summaries in Part A of this Prospectus, the Trusts
may contain or be concentrated in one or more of the types of bonds discussed
below. The following paragraphs discuss certain circumstances which may
adversely affect the ability of issuers of Bonds held in the portfolio of a
Trust to make payment of principal and interest thereon or which may adversely
affect the ratings of such Bonds; with respect to Insured Trusts, however,
because of the insurance obtained by the Sponsor or by the issuers of the Bonds,
such changes should not adversely affect an Insured Trust's receipt of principal
and interest, the Standard & Poor's AAA or Moody's Aaa ratings of the Bonds in
the Insured Trust portfolio, or the Standard & Poor's AAA rating of the Units of
each such Insured Trust. For economic risks specific to the individual Trusts,
see "Risk Factors" for each Trust.


HEALTH CARE FACILITY REVENUE OBLIGATIONS.  Some of the Bonds in a Trust may
be obligations of issuers whose revenues are derived from services provided by
hospitals or other health care facilities, including nursing homes. Ratings of
bonds issued for health care facilities are sometimes based on feasibility
studies that contain projections of occupancy levels, revenues and expenses. A
facility's gross receipts and net income available for debt service may be
affected by future events and conditions including, among other things, demand
for services, the ability of the facility to provide the services required, an
increasing shortage of qualified nurses or a dramatic rise in nursing salaries,
physicians' confidence in the facility, management capabilities, economic
developments in the service area, competition from other similar providers,
efforts by insurers and governmental agencies to limit rates, legislation
establishing state rate-setting agencies, expenses, government regulation, the
cost and possible unavailability of malpractice insurance, and the termination
or restriction of governmental financial assistance, including that associated
with Medicare, Medicaid and other similar third party payor programs. Medicare
reimbursements are currently calculated on a prospective basis and are not based
on a provider's actual costs. Such method of reimbursement may adversely affect
reimbursements to hospitals and other facilities for services provided under the
Medicare program and thereby may have an adverse effect on the ability of such
institutions to satisfy debt service requirements. In the event of a default
upon a bond secured by hospital facilities, the limited alternative uses for
such facilities may result in the recovery upon such collateral not providing
sufficient funds to fully repay the bonds.


Certain hospital bonds provide for redemption at par upon the damage,
destruction or condemnation of the hospital facilities or in other special
circumstances.


SINGLE FAMILY AND MULTI-FAMILY HOUSING REVENUE OBLIGATIONS.  Some of the
Bonds in a Trust may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are primarily
derived from mortgage loans to housing projects for the elderly or for low to
moderate income families. Such issues are generally characterized by mandatory
redemption at par or, in the case of original issue discount bonds, accreted
value in the event of economic defaults and in the event of a failure of the
operator of a project to comply with certain covenants as to the operation of
the project. The failure of such operator to comply with certain covenants
related to the tax-exempt status of interest on the Bonds, such as provisions
requiring that a specified percentage of units be rented or available for rental
to low or moderate income families, potentially could cause interest on such
Bonds to be subject to Federal income taxation from the date of issuance of the
Bonds. The ability of such issuers to make debt service payments will be
affected by events and conditions affecting financed projects, including, among
other things, the achievement and maintenance of sufficient occupancy levels and
adequate rental income, employment and income conditions prevailing in local
labor markets, increases in taxes, utility costs and other operating expenses,
the managerial ability of project managers, changes in laws and governmental
regulations, the appropriation of subsidies, and social and economic trends
affecting the localities in which the projects are located. Occupancy of such
housing projects may be adversely affected by high rent levels and income
limitations imposed under Federal and state programs.


SINGLE FAMILY MORTGAGE REVENUE BONDS.  Some of the Bonds in a Trust may be
single family mortgage revenue bonds, which are issued for the purpose of
acquiring from originating financial institutions notes secured by mortgages on
residences located within the issuer's boundaries and owned by persons of low or
moderate income. Mortgage loans are generally partially or completely prepaid
prior to their final maturities as a result of events such as sale of the
mortgaged premises, default, condemnation or casualty loss. Because these bonds
are subject to extraordinary mandatory redemption in whole or in part from such
prepayments of mortgage loans, a substantial portion of such bonds will probably
be redeemed prior to their scheduled maturities or even prior to their ordinary
call dates. Extraordinary mandatory redemption without premium could also result
from the failure of the originating financial institutions to make mortgage
loans in sufficient amounts within a specified time period. The redemption price
of such issues may be more or less than the offering price of such bonds.
Additionally, unusually high rates of default on the underlying mortgage loans
may reduce revenues available for the payment of principal of or interest on
such mortgage revenue


2





bonds. Single family mortgage revenue bonds issued after December 31, 1980 were
issued under Section 103A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, or

Section 143 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, which Sections contain certain
requirements relating to the use of the proceeds of such bonds in order for the
interest on such bonds to retain its tax-exempt status. In each case, the issuer
of the bonds has covenanted to comply with applicable requirements and bond
counsel to such issuer has issued an opinion that the interest on the bonds is
exempt from Federal income tax under existing laws and regulations. There can be
no assurance that such continuing requirements will be satisfied; the failure to
meet such requirements could cause interest on the Bonds to be subject to
Federal income taxation, possibly from the date of issuance of the Bonds.


CONGREGATE CARE REVENUE OBLIGATIONS.  Some of the Bonds in a Trust may be
obligations of issuers whose revenues are primarily derived from loans to
finance the construction and/or acquisition of congregate care facilities,
including retirement facilities and nursing care units. A facility's gross
receipts and net income available for debt service may be affected by future
events and conditions, including, among other things, demand for services, the
ability of the facility to provide the services required, management
capabilities, an increasing shortage of qualified nurses or a dramatic rise in
nursing salaries, economic developments in the service area, competition from
other similar providers, efforts by insurers and governmental agencies to limit
rates, legislation establishing state rate-setting agencies, expenses,
government regulation and the termination or restriction of governmental
financial assistance.


FEDERALLY ENHANCED OBLIGATIONS.  Some of the mortgages which secure the
various health care or housing projects which underlie the previously discussed
Health Care Facility Revenue, Single Family and Multi-Family Housing Revenue,
Single Family Mortgage Revenue Obligations and Congregate Care Revenue Bonds
(the "Obligations") in a Trust may be insured by the Federal Housing
Administration ("FHA"). Under FHA regulations, the maximum insurable mortgage
amount cannot exceed 90% of the FHA's estimated value of the project. The FHA
mortgage insurance does not constitute a guarantee of timely payment of the
principal of and interest on the Obligations. Payment of mortgage insurance
benefits may be (1) less than the principal amount of Obligations outstanding or

(2) delayed if disputes arise as to the amount of the payment or if certain
notices are not given to the FHA within the prescribed time periods. In
addition, some of the previously discussed Obligations may be secured by
mortgage-backed certificates guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage
Association ("GNMA"), a wholly owned corporate instrumentality of the United
States, and/or the Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae") a
federally chartered and stockholder-owed corporation. GNMA and Fannie Mae
guarantee timely payment of principal and interest on the mortgage-backed
certificates, even where the underlying mortgage payments are not made. While
such mortgage-backed certificates are often pledged to secure payment of
principal and interest on the Obligations, timely payment of interest and
principal on the Obligations is not insured or guaranteed by the United States,
GNMA, Fannie Mae or any other governmental agency or instrumentality. The GNMA
mortgage-backed certificates constitute a general obligation of the United
States backed by its full faith and credit. The obligations of Fannie Mae,
including its obligations under the Fannie Mae mortgage-backed securities, are
obligations solely of Fannie Mae and are not backed by, or entitled to, the full
faith and credit of the United States.


PUBLIC HOUSING AUTHORITY REVENUE OBLIGATIONS.  Some of the Bonds in a Trust
may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are primarily derived from loans to
finance public housing projects. These bonds are guaranteed by the federal
Department of Housing and Urban Development. Such issues are generally
characterized by mandatory redemption at par or, in the case of original issue
discount bonds, accreted value in the event of economic defaults. The ability of
such issuers to make debt service payments will be affected by events and
conditions affecting financed projects, including, among other things, the
achievement and maintenance of sufficient occupancy levels, employment and
income conditions prevailing in local labor markets, increases in taxes, utility
costs and other operating expenses, changes in laws and governmental
regulations, and social and economic trends affecting the localities in which
the projects are located. In addition, the federal Department of Housing and
Urban Development may impose regulations and/or limitations which may have an
adverse impact on the Bonds in a Trust.


INDUSTRIAL REVENUE OBLIGATIONS.  Certain of the Bonds in a Trust may be
industrial revenue bonds ("IRBs"), which are tax-exempt securities issued by
states, municipalities, public authorities or similar entities to finance the
cost of acquiring, constructing or improving various industrial projects. These
projects are usually operated by corporate entities. Issuers are obligated only
to pay amounts due on the IRBs to the extent that funds are available from the
unexpended proceeds of the IRBs or receipts or revenues of the issuer under an
arrangement between the issuer and the corporate operator of a project. The
arrangement may be in the form of a lease, installment sale agreement,
conditional sale agreement or loan agreement, but in each case the payments to
the issuer are designed to be sufficient to meet the payments of amounts due on
the IRBs. Regardless of the structure, payment of IRBs is solely dependent upon
the creditworthiness of the corporate operator of the project and, if
applicable, corporate guarantor. Corporate operators or guarantors may be
affected by many factors which may have an adverse impact on the credit quality
of the particular company or industry. These include cyclicality of revenues and
earnings, regulatory and environmental restrictions, litigation resulting from
accidents or environmentally-caused illnesses, extensive competition and
financial deterioration resulting from a corporate restructuring pursuant to a
leveraged buy-out, takeover or otherwise. Such a restructuring may


3





result in the operator of a project becoming highly leveraged which may have an
impact on such operator's creditworthiness which in turn would have an adverse
impact on the rating and/or market value of such Bonds. Further, the possibility
of such a restructuring may have an adverse impact on the market for and
consequently the value of such Bonds, even though no actual takeover or other
action is ever contemplated or effected. The IRBs in a Trust may be subject to
special or extraordinary redemption provisions which may provide for redemption
at par or, in the case of original issue discount bonds, accreted value. The
Sponsor cannot predict the causes or likelihood of the redemption of IRBs in a
Trust prior to the stated maturity of such Bonds.


POWER REVENUE OBLIGATIONS.  Some of the Bonds in a Trust may be obligations
of issuers whose revenues are primarily derived from pollution control bonds as
well as the sale of electric energy and oil and gas. Some of these obligations
are backed by the credit of an investor owned utility (IOU). The problems faced
by such issuers include the difficulty in obtaining approval for timely and
adequate rate increases from the applicable public utility commissions, the
difficulty of financing large construction programs, increased competition,
reductions in estimates of future demand for electricity in certain areas of the
country, the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays
attributable to environmental considerations, the difficulty of the capital
market in absorbing utility debt, the difficulty in obtaining fuel at reasonable
prices and the effect of energy conservation. All of such issuers have been
experiencing certain of these problems in varying degrees. In addition, Federal,
state and municipal governmental authorities may from time to time review
existing, and impose additional, regulations governing the licensing,
construction and operation of nuclear power plants, which may adversely affect
the ability of the issuers of certain of the Bonds in a Trust to make payments
of principal and/or interest on such Bonds.


UTILITY OBLIGATIONS.  Some of the Bonds in a Trust may be obligations of
issuers whose revenues are primarily derived from the sale of natural gas or the
combined net revenue of two or more municipal utility systems operating as a
single entity. The problems faced by such issuers include the difficulty in
obtaining approval for timely and adequate rate increases from the applicable
public utility commissions, the difficulty of financing large construction
programs, increased competition, reductions in estimates of future demands for
natural gas in certain areas of the country, the limitations on operations and
increased costs and delays attributable to environmental considerations, the
difficulty of the capital market in absorbing utility debt, the difficulty in
obtaining fuel at reasonable prices and the effect of energy conservation. In
addition, Federal, state and municipal governmental authorities may from time to
time review existing, and impose additional, regulations governing the
licensing, construction and operation of nuclear power plants, which may
adversely affect the ability of the issuers of certain of the Bonds in a Trust
to make payments of principal and/or interest on such Bonds.


TRANSPORTATION BONDS.  Some of the Bonds in a Trust may be obligations of
issuers which are payable from and secured by revenues derived from the
ownership and operation of airports, public transit systems and ports. The major
portion of an airport's gross operating income is generally derived from fees
received from airlines pursuant to use agreements which consist of annual
payments for airport use, occupancy of certain terminal space, service fees and
leases. Airport operating income may therefore be affected by the ability of the
airlines to meet their obligations under the use agreements. The air transport
industry is experiencing significant variations in earnings and traffic, due to
increased competition, excess capacity, increased costs, deregulation, traffic
constraints and other factors, and several airlines are experiencing severe
financial difficulties. In particular, facilities with use agreements involving
airlines experiencing financial difficulty may experience a reduction in revenue
due to the possible inability of these airlines to meet their use agreement
obligations because of such financial difficulties and possible bankruptcy. The
Sponsor cannot predict what effect these industry conditions may have on airport
revenues which are dependent for payment on the financial condition of the
airlines and their usage of the particular airport facility. Bonds that are
secured primarily by the revenue collected by a public transit system typically
are additionally secured by a pledge of sales tax receipts collected at the
state or local level, or of other governmental financial assistance. Transit
system net revenues will be affected by variations in utilization, which in turn
may be affected by the degree of local governmental subsidization, demographic
and population shifts, and competition from other forms of transportation; and
by increased costs, including costs resulting from previous deferrals of
maintenance. Port authorities derive their revenues primarily from fees imposed
on ships using the facilities. The rate of utilization of such facilities may
fluctuate depending on the local economy and on competition from competing forms
of transportation such as air, rail and trucks.


WATER AND/OR SEWERAGE REVENUE OBLIGATIONS.  Some of the Bonds in a Trust may
be obligations of issuers whose revenues are derived from the sale of water
and/or sewerage services. Such Bonds are generally payable from user fees. The
problems of such issuers include the ability to obtain timely and adequate rate
increases, population decline resulting in decreased user fees, the difficulty
of financing large construction programs, the limitations on operations and
increased costs and delays attributable to environmental considerations, the
increasing difficulty of obtaining or discovering new supplies of fresh water,
the effect of conservation programs and the impact of "no-growth" zoning
ordinances. All of such issuers have been experiencing certain of these problems
in varying degrees.


4





RESOURCE RECOVERY REVENUE OBLIGATIONS.  Some of the Bonds in a Trust may be
obligations of issuers whose revenues are derived from the sale of sewerage or
solid waste disposal services. Such bonds are generally payable from user fees.
The problems of such issuers include the ability to obtain timely and adequate
rate increases, population decline resulting in decreased user fees, the
difficulty of financing large construction programs, the limitations on
operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental
considerations, the effect of conservation programs and the impact of
"no-growth" zoning ordinances. All of such issuers have been experiencing
certain of these problems in varying degrees.


EDUCATION REVENUE OBLIGATIONS.  Some of the Bonds in a Trust may be
obligations of issuers which are, or which govern the operation of, colleges and
universities and whose revenues are derived mainly from tuition, dormitory
revenues, grants and endowments. General problems of such issuers include the
prospect of a declining percentage of the population consisting of "college" age
individuals, possible inability to raise tuitions and fees sufficiently to cover
increased operating costs, the uncertainty of continued receipt of Federal
grants and state funding, and government legislation or regulations which may
adversely affect the revenues or costs of such issuers. All of such issuers have
been experiencing certain of these problems in varying degrees.


BRIDGE AND TOLLROAD REVENUE OBLIGATIONS.  Some of the Bonds in a Trust may
be obligations of issuers which derive their payments from bridge, road or
tunnel toll revenues. The revenues of such an issuer could be adversely affected
by competition from toll-free vehicular bridges and roads and alternative modes
of transportation. Such revenues could also be adversely affected by a reduction
in the availability of fuel to motorists or significant increases in the costs
thereof. Specifically, governmental regulations restricting the use of vehicles
in the New York City metropolitan area may adversely affect revenues of the
Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority.


DEDICATED-TAX SUPPORTED REVENUE BONDS.  Some of the Bonds in a Trust may be
obligations of issuers which are payable from and secured by tax revenues from a
designated source, which revenues are pledged to secure the bonds. The various
types of Bonds described below differ in structure and with respect to the
rights of the bondholders to the underlying property. Each type of dedicated-tax
supported Bond has distinct risks, only some of which are set forth below. One
type of dedicated-tax supported Bond is secured by the incremental tax received
on either real property or on sales within a specifically defined geographical
area; such tax generally will not provide bondholders with a lien on the
underlying property or revenues. Another type of dedicated-tax supported Bond is
secured by a special tax levied on real property within a defined geographical
area in such a manner that the tax is levied on those who benefit from the
project; such bonds typically provide for a statutory lien on the underlying
property for unpaid taxes. A third type of dedicated-tax supported Bond may be
secured by a tax levied upon the manufacture, sale or consumption of commodities
or upon the license to pursue certain occupations or upon corporate privileges
within a taxing jurisdiction. As to any of these types of Bonds, the ability of
the designated revenues to satisfy the interest and principal payments on such
bonds may be affected by changes in the local economy, the financial success of
the enterprise responsible for the payment of the taxes, the value of any
property on which taxes may be assessed and the ability to collect such taxes in
a timely fashion. Each of these factors will have a different affect on each
distinct type of dedicated-tax supported bonds.


MUNICIPAL LEASE REVENUE BONDS.  Some of the Bonds in a Trust may be
obligations that are secured by lease payments of a governmental entity. Such
payments are normally subject to annual budget appropriations of the leasing
governmental entity. A governmental entity that enters into such a lease
agreement cannot obligate future governments to appropriate for and make lease
payments but covenants to take such action as is necessary to include any lease
payments due in its budgets and to make the appropriations therefor. A
governmental entity's failure to appropriate for and to make payments under its
lease obligation could result in insufficient funds available for payment of the
obligations secured thereby.


SPECIAL OBLIGATION TO CROSSOVER.  Some of the Bonds in a Trust may be issued
with the intention of crossover refunding an outstanding issue at a future date.
These bonds are secured to the crossover date by U.S. Government securities
purchased with the proceeds of the refunding bonds. The revenues of such an
issuer could be adversely affected by problems associated with the outstanding
issue, economic, social and environmental policies and conditions that are not
within the control of the issuer and governmental policies and regulations
affecting the issuer.


CIVIC ORGANIZATION OBLIGATIONS.  Some of the Bonds in a Trust may be
obligations of issuers whose revenues are derived from the pledge of civic
organizations, including their assets. The problems faced by such issuers
include the ability to collect pledges made, the unpredictable nature of an
organization's composition and participation, the quality and skill of
management, increased costs and delays attributable to organizations, expenses,
and legislation regarding certain organizational purposes.


ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT BONDS AND STRIPPED OBLIGATIONS.  Certain of the
Bonds in a Trust may be original issue discount bonds. These Bonds were issued
with nominal interest rates less than the rates then offered by comparable
securities and as a consequence were originally sold at a discount from their
face, or par, values. This original issue discount, the difference between the
initial purchase price and face value, is deemed under current law to accrue on
a


5





daily basis and the accrued portion is treated as tax-exempt interest income for
federal income tax purposes. On sale or redemption, gain, if any, realized in
excess of the earned portion of original issue discount will be taxable as
capital gain. See "What is the Tax Status of Unitholders". The current value of
an original issue discount bond reflects the present value of its face amount at
maturity. In a stable interest rate environment, the market value of an original
issue discount bond would tend to increase more slowly in early years and in
greater increments as the bond approached maturity.


Certain of the original issue discount bonds in a Trust may be zero coupon
bonds. Zero coupon bonds do not provide for the payment of any current interest;
the buyer receives only the right to receive a final payment of the face amount
of the bond at its maturity. The effect of owning a zero coupon bond is that a
fixed yield is earned not only on the original investment but also, in effect,
on all discount earned during the life of the obligation. This implicit
reinvestment of earnings at the same rate eliminates the risk of being unable to
reinvest the income on such obligation at a rate as high as the implicit yield,
but at the same time also eliminates the holder's ability to reinvest at higher
rates in the future. For this reason, zero coupon bonds are subject to
substantially greater price fluctuations during periods of changing market
interest rates than are securities of comparable quality that pay interest
currently.


Original issue discount bonds, including zero coupon bonds, may be subject
to redemption at prices based on the issue price plus the amount of original
issue discount accreted to redemption (the "accreted value") plus, if
applicable, some premium. Pursuant to such call provisions an original issue
discount bond may be called prior to its maturity date at a price less than its
face value. See the "Schedules of Investments" for more information about the
call provisions of portfolio Bonds.


Certain of the Bonds in a Trust may be Stripped Obligations, which represent
evidences of ownership with respect to either the principal amount of or a
payment of interest on a tax-exempt obligation. An obligation is "stripped" by
depositing it with a custodian, which then effects a separation in ownership
between the bond and any interest payment which has not yet become payable, and
issues evidences of ownership with respect to such constituent parts. A Stripped
Obligation therefore has economic characteristics similar to zero coupon bonds,
as described above.


Each Stripped Obligation has been purchased at a discount from the amount
payable at maturity. With respect to each Unitholder, the Internal Revenue Code
treats as "original issue discount" that portion of the discount which produces
a yield to maturity (as of the date of purchase of the Unitholder's Units) equal
to the lower of the coupon rate of interest on the underlying obligation or the
yield to maturity on the basis of the purchase price of the Unitholder's Units
which is allocable to each Stripped Obligation. Original issue discount which
accrues with respect to a Stripped Obligation will be exempt from Federal income
taxation to the same extent as interest on the underlying obligations. (See
"WHAT IS THE TAX STATUS OF UNITHOLDERS?" in Part B of this Prospectus.)


Unitholders should consult their own tax advisers with respect to the state
and local tax consequences of owning original issue discount bonds or Stripped
Obligations. Under applicable provisions governing determination of state and
local taxes, interest on original issue discount bonds or Stripped Obligations
may be deemed to be received in the year of accrual even though there is no
corresponding cash payment.



WHY AND HOW ARE THE BONDS INSURED?




INSURANCE ON BONDS



INSURED TRUSTS--The Insurer's policy unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees
the full and complete payment required to be made by or on behalf of the Issuer
to the Paying Agent or its successor of an amount equal to (i) the principal of
(either at the stated maturity or by an advancement of maturity pursuant to a
mandatory sinking fund payment) and interest on, the Bonds as such payments
shall become due but shall not be so paid (except that in the event of any
acceleration of the due date of such principal by reason of mandatory or
optional redemption or acceleration resulting from default or otherwise, other
than any advancement of maturity pursuant to a mandatory sinking fund payment,
the payments guaranteed by the Insurer's policy shall be made in such amounts
and at such times as such payments of principal would have been due had there
not been any such acceleration); and (ii) the reimbursement of any such payment
which is subsequently recovered from any owner of the Bonds pursuant to a final
judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction that such payment constitutes an
avoidable preference to such owner within the meaning of any applicable
bankruptcy law (a "Preference").


The Insurer's policy does not insure against loss of any prepayment premium
which may at any time be payable with respect to any Bond. The Insurer's policy
does not, under any circumstance, insure against loss relating to: (i) optional
or mandatory redemptions (other than mandatory sinking fund redemptions); (ii)
any payments to be made on an accelerated basis; (iii) payments of the purchase
price of Bonds upon tender by an owner thereof; or (iv) any Preference relating
to (i) through (iii) above. The Insurer's policy also does not insure against
nonpayment of principal of or interest on the Bonds resulting from the
insolvency, negligence or any other act or omission of the Paying Agent or any
other paying agent for the Bonds.


6





Upon receipt of telephonic or telegraphic notice, such notice subsequently
confirmed in writing by registered or certified mail, or upon receipt of written
notice by registered or certified mail, by the Insurer from the Paying Agent or
any owner of a Bond the payment of an insured amount for which is then due, that
such required payment has not been made, the Insurer on the due date of such
payment or within one business day after receipt of notice of such nonpayment,
whichever is later, will make a deposit of funds, in an account with State
Street Bank and Trust Company, N.A., in New York, New York, or its successor,
sufficient for the payment of any such insured amounts which are then due. Upon
presentment and surrender of such Bonds or presentment of such other proof of
ownership of the Bonds, together with any appropriate instruments of assignment
to evidence the assignment of the insured amounts due on the Bonds as are paid
by the Insurer, and appropriate instruments to effect the appointment of the
Insurer as agent for such owners of the Bonds in any legal proceeding related to
payment of insured amounts on the Bonds, such instruments being in a form
satisfactory to State Street Bank and Trust Company, N.A., State Street Bank and
Trust Company, N.A. shall disperse to such owners or the Paying Agent payment of
the insured amounts due on such Bonds, less any amount held by the Paying Agent
for the payment of such insured amounts and legally available therefor.


The Insurer is the principal operating subsidiary of MBIA, Inc., a New York
Stock Exchange listed company (the "Company"). The Company is not obligated to
pay the debts of or claims against the Insurer. The Insurer is domiciled in the
State of New York and licensed to do business in and subject to regulation under
the laws of all 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto
Rico, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Virgin Islands of
the United States and the Territory of Guam. The Insurer has two European
branches, one in the Republic of France and the other in the Kingdom of Spain.
New York has laws prescribing minimum capital requirements, limiting classes and
concentrations of investments and requiring the approval of policy rates and
forms. State laws also regulate the amount of both the aggregate and individual
risks that may be insured, the payment of dividends by the Insurer, changes in
control and transactions among affiliates. Additionally, the Insurer is required
to maintain contingency reserves on its liabilities in certain amounts and for
certain periods of time.


Effective February 17, 1998, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
stock of Capital Markets Assurance Corporation ("CMAC"), a New York domiciled
financial guarantee insurance company, through a merger with its parent, CapMAC
Holdings, Inc. Pursuant to a reinsurance agreement, CMAC has ceded all of its
net insured risks (including any amounts due but unpaid from third party
reinsurers), as well as its unearned premiums and contingency reserves, to the
Insurer. The Company is not obligated to pay the debts of or claims against
CMAC.


As of December 31, 1998, the Insurer had admitted assets of $6.5 billion
(audited), total liabilities of $4.2 billion (audited), and total capital and
surplus of $2.3 billion (audited) determined in accordance with statutory
accounting practices prescribed or permitted by insurance regulatory
authorities. As of June 30, 1999, MBIA had admitted assets of $6.8 billion
(unaudited), total liabilities of $4.5 billion (unaudited), and total capital
and surplus of $2.3 billion (unaudited) determined in accordance with statutory
accounting practices prescribed or permitted by insurance regulatory
authorities.


Furthermore, copies of the Insurer's year end financial statements prepared
in accordance with statutory accounting practices are available without charge
from the Insurer. A copy of the Annual Report on Form 10-K of the Company is
available from the Insurer or the Securities and Exchange Commission. The
address of the Insurer is 113 King Street, Armonk, New York 10504. The telephone
number of the Insurer is (914) 273-4545.



YEAR 2000 READINESS DISCLOSURE



MBIA, Inc. is actively managing a high-priority Year 2000 (Y2K) program. The
company has established an independent Y2K testing lab in its Armonk
headquarters, with a committee of business unit managers overseeing the project.
MBIA has a budget of $1.13 million for its 1998-2000 Y2K efforts. Expenditures
are proceeding as anticipated, and we do not expect the project budget to
materially exceed this amount. MBIA has initiated a comprehensive Y2K plan that
includes assessment, remediation, testing and contingency planning. This plan
covers "mission-critical" internally developed systems, vendor software,
hardware and certain third-party entities through which we conduct our business.
Testing to date indicates that functions critical to the financial guarantee
business, both domestic and international, were Y2K-ready as of December 31,
1998. Additional testing will continue throughout 1999.


Moody's Investors Service rates the claims paying ability of the Insurer
"Aaa".


Standard & Poor's Ratings Service, a division of the McGraw Hill Companies,
Inc., rates the claims paying ability of the Insurer "AAA".


Fitch IBCA, Inc. (formerly known as Fitch Investors Service, L.P.) rates the
financial strength of the Insurer "AAA."


Each rating of the Insurer should be evaluated independently. The ratings
reflect the respective rating agency's current assessment of the
creditworthiness of the Insurer and its ability to pay claims on its policies of
insurance. Any further explanation as to the significance of the above ratings
may be obtained only from the applicable rating agency.


7





The above ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold the Bonds,
and such ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the
rating agencies. Any downward revision or withdrawal of any of the above ratings
may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Bonds. The Insurer does
not guaranty the market price of the Bonds nor does it guaranty that the ratings
on the Bonds will not be revised or withdrawn.


TRADITIONAL TRUSTS--Insurance guaranteeing the timely payment, when due, of all
principal and interest on certain Bonds in a Traditional Trust may have been
obtained by the Sponsor, issuer or underwriter of the particular Bonds involved
or by another party. Such insurance, which provides coverage substantially the
same as that obtained with respect to Bonds in Insured Trusts as described
above, is effective so long as the insured Bond is outstanding and the insurer
remains in business. Insurance relates only to the particular Bond and not to
the Units offered hereby or to their market value. Insured Bonds have received a
rating of "Aaa" by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and/or "AAA" by Standard &
Poor's Corporation in recognition of such insurance.


If a Bond in a Traditional Trust is insured, the Schedule of Investments in
Part A of this Prospectus will identify the insurer. Such insurance will be
provided by Financial Guaranty Insurance Company ("FGIC"), AMBAC Assurance
Corporation ("AMBAC"), Bond Investors Guaranty Insurance Company, now known as
MBIA Corp. of Illinois ("BIG"), Capital Guaranty Insurance Company ("CGIC"),
Financial Security Assurance, Inc. ("FSA"), Municipal Bond Insurance Association
(the "Association"), MBIA Insurance Corporation ("MBIA") or Connie Lee Insurance
Company ("ConnieLee"). The Sponsor to date has purchased and presently intends
to purchase insurance for Bonds in Traditional Trusts exclusively from MBIA (see
the preceding disclosure regarding MBIA). There can be no assurance that any
insurer listed therein will be able to satisfy its commitments in the event
claims are made in the future. However, Standard & Poor's Corporation has rated
the claims-paying ability of each insurer "AAA," and Moody's Investors Service
has rated all bonds insured by each such insurer, except ConnieLee, "Aaa."
Moody's Investor's Service gives no ratings for bonds insured by ConnieLee.


Because any such insurance will be effective so long as the insured Bonds
are outstanding, such insurance will be taken into account in determining the
market value of such Bonds and therefore some value attributable to such
insurance will be included in the value of the Units of the Trust that includes
such Bonds. The insurance does not, however, guarantee the market value of the
Bonds or of the Units.



ACCUMULATION PLAN



The Sponsor, John Nuveen & Co. Incorporated, is also the principal
underwriter of the Accumulation Funds listed in the following table. Each of
these funds is an open-end, diversified management investment company into which
Unitholders may choose to reinvest Trust distributions automatically, without
any sales charge. Unitholders may reinvest both interest and principal
distributions or principal distributions only. Each Accumulation Fund has
investment objectives which differ in certain respects from those of the Trusts
and may invest in securities which would not be eligible for deposit in the
Trusts. The investment adviser to each Accumulation Fund is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Sponsor. Unitholders should contact their financial adviser or
the Sponsor to determine which of the Accumulation Funds they may reinvest into,
as reinvestment in certain of the Accumulation Funds may be restricted to
residents of a particular state or states. Unitholders may obtain a prospectus
for each Accumulation Fund through their financial adviser or through the
Sponsor at (800) 621-7227. For a more detailed description, Unitholders should
read the prospectus of the Accumulation Fund in which they are interested.


The following is a complete list of the Accumulation Funds currently
available, as of the Date of Deposit of this Prospectus, to Unitholders under
the Accumulation Plan. The list of available Accumulation Funds is subject to
change without the consent of any of the Unitholders.

Each person who purchases Units of a Trust may become a participant in the
Accumulation Plan and elect to have his or her distributions on Units of the
Trust invested directly in shares of one of the Accumulation Funds. Reinvesting
Unitholders may select any interest distribution plan. Thereafter, each
distribution of interest income or principal on the participant's Units
(principal only in the case of a Unitholder who has chosen to reinvest only
principal distributions) will, on the applicable distribution date, or the next
day on which the New York Stock Exchange is normally open ("business day") if
the distribution date is not a business day, automatically be received by the
transfer agent for each of the Accumulation Funds, on behalf of such participant
and applied on that date to purchase shares (or fractions thereof) of the
Accumulation Fund chosen at net asset value as computed as of 4:00 p.m. eastern
time on each such date. All

distributions will be reinvested in the Accumulation Fund chosen and no part
thereof will be retained in a separate account. These purchases will be made
without a sales charge.


The Transfer Agent of the Accumulation Fund will mail to each participant in
the Accumulation Plan a quarterly statement containing a record of all
transactions involving purchases of Accumulation Fund shares (or fractions
thereof) with Trust interest distributions or as a result of reinvestment of
Accumulation Fund dividends. Any distribution of principal used to purchase
shares of an Accumulation Fund will be separately confirmed by the Transfer
Agent. Unitholders will also receive distribution statements from the Trustee
detailing the amounts transferred to their Accumulation Fund accounts.


Participants may at any time, by so notifying the Trustee in writing, elect
to change the Accumulation Fund into which their distributions are being
reinvested, to change from principal only reinvestment to reinvestment of both
principal and interest or vice versa, or to terminate their participation in the
Accumulation Plan altogether and receive future distributions on their Units in
cash. There will be no charge or other penalty for such change of election or
termination. The character of Trust distributions for income tax purposes will
remain unchanged even if they are reinvested in an Accumulation Fund.

DESCRIPTION OF RATINGS*



STANDARD & POOR'S CORPORATION.  A description of the applicable Standard &
Poor's Corporation rating symbols and their meanings follows:


A Standard & Poor's rating is a current assessment of the creditworthiness
of an obligor with respect to a specific debt obligation. This assessment may
take into consideration obligors such as guarantors, insurers or lessees.


The rating is not a recommendation to purchase, sell or hold a security,
inasmuch as it does not comment as to market price or suitability for a
particular investor.


The ratings are based on current information furnished by the issuer or
obtained by Standard & Poor's from other sources it considers reliable. Standard
& Poor's does not perform an audit in connection with any rating and may, on
occasion, rely on unaudited financial information. The ratings may be changed,
suspended or withdrawn as a result of changes in, or unavailability of, such
information, or for other circumstances.


The ratings are based, in varying degrees, on the following considerations:


I.  Likelihood of default--capacity and willingness of the obligor as to
the timely payment of interest and repayment of principal in accordance
with the terms of the obligation;


II.  Nature of and provisions of the obligation;


III.  Protection afforded by, and relative position of, the obligation in
the event of bankruptcy, reorganization or other arrangements under
the laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors' rights.


AAA--This is the highest rating assigned by Standard & Poor's to a debt
obligation. Capacity to pay interest and repay principal is extremely strong.


AA--Bonds rated AA have a very strong capacity to pay interest and repay
principal, and differ from the highest rated issues only in small degree.


A--Bonds rated A have a strong capacity to pay interest and repay principal,
although they are somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in
circumstances and economic conditions than bonds in higher rated categories.


BBB--Bonds rated BBB are regarded as having an adequate capacity to pay
interest and repay principal. Whereas they normally exhibit adequate protection
parameters, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more
likely to lead to a weakened capacity to pay interest and repay principal for
bonds in this category than for bonds in the higher rated categories.


PLUS (+) OR MINUS (-): The ratings from "AA" to "BB" may be modified by the
addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major
rating categories.


PROVISIONAL RATINGS: The letter "p" indicates that the rating is
provisional. A provisional rating assumes the successful completion of the
project being financed by the issuance of the bonds being rated and indicates
that payment of debt service requirements is largely or entirely dependent upon
the successful and timely completion of the project. This rating, however, while
addressing credit quality subsequent to completion of the project, makes no
comment on the likelihood of, or the risk of default upon failure of, such
completion. Accordingly, the investor should exercise his own judgment with
respect to such likelihood and risk.


NOTE RATINGS: A Standard & Poor's note rating reflects the liquidity
concerns and market access risks unique to notes. Notes due in 3 years or less
will likely receive a note rating. Notes maturing beyond 3 years will most
likely receive a long-term debt rating.


Note rating symbols are as follows:


SP-1  Very strong or strong capacity to pay principal and interest.

Those issues determined to possess overwhelming safety
characteristics will be given a plus (+) designation.


SP-2  Satisfactory capacity to pay principal and interest.


MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE, INC.  A brief description of the applicable
Moody's Investors Service, Inc. rating symbols and their meanings follows:


Aaa--Bonds which are rated Aaa are judged to be the best quality. They carry
the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as "gilt
edge." Interest payments are protected by a large or by an exceptionally stable
margin and principal is secure. While the various protective elements are likely
to change, such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair the
fundamentally strong position of such issues. Their safety is so absolute that,




*As published by the rating companies.



11





with the occasional exception of oversupply in a few specific instances,
characteristically, their market value is affected solely by money market
fluctuations.


Aa--Bonds which are rated Aa are judged to be of high quality by all
standards. Together with the Aaa group they comprise what are generally known as
high grade bonds. They are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of
protection may not be as large as in Aaa securities or fluctuations of
protective elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements
present which make the long-term risks appear somewhat larger than in Aaa
securities. Their market value is virtually immune to all but money market
influences, with the occasional exception of oversupply in a few specific
instances.


A--Bonds which are rated A possess many favorable investment attributes and
are to be considered as upper medium grade obligations. Factors giving security
to principal and interest are considered adequate, but elements may be present
which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future. The market
value of A-rated bonds may be influenced to some degree by economic performance
during a sustained period of depressed business conditions, but, during periods
of normalcy, A-rated bonds frequently move in parallel with Aaa and Aa
obligations, with the occasional exception of oversupply in a few specific
instances.


Moody's bond rating symbols may contain numerical modifiers of a generic
rating classification. The modifier 1 indicates that the bond ranks at the high
end of its category; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the
modifier 3 indicates that the issue ranks in the lower end of its generic rating
category.


Baa--Bonds which are rated Baa are considered as medium grade obligations,

i.e., they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured. Interest payments
and principal security appear adequate for the present but certain protective
elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great
length of time. Such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in
fact have speculative characteristics as well. The market value of Baa-rated
bonds is more sensitive to changes in economic circumstances, and aside from
occasional speculative factors applying to some bonds of this class, Baa market
valuations move in parallel with Aaa, Aa and A obligations during periods of
economic normalcy, except in instances of oversupply.


Con. (--)--Bonds for which the security depends upon the completion of some
act or the fulfillment of some condition are rated conditionally. These are
bonds secured by (a) earnings of projects under construction, (b) earnings of
projects unseasoned in operation experience, (c) rentals which begin when
facilities are completed, or (d) payments to which some other limiting condition
attaches. Parenthetical rating denotes probable credit stature upon completion
of construction or elimination of basis of condition.





NOTE RATINGS:







MIG 1  This designation denotes best quality. There is present strong
       protection by established cash flows, superior liquidity support or
       demonstrated broad-based access to the market for refinancing.

MIG 2  This designation denotes high quality. Margins of protection are
       ample although not so large as in the preceding group.








FITCH IBCA, INC. (formerly Fitch Investors Service, L.P.) A brief
description of the applicable Fitch IBCA, Inc. rating symbols and their meanings
follow:


AAA--Bonds considered to be investment grade and of the highest credit
quality. The obligor has an exceptionally strong ability to pay interest and
repay principal, which is unlikely to be affected by reasonably foreseeable
events.


AA--Bonds considered to be investment grade and of very high credit quality.
The obligor's ability to pay interest and repay principal is very strong,
although not quite as strong as bonds rated AAA. Bonds rated in the AAA and AA
categories are not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable future developments.


A--Bonds considered to be investment grade and of high credit quality. The
obligor's ability to pay interest and repay principal is considered to be
strong, but may be more vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions and
circumstances than bonds with higher ratings.


BBB--Bonds considered to be investment grade and of satisfactory credit
quality. The obligor's ability to pay interest and repay principal is considered
to be adequate. Adverse changes in economic conditions and circumstances,
however, are more likely to have adverse impact on these bonds, and therefore
impair timely payment. The likelihood that the ratings of these bonds will fall
below investment grade is higher than for bonds with higher ratings.


To provide more detailed indications of credit quality, the AA, A and BBB
ratings may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative
standing within these major rating categories.





NOTE RATINGS:







FIN-1  Notes assigned this rating are regarded as having the strongest
       degree of assurance for timely payment.

                                   12













FIN-2  Notes assigned this rating reflect a degree of assurance for timely
       payment only slightly less in degree than the highest category.









HOW THE TRUST COMPARES PERFORMANCE



The Sponsor may compare the estimated returns of the Trust with the returns
or yields of other tax-free and taxable investments, often on a taxable
equivalent basis. In addition, the Sponsor from time to time may quote various
performance measures and studies in order to compare the historical returns
available from an investment in municipal securities with investments in both
tax-free and taxable securities.


Nuveen Research prepared one such study which compared the after-tax value
of $100,000 initially invested in 1977 in various asset classes including
municipal bonds, treasury bonds and corporate bonds. As indicated in the chart
provided below, the 20-year study shows that municipal bonds significantly
outperformed corporate and treasury bonds once the effects of taxes were
factored in. In fact, over the 20-year period, municipal bond returns in dollars
were almost double those of treasury bonds.



AFTER-TAX VALUE OF $100,000 INVESTED IN 1977*



The graph appearing on this page of the Information Supplement compares
after-tax total returns of $100,000 initially in 1977 in each of the Lehman
Brothers MuniBond Index, Long-Term Treasury Index and Long-Term Corporate Index.
As indicated in the graph, such an investment in the Lehman Brothers MuniBond
Index, Long-Term Treasury Index and Long-Term Corporate Index would have
appreciated to $511,039, $274,434, and $298,682, respectively at the end of
1996. The graph assumes all proceeds of investment are reinvested at the
respective index rates at the time of reinvestment and also assumes that 20% of
the assets in each category are turned over annually and proceeds are reinvested
in the respective indexes. The tax rates assumed to generate the after-tax total
returns were based upon the income and capital gain rates applicable each year
from 1977-1996 for an investor who earned the inflation-adjusted equivalents of
$500,000 in 1996. In addition, treasury returns were "grossed up" an assumed 5%
to take into account the Treasuries' exemption from state income tax. The graph
is for illustrative purposes only, and does not represent the return or
performance of any Nuveen Tax-Free Unit Trust and is not intended to predict
future results.

A comparison of the estimated returns of the Trust and the historic
performance of municipal bonds to the returns and performance of other
investments is one element to consider in making an informed investment
decision. Taxable investments have investment characteristics that differ from
those of the Trust. U.S. Government bonds are long-term investments backed by
the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government and are subject to federal
income tax but are exempt from state income taxes. Bank CDs are generally
short-term FDIC insured investments, which pay fixed principal and interest but
are subject to fluctuating rollover rates. Both bank CDs and corporate bonds are
generally subject to both federal and state income taxes. Money market funds are
short term investments with stable net asset values, fluctuating yields and
special features that enhance liquidity.

HOW TO CALCULATE YOUR ESTIMATED INCOME



The examples provided below illustrate how to calculate the estimated annual
income generated by a hypothetical $10,000 investment in each respective Trust.
The illustrations assume that the investment was made on the day prior to the
date of deposit by an investor electing the monthly distribution plan and that
the portfolio contains all the securities described in the portfolio. These
hypothetical examples are for illustrative purposes only and not intended to
reflect or predict the results of any actual investment and do not contemplate
changes to the portfolio or expenses.

ECONOMIC FACTORS--ARIZONA



GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.  Progressing from its traditional reliance on a
cyclical construction industry, Arizona's economic base is maturing and
diversifying. One of the nation's leaders in employment growth, Arizona has been
among the top five employment growth states for more than four years, and it
should remain there through 1998. After climbing by 6.2% in 1994, during which
the state's economy produced the second-highest number of jobs of any year in
Arizona history, job creation in Arizona is leveling off with employment growth
of 5.6% in 1996-97, although this compares favorably with the national figure of
2.0%. Arizona's wage and salary employment grew 5.6% in 1996, 4.5% in 1997 and
is forecast to increase by 3.5% to 4.5% in 1998, and 3.5% in 1999. The
unemployment rate, around 4.5% for 1997, should remain low before increasing in
late 1998 and 1999.


Arizona ranked third in the nation in personal income growth during 1991-96.
Personal income, after growing 7.2% in 1997, is estimated at 6.7% in 1998 and
6.5% in 1999.


Overall, Arizona's forecast is for continued but moderate rates of growth in
employment and personal income. Employment growth will continue to be stronger
in the Phoenix area than in the balance of the state. Housing has probably
peaked and is likely to decline after seven extremely strong years. Retail sales
should also continue to slow.


Population, because of continued employment growth, will record
above-average growth rates. After population growth of 3.2% in 1996 and 3% in
1997, the forecast calls for 2.8% in 1998 and 2.5% in 1999. That translates into
almost 130,000 more people in the state in 1998 and 117,000 in 1999.


BUDGETARY PROCESS.  The Budget Reform Act of 1997 made significant changes
to the State's planning and budgeting systems. Beginning with the Fiscal
biennium 2000-01, all State agencies, including capital improvement budgeting,
will be moved to a biennial budgeting system. From Fiscal Year 2000 to 2006, all
State agencies will move to a budget format that reflects the program structure
in the "Master List of State Government Programs."


The Budget Reform Act of 1993 established the current budgeting system of
one-and two-year budget reviews. Agencies selected for annual review and
appropriation are designated as Major Budget Units (MBUs). The 18 MBUs account
for over 90% of the total General Fund expenditures. Agencies selected for
biennial review and appropriation are designated as Other Budget Units (OBUs).
In 1997, combined MBU and OBU in the General Fund totaled $4.68 billion, and is
estimated at $5.1 billion in 1998.


REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES.  The General Fund closed fiscal year 1997 with a
$515.9 million ending balance, setting a new record for the state, and the
Executive plan for fiscal year 1998 anticipates a $497.1 million balance.
Overall, fiscal year 1997 revenues totaled $5,028.2 million. Corporate income
tax revenue jumped by 34%, from $448 million in fiscal year 1996 to $600 million
in fiscal year 1997. Individual income tax revenues grew by 12% from fiscal year
1996 to fiscal year 1997. Expenditures for fiscal year 1997 totaled $4,826.5
million. Revertments totaled $80.17 million in fiscal year 1997.


The current Executive forecast for fiscal year 1998 revenue is $5.289
billion. The major revenue source, transaction privilege taxes, is forecast to
produce $2.3 billion for fiscal year 1998. All three major revenue categories --
individual income taxes, corporate income taxes and transaction privilege taxes
-- showed gains on a year-over-year basis. The most significant impact on fiscal
year 1998 revenues will be the various tax cutting measures enacted over the
past several years, which has decreased revenues by some 3.2%. Overall, the
Executive estimates a 3.7% or $196.9 million increase in base revenues of the
current Fiscal year 1998 estimate. This compares to the 4.5%, or $227.5 million
increase in base revenues between fiscal year 1997 and fiscal year 1998.


The Executive fiscal plan for Fiscal Year 1998 is based on revenue
estimates, yet still provides for Executive-initiated program changes and school
finance of $127.7 million; a $210 million tax reduction and a $96.0 million
capital program. The Executive projects a fiscal year 1998 ending balance of
$497.1 million.


For Fiscal year 1999, the Executive is recommending a base operating budget
of $5.4 billion, an increase of approximately $260.6 million. The majority of
recommended expenditures for fiscal year 1999 are in education. A projected
ending balance of $19.9 million is expected for Fiscal Year 1999. This amount
would ordinarily be considered "thin" at only 0.4% of expenditures. However,
given the prudent revenue forecast and the available reserves of $393 million in
the Budget Stabilization Fund, $95 million in the Medical Services Stabilization
Fund, and $42.4 million in the Temporary Assistance Stabilization Fund, the
$19.9 million amount seems appropriate.


LITIGATION.  In response to the court's ruling in ROOSEVELT V. BISHOP in
1994, the Executive recommended $30 million for the first-year implementation of
a capital assistance program for Arizona's schools. The program is designed to
help school districts that lack bonding capacity due to low value or rapid
growth. Income is provided for in a Capital Equity


A-1





Fund which contains monies appropriated by the Legislature and $30 million
annually from the Common School Land Fund (Permanent State School Fund). The
Permanent State School Fund consists of revenues from the proceeds of the sale
of natural resources or property from lands that have been granted by the United
States to the State of Arizona for the support of common schools. In future
years, the Capital Equity Fund may contain monies remitted by school districts
for the repayment of loans. Funds are used to assist school districts with
capital needs. For fiscal year 1999, the Governor recommends $40.5 million be
appropriated from the Permanent State School Fund, which includes the $30
million appropriated to the Capital Equity Fund.


DEBT ADMINISTRATION AND LIMITATION.  The State is not permitted to issue
general obligation debt. The particular source of payment and security for each
of the Arizona Obligations is detailed in the debt instruments themselves and in
related offering materials. There can be no assurances with respect to whether
the market value or marketability of any of the Arizona Obligations issued by an
entity other than the State of Arizona will be affected by financial or other
conditions of the State or of any entity located within the State. In addition,
it should be noted that the State of Arizona, as well as counties,
municipalities, political subdivisions and other public authorities of the
State, are subject to limitations imposed by Arizona's Constitution with respect
to ad valorem taxation, bonded indebtedness and other matters. For example, the
State legislature cannot appropriate revenues in excess of 7% of the total
personal income of the State in any fiscal year. These limitations may affect
the ability of the issuers to generate revenues to satisfy their debt
obligations.


Although most of the Bonds in an Arizona Trust are revenue obligations of
local governments or authorities in the State, there can be no assurance that
the fiscal and economic conditions referred to above will not affect the market
value or marketability of the Bonds or the ability of the respective obligors to
pay principal of and interest on the Bonds when due.



ARIZONA TAXABLE ESTIMATED CURRENT RETURN TABLE



The following tables show the approximate taxable estimated current returns
for individuals that are equivalent to tax-exempt estimated current returns
under combined Federal and state taxes, using published 1999 marginal Federal
tax rates and marginal state tax rates currently available and scheduled to be
in effect. The table assumes that federal taxable income is equal to state
income subject to tax, and for cases in which more than one state rate falls
within a Federal bracket, the state rate corresponding to the highest income
within that Federal bracket is used. The combined state and Federal tax brackets
shown reflect the fact that state tax payments are currently deductible for
Federal tax purposes and for Arizona tax purposes. The tables do not reflect any
local taxes or any taxes other than personal income taxes. The tables illustrate
what you would have to earn on taxable investments to equal the tax-exempt
estimated current return for your income tax bracket. A taxpayer's marginal tax
rate is affected by both his taxable income and his adjusted gross income.
Locate your adjusted gross and your taxable income (which is your adjusted gross
income reduced by any deductions and exemptions), then locate your tax bracket
based on joint or single tax filing. Read across to the equivalent taxable
estimated current return you would need to match the tax-free income.

1 The table reflects the effect of the limitations on itemized deductions
and the deduction for personal exemptions. They were designed to phase out
certain benefits of these deductions for higher income taxpayers. These
limitations, in effect, raise the current maximum marginal combined Federal and
state tax rate to approximately 47.02 percent for taxpayers filing a joint
return and entitled to four personal exemptions and to approximately 43.72
percent for taxpayers filing a single return entitled to only one personal
exemption. These limitations are subject to certain maximums, which depend on
the number of exemptions claimed and the total amount of the taxpayer's itemized
deductions. For example, the limitation on itemized deductions will not cause a
taxpayer to lose more than 80% of his allowable itemized deductions, with
certain exceptions.


2 Combined Federal and state tax rate reverts to 38.88% after the 80% cap on
the limitation on itemized deductions has been met.


3 Combined Federal and state tax rate reverts to 42.50% after the 80% cap on

APPENDIX B




COLORADO DISCLOSURE




ECONOMIC FACTORS--COLORADO



RESTRICTIONS ON APPROPRIATIONS AND REVENUES.  The State Constitution
requires that expenditures for any fiscal year not exceed revenues for such
fiscal year. By statute, the amount of General Fund revenues available for
appropriation is based upon revenue estimates which, together with other
available resources, must exceed annual appropriations by the amount of the
unappropriated reserve (the "Unappropriated Reserve"). The Unappropriated
Reserve requirement for fiscal years 1991, 1992 and 1993 was set at 3% of total
appropriations from the General Fund. For fiscal years 1994 and thereafter, the
Unappropriated Reserve requirement is 4% of total appropriations from the
General Fund. In addition to the Unappropriated Reserve, a constitutional
amendment approved by Colorado voters in 1992 requires the State and each local
government to reserve a certain percentage of its fiscal year spending
(excluding bonded debt service) for emergency use (the "Emergency Reserve"). The
minimum Emergency Reserve was set at 1% for 1993 and 2% for 1994 and is set at
3% for 1995 and later years. The balance held in the State Controlled
Maintenance Trust Fund is now used to satisfy the Emergency Reserve requirement.


For fiscal year 1992 and thereafter, General Fund appropriations are also
limited by statute to an amount equal to the cost of performing certain required
reappraisals of taxable property plus an amount equal to the lesser of (i) five
percent of Colorado personal income or (ii) 106% of the total General Fund
appropriations for the previous fiscal year. This restriction does not apply to
any General Fund appropriations which are required as a result of a new federal
law, a final state or federal court order or moneys derived from the increase in
the rate or amount of any tax or fee approved by a majority of the registered
electors of the State voting at any general election. In addition, the statutory
limit on the level of General Fund appropriations may be exceeded for a given
fiscal year upon the declaration of a State fiscal emergency by the State
General Assembly.


According to the Colorado Economic Perspective, State Revenue and Economic
Projections through FY 2003-04, dated June 20, 1999 (the "1999 Economic
Report"), which is published by the Office of State Planning and Budgeting, the
fiscal year 1999 ending General Fund reserve will be $645.8 million, which is
$457.6 million over the Unappropriated Reserve requirement. The 1998 fiscal year
ending General Fund reserve was $901 million, or $724 million over the required
Unappropriated Reserve. Based on the 1999 Economic Report estimates, the fiscal
year 2000 ending General Fund reserve is forecast to be approximately $454.7
million, or $255.1 million over the required Unappropriated Reserve.


On November 3, 1992, voters in Colorado approved a constitutional amendment
(the "Amendment") which, in general, became effective December 31, 1992, and
restricts the ability of the State and local governments to increase revenues
and impose taxes. The Amendment applies to the State and all local governments,
including home rule entities ("Districts"). Enterprises, defined as
government-owned businesses authorized to issue revenue bonds and receiving
under 10% of annual revenue in grants from all Colorado state and local
governments combined, are excluded from the provisions of the Amendment.


The provisions of the Amendment are unclear and have required judicial
interpretation. Among other provisions, beginning November 4, 1992, the
Amendment requires voter approval prior to tax increases, the imposition of a
new tax, creation of debt, or mill levy or valuation for assessment ratio
increases or a change of tax policy resulting in a net revenue gain. The
Amendment also limits increases in government spending and property tax revenues
to specified percentages. The Amendment requires that District property tax
revenues yield no more than the prior year's revenues adjusted for inflation,
voter approved changes and (except with regard to school districts) local growth
in property values according to a formula set forth in the Amendment. School
districts are allowed to adjust tax levies for changes in student enrollment.
Pursuant to the Amendment, local government spending is to be limited by the
same formula as the limitation for property tax revenues. The Amendment limits
increases in expenditures from the State General Fund and program revenues (cash
funds) to the growth in inflation plus the percentage change in State population
in the prior calendar year. The bases for initial spending and revenue limits
were fiscal year 1992 spending and 1991 property taxes collected in 1992. The
base for spending and revenue limits for each subsequent fiscal year is the
prior fiscal year's spending and property taxes collected in the prior calendar
year. Debt service changes, reductions and voter-approved revenue changes are
excluded from the calculation bases. The Amendment also prohibits new or
increased real property transfer taxes, new State real property taxes and local
District income taxes.


Litigation concerning several issues relating to the Amendment has been
brought in the Colorado courts. The litigation deals with three principal
issues: (i) whether Districts can increase mill levies to pay debt service on
general obligation bonds without obtaining voter approval; (ii) whether a
multi-year lease-purchase agreement subject to annual appropriation is an
obligation which requires voter approval prior to execution of the agreement;
and (iii) what constitutes an "enterprise" which is excluded from the provisions
of the Amendment. In September, 1994, the Colorado Supreme Court held that
Districts can increase mill levies to pay debt service on voter approved general
obligation bonds issued after the effective date of the Amendment; in June, 1995
the Colorado Supreme Court validated mill levy increases


B-1





to pay general obligation bonds issued prior to the Amendment provided that such
bonds or bonds issued to refund such bonds were voter approved. In late 1994,
the Colorado Court of Appeals held that multi-year lease-purchase agreements
subject to annual appropriation do not require voter approval. The time to file
an appeal in that case has expired. Recently the Colorado Supreme Court ruled
that notes to be issued by the State the repayment of which was subject to
legislative appropriation must be approved by the voters under the Amendment.
The Court distinguished these notes from lease-purchase agreements. Finally, in
May, 1995, the Colorado Supreme Court ruled that entities with the power to levy
taxes may not themselves be "enterprises" for purposes of the Amendment;
however, the Court did not address the issue of how valid enterprises may be
created. Many Colorado local governments interpret this decision to mean that a
government with taxing power cannot be an enterprise but that a business
activity (such as a utility) owned by such a government can be an enterprise.
Additional litigation in the "enterprise" arena may be filed in the future to
clarify these issues. The Colorado Supreme Court also has decided that voters
can authorize a government to keep and spend all revenues received in excess of
the spending limits. Other aspects of the spending limit are being litigated in
district court actions.


According to the 1999 Economic Report, for fiscal year 1998, general fund
revenues (adjusted for cash funds that are exempt from the Amendment) were
$5,348 million and program revenues (cash funds) were $2,087.2 million, for
revenues totaling $7,435.2 million. During year 1996, population and inflation
grew at rates of 3.5% and 2.0%, respectively, for a combined total limit of
5.5%. Accordingly, under the Amendment, State expenditures during the 1998
fiscal year could not exceed $6,872 million and the actual 1998 fiscal year
general fund and program revenues of $7,435.2 million were over the limit. In
November 1998, Colorado voters defeated a proposition to permit the State to
keep and spend a portion of the surplus, and the excess of $563.2 million is
required to be refunded to Colorado taxpayers. The estimated limitation for
fiscal year 1999 is 5.3% over the revenue limit for the 1999 fiscal year;
accordingly, 1999 fiscal year revenues cannot exceed an estimated $7,236.2
million. Fiscal year 2000 revenues are estimated to be $615.7 million over the
projected limitation which means that there will likely be additional refunds
unless voters allow some or all of those revenues to be retained.


Because of the significant anticipated surpluses, many permanent tax
reductions were passed by the General Assembly in 1999 and signed into law by
the Governor. In total, taxes were reduced by an estimated $237.8 million in
fiscal year 2001, the first full year of the majority of the tax cuts. The
largest tax cut was a reduction in the income tax rate to 4.75%, effective
January 1, 1999, from the previous 5% rate.


There is also a statutory restriction on the amount of annual increases in
taxes that the various taxing jurisdictions in Colorado can levy without
electoral approval. This restriction does not apply to taxes levied to pay
general obligation debt.


STATE FINANCES.  According to State of Colorado Audited Financial Reports,
under generally accepted accounting principles, the State had unrestricted
General Fund ending balances at June 30 of approximately $320.4 million in
fiscal year 1994, $408.0 million for fiscal year 1995, $368.5 million for fiscal
year 1996 and $514.1 million for fiscal year 1997. The ending balances starting
with fiscal year 1997 are required give effect to HB 98-1414, which specifies
that the refunds required by the Amendment are to be booked in the year of the
refund rather than in the year incurred.


For fiscal year 1998, the following tax categories generated the following
percentages of the State's $5,401.2 million total revenues (accrual basis):

individual income taxes represented 56% of gross fiscal year 1998 receipts;
sales, use, and other excise taxes represented 30% of gross fiscal year 1998
receipts; and corporate income taxes represented 4.9% of gross fiscal year 1998
receipts. For fiscal year 1999, General Fund revenues of approximately $5,766.4
million and appropriations of approximately $5,850.3 million are projected. The
percentages of General Fund revenue generated by type of tax for fiscal year
1999 and 2000 are not expected to be significantly different from fiscal year
1998 percentages.


STATE DEBT.  Under its constitution, the State of Colorado is not permitted
to issue general obligation bonds secured by the full faith and credit of the
State. However, certain agencies and instrumentalities of the State are
authorized to issue bonds secured by revenues from specific projects and
activities. The State enters into certain lease transactions which are subject
to annual renewal at the option of the State. In addition, the State is
authorized to issue short-term revenue anticipation notes. Local government
units in the State are also authorized to incur indebtedness. The major source
of financing for such local government indebtedness is an ad valorem property
tax. In addition, in order to finance public projects, local governments in the
State can issue revenue bonds payable from the revenues of a utility or
enterprise or from the proceeds of an excise tax, or assessment bonds payable
from special assessments. Colorado local governments can also finance public
projects through leases which are subject to annual appropriation at the option
of the local government. Local governments in Colorado also issue tax
anticipation notes. The Amendment requires prior voter approval for the creation
of any multiple fiscal year debt or other financial obligation whatsoever,
except for refundings at a lower rate or obligations of an enterprise. The State
has submitted to the voters of the State at the November 2, 1999 election a
question of issuing $1,700,000,000 of revenue anticipation notes, the proceeds
of which would be used for highway purposes.

STATE ECONOMY.  Based on estimates published by the State of Colorado,
Office of State Planning and Budgeting as presented in the 1999 Economic Report,
54% of non-agricultural employment in Colorado in 1998 was concentrated in the
retail and wholesale trade and service sectors, reflecting the importance of
tourism to the State's economy and of Denver as a regional economic and
transportation hub. The government and manufacturing sectors followed as the
next largest employment sectors in the State, representing approximately 15.7%
and 10.1%, respectively, of non-agricultural employment in the State in 1998.
The Office of Planning and Budgeting expects similar concentrations for calendar
years 1999 and 2000.


According to the 1999 Economic Report, the Colorado unemployment rate rose
slightly from 3.3% during 1997 to 3.8% during 1998. Colorado continued to
surpass the non-agricultural employment growth rate of the U.S., with a 3.6%
rate of growth for Colorado in 1998, as compared with 2.5% for the nation as a
whole. Employment growth is expected to remain healthy, although to slow
slightly to 3.1% in the year 2000.


Personal income rose 8.2% in Colorado during 1998, as compared with an
increase of 5.0% for the nation as a whole. Total Colorado retail sales in 1998
increased by 6.4% over calendar year 1997.



COLORADO TAXABLE ESTIMATED CURRENT RETURN TABLE



The following tables show the approximate taxable estimated current returns
for individuals that are equivalent to tax-exempt estimated current returns
under combined Federal and state taxes, using published 1999 marginal Federal
tax rates and marginal state tax rates currently available and scheduled to be
in effect. The table assumes that federal taxable income is equal to state
income subject to tax, and for cases in which more than one state rate falls
within a Federal bracket, the state rate corresponding to the highest income
within that Federal bracket is used. The combined state and Federal tax brackets
shown reflect the fact that state tax payments are currently deductible for
Federal tax purposes. The tables do not reflect any local taxes or any taxes
other than personal income taxes. The tables illustrate what you would have to
earn on taxable investments to equal the tax-exempt estimated current return for
your income tax bracket. A taxpayer's marginal tax rate is affected by both his
taxable income and his adjusted gross income. Locate your adjusted gross and
your taxable income (which is your adjusted gross income reduced by any
deductions and exemptions), then locate your tax bracket based on joint or
single tax filing. Read across to the equivalent taxable estimated current
return you would need to match the tax-free income.

1 The table reflects the effect of the limitations on itemized deductions
and the deduction for personal exemptions. They were designed to phase out
certain benefits of these deductions for higher income taxpayers. These
limitations, in effect, raise the current maximum marginal combined Federal and
state tax rate to approximately 47.23 percent for taxpayers filing a joint
return and entitled to four personal exemptions and to approximately 43.69
percent for taxpayers filing a single return entitled to only one personal
exemption. These limitations are subject to certain maximums, which depend on
the number of exemptions claimed and the total amount of the taxpayer's itemized
deductions. For example, the limitation on itemized deductions will not cause a
taxpayer to lose more than 80% of his allowable itemized deductions, with
certain exceptions.


2 Combined Federal and state tax rate reverts to 39.04% after the 80% cap on
the limitation on itemized deductions has been met.


3 Combined Federal and state tax rate reverts to 42.47% after the 80% cap on

APPENDIX C




FLORIDA DISCLOSURE




POPULATION



In 1980, Florida was the seventh most populous state in the U.S. Florida has
grown dramatically since then and as of April 1, 1998, ranks fourth with an
estimated population of 15 million.


- In 1998, about 232,000 more new residents moved into Florida than moved out.


- The U.S. average population increase since 1990 is about 1.0% annually,
while Florida's average increase is about 1.9% annually.


- Florida continues to be one of the fastest growing of the largest states.


Florida's strong population growth is one reason Florida's economy is
performing better than the U.S. as a whole. In addition to attracting senior
citizens to Florida as a place for retirement, Florida is also recognized as
attracting a significant number of individuals of working age (18-64).


- In recent years, Florida's prime working age population (18-44) has grown at
an average annual rate of more than 2.0%.


- More than 60% of Florida's total population is at the working age (18-64).
This share is not expected to change appreciably into the twenty-first
century.



INCOME



According to the U.S. Department of Commerce and the Florida Consensus
Economic Estimating Conference, personal income in Florida has been growing
strongly the last several years and has generally performed better than the U.S.
as a whole and the southeast U.S. in particular. This is due to the fact that
Florida's population has been growing at a very strong pace and, since the early
70's, its economy has diversified providing a broader economic base.


- Florida's real income per person has tracked closely with the U.S. average
and has tracked above the southeast.


Florida has a proportionately greater retirement age population than other
states. As a result, property, income (dividends, interest, and rent), and
transfer payments (Social Security and pension benefits, among other sources of
income) are relatively more important sources of income to persons residing in
Florida. Transfer payments (Social Security and pension benefits, among other
sources of income) are typically less sensitive to the ups and downs of the
economy than wages and salaries and other employment income. Transfer payments
(Social Security and pension benefits, and other sources of income), therefore,
act as a stabilizing force in weak economic periods.


The personal income of residents of the various states in the U.S. is
frequently used to make comparisons among the various states. However, using
personal income to compare Florida to other states can be misleading. Florida's
personal income is systematically underestimated. Contributions by employers to
employees' pension, profit sharing, and other retirement plans are included in
personal income of that employee while the employee is working and earning wages
and salary. When those same employees retire, to avoid double accounting,
retirement payments to them from those retirement plans are excluded in
computing personal income. Florida retirees are more likely to be collecting
retirement benefits that they earned in a state other than Florida. As a result,
Florida personal income is underestimated.


- Florida's personal income per person in 1998 was $25,852.


- The U.S. average personal income per person was slightly higher at $26,412.


- Personal income per person in the southeast United States was significantly
lower at $23,725.


- Total Florida real personal income is forecasted to increase 4.9% in the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1999, and 3.5% in the fiscal year ending June 30,
2000.


- Florida real personal income per person is projected to increase 3.1% in the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1999, and 1.8% in the fiscal year ending June 30,
2000.


- The Florida economy appears to be growing in line with, but stronger than,
the U.S. economy; however, the Florida economy is expected to grow more slowly
in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2000, than in the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1999.



EMPLOYMENT



- Since 1992, Florida's population has increased an estimated 11.7%, while the
number of employed persons in Florida increased 15.0%.


C-1





- In that same period, Florida's total non-farm employment has grown
approximately 24.6%, while U.S. non-farm jobs increased 15.9%.


- Florida is gradually becoming less dependent on employment related to
construction, agriculture, or manufacturing, and more dependent on employment
related to trade and services. This has also contributed to Florida's strong
economic performance.


Presently, services constitute 36% and trade 25.5% of Florida's total
non-farm jobs. The U.S., however, has a greater percentage of manufacturing jobs
than Florida. Manufacturing jobs tend to pay higher wages, but service jobs can
also pay well and tend to be less sensitive to swings in the business cycle.
Florida has a concentration of manufacturing jobs in high-tech and high
value-added sectors, such as electrical and electronic equipment, as well as
printing and publishing. These types of manufacturing jobs tend to be less
cyclical.


- Florida's unemployment rate throughout the 1980's was consistently lower
than that for the U.S.


- In the early 1990's, Florida's unemployment rate was higher than that of the
U.S.


- In current years, Florida's unemployment rate has again generally fallen
below that of the U.S.


- Florida's unemployment rate was 4.3% during 1998.


- The U.S. unemployment rate was 4.5% during 1998.


- It is estimated that Florida's unemployment rate will be 4.2% in the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1999, and 4.4% in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2000.


Florida's economy is expected to grow at a moderate rate along with the
U.S., but is expected to outperform the U.S. as a whole.


- Total non-farm employment in Florida is expected to increase 3.4% for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1999, and 2.9% for the fiscal year ending June 30,
2000. Trade and services, the two largest employment sectors, account for
more than half of the total non-farm employment in Florida.


- Employment in the service sectors should experience an increase of 5.5% for
the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999, while growing 4.4% for the fiscal year
ending June 30, 2000. Trade is expected to expand 2.8% for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1999, and 2.8% for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2000.


- The service sector is now Florida's largest employment category.



CONSTRUCTION



In the past, Florida's economy has been highly dependent on the construction
industry and construction related manufacturing. This dependency has declined in
recent years and continues to decline as a result of continued diversification
of Florida's economy. For example, in 1973, total contract construction
employment as a share of total non-farm employment was about 10%, in the late
1980's, the share had edged downward to 7.5%, and in 1998, the share was only
5.3%. This trend is expected to continue as Florida's economy continues to
diversify. Florida, nevertheless, has a dynamic construction industry, with the
percentage of housing starts increasing in 1998 by 11.1%, and construction jobs
overall increasing by 5.1%, due to low interest rates and favorable economic
conditions.


A driving force behind Florida's construction industry has been Florida's
rapid rate of population growth. Although Florida currently is the fourth most
populous state, its annual population growth is now projected to slow somewhat
as the number of people moving into Florida is expected to remain over 200,000 a
year during the next decade. This population trend should provide fuel for
business and home builders to keep construction activity lively in Florida in
the next few years. Moreover, recent federal tax reforms reducing capital gains
realized on the sale of homes may increase the purchases of second,
preretirement homes in Florida.


- Single and multi-family housing starts in Florida for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1999, are projected to reach a combined level of 144,000, decreasing
slightly to 143,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2000.


- Total construction expenditures in Florida are forecasted to increase 8.6%
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999, and increase 2.5% for the fiscal year
ending June 30, 2000.


- Single and multi-family housing starts in Florida are projected to account
for about 9% of all the housing starts in the U.S. for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1999 and 9.53% of all housing starts in the U.S. for the fiscal
year ending June 30, 2000.



TOURISM



Tourism is one of Florida's most important industries. Approximately 48.7
million tourists visited Florida in 1998, a 3.7% increase over 1997. Tourists in
Florida are, in essence, additional residents for purposes of determining
Florida tax


C-2





revenues. Florida's tourist industry over the years has become more
sophisticated, attracting visitors year-round and, to a degree, reducing its
seasonality. Visitors to Florida tend to arrive slightly more by air than by
auto.


- Tourist arrivals to Florida are forecasted to increase by 2.0% for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1999, and 1.7% for the fiscal year ending June 30,
2000.


- Tourist arrivals to Florida by air are expected to increase by 3.2% for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1999, and increase by 3.9% for the fiscal year
ending June 30, 2000.


- Tourist arrivals by car are expected to increase by 0.6% for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1999, and decrease 1.0% for the fiscal year ending June 30,
2000.


By June 30, 1999, 49.7 million domestic and international tourists are
expected to have visited Florida. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2000,
about 50.6 million tourists are expected to visit Florida.



REVENUES AND EXPENSES



Estimated General Revenue plus Working Capital and Budget Stabilization
funds available to Florida for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999, total
$19,481.8 million, a 5.2% increase over the fiscal year ended June 30, 1998. Of
the total General Revenue plus Working Capital and Budget Stabilization funds
available to Florida, $17,779.5 million of that is Estimated Revenues and
represents an increase of 5.0% over the previous year's Estimated Revenues. With
effective General Revenues plus Working Capital Fund and Budget Stabilization
appropriations at $18,222.0 million, including a $100.9 million transferred to
the Budget Stabilization Fund, unencumbered reserves at the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1999, are estimated at $1,360.7 million. Estimated General Revenue plus
Working Capital and Budget Stabilization funds available to Florida for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 2000, total $20,133.9 million, a 3.3% increase over
the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999. The $18,555.2 million in Estimated Revenues
represents an increase of 4.4% over the previous year's Estimated Revenues.



GENERAL REVENUES AND EXPENSES



For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1997, approximately 67% of Florida's
total direct revenue to its four operating funds was derived from Florida taxes
and fees, with Federal grants and other special revenue accounting for the
balance. The large majority of Florida General Revenue Funds available to
Florida for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1997, were made up of the following
taxes:


- Sales and use tax -- 68%


- Corporate income tax -- 8%


- Intangible personal property tax -- 4%


- Beverage tax -- 3%


- Estate tax -- 3%


During the same fiscal year ended June 30, 1997, the large majority of
expenditures from Florida's General Revenue Fund were as follows:


- Education -- 53%


- Health and welfare -- 26%


- Public safety -- 14%



FLORIDA SALES AND USE TAX



Florida's sales and use tax (6%) currently accounts for Florida's single
largest source of tax receipts. Slightly less than 10% of Florida's sales and
use tax is designated for local governments and is distributed to the respective
counties in which the tax is collected for use by the counties, and the
municipalities in such counties. In addition to this money from the State of
Florida, local governments may (by a vote of the residents) assess a 0.5% or a
1.0% discretionary sales surtax within their county. Proceeds from this local
option sales tax are used for funding local infrastructure programs and
acquiring land for public recreation or conservation or protection of natural
resources as provided under applicable Florida law. Certain charter counties
have other taxing powers in addition, and non-consolidated counties with a
population in excess of 800,000 may levy a local option sales tax to fund
indigent health care. The indigent health care tax alone cannot exceed 0.5% and
when combined with the infrastructure surtax cannot exceed 1.0%.


- For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1997, Florida sales and use tax receipts
(exclusive of the tax on gasoline and special fuels) totaled $12,089 million,
an increase of 5.5% over the fiscal year ended June 30, 1996, collections.


C-3






ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE TAX



Florida imposes an alcoholic beverage wholesale tax (excise tax) on beer,
wine, and liquor. This tax is one of Florida's major tax sources. Ninety-eight
percent of the revenues collected from this tax are deposited into Florida's
General Revenue Fund.


- Alcoholic beverage tax totaled $447.2 million for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1997.



CORPORATE INCOME TAX



Florida imposes an income tax on corporations. All receipts of the corporate
income tax are credited to the General Revenue Fund.


- For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1997, corporate income tax totaled
$1,362.3 million, an increase of 17.2% from the fiscal year ended June 30,
1996.



DOCUMENTARY STAMP TAX



Florida imposes a documentary stamp tax on deeds and other documents
relating to realty, corporate shares, bonds, certificates of indebtedness,
promissory notes, wage assignments, and retail charge accounts. For the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1997, 62.63% of these taxes were deposited to the General
Revenue Fund.


- Documentary stamp tax collections totaled $844.2 million for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1997, an 8.9% increase from the fiscal year ended June 30,
1996.



INTANGIBLE PERSONAL PROPERTY TAX



Florida imposes an annual intangible personal property tax on stocks, bonds,
including bonds secured by liens on Florida real property, notes, governmental
leaseholds, and certain other intangibles not secured by a lien on Florida real
property. The annual rate of tax is currently 2 mills (a mill is $1.00 of tax
per $1,000.00 of property value). Effective January 1, 2000, the rate for the
annual intangibles tax will decrease to 1.5 mills. Florida also imposes a
non-recurring 2 mill tax on mortgages and other obligations secured by liens on
Florida real property. Of the net taxes imposed on intangible personal property,
66.5% are distributed to the General Revenue Fund.


- For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1997, total intangible personal property
tax collections were $952.4 million, a 6.3% increase from the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1996.



ESTATE TAX



Florida imposes an estate tax on the estate of a decedent for the privilege
of transferring property at death. All receipts of the estate tax are credited
to the General Revenue Fund.


- For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1997, receipts from this source were
$546.9 million, an increase of 30% over the fiscal year ended June 30, 1996.



LOTTERY



Florida began its own lottery in 1988. Florida law requires that lottery
revenues be distributed 50% to the public in prizes, at least 38.0% for use in
enhancing education, and no more than 12.0% for costs of administering the
lottery.


- Lottery ticket sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1997, totaled
$2.09 billion, providing education with approximately $792.3 million.



DEBT-BALANCED BUDGET REQUIREMENT



At the end of the fiscal year ended June 30, 1998, Florida had outstanding
about $8,703 million in principal amount of debt secured by its full faith and
credit. Since then, the State has issued about $629 million in principal amount
of full faith and credit bonds.


Florida's Constitution and statutes require that Florida not run a deficit
in its budget, as a whole, or in any separate fund within its budget. Rather its
budget and funds must be kept in balance from currently available revenues each
fiscal year. If the Governor or Comptroller believes a deficit will occur in any
fund, by statute, he must certify his opinion to the Administrative Commission,
which then is authorized to reduce all Florida agency budgets and releases by a
sufficient amount to prevent a deficit in any fund. Additionally, the Florida
Constitution prohibits Florida from borrowing by issuing bonds to fund its
operations.



LITIGATION



Currently under litigation are several issues relating to Florida actions or
Florida taxes that put at risk a portion of General Revenue Fund monies. There
is no assurance that any of such matters, individually or in the aggregate, will
not have a material adverse affect on Florida's financial position. A brief
summary of these matters follows.


C-4






NATHAN M. HAMEROFF, M.D., ET AL. V. AGENCY FOR HEALTHCARE ADMINISTRATION, ET


AL.


The plaintiff challenged the constitutionality of Florida's Public
Medical Assistance Trust Fund annual assessment on net operating revenue of
free standing out-patient facilities offering sophisticated radiology
services. The trial has not been scheduled. If Florida is unsuccessful in
its action, the potential cost to Florida could be $70 million.



BARNETT BANK V. FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE



This case involves the issue of whether under Florida's refund statute
for dealer repossessions, the Florida Department of Revenue ("DOR") is
authorized to grant a refund to a financial institution, which is the
assignee of security agreements governing the sale of automobiles and other
property sold through dealers. The 4th Judicial Circuit found that the
statute not only provides a refund or credit to the dealer who sold the
tangible personal property and collected and remitted the tax, but that the
statute also allows the right to the refund to be assigned. Several banks
have already applied for refunds based on this holding and the potential
amount in refunds to financial institutions could exceed $30 million
annually. DOR plans to appeal this decision.



TOWER ENVIRONMENTAL V. FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION



The plaintiff has alleged that the State of Florida and the Department
of Environmental Protection ("DEP") breached contracts with it by freezing
the processing of reimbursement applications and by terminating the
petroleum reimbursement process. The plaintiff argues alternatively that
these actions are torts or impairment of contractual obligations. The
plaintiff further alleges that the termination of reimbursement claims
constitute a breach of contract. The plaintiff seeks damages, attorneys fees
and costs, the total of which could reach $60 million.



BARNETT BANKS, INC. V. FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE



The taxpayer in this case challenged the imposition of interest on
additional amounts of corporate income tax due as a result of adjustments
under a Federal income tax audit that were reported to Florida. DOR's
historical position is that interest is due from the due date of the return
until payment of the additional amount of tax is made. The taxpayer contends
that interest should begin to accrue only from the date the Federal audit
adjustments were due to be reported to Florida. A Final Order was issued
adopting DOR's position, but the taxpayer has appealed. The potential lost
revenue and refund exposure is in the range of $12 to $20 million annually.



DEFICIT FUND EQUITY



The Florida Casualty Insurance Risk Management Trust Fund has deficit
retained earnings of approximately $567 million. These represent long term
liabilities of Florida as a whole. These liabilities include claims pertaining
to state employee Workers' Compensation, federal civil rights, and general and
automotive liability.


The Special Disability Trust Fund has a deficit fund balance of
approximately $1.9 billion. This deficit is the result of claims expense over
net assessment revenue.



YEAR 2000 READINESS



Some of the computer technology used by the State of Florida may not have
been designed to recognize the year 2000, which means that instead of treating
the double zeros at the end of 2000 as indicating the year 2000, the technology
treats the double zeros as indicating the year 1900. Despite considerable
efforts made by the State to bring all of its computer hardware, software, and
embedded technology into compliance so as to recognize the year 2000, there can
be no guarantee that year 2000 compliance will be achieved in a timely manner
and no assurance made that entities that deal with Florida will have achieved
year 2000 compliance.


Florida maintains a bond rating of Aa2, AA+, and AA from Moody's Investor's
Service, Standard & Poor's Corporation, and Fitch, respectively, on the majority
of its general obligation bonds, although the rating of a particular series of
revenue bonds relates primarily to the project, facility, or other revenue
source from which such series derives funds for repayment. While these ratings
and some of the information presented above indicate that Florida is in
satisfactory economic health, there can be no assurance that there will not be a
decline in economic conditions or that particular Florida Municipal Obligations
purchased by the Fund will not be adversely affected by any such changes.


The sources for the information presented above include official statements
and financial statements of the State of Florida. While John Nuveen & Co.,
Incorporated has not independently verified this information, John
Nuveen & Co., Incorporated has no reason to believe that the information is not
correct in all material respects.



FLORIDA TAXABLE ESTIMATED CURRENT RETURN TABLE



The following tables show the approximate taxable estimated current returns
for individuals that are equivalent to tax-exempt estimated current returns
under published 1999 marginal Federal tax rates*. The tables illustrate what you
would have to earn on taxable investments to equal the tax-exempt estimated
current return for your income tax bracket. A taxpayer's marginal tax rate is
affected by both his taxable income and his adjusted gross income. Locate your
adjusted


C-5





gross and your taxable income (which is your adjusted gross income reduced by
any deductions and exemptions), then locate your tax bracket based on joint or
single tax filing. Read across to the equivalent taxable estimated current
return you would need to match the tax-free income.


* The State of Florida does not impose an income tax on individuals.
However, Florida does impose an intangible personal property tax, which is not
included in these tables because it is generally based on property value rather
than income.

1 The table reflects the effect of the limitations on itemized deductions
and the deduction for personal exemptions. They were designed to phase out
certain benefits of these deductions for higher income taxpayers. These
limitations, in effect, raise the current maximum marginal Federal tax rate to
approximately 44.27 percent for taxpayers filing a joint return and entitled to
four personal exemptions and to approximately 40.79 percent for taxpayers filing
a single return entitled to only one personal exemption. These limitations are
subject to certain maximums, which depend on the number of exemptions claimed
and the total amount of the taxpayer's itemized deductions. For example, the
limitation on itemized deductions will not cause a taxpayer to lose more than
80% of his allowable itemized deductions, with certain exceptions.


2 Federal tax rate reverts to 36.00% after the 80% cap on the limitation on
itemized deductions has been met.


3 Federal tax rate reverts to 39.60% after the 80% cap on the limitation on
itemized deductions has been met.

NUVEEN TAX-FREE UNIT TRUST, SERIES 1124

TRUST INDENTURE AND AGREEMENT

DATED OCTOBER 25, 1999



This Trust Indenture and Agreement by and between John Nuveen & Co.
Incorporated, as Depositor and The Chase Manhattan Bank, as Trustee, sets forth
certain provisions in full and incorporates other provisions by reference to the
document entitled "Standard Terms and Conditions of Trust for Nuveen Tax-Free
Unit Trust, Series 823 and subsequent Series, effective September 7, 1995"
(herein called the "Standard Terms and Conditions of Trust"), and such
provisions as are set forth in full and such provisions as are incorporated by
reference constitute a single instrument. All references herein to Articles and
Sections are to Articles and Sections of the Standard Terms and Conditions of
Trust.



WITNESSETH THAT:



In consideration of the promises and of the mutual agreements herein
contained, the Depositor and the Trustee, agree as follows:



PART I

STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF TRUST



Subject to the Provisions of Part II hereof, all the provisions contained in
the Standard Terms and Conditions of Trust are herein incorporated by reference
in their entirety and shall be deemed to be a part of this instrument as fully
and to the same extent as though said provisions had been set forth in full in
this instrument.



PART II

SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF TRUST



The following special terms and conditions are hereby agreed to:


(a)  The Bonds defined in Section 1.01(1) listed in Schedule A hereto have
been deposited in trust under this Trust Indenture and Agreement.


(b)  The fractional undivided interest in and ownership of the Trust Fund
represented by each Unit for a Trust on the Initial Date of Deposit is the
amount set forth under the captions "Essential Information -- Fractional
Undivided Interest in the Trust per Unit" in the Prospectus.


(c)  The number of Units created of a Trust are as set forth under the
caption "Essential Information -- Number of Units" in the Prospectus for each
Trust.


(d)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Standard Terms and
Conditions of Trust, the phrase "Nuveen Tax-Exempt Unit Trust" shall be hereby
replaced with the phrase "Nuveen Tax-Free Unit Trust."


(e)  All references to "The Chase Manhattan Bank (National Association)" in
the Standard Terms and Conditions of Trust shall be replaced with "The Chase
Manhattan Bank."


(f)  Section 3.01 shall be amended to read in its entirety as follows:


SECTION 3.01 INITIAL COST. Subject to reimbursement as hereinafter provided,
the cost of organizing the Trust and the sale of the Trust Units shall be borne
by the Depositor, provided, however, that the liability on the part of the
Depositor under this section shall not include any fees or other expenses
incurred in connection with the administration of the Trust subsequent to the
deposit referred to in Section 2.01. At the earlier of six months after the
Initial Date of Deposit or the conclusion of the primary offering period (as
certified by the Depositor to the Trustee), the Trustee shall withdraw from the
Account or Accounts specified in the Prospectus or, if no Account is therein
specified, from the Principal Account, and pay to the Depositor the Depositor's
reimbursable expenses of organizing the Trust in an amount certified to the
Trustee by the Depositor. In no event shall the amount paid by the Trustee to
the Depositor for the Depositor's reimbursable expenses of organizing the Trust
exceed the estimated per Unit amount of organization costs set forth in the
Prospectus for the Trust multiplied by the number of Units of the Trust
outstanding at the earlier of six months after the Initial Date of Deposit or
the end of the initial offering period; nor shall the Depositor be entitled to
or request reimbursement for expenses of organizing the Trust incurred after the
earlier of six months after the Initial Date of Deposit or the end of the
initial offering period. If the cash balance of the Principal Account is
insufficient to make such withdrawal, the Trustee shall, as directed by the
Depositor, sell Bonds identified by the Depositor, or distribute to the
Depositor securities having a value, as determined under Section 4.01 as of the
date of distribution, sufficient for such reimbursement. The reimbursement
provided for in this section shall be for the account of the Unitholders of
record at the earlier of six months after the Initial Date of Deposit or the
conclusion of the primary offering period. Any assets deposited with the Trustee
in respect of the expenses reimbursable under this Section 3.01





shall be held and administered as assets of the Trust for all purposes
hereunder. The Depositor shall deliver to the Trustee any cash identified in the
Statement of Condition of the Trust included in the Prospectus not later than
the 10 calendar days following the Initial Date of Deposit or deposit of
additional Bonds, as applicable and the Depositor's obligation to make such
delivery shall be secured by the letter of credit deposited pursuant to

Section 2.01. Any cash which the Depositor has identified as to be used for
reimbursement of expenses pursuant to this Section 3.01 shall be held by the
Trustee, without interest, and reserved for such purpose and, accordingly, prior
to the earlier of six months after the Initial Date of Deposit or the conclusion
of the primary offering period, shall not be subject to distribution or, unless
the Depositor otherwise directs, used for payment of redemptions in excess of
the per Unit amount payable pursuant to the next sentence. If a Unitholder
redeems Units prior to the earlier of six months after the Initial Date of
Deposit or the conclusion of the primary offering period, the Trustee shall pay
to the Unitholder, in addition to the Redemption Value of the tendered Units,
unless otherwise directed by the Depositor, an amount equal to the estimated per
Unit cost of organizing the Trust set forth in the Prospectus, or such lower
revision thereof most recently communicated to the Trustee by the Depositor
pursuant to Section 4.01, multiplied by the number of Units tendered for
redemption; to the extent the cash on hand in the Trust is insufficient for such
payment, the Trustee shall have the power to sell Bonds in accordance with

Section 3.07. As used herein, the Depositor's reimbursable expenses of
organizing the Trust shall include the cost of the initial preparation and
typesetting of the registration statement, prospectuses (including preliminary
prospectuses), the indenture, and other documents relating to the Trust, SEC and
state blue sky registration fees, the cost of the initial valuation of the
portfolio and audit of the Trust, the initial fees and expenses of the Trustee,
and legal and other out-of-pocket expenses related thereto, but not including
the expenses incurred in the printing of preliminary prospectuses and
prospectuses, expenses incurred in the preparation and printing of brochures and
other advertising materials and any other selling expenses.


(g)  The following two paragraphs shall be substituted for the first
paragraph of Section 4.01:


SECTION 4.01. EVALUATION: The Trustee shall make an evaluation of each Trust
as of that time set forth in the Prospectus (the "Evaluation Time"), (i) on the
last business day of each of the months of June and December, (ii) on the day on
which any Unit of a respective Trust is tendered for redemption, and (iii) on
any other day desired by the Trustee or requested by the Depositor. Such
evaluations shall take into account and itemize separately, (1) the cash on hand
in the respective Trust (other than cash declared held in trust to cover
contracts to purchase bonds) or moneys in the process of being collected from
matured interest coupons or bonds matured or called for redemption prior to
maturity, (2) the value of each issue of the Bonds in the Trust, and

(3) interest accrued thereon not subject to collection and distribution. In
making the evaluations the Trustee may determine the value of each issue of the
Bonds in the Trust by the following methods or any combination thereof which it
deems appropriate: (i) on the basis of current bid prices of such Bonds as
obtained from investment dealers or brokers (including the Depositor) who
customarily deal in bonds comparable to those held by the Trust, or (ii) if bid
prices are not available for any of such Bonds, on the basis of bid prices for
comparable bonds, or (iii) by causing the value of the Bonds in the Trust to be
determined by others engaged in the practice of evaluating, quoting or
appraising bonds. For each such evaluation there shall be deducted from the sum
of the above (i) amounts representing any applicable taxes or governmental
charges payable out of the Trust and for which no deductions shall have
previously been made for the purpose of addition to the Reserve Account of such
Trust, (ii) amounts representing accrued expenses of the Trust including but not
limited to unpaid fees and expenses of the Trustee, the Depositor and counsel,
in each case as reported by the Trustee to the Depositor on or prior to the date
of evaluation, (iii) amounts representing unpaid organization costs, and

(iv) cash held for distribution to Unitholders of such Trust of record, and
required for redemption of Units tendered, as of a date prior to the evaluation
then being made. The value of the pro rata share of each Unit of such Trust
determined on the basis of any such evaluation shall be referred to herein as
the "Unit Value."


Prior to the payment to the Depositor of its reimbursable organization costs
to be made at the earlier of six months after the Initial Date of Deposit or the
conclusion of the primary offering period in accordance with Section 3.01 for
purposes of determining the Trust Evaluation and Unit Value under this

Section 4.01, the Trustee shall rely upon the amounts representing unpaid
organization costs in the estimated amount per Unit set forth in the Prospectus
until such time as the Depositor notifies the Trustee in writing of a revised
estimated amount per Unit representing unpaid organization costs. Upon receipt
of such notice, the Trustee shall use this revised estimated amount per Unit
representing unpaid organization costs in determining the Trust Evaluation and
Unit Value but such revision of the estimated expenses shall not effect
calculations made prior thereto and no adjustment shall be made in respect
thereof.


(h)  The following paragraph shall be added to Section 4.05:


The Depositor may employ agents in connection with its duties referenced in

Section 4.05 and shall not be answerable for the default or misconduct of such
agents if they shall have been selected with reasonable care. The fees of such
agents shall be reimbursable to the Depositor from the Trust Fund, provided,
however, that the





amount of such reimbursement in any year (i) shall reduce the amount payable to
the Depositor for such year with respect to the service in question and shall
not exceed the maximum amount payable to the Depositor for such service for such
year and (ii) if such agent is an affiliate of the Depositor, the amount of the
reimbursement, when combined with (a) all compensation received by such agent
from other series of the Fund or other unit investment trusts sponsored by the
Depositor or its affiliates and (b) the amount payable to the Depositor from the
Trust Fund and from other series of the Fund or other unit investment trusts
sponsored by the Depositor or its affiliates in respect of the service in
question, shall not exceed the aggregate cost of such agent and the Depositor of
providing such service. The Trustee shall pay such reimbursement against the
Depositor's invoice therefor upon which the Trustee may rely as the Depositor's
certification that the amount claimed complies with the provisions of this
paragraph.

RE:  NUVEEN TAX-FREE UNIT TRUST, SERIES 1124



Gentlemen:


We have served as counsel for you, as depositor of Nuveen Tax-Free Unit
Trust, Series 1124 (hereinafter referred to as the "Fund"), in connection with
the issuance under the Trust Indenture and Agreement dated the date hereof
between John Nuveen & Co. Incorporated, as Depositor, and The Chase Manhattan
Bank, as Trustee, of Units of fractional undivided interest in the one or more
Trusts of said Fund (hereinafter referred to as the "Units").


In connection therewith, we have examined such pertinent records and
documents and matters of law as we have deemed necessary in order to enable us
to express the opinions hereinafter set forth.


Based upon the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:

authorized; and


2.  The book entry positions and certificates evidencing the Units in the
Trusts of the Fund when duly established or duly executed and delivered by the
Depositor and the Trustee in accordance with the aforementioned Trust Indenture
and Agreement, will constitute valid and binding obligations of such Trusts and
the Depositor in accordance with the terms thereof.


We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the
Registration Statement (File No. 333-88977) relating to the Units referred to
above and to the use of our name and to the reference to our firm in said

John Nuveen & Co. Incorporated

Chicago, Illinois 60606


RE:  Nuveen Tax-Free Unit Trust, Series 1124


Gentlemen:


We have served as counsel for you, as Depositor of Nuveen Tax-Free Unit
Trust, Series 1124 (the "Fund") in connection with the issuance under the Trust
Indenture and Agreement, dated the date hereof between John Nuveen & Co.
Incorporated, as Depositor, and The Chase Manhattan Bank, as Trustee, of Units
of fractional undivided interest (the "Units"), as evidenced by a book entry
position or certificate, if requested by the purchaser of Units, in the one or
more Trusts of said Fund.


We have also served as counsel for you in connection with all previous
Series of the Nuveen Tax-Free Unit Trust and as such have previously examined
such pertinent records and documents and matters of law as we have deemed
necessary, including (but not limited to) the Trust Indenture and Agreements
with respect to those series. We have also examined such pertinent records and
documents and matters of law as we have deemed necessary including (but not
limited to) the Trust Indenture and Agreement relating to Nuveen Tax-Free Unit
Trust, Series 1124.


We have concluded that the Trust Indenture and Agreement for the Fund and
its counterpart in each of the prior issues of Nuveen Tax-Free Unit Trust are in
all material respects substantially identical. For purposes of the following
opinions, it is assumed that each asset of the Trust is debt, the interest on
which is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes.


Based upon the foregoing, and upon such matters of law as we consider to be
applicable, we are of the opinion that, under existing federal income law:


(i)  Each of the Trusts will not be an association taxable as a corporation
but will be governed by the provisions of Subchapter J (relating to Trusts) of
Chapter 1, Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code").


(ii)  Each Unitholder will be considered as owning a pro rata share of each
asset of the respective Trust of the Fund in the proportion that the number of
Units of such Trust held by him bears to the total number of outstanding Units
of such Trust. Under Subpart E, Subchapter J of Chapter 1 of the Code, income of
each Trust will be treated as income of each Unitholder of the Trust in the
proportion described, and an item of Trust income will have the same character
in the hands of a Unitholder as it would have in the hands of the Trustee.
Accordingly, to the extent that the income of a Trust consists of interest and
original issue discount excludable from gross income under Section 103 of the
Code, such income will be excludable from Federal gross income of the
Unitholders, except in the case of a Unitholder who is a substantial user (or a
person related to such user) of a facility financed through issuance of any
industrial development bonds or certain private activity bonds held by the
Trust. In the case of such Unitholder who is a substantial user, interest
received with respect to his Units attributable to such industrial development
bonds or such private activity bonds is includable in his gross income.
Moreover, in the case of certain corporations, interest on all of the Bonds is
included in computing the alternative minimum tax pursuant to Sections 56(c) of
the Code and the branch profits tax imposed by Section 884 of the Code with
respect to U.S. branches of foreign corporations.


(iii)  Gain or loss will be recognized to a Unitholder upon redemption or
sale of his Units. Such gain or loss is measured by comparing the proceeds of
such redemption or sale with the adjusted basis of the Units. If a Bond is
acquired with accrued interest, that portion of the price paid for the accrued
interest is added to the tax basis of the Bond. When this accrued interest is
received, it is treated as a return of capital and reduces the tax basis of the
Bond. If a Bond is purchased for a premium, the amount of the premium is added
to the tax basis of the Bond. Bond premium is amortized over the remaining term
of the Bond, and the tax basis of the Bond is reduced each tax year by the
amount of the premium amortized in that tax year. Accordingly, Unitholders must
reduce the tax basis of their Units for their share of accrued interest received
by the Trust, if any, on Bonds delivered after the Unitholders pay for their
Units to the extent that such interest accrued on such Bonds before the date the
Trust acquired ownership of the Bonds (and the amount of this reduction may
exceed the amount of accrued interest paid to the seller) and, consequently,
such Unitholders may have an increase in taxable gain or reduction in capital
loss upon the disposition of such Units. Such gain or loss is measured by
comparing the proceeds of such redemption or sale with the adjusted basis of
such Units. In addition, such basis will be increased by both the Unitholder's
aliquot share of the accrued original issue discount (and market discount, if
the Unitholder elects to include market discount in income as it accrues) with
respect to each Bond held by the





Trust with respect to which there was original issue discount at the time the
Bond was issued (or which was purchased with market discount) and reduced by the
annual amortization of bond premium, if any, on Bonds held by the Trust.


(iv)  If the Trustee disposes of a Trust asset (whether by sale, payment on
maturity, redemption or otherwise) gain or loss is recognized to the Unitholder
and the amount thereof is measured by comparing the Unitholder's aliquot share
of the total proceeds from the transaction with his basis for his fractional
interest in the asset disposed of. Such basis is ascertained by apportioning the
tax basis for his Units among each of the Trust assets (as of the date on which
his Units were acquired) ratably according to their values as of the valuation
date nearest the date on which he purchased such Units. A Unitholder's basis in
his Units and of his fractional interest in each Trust asset must be reduced by
the amount of his aliquot share of accrued interest received by the Trust, if
any, on Bonds delivered after the Unitholders pay for their Units to the extent
that such interest accrued on the Bonds before the Trust acquired ownership of
the Bonds (and the amount of this reduction may exceed the amount of accrued
interest paid to the seller) must be reduced by the annual amortization of bond
premium, if any, on Bonds held by the Trust; and must be increased by the
Unitholder's share of accrued original issue discount (and market discount, if
the Unitholder elects to include market discount in income as it accrues) with
respect to each Bond which, at the time the Bond was issued, had original issue
discount (or which was purchased with market discount).


(v)  In the case of any Bond held by the Trust where the "stated redemption
price at maturity" exceeds the "issue price," such excess shall be original
issue discount. With respect to each Unitholder, upon the purchase of his Units
subsequent to the original issuance of Bonds held by the Trust Section
1272(a)(7) of the Code provides for a reduction in the accrued "daily portion"
of such original issue discount upon the purchase of a Bond subsequent to the
Bond's original issue, under certain circumstances. In the case of any Bond held
by the Trust the interest on which is excludable from gross income under Section
103 of the Code, any original issue discount which accrues with respect thereto
will be treated as interest which is excludable from gross income under Section
103 of the Code.


(vi)  In the case of Trusts for which MBIA Insurance Corporation ("MBIA")
insurance with respect to each of the Bonds deposited therein has been obtained
by the Depositor or the issuer or underwriter of the Bonds, we have examined the
form of MBIA's policy or several policies of insurance (the "Policies") which
have been delivered to the Trustee. Assuming issuance of Policies in such form,
in our opinion, any amounts paid under said Policies representing maturing
interest on defaulted Bonds held by the Trustee will be excludable from Federal
gross income if, and to the same extent as, such interest would have been so
excludable if paid in normal course of business by the respective issuer of the
defaulted Bonds, provided that, at the time such policies are purchased, the
amounts paid for such policies are reasonable, customary and consistent with the
reasonable expectation that the issuer of the Bonds, rather than the insurer,
will pay debt service on the Bonds. Paragraph (ii) of this opinion is
accordingly applicable to Policy proceeds representing maturing interest.


(vii)  Certain bonds in the portfolio of the Trust have been insured by the
issuers, underwriters, the Sponsor or others against default in the prompt
payment of principal and interest (the "Insured Bonds"). Such Insured Bonds are
so designated on the portfolio pages in the Prospectus for each Trust. Insurance
on Insured Bonds is effective so long as such Bonds remain outstanding. For each
of these Insured Bonds, we have been advised that the aggregate principal amount
of such Bonds listed on the portfolio page was acquired by the Trust and are
part of the series of such Insured Bonds in the listed aggregate principal
amount. Based upon the assumption that the Insured Bonds of the Trust are part
of a series covered by an insurance policy, it is our opinion that any amounts
received by the Trust representing maturing interest on such Insured Bonds will
be excludable from Federal gross income if, and to the same extent as, such
interest would have been so excludable if paid in normal course by the Issuer
provided that, at the time such policies are purchased, the amounts paid for
such policies are reasonable, customary and consistent with the reasonable
expectation that the issuer of the Insured Bonds, rather than the insurer will
pay debt service on the Bonds. Paragraph (ii) of this opinion is accordingly
applicable to such payment representing maturing interest.


Because the Trusts do not include any "private activity bonds" within the
meaning of Section 57(a)(5) of the Code issued on or after August 8, 1986, none
of the Trust's interest income shall be treated as an item of tax preference
when computing the alternative minimum tax. In the case of corporations, for
taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, the alternative minimum tax and
the Superfund Tax depend upon the corporation's alternative minimum taxable
income ("AMTI"), which is the corporation's taxable income with certain
adjustments.


Pursuant to Section 56(c) of the Code, one of the adjustment items used in
computing AMTI of a corporation (other than an S Corporation, Regulated
Investment Company, Real Estate Investment Trust, REMIC or FASIT) for tax years
beginning in 1989 is an amount equal to 75% of the excess of such corporation's
"adjusted current earnings" over an amount equal to its AMTI (before such
adjustment item and the alternative tax net





operating loss deduction). "Adjusted current earnings" includes all tax-exempt
interest, including interest on all Bonds in the Trust, and tax-exempt original
issue discount.


Sections 1288 and 1272 of the Code provide a complex set of rules governing
the accrual of original issue discount. These rules provide that original issue
discount accrues either on the basis of a constant compound interest rate or
ratably over the term of the Bond, depending on the date the Bond was issued. In
addition, special rules apply if the purchase price of a Bond exceeds the
original issue price plus the amount of original issue discount which would have
previously accrued based upon its issue price (its "adjusted issue price"). The
application of these rules will also vary depending on the value of the Bond on
the date a Unitholder acquires his Units, and the price the Unitholder pays for
his Units.


Effective for tax returns filed after December 31, 1987, all taxpayers are
required to disclose to the Internal Revenue Service the amount of tax-exempt
interest earned during the year.


Section 265 of the Code provides for a reduction in each taxable year of
100% of the otherwise deductible interest on indebtedness incurred or continued
by financial institutions, to which either Section 585 or Section 593 of the
Code applies, to purchase or carry obligations acquired after August 7, 1986
(with certain exceptions), the interest on which is exempt from Federal income
taxes for such taxable year. Under rules prescribed by Section 265, the amount
of interest otherwise deductible by such financial institutions in any taxable
year which is deemed to be attributable to tax-exempt obligations acquired after
August 7, 1986, will generally be the amount that bears the same ratio to the
interest deduction otherwise allowable (determined without regard to Section
265) to the taxpayer for the taxable year as the taxpayer's average adjusted
basis (within the meaning of Section 1016) of tax-exempt obligations acquired
after August 7, 1986, bears to such average adjusted basis for all assets of the
taxpayer.


We also call attention to the fact that, under Section 265 of the Code,
interest on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry Units is not
deductible for Federal income tax purposes. Under rules used by the Internal
Revenue Service for determining when borrowed funds are considered used for the
purpose of purchasing or carrying particular assets, the purchase of Units may
be considered to have been made with borrowed funds even though the borrowed
funds are not directly traceable to the purchase of Units. However, these rules
generally do not apply to interest paid on indebtedness incurred for
expenditures of a personal nature such as a mortgage incurred to purchase or
improve a personal residence.


"The Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993" (the "Tax Act") subjects tax-exempt
bonds to the market discount rules of the Code effective for bonds purchased
after April 30, 1993. In general, market discount is the amount (if any) by
which the stated redemption price at maturity exceeds an investor's purchase
price (except to the extent that such difference, if any, is attributable to
original issue discount not yet accrued) subject to a statutory de minimis rule.
Market discount can arise based on the price a Trust pays for Bonds or the price
a Unitholder pays for his or her Units. Under the Tax Act, accretion of market
discount is taxable as ordinary income; under prior law, the accretion had been
treated as capital gain. Market discount that accretes while a Trust holds a
Bond would be recognized as ordinary income by the Unitholders when principal
payments are received on the Bond, upon sale or at redemption (including early
redemption), or upon the sale or redemption of his or her Units, unless a
Unitholder elects to include market discount in taxable income as it accrues.


Chapman and Cutler has expressed no opinion with respect to taxation under
any other provisions of Federal law. Ownership of the Units may result in
collateral Federal income tax consequences to certain taxpayers. Prospective
investors should consult their tax advisors as to the applicability of any such
collateral consequences.


We have not examined any of the Bonds to be deposited and held in the Trust
or the proceedings for the issuance thereof or the opinions of bond counsel with
respect thereto, and therefore express no opinion as to the exemption from State
income taxes of interest on the Bonds if received directly by a Unitholder.


We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the
Registration Statement (File No. 333-88977) relating to the Units referred to
above and to the use of our name and to the reference to our firm in said
Registration Statement and in the related Prospectus.

Re: Arizona Insured Trust 62


Gentlemen:


We have acted as counsel to Nuveen Tax-Free Unit Trust, Series 1124, with
respect to certain matters preliminary to the issuance and sale of units of
interest therein (the "Units") pursuant to a Trust Indenture and Agreement,
dated as of the date hereof (the "Indenture"), between John Nuveen & Co.
Incorporated, as depositor (the "Depositor"), and The Chase Manhattan Bank, as
trustee (the "Trustee"). The Units represent fractional undivided interests in
the principal of and net income on obligations deposited in one of several
separate trusts, including the above-captioned trust (the "Trust"), will be
evidenced by a certificate (the "Certificate") and will be sold to various
investors (the "Unitholders"). Each separate trust will be administered as a
distinct entity with separate certificates, investments, expenses, books and
records.


The assets of the Trust will consist of interest-bearing obligations issued
by or on behalf of the State of Arizona (the "State"), its political
subdivisions and authorities (the "Arizona Bonds"), and certain bonds issued by
Puerto Rico Authorities (the "Possession Bonds") (collectively the Arizona Bonds
and Possession Bonds shall be referred to herein as the "Bonds"), provided the
interest on such Bonds received by the Trust is exempt from State income taxes.
Distributions of interest on the Bonds received by the Trust will be made
semi-annually unless a Unitholder elects to receive them monthly or quarterly.


Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel have independently examined the Bonds to
be deposited in and held in the Trust. However, although no opinion is expressed
herein regarding such matters, it is assumed that: (i) the Bonds were validly
issued, (ii) the interest thereon is excludable from gross income for federal
income tax purposes and (iii) interest on the Bonds, if received directly by a
Unitholder would be exempt from the Arizona income tax (the "ARIZONA INCOME
TAX"). We have assumed that, at the respective times of issuance of the Bonds,
opinions relating to the validity thereof and to the exemption of interest
thereon from Federal income tax were rendered by bond counsel to the respective
issuing authorities. In addition, with respect to the Arizona Bonds, bond
counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions that the interest on the
Bonds is exempt from the Arizona Income Tax. Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel
has made any review for the Trust of the proceedings relating to the issuance of
the Bonds or of the bases for the opinions rendered in connection therewith.


Based on the foregoing, and review and consideration of existing State laws,
it is our opinion, and we herewith advise you, as follows:


(1)--For State income tax purposes, each Unitholder will be treated as the
owner of a pro rata portion of the Trust, and the income of the Trust will
therefore be treated as the income of the Unitholder under State law.


(2)--For State income tax purposes, interest on the Arizona Bonds which is
excludable from Federal gross income and which is exempt from State income taxes
when received by the Trust, and which would be excluable from Federal gross
income and exempt from State income taxes if recieved directly by a Unitholder,
will retain its status as tax-exempt interest when received by the Trust and
distributed to the Unitholders.





(3)--To the extent that interest derived from the Trust by a Unitholder with
respect to the the Arizona Bonds is excludable from Federal gross income, such
interest will not be subject to State income taxes.


(4)--Interest on the Possession Bonds which is excludable from gross income
for federal income tax purposes and is exempt from state and local taxation
pursuant to federal law when received by the Trust will be exempt from Arizona
income taxation and therefore will not be includable in the income of the
Unitholders for income tax purposes when distributed by the Trust and received
by the Unitholders.


(5)--Each Unitholder will realize taxable gain or loss for State income tax
purposes when Bonds held in the Trust are sold, exchanged, redeemed prior to
maturity or paid at maturity, or when the Unitholder redeems or sells his
Unit(s), at a price that differs from original cost as adjusted for accretion of
any discount or amortization of any premium and other basis adjustments,
including any basis reduction that may be required to reflect a Unitholder's
share of interest, if any, accruing on Bonds during the interval between the
Unitholder's settlement date and the date such Bonds are delivered to the Trust,
if later.


(6)--State law does not permit a deduction for interest paid or incurred on
indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry Units in the Trust, the
interest on which is exempt from State income taxes. Special rules apply to
financial institutions.


(7)--Neither the Bonds nor the Units will be subject to State property
taxes, sales taxes or use taxes.


(8)--In the case of Trusts for which an insurance policy or policies with
respect to the payment of principal and interest on the Arizona Bonds and
Possession Bonds has been obtained by the Depositor, any proceeds paid under
such policy or policies issued to the Trust, if any, with respect to the Bonds
in the Trust which represent maturing interest on defaulted Bonds held by the
Trustee will be exempt from State income taxes if, and to the same extent as,
such interest would have been so exempt if paid by the issuer of the defaulted
Bonds provided that, at the time such policies are purchased, the amounts paid
for such policies are reasonable, customary and consistent with the reasonable
expectation that the issuer of the bonds, rather than the insurer, will pay debt
service on the bonds.


We have not examined any of the Bonds to be deposited and held in the Trust
or the proceedings for the issuance thereof or the opinions of bond counsel with
respect thereto, and therefore express no opinion as to the exemption from State
income taxes of interest on the Bonds if received directly by a Unitholder.


We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the
Registration Statement (No. 333-88977) filed pursuant to the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the "Act"), with respect to the registration of the sale of
the Units by Nuveen Tax-Free Unit Trust, Series 1124, and to the references to
our firm in such Registration Statement and the preliminary prospectus included
therein. In giving such consent, we do not thereby admit that we are persons
whose consent is required by Section 7 of the Act, or the rules and regulations
thereunder.


Very truly yours,

RE: Colorado Insured Trust 82


Ladies and Gentlemen:


We have acted as special counsel to the Nuveen Tax-Free Unit Trust, Series
1124 (the "Fund") with respect to certain applications of the income tax law of
the State of Colorado to the above captioned Trust(s) created as part of the
Fund (the "Colorado Trust(s)") and to the holders of certificates or registered
holders of book entry positions evidencing ownership of fractional undivided
interest ("Units") in the Colorado Trust(s) who are residents of the State of
Colorado ("Colorado Unitholders").


In this connection, we have examined the form of an opinion of Chapman and
Cutler, counsel for John Nuveen & Co. Incorporated, the Depositor, to be dated
today, as to the federal tax status of the several constituent trusts of the
Fund and the holders of Units, including the Colorado Trust(s) and the Colorado
Unitholders. Chapman and Cutler has advised us that its opinion, as executed and
delivered, will be in all material respects identical to such form. We have also
examined such pertinent materials and matters of law as we deemed necessary in
order to enable us to express the opinions hereinafter set forth.


It is our understanding that a Colorado Trust will consist of obligations
which were issued by the State of Colorado or its political subdivisions or by
the United States or possessions of the United States, including Puerto Rico,
the Virgin Islands and Guam ("Bonds"). The following opinion assumes that the
Colorado Trust(s) will have no income other than (i) interest income on the
Bonds, (ii) insurance proceeds, if any, referred to in paragraph (3) below, and

(iii) gain on the disposition of such Bonds.


Based on the foregoing and, with your permission, in reliance upon the
opinion of Chapman and Cutler referred to above, it is our opinion that
application of existing Colorado income tax law would be as follows:


The Chapman and Cutler opinion concludes that each trust, including the
Colorado Trust(s), will be governed by the provisions of subchapter J of chapter
1, Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code"). Although there are no Colorado
income tax statutes similar to subchapter J of chapter 1 of the Code, the
Colorado statutory provisions generally operate to reach the same result that is
reached under the federal system. The income, deduction, and credit items
directly reportable by the "owner" of a trust under the federal rules are also
directly reportable by that same person under Colorado rules. Conversely, items
of income, deduction, and credit not reportable for federal purposes typically
are not reported for Colorado purposes. For resident individuals, estates, and
trusts, Colorado law imposes a tax on federal taxable income, as defined in the
Code, with specific modifications. For corporations, a tax is imposed on net
income derived from sources within Colorado. A corporation's net income is
defined as federal taxable income, again with certain modifications. There are
two modifications relevent to this opinion. First, interest income less
amortization of premium on obligations of any state or any politcal subdivision
thereof must be added to federal taxable income; however, interest income on
obligations of the State of Colorado or a political subdivision thereof which
are issued on or after May 1, 1980 is specifically excluded from this
modification. Interest income on obligations of the State of Colorado or a
political subdivision thereof which were issued before May 1, 1980 is also
excluded from this modification to the extent that such interest is specifically
exempt from income taxation under the laws of the State of Colorado authorizing
the issuance of such obligations. The second relevent modification is that
interest income on obligations of the United States and its possessions is
subtracted from federal taxable income to the extent it was included in federal
taxable income.





Colorado also imposes on individuals, estates, and trusts an alternative
minimum tax based on the federal alternative minimum taxable income determined
pursuant to Section 55 of the Code. As with the modifications to federal taxable
income pertaining to interest income on Colorado exempt obligations, interest
income on obligations of the State of Colorado and political sudivisions thereof
which are issued on or after May 1, 1980, or which were issued prior to May 1,
1980 but have interest specifically exempt from income taxation under the
Colorado laws authorizing the issuance of such obligations, is not included in
the modification that otherwise requires that interest income from obligations
of states or political subdivisions thereof be added to federal alternative
minimum taxable income. Furthermore, interest income on obligations of the
United States and its possessions is subtracted from federal alternative minimum
taxable income.


Because Colorado income tax law is based upon the federal law and in light
of the opinion of Chapman and Cutler, the Colorado Trust(s) will not be
association(s) taxable as corporation(s) for purposes of Colorado income
taxation.


With respect to Colorado Unitholders, in view of the relationship between
federal and Colorado tax computations described above and the opinion of Chapman
and Cutler referred to above:


1.--Each Colorado Unitholder will be treated as owning a share of each asset
of the Colorado Unitholder's respective Colorado Trust for Colorado income tax
purposes, in the proportion that the number of Units of such Colorado Trust held
by the Unitholder bears to the total number of outstanding Units of the Colorado
Trust, and the income of the Colorado Trust will therefore be treated as the
income of each Colorado Unitholder under Colorado law in the proportion
described;


2.--Interest on Bonds that would not be included in the base subject to
Colorado income tax or Colorado alternative minimum tax when paid directly to a
Colorado Unitholder will not be included in the base subject to Colorado income
tax or alternative minimum tax when received by a Colorado Trust and attributed
to such Colorado Unitholder and when distributed to such Colorado Unitholder;


3.--Proceeds paid under an insurance policy, if any, issued to the issuer of
the Bonds involved, to the Depositor prior to deposit of the Bonds in a Colorado
Trust, or to a Colorado Trust, which proceeds represent maturing interest on
defaulted Bonds and which proceeds would not be included in the base subject to
Colorado income tax or Colorado alternative minimum tax when paid directly to a
Colorado Unitholder will not be included in the base subject to Colorado income
and alternative minimum tax when received by a Colorado Trust and attributed to
such Colorado Unitholder and when distributed to such Colorado Unitholder;


4.--Generally, each Colorado Unitholder will realize gain or loss taxable in
Colorado when the Colorado Unitholder's respective Colorado Trust disposes of a
Bond (whether by sale, exchange, redemption, or payment at maturity) or when the
Colorado Unitholder redeems or sells Units at a price that differs from original
cost as adjusted for amortization of bond discount or premium and other basis
adjustments (including any basis reduction that may be required to reflect a
Colorado Unitholder's share of interest, if any, accruing on Bonds during the
interval between the Colorado Unitholder's settlement date and the date such
Bonds are delivered to the Colorado Trust, if later). However, beginning in
2000, a Colorado Unitholder who is an individual, a trust or an estate may be
able to exclude from Colorado taxable income up to $1,200 per year ($2,400 for a
married couple filing jointly) of gains from the Trust's disposition of Bonds or
from the redemption or sale of the Colorado Unitholder's Units. Under
legislation enacted by Colorado in 1999, interest income, dividend income and
net capital gains (as defined in Section 1222(11) of the Code) otherwise
includable in taxable income qualify for the exclusion. The exclusion will be
available only in years during which state revenues exceed by $220 million

(indexed annually to relfect the rate of growth in Colorado personal income)
state spending limits mandated by the Colorado Constitution, as such revenue and
spending limits are described in the Appendix to the Information Supplement
entitled "Colorado Disclosure" under the caption "Economic
Factors--Colorado--Restrictions on Appropriations and Revenues";


5.--Tax cost reduction requirements relating to amortization of bond premium
may, under some circumstances, result in Colorado Unitholders realizing gain
taxable in Colorado when their Units are sold or redeemed for an amount equal to
or less than their original cost. Such gain may qualify for the exclusion from
Colorado taxable income described in paragraph (4) above during years in which
the exclusion becomes available; and





6.--If interest on indebtedness incurred or continued by a Colorado
Unitholder to purchase Units in the Colorado Trust is not deductible for federal
income tax purposes, it will not be deductible for Colorado income tax purposes.


We have not examined any of the Bonds to be deposited in the Colorado
Trusts(s) and express no opinion as to whether the interest (or, if applicable,
insurance proceeds representing interest) on any such Bonds would in fact be
included in the base subject to Colorado income tax or Colorado alternative
minimum tax if directly received by a Colorado Unitholder.


We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the
Registration Statement (File No. 333-88977) relating to the Units referred to
above and to the use of our name and the reference to our firm in such
Registration Statement, and in the related Prospectus, under the "Tax Status"
heading for each Colorado Trust in the Fund. In addition, we authorize Chase
Manhattan Bank to rely upon this opinion in its capacity as Trustee of the Fund.


Very truly yours,




SHERMAN & HOWARD L.L.C.

Nuveen Tax-Free Unit Trust, Series 1124

Florida Insured Trust 283

John Nuveen & Co. Incorporated

333 W. Wacker Drive

Chicago, Illinois 60606


Attn:  Gifford R. Zimmerman

Assistant General Counsel and

Vice President


Re:  Florida Insured Trust 283


Gentlemen:


We have acted as special Florida counsel to Nuveen Tax-Free Unit Trust,
Series 1124 including the above-captioned trust (the "Fund") in connection with
the issuance by the Fund of units of fractional undivided interests in the Fund
(the "Units"). In that connection, you have requested our opinion as to the
application of Florida state and local taxes to the Trust (as hereinafter
defined) and to investors who purchase units in the Trust.


We have not been furnished with a copy of the Registration Statement or the
prospectus, which is a part of the Registration Statement, relating to the
issuance by the Fund of the Units. However, you have authorized us to assume
that the proposed offer and sale of the Units, including the units of the
Florida Trust, will be carried out in that same manner and upon the same terms
and conditions as those described in any prospectus for a previous Nuveen
Tax-Free Unit Trust that contained a Florida Insured Trust. In addition, you
have authorized us to assume and we have assumed that:


(a)--The Fund has been organized under a Trust Indenture and Agreement
between John Nuveen & Co., Incorporated (the "Depositor") and The Chase
Manhattan Bank (the "Trustee").


(b)--The Fund will issue the Units in several State Trusts; one of which is
the Florida Insured Trust (the "Trust").


(c)--The Units will be purchased by various investors who may be individuals
or corporations.


(d)--Each Unit of the Trust represents a fractional undivided interest in
the principal and net income of the Trust in the ratio of ten Units for each
$1,000 principal amount of the obligations initially acquired by the Trust.


(e)--Each Trust will be administered as a distinct entity with separate
certificates, investments, expenses, books, and records.


(f)--The assets of the Trust will consist solely of interest-bearing
obligations issued by or on behalf of the State of Florida, its political
subdivisions, and authorities or by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam or the
Virgin Islands.


(g)--Distributions of interest received by the Trust will be made
semi-annually, unless the Unitholder elects otherwise.


(h) The interest on all Bonds in the Trust will be exempt from Federal
income tax.(N.1)


(i)--The Bonds have been issued in strict compliance with all requirements
of Florida, Federal or territorial law.


(j)--The Fund is a registered investment company under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended.


In rendering our opinion, you have advised us that Messrs. Chapman and
Cutler have rendered the following opinions and have authorized us to rely upon
such opinions and we have relied upon such opinions that:





(a)--The Trust will not be taxable as an association but will be governed by
the provisions of Subchapter J (relating to trusts) of Chapter 1 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.


(b)--Each Unitholder will be considered as owning a pro-rata share of each
asset of the Trust to which such Unit relates in the proportion that the number
of Units of the Trust held by him bears to the total number of outstanding Units
of the Trust and will be subject to Federal income tax on the income therefrom
under the provisions of Subpart E of Subchapter J of Chapter 1 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.


(c)--The Trust will not be subject to Federal income taxes.


(d)--For Federal income tax purposes, each item of Trust income will have
the same character in the hands of a Unitholder as it would have in the hands of
the Trustee. Accordingly, to the extent that the income of the Trust consists of
interest excludable from Federal gross income under Section 103 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, such income will be excludable from Federal
gross income of the Unitholders.


(e)--For Federal income tax purposes, each Unitholder will have a taxable
event when, upon redemption or sale of his Units, he receives cash or other
property. Gain or loss will be measured by comparing the proceeds of such a
redemption or sale with the Unitholder's adjusted basis for the Unit. Before
adjustment, generally this basis would be cost, if the Unitholder had purchased
his Units, plus his share of certain advances by the Trustee to the Trust and
certain accrued original issue discount. For Federal income tax purposes, if the
Trustee disposes of a Trust asset (whether by sale, payment on maturity,
retirement, or otherwise), gain or loss will be recognized by each Unitholder,
and such gain or loss is computed by measuring the Unitholder's aliquot share of
the total proceeds from the transaction against his basis for his fractional
interest in the asset disposed of (such basis being determined by apportioning
the basis for his Units among all of the Trust's assets ratably according to
their values as of the valuation date nearest the date on which he purchased the
Units). A Unitholder's basis in his Units and the basis for his fractional
interest in each Trust asset must be reduced by the amount of his aliquot share
of interest received, if any, on Bonds delivered after the Unitholder's
settlement date to the extent that such interest accrued on the Bonds during the
period from the Unitholder's settlement date to the date such Bonds are
delivered to the Trust and must be reduced annually by amortization of premiums,
if any, on obligations held by the Trust.


For the purposes of this letter:


(a)--"Florida Code" shall mean the Florida Income Tax Code, Chapter 220,
Florida Statutes, as amended. In the Florida Income Tax Code, Chapter 220,
Florida Statutes, the Florida Legistature has adopted, retroactively to January
1, 1997, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended and in effect on January
1, 1997, as the Internal Revenue Code under which a Corporate Unitholder must
compute its income for purposes of Florida corporate income taxation.


(b)--"Code" shall mean the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended and in
effect on January 1, 1997.


(c)--"Non-Corporate Unitholder" shall mean a Unitholder of the Florida Trust
who is an individual not subject to the income tax on corporations imposed by
the Florida Code.


(d)--"Corporate Unitholder" shall mean a Unitholder of the Florida Trust
that is a corporation subject to the income tax on corporations imposed by the
Florida Code.


(e)--"Nonbusiness Income" is defined in the Florida Code and shall mean
rents and royalties from real or tangible personal property, capital gains,
interest, dividends, and patent and copyright royalties, to the extent that they
do not arise from transactions and activities in the regular course of a
Corporate Unitholder's trade or business. The term Nonbusiness Income does not
include income from tangible and intangible property if the acquisition,
management, and disposition of the property constitute integral parts of a
Corporate Unitholder's regular trade or business operations, or any amounts
which could be included in apportionable income without violating the due
process clause of the United States Constitution. For purposes of this
definition, "income" means gross receipts less all expenses directly or
indirectly attributable thereto.


(f)--"Commercial domicile" shall mean the place that a corporation maintains
its principal place of business. The term "commercial domicile" is not
specifically defined in Florida law for Florida corporate





income tax purposes. However, the Florida Supreme Court has on at least two
occasions attributed meaning to this phrase, and recently enacted legislation
amending Florida's intangible personal property tax law defines this phrase. The
Court has implied that a corporation's commercial domicile is its principal
place of business, Department of Revenue v. Amrep Corp., 358 So.2d 1343, 1350
(Fla. 1978). The Court also stated in another case that a particular
corporation's domicile was in New York City where its head office and the actual
seat of its over-all business government was located and from where its
executive officers regularly exercised their complete authority and controlled
and directed all activities of the corporation, wherever carried on. Gay v.
Bessemer Properties, Inc., 32 So.2d 587, 591 (Fla. 1947). In recently enacted
legislation, a corporation is considered to acquire a commercial domicile in
Florida "when it maintains its chief or principal office in [Florida] where
executive or management functions are performed or where the course of business
operations is determined." Section 199.175 (1)(b), Florida Statutes (1989).


Based solely upon the assumptions you have permitted us to make and the
opinions of Messrs. Chapman and Cutler upon which you have authorized us to
rely, we are of the opinion that:


(a)--For Florida state income tax purposes, the Trust will not be subject to
the income tax imposed by the Florida Code so long as the Trust has no income
subject to federal income taxation. In addition, political subdivisions of
Florida do not impose any income taxes.


(b)--Because Florida does not impose an income tax on individuals,
Non-Corporate Unitholders will not be subject to any Florida income tax on
income realized by the Trust. Each Corporate Unitholder will be subject to
Florida income taxation on its share of the income realized by the Trust
notwithstanding the tax exempt status of the interest received from any bonds
under Section 103(a) of the Code or any other federal law, unless the interest
income constitutes Nonbusiness Income. Nevertheless, any Corporate Unitholder
that has its commercial domicile in Florida will be taxable under the Florida
Code on its share of the Trust income which constitutes Nonbusiness Income.


(c)--A Non-Corporate Unitholder will not be subject to Florida income
taxation with respect to gain realized when Bonds held in the Trust are sold,
redeemed, or paid at maturity. A Corporate Unitholder will be subject to Florida
income taxation with respect to gain realized on such a sale, redemption, or
payment at maturity of a Bond held by the Trust, except to the extent that the
gain realized therefrom constitutes Nonbusiness Income. Nevertheless, to the
extent that gains realized by a Corporate Unitholder arising from a sale,
redemption, or payment at maturity constitute Nonbusiness Income, such gain will
be taxable under the Florida Code if the Corporate Unitholder's commercial
domicile is in Florida.


(d)--Any gain realized by a Non-Corporate Unitholder from the redemption,
sale, or other disposition of a Unit will not be subject to Florida income tax.
Any gain realized by a Corporate Unitholder from the redemption, sale, or other
disposition of a Unit will be subject to Florida income tax except to the extent
that the gain realized therefrom constitutes Nonbusiness Income. Nevertheless,
to the extent that gain realized by a Corporate Unitholder arising from a sale,
redemption, or other disposition of a Unit consitutes Nonbusiness Income, such
gain will be taxable under the Florida Code if the Corporate Unitholder's
commercial domicile is in Florida.


(e)--A Non-Corporate Unitholder will not be subject to Florida income
taxation with respect to amounts paid under the Municipal Bond Investors
Assurance Corporation insurance policies representing interest on defaulted
obligations held by the Trustee. A Corporate Unitholder will be subject to
Florida income taxation on its share of amounts paid under the Municipal Bond
Investors Assurance Corporation insurance policies representing maturing
interest on defaulted obligations held by the Trustee except to the extent that
such payments constitute Nonbusiness Income as defined in the Florida Code.
Nevertheless, any Corporate Unitholder that has its commercial domicile in
Florida will be taxable under the Florida Code on its share of amounts paid
under the Municipal Bond Investors Assurance Corporation insurance policies
representing maturing interest on defaulted obligations held by the Trustee even
if such payments constitute Nonbusiness Income.


(f)--A Non-Corporate Unitholder will not be subject to Florida income
taxation with respect to gain realized with respect to amounts paid under the
Municipal Bond Investors Assurance Corporation insurance policies representing
principal on defaulted obligations held by the Trustee. A Corporate Unitholder
will be subject to Florida income taxation with respect to gain realized on its
share of amounts paid under the Municipal Bond Investors Assurance Corporation
insurance policies representing principal on defaulted obligations held by the
Trustee except to the extent that the gain realized constitutes





Nonbusiness Income. Nevertheless, gain realized, by any Corporate Unitholder
that has its commercial domicile in Florida, on such payments representing
principal on defaulted obligations held by the Trustee, will be taxable under
the Florida Code even if such payments constitute Nonbusiness Income.


(g)--Even if interest on indebtedness incurred or continued by a Unitholder
to purchase Units in the Trust is not deductible for Federal income tax
purposes, under Code section 265(a)(2) or any other law, it will be deductible,
in effect, by Corporate Unitholders for Florida income tax purposes if interest
earned on the Units is other than Nonbusiness Income. Nevertheless, if interest
earned on the Units is Nonbusiness Income, any Corporate Unitholder that has its
commercial domicile in Florida may reduce the amount of interest included as
Nonbusiness Income by the amount of expenses directly or indirectly attributable
thereto.


(h)--Trust Units will be subject to Florida estate tax only if owned by
Florida residents and may be subjected to Florida estate tax if owned by other
decendents. However, the Florida estate tax is limited to the amount of the
credit allowable under the applicable Federal Revenue Act (currently Section
2011 (and in some cases Section 2102) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended) for death taxes actually paid to the several states.


(i)--Neither the Bonds nor the Units will be subject to the Florida ad
valorem tax or Florida sales or use tax.


(j)--Because Bonds issued by the State of Florida, its political
subdivisions or by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, or the Virgin Islands,
are exempt from Florida intangible personal property taxation under Chapter 199,
Florida Statutes, the Trust will not be subject to Florida intangible personal
property tax. In addition, the Unitholders will not be subject to Florida
intangible personal property tax on the Units.


(k)--The sale, redemption, or other disposition by the Trust of Bonds issued
by the State of Florida, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, or the Virgin
Islands, will not subject either the Trust or the Unitholders to Florida
documentary stamp tax.


(l)--The issuance and sale of the Units by the Trust will not subject either
the Trust or the Unitholders to Florida documentary stamp tax.


(m)--The transfer of Units by a Unitholder will not be subject to Florida
documentary stamp tax.


This opinion is limited to the law in effect as of the date hereof and we
assume no responsibility for changes in the law that may become effective
subsequent to the date of this opinion. Furthermore, this letter is not to be
construed as a prediction of a favorable outcome with respect to any issue for
which no favorable prediction is made herein, or as a guaranty of any tax
result, or as offering an assurance or guaranty that a Florida state or local
taxing authority might not differ with our conclusions, or raise other questions
or issues upon audit, or that such action may not be judicially sustained.


We have not examined any of the Bonds to be deposited in the Fund and held
by the Trust, and we express no opinion as to whether the interest on any such
Bonds would, in fact, be tax-exempt if directly received by a Unitholder; nor
have we made any review of the proceedings relating to the issuance of the Bonds
or the basis for the bond counsel opinions or the opinions of Messrs. Chapman
and Cutler referred to herein.


We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the
Registration Statement (File No. 333-88977) and to the reference to our firm in
such Registration Statement and the Prospectus included therein. In giving such
consent, we do not thereby admit that we are within the category of persons
whose consent is required by Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder.




(N.1) Section 2.01 of the Indenture provides that if the Depositor fails to
deposit Bonds, through no fault of its own, the Depositor may, as provided in

Section 3.14 of said Indenture, purchase replacement bonds (referred to as "New
Bonds") that will also be tax exempt bonds issued by the same states or their
respective political subdivisions.

as Trustee of

Nuveen Tax-Free Unit Trust,

Attention:  Mr. John W. Sweeney

Vice President


Re:  Nuveen Tax-Free Unit Trust, Series 1124


Dear Sirs:


We are acting as counsel for The Chase Manhattan Bank ("Chase") in
connection with the execution and delivery of a Standard Terms and Conditions of
Trust for Nuveen Tax-Free Unit Trusts Series 823 and subsequent Series (the
"Standard Terms and Conditions of Trust") dated September 7, 1995, and a related
Trust Indenture and Agreement (the "Trust Indenture and Agreement") dated
today's date (such Standard Terms and Conditions of Trust and related Trust
Indenture and Agreement are collectively referred to as the "Indenture"), each
between John Nuveen & Co. Incorporated, as Depositor (the "Depositor"), and
Chase, as Trustee (the "Trustee"), establishing the Nuveen Tax-Free Unit Trust,
Series 1124 (the "Trust Fund"), and the confirmation by Chase, as Trustee under
the Indenture, that it has caused to be credited to the Depositor's account at
The Depository Trust Company a number of units constituting the entire interest
in the Trust Fund (such aggregate units being herein called "Units") each of
which represents an undivided interest in the Trust Fund, which consists of
tax-exempt bonds (including confirmations of contracts for the purchase of
certain bonds not yet delivered and cash, cash equivalents or an irrevocable
letter of credit in the amount required for such purchase upon the receipt of
such bonds) in the aggregate principal amount set forth in the Closing
Memorandum executed and delivered today by the Depositor and the Trustee (the
"Closing Memorandum"), such bonds being defined in the Indenture as Bonds and
listed in the Schedules to the Indenture.


We have examined the Indenture, the Closing Memorandum, the form of
certificate for the Units included in the Indenture and a specimen of the
certificates to be issued thereunder (the "Certificates") and such other
documents as we have deemed necessary in order to render this opinion. Based on
the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:


1. Chase is a duly organized and existing corporation having the powers of a
trust company under the laws of the State of New York.


2. The Indenture has been duly executed and delivered by Chase and, assuming
due execution and delivery by the Depositor, constitutes the valid and legally
binding obligation of Chase.


3. The Certificates are in proper form for execution and delivery by Chase,
as Trustee.


4. Chase, as Trustee, has registered on the registration books of the Trust
Fund the ownership of the Units by The Depository Trust Company, where it has
caused the Units to be credited to the account of the Depositor. Upon receipt of
confirmation of the effectiveness of the registration statement for the sale of
the Units filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities
Act of 1933, the Trustee may cause the Units to be transferred on the
registration books of the Trust Fund to such other names, and in such
denominations, as the Depositor may order, and may deliver Certificates
evidencing such ownership.





5. Chase, as Trustee, may lawfully advance to the Trust Fund amounts as may
be necessary to provide periodic interest distributions of approximately equal
amounts, and may be reimbursed, without interest, for any such advances from
funds in the interest account, as provided in the Indenture.


In rendering the foregoing opinion, we have not considered, among other
things, whether the Bonds have been duly authorized and delivered or the federal
tax status of the Bonds.


Very truly yours,




CARTER, LEDYARD & MILBURN

Series 1124

c/o The Chase Manhattan Bank,

as Trustee

4 New York Plaza, 3rd Floor

New York, New York 10004


Re:  Nuveen Tax-Free Unit Trust, Series 1124


Dear Sirs:


We are acting as special counsel with respect to New York tax matters for
the Nuveen Tax-Free Unit Trust, Series 1124 (the "Trust Fund"), which will be
established under a Standard Terms and Conditions of Trust for Nuveen Tax-Free
Unit Trust Series 823 and subsequent Series dated September 7, 1995, and a
related Trust Indenture and Agreement dated as of today (such Standard Terms and
Conditions of Trust and related Trust Indenture and Agreement are referred to
collectively as the "Indenture"), between John Nuveen & Co. Incorporated, as
Depositor (the "Depositor"), and The Chase Manhattan Bank, as Trustee (the
"Trustee"). Pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, units of fractional
undivided interest in the Trust Fund will be issued in the aggregate amount set
forth in the Closing Memorandum dated today's date (the "Units"), which Units
may, in accordance with the Indenture, be represented by a certificate or
certificates (the "Certificates").


We have examined and are familiar with originals or certified copies, or
copies otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such documents as we have
deemed necessary or appropriate for the purpose of this opinion. In giving this
opinion, we have relied upon the two opinions, each dated today and addressed to
the Trustee, of Chapman and Cutler, counsel for the Depositor, with respect to
the matters of law set forth therein.


Based upon the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:


1. The Trust Fund will not constitute an association taxable as a
corporation under New York law, and accordingly will not be subject to the New
York State franchise tax or the New York City general corporation tax.


2. Under the income tax laws of the State and City of New York, the income
of the Trust Fund will be considered the income of the holders of the Units.
Individual holders of Units who are residents of New York State or New York City
should compute their New York adjusted gross income in respect of the Trust Fund
in the same manner as Federal adjusted gross income, increased by interest on
obligations of states and political subdivisions thereof other than New York,
which is exempt for Federal income tax purposes, and reduced by amortization of
premium on such obligations. A New York State or City resident should determine
the basis and holding period of his Units in the same manner for New York
purposes as for Federal purposes for the purpose of computing gain or loss on
the sale or other disposition of his Units. Non-resident holders of Units will
not be taxable by New York State or City on any interest or gain derived from
the Trust Fund or upon any gain from the sale or other disposition of their
Units, since such income or gain will not be considered as derived from New York
State or City sources.


3. By reason of the exemption contained in paragraph (a) of Subdivision 8 of

Section 270 of the New York Tax Law, no New York State stock transfer tax will
be payable in respect of any transfer of the Certificates.


Very truly yours,




CARTER, LEDYARD & MILBURN

Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp."). U.S. Trust operates through Bank of America, N.A., and other subsidiaries of BofA Corp.
