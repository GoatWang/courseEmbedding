David J. McLachlan's Biography



David J. McLachlan, age 78, has been a director since 2000 and Lead Independent Director since May 2014. He served as Chairman of the Board from May 2008 to May 2014. Mr. McLachlan served as a senior advisor to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Genzyme Corporation (a publicly traded biotechnology company) from 1999 to 2004. He also was the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Genzyme from 1989 to 1999.

			David J. McLachlan, age 78, has been a director since 2000 and Lead Independent Director since May 2014. He served as Chairman of the Board from May 2008 to May 2014. Mr. McLachlan served as a senior advisor to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Genzyme Corporation (a publicly traded biotechnology company) from 1999 to 2004. He also was the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Genzyme from 1989 to 1999. Prior to joining Genzyme, Mr. McLachlan served as Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Adams-Russell Company (an electronic component supplier and cable television franchise owner). He previously served as a director of Dyax Corp. until January 2016, when it was acquired by Shire plc. 
? 
We believe that Mr. McLachlan, the current Lead Independent Director, is qualified to serve as a director because he possesses a broad range of business experience as a result of his service as both chief financial officer and director for several public companies. In particular, Mr. McLachlan has in-depth experience handling complex accounting and finance issues for a broad range of companies. He has also served on the boards and audit and governance committees of other public companies (including as chairman of the audit committee), and serves as a designated "audit committee financial expert" for Skyworks' Audit Committee.

Finite Mixture Models

Geoffrey McLachlan, David Peel 
ISBN: 978-0-471-00626-8
419 pages
October 2000



















Description
An up-to-date, comprehensive account of major issues in finite
mixture modeling
This volume provides an up-to-date account of the theory and
applications of modeling via finite mixture distributions. With an
emphasis on the applications of mixture models in both mainstream
analysis and other areas such as unsupervised pattern recognition,
speech recognition, and medical imaging, the book describes the
formulations of the finite mixture approach, details its
methodology, discusses aspects of its implementation, and
illustrates its application in many common statistical
contexts.
Major issues discussed in this book include identifiability
problems, actual fitting of finite mixtures through use of the EM
algorithm, properties of the maximum likelihood estimators so
obtained, assessment of the number of components to be used in the
mixture, and the applicability of asymptotic theory in providing a
basis for the solutions to some of these problems. The author also
considers how the EM algorithm can be scaled to handle the fitting
of mixture models to very large databases, as in data mining
applications. This comprehensive, practical guide:
* Provides more than 800 references-40% published since 1995
* Includes an appendix listing available mixture software
* Links statistical literature with machine learning and pattern
recognition literature
* Contains more than 100 helpful graphs, charts, and tables
Finite Mixture Models is an important resource for both applied and
theoretical statisticians as well as for researchers in the many
areas in which finite mixture models can be used to analyze data.

covered is so wide that it will make this book a standard reference
for the forthcoming years." (Zentralblatt MATH, Vol. 963,
2001/13)

"the material covered is so wide that it will make this book a
standard reference for the forthcoming years." (Zentralblatt MATH,
Vol.963, No.13, 2001)

"This book is excellent reading...should also serve as an excellent
handbook on mixture modelling..." (Mathematical Reviews,

"...contains valuable information about mixtures for
researchers..." (Journal of Mathematical Psychology, 2002)

"...a masterly overview of the area...It is difficult to ask for
more and there is no doubt that McLachlan and Peel's book will be
the standard reference on mixture models for many years to come."
(Statistical Methods in Medical Research, Vol. 11, 2002)

"...they are to be congratulated on the extent of their
achievement..." (The Statistician, Vol.51, No.3)
