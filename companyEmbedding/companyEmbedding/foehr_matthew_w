      goal is to produce a bottom line that supports a sustainably profitable
      business. By diversifying the portfolio of assets across numerous
      technology types, therapeutic areas, drug targets and industry partners,
      we offer investors an opportunity to invest in the increasingly
      complicated and unpredictable pharmaceutical industry. In comparison to
      its peers, we believe Ligand has assembled one of the largest and most
      diversified asset portfolios in the industry with the potential to
      generate revenue in the future. These therapies seek to address the
      unmet medical needs of patients for a broad spectrum of diseases
      including diabetes, hepatitis, muscle wasting, Alzheimer’s disease,
      dyslipidemia, anemia, asthma and osteoporosis. Ligand’s Captisol
      platform technology is a patent-protected, chemically modified
      cyclodextrin with a structure designed to optimize the solubility and
      stability of drugs. Ligand has established multiple alliances with the
      world's leading pharmaceutical companies including GlaxoSmithKline, Onyx
      Pharmaceuticals (a subsidiary of Amgen Inc.), Merck, Pfizer, Baxter
      International, Lundbeck Inc., Eli Lilly & Co. and Spectrum
