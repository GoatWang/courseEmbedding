BYS Cosmetics Make Up 101 






























































Mommy FleurMommy FleurBYS Cosmetics Make Up 101
April 25, 2013 by Mommy Fleur Super thanks to Michelle of My Mom Friday, I was one of the lucky mommy bloggers who were invited to the BYS Cosmetics Make Up 101 event last March.



Sa totoo lang mga mudra, I don’t know anything about make up. My daily make up routine is a BB cream, face powder, eyebrow pencil and lipstick. It’s very, very basic. I always go for the natural look. Hindi nga di ba maintindihan ni Alvin why I spend a lot of time putting on make up and then want to look like I don’t have make up on. Hahaha! Men can never understand women! =)

Anyways, back to the event, Angie Goyena, the General Manager of BYS Philippines told us about BYS. BYS stands for “Be Yourself”. It’s a make up brand from Australia that is now exclusively distributed by iFace Cosmetics, a Filipino owned and operated company with roots in the global fashion accessories industry. It was eventually distributed in the UK, France, Japan, South Africa and parts of the Middle East.

“Designed for girls first experimenting with makeup as well as women who are confident of who they are, BYS is currently one of the most exciting brands today. Its exceptional quality, creative and extensive product range is matched with great value.” 


BYS Cosmetics offers more a thousand products.


They have a range of eye products. Its eyeliner come in regular black and brown as well as in neon shades and with glitter. Eyeliner pencils, mascara and eye shadows likewise have many variants with one sure to match one’s many moods.


 They have the BYS Minerals Naturale line which is formulated with natural ingredients free of chemicals, dyes, preservatives and talc. BYS mineral products are quick and easy to apply, and provide a complete, smooth, natural coverage in just one stop. It is safe to use even after skin care and derma procedures like laser, IPL, micro-dermabrasion or a simple facial.


 They also have their line of Baked Cosmetics. The Baked Bronzers and Blushers are made with an innovative formula that keeps oiliness adn moisture at bay and hides impurities. Texture is ultra silky and may be used wet for thicker coverage and dry for a more natural, lighter effect



 BYS has more than 400 shades of nail polish. They come in variants like Scented, Glow in the Dark, Magnetic, UV Reactive, Chrome, 3D Special Effects, Neon and Matte.

Bonggels di ba?

So lemme share with you now ang mga na-ganap on that day =)

We were taught about how long you should keep your make up and when you should throw it out already. Here:



We were taught how to put on the No Make-Up Look. I swear I can imagine Alvin rolling his eyes at me when he hears about this. Hahaha! Whatever basta ako, I super appreciate this! Eto ang peg ko everyday!



They let us sample their products =)
This is their primer.  

 


Kung ano ang primer, I had no idea. Apparently, it’s something you put on your face before you put everything else. It “primes” the face nga. BYS’s primer has Vitamin E and Chamomile Extract which moisturizes and primes at the same time. Winner!

Then I tried their loose powder. I love because (1) my face didn’t itch while I was wearing and (2) it felt so light on my face.







I like their blush as well. I used the one that Eli was holding and it looked really natural on me =)




Moving forward, muntikan na ako mapa-cartwheels when they said that they’ll teach us daw how to “draw” our eyebrows! So happy! OMG mga muthers, I have eyebrow issues! I was born with sad eyebrows. Eto yung tipong ang saya ko na talaga pero my eyebrows still look sad. Pababa kasi siya. So I had them shaved and threaded until, maging konti na lang sila =c My everyday challenge is to draw them and make them look naturally normal looking.

Ganito pala dapat.


Oh ha! Luckily, I was seated beside the fabulous Eli, the mommy behind the The Painter’s Wife blog.


If someone knows about make up, si Eli yun! =)
So for a while, nagkaroon kami ng sariling mundo ni Eli =)





She did my eyebrows and eye make up! Professional lang ang peg =)
It was so amazing! I have been copying how she did it ever since! Thank you Eli!
Here are more photos from the event.







That’s Michelle, Jackie, Shen and Patty












We had photo ops after with our fabulous made up face thanks to BYS Cosmetics =)





And finally, I was able to meet Shen of Shen’s Addiction. She’s really a beauty blogger, a nice lady and she knows a lot about make up! =)



Here’s the result of my daytime look =) 


I super like it talaga especially the lipstick. Sad lang kasi I forgot the shade of the lipstick. I’ll go over to BYS to look for it. Ang ganda talaga eh! =)
I went home super happy because finally I know na how to put kilay and we got to take home BYS loots!!! I love it!!!


Thank you BYS for a wonderful afternoon!!!! =)
BYS is available in 26 selected SM and Watson’s outlets in Metro Manila .

Be Sociable, Share!

WoW! instant haul naman Mommy Fleur! inggit ang peg ko. I’m also a no make-up person. Even in my first work, only baby powder and lip gloss lng ako.. wlang ka kulay2x ang mukha ko. unti unti ko nang pinahahalagahan ang mukha ko. I’m using Human nature mineral foundation, sheisido eyebrow pencil (bigay lng!) and lipsticks from loreal and avon. yun lng.. pero if i want to perk up. i put blush on from avon.. when i saw you bring home loots, wahhh ang ganda! inggit talaga ako..Always my support!

I checked out BYS in SM Makati last Saturday kasi nga nakita ko ang mga IG posts nyo. I was surprised that the make-up products are affordable! As in akala ko MAC or Benefit lang ang peg ng price pero no! Lipstick and gloss for less than 300 petot? Blush na less that 30 petot? ayun, shopping galore ako hehe. Looove the curve in your brows, Fleur! Ayan, mukha na silang masaya hihi

The eyebrows really frame the face, and I’m really happy you learned how to draw a perfect brow for you!  Inspiring talaga itong session natin, and ako naging ganado narin to add a few more steps to my super basic barely-there makeup!  Winner ang BYS lipsticks and loose powder din for me!

I tried their blush on (the coral one!) and I love it, Muther! Ang ganda nya and very natural at light lang sa cheeks! Perfect for summer! Ako naman, I learned my make up skills by watching make-up tutorials lang on Youtube before and hilig ko din talaga kaya mas mabilis akong matuto. You can also try watching make-up tutorials on youtube madami kang matutunan, or we can have our own MakeUp 101 sessions with other mommies too, Dew was also asking for it!

i love bys, and bys beauty consultants at the mall. they are all accomodating. they fix your brows for free. they teach you how to apply their different kind of products.
one time, i even ask one beauty consultant if she can do a make over, and she did. and i love it! now, i am a bys user and fan.

Great exfoliant 



                            Such a great product to use after cleansing face, leaving skin extremely smooth and feeling refreshed.

This stuff is the bomb!!



                            My skin has absolutely transformed using this product. It feels baby soft, smooth, and soaks in my toner and moisturiser much better than it used to. Everything just sits better on my face. I simply don't have any dead skin cells clogging everything up!! This is some kind of black magic as I have tried numerous exfoliants in my time and I do not understand how something this gentle can do such a fabulous job!!!

Love this



                            This product has left my skin feeling so smooth. My skin can be quite sensitive but I have had no irritation at all!

Smooth tingly skin!



                            I have used this twice since receiving this last week.  I already love the clean smooth skin it gives me, and the exciting tingles my skin is left with.  Thanks Dermalogica, another superb product to covet and recommend to friends and family. :)

Awesome product!!



                            Brought the travel size to try as I love the daily microfoliant and this is awesome. It makes your skin feel so soft & clean.
My skin has been so much clearer since I started using it also. Totally recommend.

So good!



                            Just like the daily microfoliant this product buffs my skin to silky smooth perfection! I am not so keen on the smell though as to me it smells like mushrooms and I hate mushrooms haha

daily superfoliant



                            OMG I have started using this product recently and I love it.  Makes my skin feel smooth and is so easy to use.  I generally have a sensitive skin and no problems.  I will definitely be getting a bigger bottle next time. :)

Converted



                            I had a facial and received a sample of this product, and absolutely loved it, ordered it the very next day. Makes my skin so smooth and soft! It made me swap my whole skin care range to dermalogica, am in love with these products!

Gentle but effective 



                            I was expecting this to be quite harsh, however the granuals form into a lovely soft paste. Felt very smooth on my skin, and afterwards my skin was glowing.                         


Kristy

Super smooth



                            I was very impressed when I first rubbed the superfoliant on my wet hands as it felt smooth then when applying it to my skin it glided over. I felt my skin feel refreshed with my Dermologica moisturiser. Thank you will definitely use again 
Great addition to my weekly maintenance programme.

Building my skins defences!



                            I've been using this product for a little over a week or two now and it's been awesome!
At first I had a tiny break out of irritation around my chin and it tingled a bit the first few uses, but the more I use it the more my skin seems to be able to handle on a day to day basis which is amazing! 
It's like it's building up my skins tolerance against external irritants!
I've not had a breakout of eczema on my face since using it either which is a major plus, especially seeing as it is quite active! 
Another thing I've noticed is how smooth and clean my face has felt since using it! 
It's a big thumbs up from me for this product!                         


Danielle

It works!



                            Was a bit skeptical to try this at first as I have quite sensitive skin but after getting a face fit at the Dermalogica counter, I was amazed. My skin looked and felt very clean and smooth. It also wasn't irritating at all. Foundation just went on like a dream afterwards.

I use this twice a week and so far so good and haven't had a bad reaction. Would definitely recommend :)

Super powder



                            It's always so exciting to try something new.  This did not disappoint at all.  Was extremely light and easy to wash off.  My skin was super soft and clean :-)                         


Tara

Not what I was expecting



                            I am enjoying this product but it does seem strange to have it in powder form rather than the usual pre-mix.  The good thing is it makes it lighter for when traveling and let's face it, it works.  It definitely leaves my skin feeling smooth and no problems with using it every day.

Loving it!



                            This Superfoliant is just that, super!  Leaves my skin so soft and clean!  Yeah, I'm hooked :-)

Ah-Ma-Zing



                            Daily Superfoliant is super! Does a fantastic job of smoothing and softening my skin. It is more granular than the Daily Microfoliant, but isn't harsh or drying. I'm hooked!

Blew my expectations out of the water 



                            Received a sample to try and this is the first product to ever make me swear out loud while using it....I couldn't believe the way my skin felt after washing it off, was the smoothest it has ever been and felt so clean and refreshed, will definitely end up purchasing.

Exc product 



                            I got a sample, used it next morning and brought the product half an hour later. I have never been able to use this type of product till now. It leaves my skin soft and glowing. Well worth every cent!

Incredible



                            This is like Daily Microfoliant on speed - it feels similar, but wow, my skin felt even smoother afterwards. No dryness, just soft skin. My new favourite product!                        


Janet

Fabulous Product



                            Excellent exfoliant. Leaves my skin feeling very clean and smooth. Love the fact that it is a bit more active than the microfoliant and a bit less than the charcoal masque. Great product!

Gentle on the skin



                            Love the superfoliant!  So gentle on the skin and my skin feels brighter and cleaner afterwards.

Refreshing and revitalising



                            I received a product sample of this product, which I tried and was pleasantly surprised.   It was very refreshing and revitalising, left my skin feeling soft.   Would recommend, definitely on the next shopping list.

Marvelous



                            This product works for me. On moist skin, it does the exfoliation brilliantly and I get touchably smooth skin. Also, I have had lesser breakouts with using it.

Gentle but leaves skin smooth



                            This product is very gentle but leaves skin feeling soft, smooth and ready to take in the benefits of toner and moisturiser.   It has not upset my sensitive skin at all.

Smooth, soft skin



                            A lovely gentle exfoliant that leaves my skin soft and smooth. No irritation or redness after using.  Thanks Dermalogica.

Loved using this as a treat 



                            This is like the charcoal rescue masque but a microfoliant. It's more active than the daily microfoliant. I would use this product but on a less frequent basis, only if I really wanted a good cleanse.                        


Fiona
24/03/17




Would buy again



                            As soon as I've finished the thermal exfoliant am currently using I will order this. Appreciative of the fact that it is much less abrasive but appears to do just as good a job.Rating to date 5 / 5

Good product for some



                            I tried a sample of this product and was impressed. It isn't something I would normally buy, but try it after a long day at work, or maybe in the weekend when you want to have a shower and wash your hair. Cleanse as usual, then when you're in the shower, empty the product into your hand, put water into it to make a paste then rub it all over your face and massage. Talk about feeling totally fresh, polished and clean and getting all the grimes of the week out.

Fantastic product

amazing exfoliant



                            ...it started with the sample, and my skin felt and looked amazing. It felt clean, smooth, and it looked nice and clear and fresh!  I already use the Daily Microfoliant, so was thrilled for an exfoliant in the AGE Smart range. I emailed Dermalogica to ask how I incorporate this with my routine, and I'm all set - it's in my cart - ready to be part of my skincare routine. I love it!

Fabulous addition to daily skincare



                            This is a GREAT product. Having been using daily for 2 weeks and my skin looks fantastic. It has an added radiance allowing me some days to go make up free. Wow!!!

Really impressed



                            I already use the charcoal masque (which I really love) and also the daily microfoliant, so I was wondering if I would see the need for this, but I really loved it! Noticeable difference to the appearance of my skin and felt so soft and smooth afterwards.

                            Love the feel and prefer it for my 48yr old skin to the daily microfoliant.  Will finish my current supply then convert.

Fabulous product



                            I love this! Such a great way to clean and freshen up my skin- a must have!!

Great Product



                            I use this product twice a day and it has really helped my skin. My skin used to feel as though it was rough and now it feels smooth and alive. I would recommend this product for all to use and see the amazing difference it makes along with other Dermalogica products.

Rejuvenating!



                            I love the paste it forms and you can really feel how your skin is being exfoliated and detoxed. The feeling afterwards was like a soft and gentle skin peel, but just without the peel. Really left my skin feeling soft, smooth and rejuvenated!

Amazing Exfoliant



                            Best exfoliant I've ever used! Gives a very deep cleanse leaving skin feeling very new, fresh & smooth! Highly recommend!

A great addition to the Age Smart range



                            It was so easy to use and a little goes a long way, My skin felt soft and looked brighter and not at all irritated. I would definitely buy the regular size and add to my beauty routine. A+++

fantastic



                            got a sample of this and passed onto a friend to try and they have had nothing but positive things to say, results after use look visible straight away, maybe another Dermalogica convert on the way!

Preferred over the daily foliant



                            I ordered the new superfoliant and I love the smell of it and the smooth feeling it leaves is unbeatable, I now prefer it over my daily foliant option.

Great product



                            Was cautious using it for the first time as exfoliates can be very drying on a mature skin. Very pleasantly surprised at the end result. Skin felt smooth and soft. Will definitely use as part of my regime.

Brilliant



                            loved this product, use the daily microfoliant already but definitely will change to this; skin felt amazing

better than daily microfoliant



                            LOVE this new superfoliant, it's better on my skin than the daily microfoliant but not harsh.  It's awesome to use at night before a multivitamin power recovery mask.

Fantastic product



                            I was keen to see how it compares with daily microfoliant which i love.
I found it left my skin feeeling so clean refreshed and smooth.
Would certainly recommend.

SUPER-foliant!



                            I love this product so much, that after I received the free sample, I bought a bottle of it! 
My skin feels so smooth and soft after using it - LOVE IT!!!! 
Recommend it totally!

Love it!



                            What a great product, a huge improvement from the great daily microfoliant (which is also an awesome product). My skin has improved drastically and feels so much smoother and refreshed after only using it for a few days!

Dermalogica - you're the best!



                            This is yet another awesome product from the world's best skin care product brand.  I used the free sample every day while on a short holiday and of course now I am hooked.  It's perfect for ageing skin so go for it - get a large size now and you're never look better!

Love Love Love



                            Wow this product is amazing. I honestly didn't think you could get better than the daily microfoliant but this is so much better. Thank you Dermalogica

Sure is "super"-foliant



                            The results from this we noticeable the next morning, my skin was smoother, my moisturiser just glided on. I have sensitive skin and use daily microfoliant every day, but switching it up and adding this to my weekly routine a few times a week has improved my skin!                        


Melissa

Lovely Product....



                            this made my skin feel smooth but was a bit active for me to use every daily...I've gone down to once a week until my skin gets used to it.  Great to get a travel size microfoliant with it as well...always love to get the freebies :-)

lovely exfoliant!!



                            I got a sample of this in the post a few week ago.  I was a little bit worried about trying it as my skin can be a bit sensitive but it was gentle but also really effective.  My skin felt heaps smoother after using it and the texture of it has really improved over time while using it daily.  Great product!!                        


Nic

another great product



                            what a great surprise receiving this in the mail last week - have tried it and it makes the skin feel so soft and fantastic,  this product seems to be in the middle of the daily microfoliant and the charcoal rescue masque - I am a massive fan of my daily microfoliant and don't know if I would change but absolutely love being given the opportunity to try - thank you Dermalogica

Two Great Activities in the Philippines2016-11-25Beach Vacation!
The Philippines is a tropical country with one of the longest coastlines in Asia at 36,289 kilometres. It has numerous beaches most with fine powdery white sand and clean, clear and cool blue waters.
Be sure to bask in the warm tropical sun and get the perfect tan that will be the envy of your friends back home. Top Philippine beach locations: Boracay Island, Aklan; El Nido, Palawan; Camiguin Island; Pagudpud, Ilocos Norte; Puerto Galera, Mindoro; Nasugbu and Lian in Batangas; Ternate in Cavite.
Scuba Diving
The Philippines is Asia’s Dive Capital. If you are a diving enthusiast— amateur or professional, or someone who is looking for an underwater experience of a lifetime, then you must go to the Philippines if only for the reason that the country has the highest density of coral species in the world. Philippine seas are some of the most bio-diverse and marine-rich waters in the world and home to a diverse species of aquatic resources.
Amateur divers can train and get their licenses at any of the diving training centers located in diving spots Anilao, Puerto Galera and Boracay, and once done with training, they can dive side-by-side with professional divers in the country’s other must-see spots, like wreck diving at Tubbataha Reef or Apo Reef National Park in Mindoro Occidental, the largest atoll-like reef in the Philippines and home to 285 species of fish.
