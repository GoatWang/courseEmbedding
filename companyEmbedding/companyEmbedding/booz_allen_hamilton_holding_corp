    The right people, solving problems with purpose and passion 



Booz Allen created the concept of management consulting more than a century ago. Since then, we've woven that heritage into a range of highly skilled technological capabilities that have had an enduring impact for our clients, our people, and the communities where we live and work.
Our people bring a mix of expertise to solve problems with a different, more effective mindset, devising powerful solutions for our clients’ toughest challenges. We’ve lasted more than 100 years because we’ve stood firm on a foundation of the highest character, and unyielding commitment to the best client service.
We’ve adapted with the needs of the times, building value and opportunity by investing in technology sectors such as data science and analytics, digital solutions, engineering, and cybersecurity. And we're supporting those skills with investments in our culture of innovation, empowering our 22,600 dedicated employees as creative thinkers.
We all share a defining characteristic—a driving passion to solve our clients’ problems and deliver lasting value.

The complaint alleges that defendants during the Class Period made false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Booz Allen engaged in improper accounting practices in its contracts with the U.S. government; (2) consequently, the Company’s revenues derived from services provided to the U.S. government were inflated and unsustainable; (3) discovery of the foregoing conduct would subject the Company to heightened regulatory scrutiny, potential criminal sanctions, and jeopardize its business relationship with the U.S. government; and (4) as a result of the foregoing, Booz Allen’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.  On June 15, 2017, post-market, Booz Allen disclosed that on June 7, 2017, the Company’s subsidiary Booz Allen Hamilton Inc. “was informed that the U.S. Department of Justice is conducting a civil and criminal investigation relating to certain elements of [its] cost accounting and indirect cost charging practices with the U.S. government.” On this news, Booz Allen’s share price fell $7.43, or 18.89%, to close at $31.90 on June 16, 2017. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. A class action lawsuit has already been filed.

History[edit]
Early years[edit]
After graduating from Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois in 1914, Edwin G. Booz developed the business theory that companies would be more successful if they could call on someone outside their own organizations for expert, impartial advice.[7] This theory developed into a new profession — management consulting — and the firm that would bear his name.
According to the company, "In 1940, the firm was hired to help the United States Secretary of the Navy with World War II preparations. Since then, Booz Allen has had a hand in several notable private and public engagements throughout its years, such as advising on the breakup of Ma Bell and helping organize the National Football League in the 1960s."[8]
The firm has gone through several name changes in its 100 years of existence. These include: Edwin G. Booz, Business Engineering Service; Edwin G. Booz Surveys; Edwin G. Booz and Fry Surveys; Booz, Fry, Allen & Hamilton; Booz, Allen & Hamilton; and finally Booz Allen Hamilton.[9]
Organization[edit]
In 1970, Booz Allen first went public with an initial offering of 500,000 shares at $24 per share.[10] However, in 1976 public trading ceased in the largest-ever leveraged buyout involving a consulting firm where Booz Allen's partners bought back the stock, through one of the first management buyouts (MBO), and returned the firm to private ownership with a new governance structure. In 2007 managing director Marc Gerencser said that being privately held allowed the firm to consider long-range investments that companies beholden to shareholders might not be able to make.[11]
New South Wales, Australia[edit]
In 1988, the newly elected Greiner State Government commissioned a report into the State Rail Authority by Booz Allen Hamilton. The resulting report recommended up to 8,000 job losses, including the withdrawal of staff from 94 country railway stations, withdrawing services on the Nyngan- Bourke line, Queanbeyan – Cooma line and Glen Innes- Wallangarra line, the discontinuation of several country passenger services (the Canberra XPT, the Silver City Comet to Broken Hill and various diesel locomotive hauled services) and the removal of sleeper trains from services to Brisbane and Melbourne. The report also recommended the removal of all country passenger services and small freight operations, but the government did not consider this to be politically feasible.[12] The SRA was divided into business units – CityRail, responsible for urban railways; CountryLink, responsible for country passenger services; FreightRail, responsible for freight services; and Rail Estate, responsible for rail property.
Internal Revenue Service[edit]
In 1998, Booz Allen was chosen to help the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) modernize and shed its reputation for dismal customer service. The firm developed a strategy for the IRS to reshuffle its 100,000 employees into units focused on particular taxpayer categories: individuals, charities, businesses and so on. "We made some very dramatic changes in the way the IRS is organized," said CEO Ralph Shrader.[13] (Reports from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) have pointed to mixed results, including poor management of the IRS's IT portfolio and contractors.)[14]
SWIFT[edit]
In 2006 at the request of the Article 29 Working Party (an advisory group to the European Commission) the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Privacy International (PI) investigated the U.S. government's SWIFT surveillance program and Booz Allen's role therein. The ACLU and PI filed a memo at the end of their investigation which called into question the ethics and legality of a government contractor (in this case Booz Allen) acting as auditors of a government program, when that contractor is heavily involved with those same agencies on other contracts. The basic statement was that a conflict of interest may exist. Beyond that, the implication was also made that Booz Allen may be complicit in a program (electronic surveillance of SWIFT) that may be deemed illegal by the European Commission.[15][16]
Homeland Security[edit]
A June 28, 2007 article in The Washington Post related how a United States Department of Homeland Security contract with Booz Allen increased from $2 million to more than $70 million through two no-bid contracts, one occurring after the DHS's legal office had advised DHS not to continue the contract until after a review. A Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on the contract characterized it as not well-planned and lacking any measure for assuring valuable work to be completed.
According to the article,

A review of memos, e-mail and other contracting documents obtained by The Washington Post show that in a rush to meet congressional mandates to establish the information analysis and infrastructure protection offices, agency officials routinely waived rules designed to protect taxpayer money. As the project progressed, the department became so dependent on Booz Allen that it lost the flexibility for a time to seek out other contractors or hire federal employees who might do the job for less.

Elaine C. Duke, the department's chief procurement officer, acknowledged the problems with the Booz Allen contract. But Duke said those matters have been resolved. She defended a decision to issue a second no-bid contract in 2005 as necessary to keep an essential intelligence operation running until a competition could be held.[17]
National Institutes of Health[edit]
In March 2011, The National Institutes of Health reported that Booz Allen Hamilton spent at least $350M of public funds to develop the caBIG "Cancer biomedical Informatics Grid" not including supplemental grants and stimulus recovery funds. The NIH report recommended an immediate moratorium on software contracts and a full audit of budget expenditures. The original goals of the program were to share cancer data between NIH funded study centers. caBIG quickly grew in scope beyond the funded objectives, which the NIH cited as a key cause of failure. Funding levels for caBIG were the largest ever spent for a US biomedical research network. As of May 2012, the caBIG program was retired.
2011 Anonymous hack[edit]
On July 11, 2011[18][19] the group Anonymous, as part of its Operation AntiSec,[20] hacked into Booz Allen servers, extracting e-mails and non-salted passwords from the U.S. military. This information and a complete dump of the database were placed in a file shared on The Pirate Bay.[21] Despite Anonymous' claims that 90,000 emails were released, the Associated Press counted only 67,000 unique emails, of which only 53,000 were military addresses. The remainder of the addresses came from educational institutions and defense contractors.[22] Anonymous also said that it accessed four gigabytes of Booz Allen source code and deleted those four gigabytes. According to a statement by the group, "We infiltrated a server on their network that basically had no security measures in place."[23][24]
Anonymous accused Booz Allen of working with HBGary Federal by creating a project for the manipulation of social media. Anonymous also accused Booz Allen of participating in intelligence-gathering and surveillance programs of the U.S. federal government and, as stated by Kukil Bora of the International Business Times, "possible illegal activities."[20] Booz Allen confirmed the intrusion on 13 July, but contradicted Anonymous' claims in saying that the attack never got past their own systems, meaning that information from the military should be secure.[25] In August of that year, during a conference call with analysts, Ralph Shrader, the chairman and CEO, stated that "the cost of remediation and other activities directly associated with the attack" were not expected to have a "material effect on our financial results."[26]
PRISM media leak[edit]
Main articles: PRISM (surveillance program) and Edward Snowden
In June 2013, Edward Snowden — at the time a Booz Allen employee[27] contracted to projects of the National Security Agency (NSA) — publicly disclosed details of classified mass surveillance and data collection programs, including PRISM. The alleged leaks are said to rank among the most significant breaches in the history of the NSA[28] and led to considerable concern worldwide. Booz Allen condemned Snowden's leak of the existence of PRISM as "shocking" and "a grave violation of the code of conduct and core values of our firm".[29] The company fired Snowden in absentia shortly after and stated he had been an employee for less than three months at the time. Market analysts considered the incident "embarrassing" but unlikely to cause enduring commercial damage.[30] Booz Allen stated that it would work with authorities and clients to investigate the leak. Charles Riley of CNN/Money said that Booz Allen was "scrambling to distance itself from Snowden."[31]
According to Reuters, a source "with detailed knowledge on the matter" stated that Booz Allen's hiring screeners detected possible discrepancies in Snowden's résumé regarding his education, since some details "did not check out precisely", but decided to hire him anyway; Reuters stated that the element which triggered these concerns, or the manner in which Snowden satisfied the concerns, were not known.[32]
On Wednesday July 10, 2013, the United States Air Force stated that it cleared Booz Allen of wrongdoing regarding the Snowden case.[33]
Political contributions[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (June 2013)


In 2013 David Sirota of Salon said that Booz Allen and parent company The Carlyle Group make significant political contributions to the Democratic Party and the Republican Party as well as individual politicians, including Barack Obama and John McCain.[34] According to Maplight, a company that tracked campaign donations, Booz Allen gave a total of just over $87,000 to U.S. lawmakers from 2007 to June 2013.[35] Sirota concluded that "many of the politicians now publicly defending the surveillance state and slamming whistleblowers like Snowden have taken huge sums of money from these two firms", referring to Booz Allen and Carlyle, and that the political parties are "bankrolled by these firms."[34]
Activities in foreign countries[edit]
In June 2012 Booz Allen expanded its operations in North Africa and the Middle East, with initial plans to add operations in Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, United Arab Emirates. It planned to later add operations to Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, during a time when those countries, as stated by Jill R. Aitoro of the Washington Business Journal, were "recover[ing] from the turmoil associated with the Arab Spring."[36] The Booz Allen employee base, when it was a part of Booz & Company, had long-term relationships with many North African and Middle Eastern countries; Booz Allen had split from Booz & Company[36] David Sirota of Salon said that politicians in the United States who received financing from Booz Allen and "other firms with a similar multinational business model" have vested interests in "denigrating the democratic protest movements that challenge Mideast surveillance states that make those donors big money, too."[34]
Booz Allen helped the Government of the United Arab Emirates create an equivalent of the National Security Agency for that country. According to David E. Sanger and Nicole Perlroth of The New York Times, "one Arab official familiar with the effort" said that "They are teaching everything. Data mining, Web surveillance, all sorts of digital intelligence collection."[37] In 2013 Sanger and Perlroth said that the company "profits handsomely from its worldwide expansion".[37]
Employee demographics[edit]
In 2013 Booz Allen had 25,000 employees, of which half carried top secret security clearances.[37] In 2014, Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation was awarded a "Top 2014 Workplace" by the Washington Post in their annual feature.[38]

History[edit]
Early years[edit]
After graduating from Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois in 1914, Edwin G. Booz developed the business theory that companies would be more successful if they could call on someone outside their own organizations for expert, impartial advice.[7] This theory developed into a new profession — management consulting — and the firm that would bear his name.
According to the company, "In 1940, the firm was hired to help the United States Secretary of the Navy with World War II preparations. Since then, Booz Allen has had a hand in several notable private and public engagements throughout its years, such as advising on the breakup of Ma Bell and helping organize the National Football League in the 1960s."[8]
The firm has gone through several name changes in its 100 years of existence. These include: Edwin G. Booz, Business Engineering Service; Edwin G. Booz Surveys; Edwin G. Booz and Fry Surveys; Booz, Fry, Allen & Hamilton; Booz, Allen & Hamilton; and finally Booz Allen Hamilton.[9]
Organization[edit]
In 1970, Booz Allen first went public with an initial offering of 500,000 shares at $24 per share.[10] However, in 1976 public trading ceased in the largest-ever leveraged buyout involving a consulting firm where Booz Allen's partners bought back the stock, through one of the first management buyouts (MBO), and returned the firm to private ownership with a new governance structure. In 2007 managing director Marc Gerencser said that being privately held allowed the firm to consider long-range investments that companies beholden to shareholders might not be able to make.[11]
New South Wales, Australia[edit]
In 1988, the newly elected Greiner State Government commissioned a report into the State Rail Authority by Booz Allen Hamilton. The resulting report recommended up to 8,000 job losses, including the withdrawal of staff from 94 country railway stations, withdrawing services on the Nyngan- Bourke line, Queanbeyan – Cooma line and Glen Innes- Wallangarra line, the discontinuation of several country passenger services (the Canberra XPT, the Silver City Comet to Broken Hill and various diesel locomotive hauled services) and the removal of sleeper trains from services to Brisbane and Melbourne. The report also recommended the removal of all country passenger services and small freight operations, but the government did not consider this to be politically feasible.[12] The SRA was divided into business units – CityRail, responsible for urban railways; CountryLink, responsible for country passenger services; FreightRail, responsible for freight services; and Rail Estate, responsible for rail property.
Internal Revenue Service[edit]
In 1998, Booz Allen was chosen to help the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) modernize and shed its reputation for dismal customer service. The firm developed a strategy for the IRS to reshuffle its 100,000 employees into units focused on particular taxpayer categories: individuals, charities, businesses and so on. "We made some very dramatic changes in the way the IRS is organized," said CEO Ralph Shrader.[13] (Reports from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) have pointed to mixed results, including poor management of the IRS's IT portfolio and contractors.)[14]
SWIFT[edit]
In 2006 at the request of the Article 29 Working Party (an advisory group to the European Commission) the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Privacy International (PI) investigated the U.S. government's SWIFT surveillance program and Booz Allen's role therein. The ACLU and PI filed a memo at the end of their investigation which called into question the ethics and legality of a government contractor (in this case Booz Allen) acting as auditors of a government program, when that contractor is heavily involved with those same agencies on other contracts. The basic statement was that a conflict of interest may exist. Beyond that, the implication was also made that Booz Allen may be complicit in a program (electronic surveillance of SWIFT) that may be deemed illegal by the European Commission.[15][16]
Homeland Security[edit]
A June 28, 2007 article in The Washington Post related how a United States Department of Homeland Security contract with Booz Allen increased from $2 million to more than $70 million through two no-bid contracts, one occurring after the DHS's legal office had advised DHS not to continue the contract until after a review. A Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on the contract characterized it as not well-planned and lacking any measure for assuring valuable work to be completed.
According to the article,

A review of memos, e-mail and other contracting documents obtained by The Washington Post show that in a rush to meet congressional mandates to establish the information analysis and infrastructure protection offices, agency officials routinely waived rules designed to protect taxpayer money. As the project progressed, the department became so dependent on Booz Allen that it lost the flexibility for a time to seek out other contractors or hire federal employees who might do the job for less.

Elaine C. Duke, the department's chief procurement officer, acknowledged the problems with the Booz Allen contract. But Duke said those matters have been resolved. She defended a decision to issue a second no-bid contract in 2005 as necessary to keep an essential intelligence operation running until a competition could be held.[17]
National Institutes of Health[edit]
In March 2011, The National Institutes of Health reported that Booz Allen Hamilton spent at least $350M of public funds to develop the caBIG "Cancer biomedical Informatics Grid" not including supplemental grants and stimulus recovery funds. The NIH report recommended an immediate moratorium on software contracts and a full audit of budget expenditures. The original goals of the program were to share cancer data between NIH funded study centers. caBIG quickly grew in scope beyond the funded objectives, which the NIH cited as a key cause of failure. Funding levels for caBIG were the largest ever spent for a US biomedical research network. As of May 2012, the caBIG program was retired.
2011 Anonymous hack[edit]
On July 11, 2011[18][19] the group Anonymous, as part of its Operation AntiSec,[20] hacked into Booz Allen servers, extracting e-mails and non-salted passwords from the U.S. military. This information and a complete dump of the database were placed in a file shared on The Pirate Bay.[21] Despite Anonymous' claims that 90,000 emails were released, the Associated Press counted only 67,000 unique emails, of which only 53,000 were military addresses. The remainder of the addresses came from educational institutions and defense contractors.[22] Anonymous also said that it accessed four gigabytes of Booz Allen source code and deleted those four gigabytes. According to a statement by the group, "We infiltrated a server on their network that basically had no security measures in place."[23][24]
Anonymous accused Booz Allen of working with HBGary Federal by creating a project for the manipulation of social media. Anonymous also accused Booz Allen of participating in intelligence-gathering and surveillance programs of the U.S. federal government and, as stated by Kukil Bora of the International Business Times, "possible illegal activities."[20] Booz Allen confirmed the intrusion on 13 July, but contradicted Anonymous' claims in saying that the attack never got past their own systems, meaning that information from the military should be secure.[25] In August of that year, during a conference call with analysts, Ralph Shrader, the chairman and CEO, stated that "the cost of remediation and other activities directly associated with the attack" were not expected to have a "material effect on our financial results."[26]
PRISM media leak[edit]
Main articles: PRISM (surveillance program) and Edward Snowden
In June 2013, Edward Snowden — at the time a Booz Allen employee[27] contracted to projects of the National Security Agency (NSA) — publicly disclosed details of classified mass surveillance and data collection programs, including PRISM. The alleged leaks are said to rank among the most significant breaches in the history of the NSA[28] and led to considerable concern worldwide. Booz Allen condemned Snowden's leak of the existence of PRISM as "shocking" and "a grave violation of the code of conduct and core values of our firm".[29] The company fired Snowden in absentia shortly after and stated he had been an employee for less than three months at the time. Market analysts considered the incident "embarrassing" but unlikely to cause enduring commercial damage.[30] Booz Allen stated that it would work with authorities and clients to investigate the leak. Charles Riley of CNN/Money said that Booz Allen was "scrambling to distance itself from Snowden."[31]
According to Reuters, a source "with detailed knowledge on the matter" stated that Booz Allen's hiring screeners detected possible discrepancies in Snowden's résumé regarding his education, since some details "did not check out precisely", but decided to hire him anyway; Reuters stated that the element which triggered these concerns, or the manner in which Snowden satisfied the concerns, were not known.[32]
On Wednesday July 10, 2013, the United States Air Force stated that it cleared Booz Allen of wrongdoing regarding the Snowden case.[33]
Political contributions[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (June 2013)


In 2013 David Sirota of Salon said that Booz Allen and parent company The Carlyle Group make significant political contributions to the Democratic Party and the Republican Party as well as individual politicians, including Barack Obama and John McCain.[34] According to Maplight, a company that tracked campaign donations, Booz Allen gave a total of just over $87,000 to U.S. lawmakers from 2007 to June 2013.[35] Sirota concluded that "many of the politicians now publicly defending the surveillance state and slamming whistleblowers like Snowden have taken huge sums of money from these two firms", referring to Booz Allen and Carlyle, and that the political parties are "bankrolled by these firms."[34]
Activities in foreign countries[edit]
In June 2012 Booz Allen expanded its operations in North Africa and the Middle East, with initial plans to add operations in Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, United Arab Emirates. It planned to later add operations to Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, during a time when those countries, as stated by Jill R. Aitoro of the Washington Business Journal, were "recover[ing] from the turmoil associated with the Arab Spring."[36] The Booz Allen employee base, when it was a part of Booz & Company, had long-term relationships with many North African and Middle Eastern countries; Booz Allen had split from Booz & Company[36] David Sirota of Salon said that politicians in the United States who received financing from Booz Allen and "other firms with a similar multinational business model" have vested interests in "denigrating the democratic protest movements that challenge Mideast surveillance states that make those donors big money, too."[34]
Booz Allen helped the Government of the United Arab Emirates create an equivalent of the National Security Agency for that country. According to David E. Sanger and Nicole Perlroth of The New York Times, "one Arab official familiar with the effort" said that "They are teaching everything. Data mining, Web surveillance, all sorts of digital intelligence collection."[37] In 2013 Sanger and Perlroth said that the company "profits handsomely from its worldwide expansion".[37]
Employee demographics[edit]
In 2013 Booz Allen had 25,000 employees, of which half carried top secret security clearances.[37] In 2014, Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation was awarded a "Top 2014 Workplace" by the Washington Post in their annual feature.[38]

History[edit]
Early years[edit]
After graduating from Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois in 1914, Edwin G. Booz developed the business theory that companies would be more successful if they could call on someone outside their own organizations for expert, impartial advice.[7] This theory developed into a new profession — management consulting — and the firm that would bear his name.
According to the company, "In 1940, the firm was hired to help the United States Secretary of the Navy with World War II preparations. Since then, Booz Allen has had a hand in several notable private and public engagements throughout its years, such as advising on the breakup of Ma Bell and helping organize the National Football League in the 1960s."[8]
The firm has gone through several name changes in its 100 years of existence. These include: Edwin G. Booz, Business Engineering Service; Edwin G. Booz Surveys; Edwin G. Booz and Fry Surveys; Booz, Fry, Allen & Hamilton; Booz, Allen & Hamilton; and finally Booz Allen Hamilton.[9]
Organization[edit]
In 1970, Booz Allen first went public with an initial offering of 500,000 shares at $24 per share.[10] However, in 1976 public trading ceased in the largest-ever leveraged buyout involving a consulting firm where Booz Allen's partners bought back the stock, through one of the first management buyouts (MBO), and returned the firm to private ownership with a new governance structure. In 2007 managing director Marc Gerencser said that being privately held allowed the firm to consider long-range investments that companies beholden to shareholders might not be able to make.[11]
New South Wales, Australia[edit]
In 1988, the newly elected Greiner State Government commissioned a report into the State Rail Authority by Booz Allen Hamilton. The resulting report recommended up to 8,000 job losses, including the withdrawal of staff from 94 country railway stations, withdrawing services on the Nyngan- Bourke line, Queanbeyan – Cooma line and Glen Innes- Wallangarra line, the discontinuation of several country passenger services (the Canberra XPT, the Silver City Comet to Broken Hill and various diesel locomotive hauled services) and the removal of sleeper trains from services to Brisbane and Melbourne. The report also recommended the removal of all country passenger services and small freight operations, but the government did not consider this to be politically feasible.[12] The SRA was divided into business units – CityRail, responsible for urban railways; CountryLink, responsible for country passenger services; FreightRail, responsible for freight services; and Rail Estate, responsible for rail property.
Internal Revenue Service[edit]
In 1998, Booz Allen was chosen to help the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) modernize and shed its reputation for dismal customer service. The firm developed a strategy for the IRS to reshuffle its 100,000 employees into units focused on particular taxpayer categories: individuals, charities, businesses and so on. "We made some very dramatic changes in the way the IRS is organized," said CEO Ralph Shrader.[13] (Reports from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) have pointed to mixed results, including poor management of the IRS's IT portfolio and contractors.)[14]
SWIFT[edit]
In 2006 at the request of the Article 29 Working Party (an advisory group to the European Commission) the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Privacy International (PI) investigated the U.S. government's SWIFT surveillance program and Booz Allen's role therein. The ACLU and PI filed a memo at the end of their investigation which called into question the ethics and legality of a government contractor (in this case Booz Allen) acting as auditors of a government program, when that contractor is heavily involved with those same agencies on other contracts. The basic statement was that a conflict of interest may exist. Beyond that, the implication was also made that Booz Allen may be complicit in a program (electronic surveillance of SWIFT) that may be deemed illegal by the European Commission.[15][16]
Homeland Security[edit]
A June 28, 2007 article in The Washington Post related how a United States Department of Homeland Security contract with Booz Allen increased from $2 million to more than $70 million through two no-bid contracts, one occurring after the DHS's legal office had advised DHS not to continue the contract until after a review. A Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on the contract characterized it as not well-planned and lacking any measure for assuring valuable work to be completed.
According to the article,

A review of memos, e-mail and other contracting documents obtained by The Washington Post show that in a rush to meet congressional mandates to establish the information analysis and infrastructure protection offices, agency officials routinely waived rules designed to protect taxpayer money. As the project progressed, the department became so dependent on Booz Allen that it lost the flexibility for a time to seek out other contractors or hire federal employees who might do the job for less.

Elaine C. Duke, the department's chief procurement officer, acknowledged the problems with the Booz Allen contract. But Duke said those matters have been resolved. She defended a decision to issue a second no-bid contract in 2005 as necessary to keep an essential intelligence operation running until a competition could be held.[17]
National Institutes of Health[edit]
In March 2011, The National Institutes of Health reported that Booz Allen Hamilton spent at least $350M of public funds to develop the caBIG "Cancer biomedical Informatics Grid" not including supplemental grants and stimulus recovery funds. The NIH report recommended an immediate moratorium on software contracts and a full audit of budget expenditures. The original goals of the program were to share cancer data between NIH funded study centers. caBIG quickly grew in scope beyond the funded objectives, which the NIH cited as a key cause of failure. Funding levels for caBIG were the largest ever spent for a US biomedical research network. As of May 2012, the caBIG program was retired.
2011 Anonymous hack[edit]
On July 11, 2011[18][19] the group Anonymous, as part of its Operation AntiSec,[20] hacked into Booz Allen servers, extracting e-mails and non-salted passwords from the U.S. military. This information and a complete dump of the database were placed in a file shared on The Pirate Bay.[21] Despite Anonymous' claims that 90,000 emails were released, the Associated Press counted only 67,000 unique emails, of which only 53,000 were military addresses. The remainder of the addresses came from educational institutions and defense contractors.[22] Anonymous also said that it accessed four gigabytes of Booz Allen source code and deleted those four gigabytes. According to a statement by the group, "We infiltrated a server on their network that basically had no security measures in place."[23][24]
Anonymous accused Booz Allen of working with HBGary Federal by creating a project for the manipulation of social media. Anonymous also accused Booz Allen of participating in intelligence-gathering and surveillance programs of the U.S. federal government and, as stated by Kukil Bora of the International Business Times, "possible illegal activities."[20] Booz Allen confirmed the intrusion on 13 July, but contradicted Anonymous' claims in saying that the attack never got past their own systems, meaning that information from the military should be secure.[25] In August of that year, during a conference call with analysts, Ralph Shrader, the chairman and CEO, stated that "the cost of remediation and other activities directly associated with the attack" were not expected to have a "material effect on our financial results."[26]
PRISM media leak[edit]
Main articles: PRISM (surveillance program) and Edward Snowden
In June 2013, Edward Snowden — at the time a Booz Allen employee[27] contracted to projects of the National Security Agency (NSA) — publicly disclosed details of classified mass surveillance and data collection programs, including PRISM. The alleged leaks are said to rank among the most significant breaches in the history of the NSA[28] and led to considerable concern worldwide. Booz Allen condemned Snowden's leak of the existence of PRISM as "shocking" and "a grave violation of the code of conduct and core values of our firm".[29] The company fired Snowden in absentia shortly after and stated he had been an employee for less than three months at the time. Market analysts considered the incident "embarrassing" but unlikely to cause enduring commercial damage.[30] Booz Allen stated that it would work with authorities and clients to investigate the leak. Charles Riley of CNN/Money said that Booz Allen was "scrambling to distance itself from Snowden."[31]
According to Reuters, a source "with detailed knowledge on the matter" stated that Booz Allen's hiring screeners detected possible discrepancies in Snowden's résumé regarding his education, since some details "did not check out precisely", but decided to hire him anyway; Reuters stated that the element which triggered these concerns, or the manner in which Snowden satisfied the concerns, were not known.[32]
On Wednesday July 10, 2013, the United States Air Force stated that it cleared Booz Allen of wrongdoing regarding the Snowden case.[33]
Political contributions[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (June 2013)


In 2013 David Sirota of Salon said that Booz Allen and parent company The Carlyle Group make significant political contributions to the Democratic Party and the Republican Party as well as individual politicians, including Barack Obama and John McCain.[34] According to Maplight, a company that tracked campaign donations, Booz Allen gave a total of just over $87,000 to U.S. lawmakers from 2007 to June 2013.[35] Sirota concluded that "many of the politicians now publicly defending the surveillance state and slamming whistleblowers like Snowden have taken huge sums of money from these two firms", referring to Booz Allen and Carlyle, and that the political parties are "bankrolled by these firms."[34]
Activities in foreign countries[edit]
In June 2012 Booz Allen expanded its operations in North Africa and the Middle East, with initial plans to add operations in Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, United Arab Emirates. It planned to later add operations to Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, during a time when those countries, as stated by Jill R. Aitoro of the Washington Business Journal, were "recover[ing] from the turmoil associated with the Arab Spring."[36] The Booz Allen employee base, when it was a part of Booz & Company, had long-term relationships with many North African and Middle Eastern countries; Booz Allen had split from Booz & Company[36] David Sirota of Salon said that politicians in the United States who received financing from Booz Allen and "other firms with a similar multinational business model" have vested interests in "denigrating the democratic protest movements that challenge Mideast surveillance states that make those donors big money, too."[34]
Booz Allen helped the Government of the United Arab Emirates create an equivalent of the National Security Agency for that country. According to David E. Sanger and Nicole Perlroth of The New York Times, "one Arab official familiar with the effort" said that "They are teaching everything. Data mining, Web surveillance, all sorts of digital intelligence collection."[37] In 2013 Sanger and Perlroth said that the company "profits handsomely from its worldwide expansion".[37]
Employee demographics[edit]
In 2013 Booz Allen had 25,000 employees, of which half carried top secret security clearances.[37] In 2014, Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation was awarded a "Top 2014 Workplace" by the Washington Post in their annual feature.[38]

History[edit]
Early years[edit]
After graduating from Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois in 1914, Edwin G. Booz developed the business theory that companies would be more successful if they could call on someone outside their own organizations for expert, impartial advice.[7] This theory developed into a new profession — management consulting — and the firm that would bear his name.
According to the company, "In 1940, the firm was hired to help the United States Secretary of the Navy with World War II preparations. Since then, Booz Allen has had a hand in several notable private and public engagements throughout its years, such as advising on the breakup of Ma Bell and helping organize the National Football League in the 1960s."[8]
The firm has gone through several name changes in its 100 years of existence. These include: Edwin G. Booz, Business Engineering Service; Edwin G. Booz Surveys; Edwin G. Booz and Fry Surveys; Booz, Fry, Allen & Hamilton; Booz, Allen & Hamilton; and finally Booz Allen Hamilton.[9]

In 1970, Booz Allen first went public with an initial offering of 500,000 shares at $24 per share.[10] However, in 1976 public trading ceased in the largest-ever leveraged buyout involving a consulting firm where Booz Allen's partners bought back the stock, through one of the first management buyouts (MBO), and returned the firm to private ownership with a new governance structure. In 2007 managing director Marc Gerencser said that being privately held allowed the firm to consider long-range investments that companies beholden to shareholders might not be able to make.[11]
New South Wales, Australia[edit]
In 1988, the newly elected Greiner State Government commissioned a report into the State Rail Authority by Booz Allen Hamilton. The resulting report recommended up to 8,000 job losses, including the withdrawal of staff from 94 country railway stations, withdrawing services on the Nyngan- Bourke line, Queanbeyan – Cooma line and Glen Innes- Wallangarra line, the discontinuation of several country passenger services (the Canberra XPT, the Silver City Comet to Broken Hill and various diesel locomotive hauled services) and the removal of sleeper trains from services to Brisbane and Melbourne. The report also recommended the removal of all country passenger services and small freight operations, but the government did not consider this to be politically feasible.[12] The SRA was divided into business units – CityRail, responsible for urban railways; CountryLink, responsible for country passenger services; FreightRail, responsible for freight services; and Rail Estate, responsible for rail property.
Internal Revenue Service[edit]
In 1998, Booz Allen was chosen to help the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) modernize and shed its reputation for dismal customer service. The firm developed a strategy for the IRS to reshuffle its 100,000 employees into units focused on particular taxpayer categories: individuals, charities, businesses and so on. "We made some very dramatic changes in the way the IRS is organized," said CEO Ralph Shrader.[13] (Reports from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) have pointed to mixed results, including poor management of the IRS's IT portfolio and contractors.)[14]
SWIFT[edit]
In 2006 at the request of the Article 29 Working Party (an advisory group to the European Commission) the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Privacy International (PI) investigated the U.S. government's SWIFT surveillance program and Booz Allen's role therein. The ACLU and PI filed a memo at the end of their investigation which called into question the ethics and legality of a government contractor (in this case Booz Allen) acting as auditors of a government program, when that contractor is heavily involved with those same agencies on other contracts. The basic statement was that a conflict of interest may exist. Beyond that, the implication was also made that Booz Allen may be complicit in a program (electronic surveillance of SWIFT) that may be deemed illegal by the European Commission.[15][16]
Homeland Security[edit]
A June 28, 2007 article in The Washington Post related how a United States Department of Homeland Security contract with Booz Allen increased from $2 million to more than $70 million through two no-bid contracts, one occurring after the DHS's legal office had advised DHS not to continue the contract until after a review. A Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on the contract characterized it as not well-planned and lacking any measure for assuring valuable work to be completed.
According to the article,

A review of memos, e-mail and other contracting documents obtained by The Washington Post show that in a rush to meet congressional mandates to establish the information analysis and infrastructure protection offices, agency officials routinely waived rules designed to protect taxpayer money. As the project progressed, the department became so dependent on Booz Allen that it lost the flexibility for a time to seek out other contractors or hire federal employees who might do the job for less.

Elaine C. Duke, the department's chief procurement officer, acknowledged the problems with the Booz Allen contract. But Duke said those matters have been resolved. She defended a decision to issue a second no-bid contract in 2005 as necessary to keep an essential intelligence operation running until a competition could be held.[17]
National Institutes of Health[edit]
In March 2011, The National Institutes of Health reported that Booz Allen Hamilton spent at least $350M of public funds to develop the caBIG "Cancer biomedical Informatics Grid" not including supplemental grants and stimulus recovery funds. The NIH report recommended an immediate moratorium on software contracts and a full audit of budget expenditures. The original goals of the program were to share cancer data between NIH funded study centers. caBIG quickly grew in scope beyond the funded objectives, which the NIH cited as a key cause of failure. Funding levels for caBIG were the largest ever spent for a US biomedical research network. As of May 2012, the caBIG program was retired.
2011 Anonymous hack[edit]
On July 11, 2011[18][19] the group Anonymous, as part of its Operation AntiSec,[20] hacked into Booz Allen servers, extracting e-mails and non-salted passwords from the U.S. military. This information and a complete dump of the database were placed in a file shared on The Pirate Bay.[21] Despite Anonymous' claims that 90,000 emails were released, the Associated Press counted only 67,000 unique emails, of which only 53,000 were military addresses. The remainder of the addresses came from educational institutions and defense contractors.[22] Anonymous also said that it accessed four gigabytes of Booz Allen source code and deleted those four gigabytes. According to a statement by the group, "We infiltrated a server on their network that basically had no security measures in place."[23][24]
Anonymous accused Booz Allen of working with HBGary Federal by creating a project for the manipulation of social media. Anonymous also accused Booz Allen of participating in intelligence-gathering and surveillance programs of the U.S. federal government and, as stated by Kukil Bora of the International Business Times, "possible illegal activities."[20] Booz Allen confirmed the intrusion on 13 July, but contradicted Anonymous' claims in saying that the attack never got past their own systems, meaning that information from the military should be secure.[25] In August of that year, during a conference call with analysts, Ralph Shrader, the chairman and CEO, stated that "the cost of remediation and other activities directly associated with the attack" were not expected to have a "material effect on our financial results."[26]
PRISM media leak[edit]
Main articles: PRISM (surveillance program) and Edward Snowden
In June 2013, Edward Snowden — at the time a Booz Allen employee[27] contracted to projects of the National Security Agency (NSA) — publicly disclosed details of classified mass surveillance and data collection programs, including PRISM. The alleged leaks are said to rank among the most significant breaches in the history of the NSA[28] and led to considerable concern worldwide. Booz Allen condemned Snowden's leak of the existence of PRISM as "shocking" and "a grave violation of the code of conduct and core values of our firm".[29] The company fired Snowden in absentia shortly after and stated he had been an employee for less than three months at the time. Market analysts considered the incident "embarrassing" but unlikely to cause enduring commercial damage.[30] Booz Allen stated that it would work with authorities and clients to investigate the leak. Charles Riley of CNN/Money said that Booz Allen was "scrambling to distance itself from Snowden."[31]
According to Reuters, a source "with detailed knowledge on the matter" stated that Booz Allen's hiring screeners detected possible discrepancies in Snowden's résumé regarding his education, since some details "did not check out precisely", but decided to hire him anyway; Reuters stated that the element which triggered these concerns, or the manner in which Snowden satisfied the concerns, were not known.[32]
On Wednesday July 10, 2013, the United States Air Force stated that it cleared Booz Allen of wrongdoing regarding the Snowden case.[33]
Political contributions[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (June 2013)


In 2013 David Sirota of Salon said that Booz Allen and parent company The Carlyle Group make significant political contributions to the Democratic Party and the Republican Party as well as individual politicians, including Barack Obama and John McCain.[34] According to Maplight, a company that tracked campaign donations, Booz Allen gave a total of just over $87,000 to U.S. lawmakers from 2007 to June 2013.[35] Sirota concluded that "many of the politicians now publicly defending the surveillance state and slamming whistleblowers like Snowden have taken huge sums of money from these two firms", referring to Booz Allen and Carlyle, and that the political parties are "bankrolled by these firms."[34]
Activities in foreign countries[edit]
In June 2012 Booz Allen expanded its operations in North Africa and the Middle East, with initial plans to add operations in Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, United Arab Emirates. It planned to later add operations to Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, during a time when those countries, as stated by Jill R. Aitoro of the Washington Business Journal, were "recover[ing] from the turmoil associated with the Arab Spring."[36] The Booz Allen employee base, when it was a part of Booz & Company, had long-term relationships with many North African and Middle Eastern countries; Booz Allen had split from Booz & Company[36] David Sirota of Salon said that politicians in the United States who received financing from Booz Allen and "other firms with a similar multinational business model" have vested interests in "denigrating the democratic protest movements that challenge Mideast surveillance states that make those donors big money, too."[34]
Booz Allen helped the Government of the United Arab Emirates create an equivalent of the National Security Agency for that country. According to David E. Sanger and Nicole Perlroth of The New York Times, "one Arab official familiar with the effort" said that "They are teaching everything. Data mining, Web surveillance, all sorts of digital intelligence collection."[37] In 2013 Sanger and Perlroth said that the company "profits handsomely from its worldwide expansion".[37]
Employee demographics[edit]
In 2013 Booz Allen had 25,000 employees, of which half carried top secret security clearances.[37] In 2014, Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation was awarded a "Top 2014 Workplace" by the Washington Post in their annual feature.[38]

History[edit]
Early years[edit]
After graduating from Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois in 1914, Edwin G. Booz developed the business theory that companies would be more successful if they could call on someone outside their own organizations for expert, impartial advice.[7] This theory developed into a new profession — management consulting — and the firm that would bear his name.
According to the company, "In 1940, the firm was hired to help the United States Secretary of the Navy with World War II preparations. Since then, Booz Allen has had a hand in several notable private and public engagements throughout its years, such as advising on the breakup of Ma Bell and helping organize the National Football League in the 1960s."[8]
The firm has gone through several name changes in its 100 years of existence. These include: Edwin G. Booz, Business Engineering Service; Edwin G. Booz Surveys; Edwin G. Booz and Fry Surveys; Booz, Fry, Allen & Hamilton; Booz, Allen & Hamilton; and finally Booz Allen Hamilton.[9]
Organization[edit]
In 1970, Booz Allen first went public with an initial offering of 500,000 shares at $24 per share.[10] However, in 1976 public trading ceased in the largest-ever leveraged buyout involving a consulting firm where Booz Allen's partners bought back the stock, through one of the first management buyouts (MBO), and returned the firm to private ownership with a new governance structure. In 2007 managing director Marc Gerencser said that being privately held allowed the firm to consider long-range investments that companies beholden to shareholders might not be able to make.[11]
New South Wales, Australia[edit]
In 1988, the newly elected Greiner State Government commissioned a report into the State Rail Authority by Booz Allen Hamilton. The resulting report recommended up to 8,000 job losses, including the withdrawal of staff from 94 country railway stations, withdrawing services on the Nyngan- Bourke line, Queanbeyan – Cooma line and Glen Innes- Wallangarra line, the discontinuation of several country passenger services (the Canberra XPT, the Silver City Comet to Broken Hill and various diesel locomotive hauled services) and the removal of sleeper trains from services to Brisbane and Melbourne. The report also recommended the removal of all country passenger services and small freight operations, but the government did not consider this to be politically feasible.[12] The SRA was divided into business units – CityRail, responsible for urban railways; CountryLink, responsible for country passenger services; FreightRail, responsible for freight services; and Rail Estate, responsible for rail property.
Internal Revenue Service[edit]
In 1998, Booz Allen was chosen to help the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) modernize and shed its reputation for dismal customer service. The firm developed a strategy for the IRS to reshuffle its 100,000 employees into units focused on particular taxpayer categories: individuals, charities, businesses and so on. "We made some very dramatic changes in the way the IRS is organized," said CEO Ralph Shrader.[13] (Reports from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) have pointed to mixed results, including poor management of the IRS's IT portfolio and contractors.)[14]
SWIFT[edit]
In 2006 at the request of the Article 29 Working Party (an advisory group to the European Commission) the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Privacy International (PI) investigated the U.S. government's SWIFT surveillance program and Booz Allen's role therein. The ACLU and PI filed a memo at the end of their investigation which called into question the ethics and legality of a government contractor (in this case Booz Allen) acting as auditors of a government program, when that contractor is heavily involved with those same agencies on other contracts. The basic statement was that a conflict of interest may exist. Beyond that, the implication was also made that Booz Allen may be complicit in a program (electronic surveillance of SWIFT) that may be deemed illegal by the European Commission.[15][16]
Homeland Security[edit]
A June 28, 2007 article in The Washington Post related how a United States Department of Homeland Security contract with Booz Allen increased from $2 million to more than $70 million through two no-bid contracts, one occurring after the DHS's legal office had advised DHS not to continue the contract until after a review. A Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on the contract characterized it as not well-planned and lacking any measure for assuring valuable work to be completed.
According to the article,

A review of memos, e-mail and other contracting documents obtained by The Washington Post show that in a rush to meet congressional mandates to establish the information analysis and infrastructure protection offices, agency officials routinely waived rules designed to protect taxpayer money. As the project progressed, the department became so dependent on Booz Allen that it lost the flexibility for a time to seek out other contractors or hire federal employees who might do the job for less.

Elaine C. Duke, the department's chief procurement officer, acknowledged the problems with the Booz Allen contract. But Duke said those matters have been resolved. She defended a decision to issue a second no-bid contract in 2005 as necessary to keep an essential intelligence operation running until a competition could be held.[17]
National Institutes of Health[edit]
In March 2011, The National Institutes of Health reported that Booz Allen Hamilton spent at least $350M of public funds to develop the caBIG "Cancer biomedical Informatics Grid" not including supplemental grants and stimulus recovery funds. The NIH report recommended an immediate moratorium on software contracts and a full audit of budget expenditures. The original goals of the program were to share cancer data between NIH funded study centers. caBIG quickly grew in scope beyond the funded objectives, which the NIH cited as a key cause of failure. Funding levels for caBIG were the largest ever spent for a US biomedical research network. As of May 2012, the caBIG program was retired.
2011 Anonymous hack[edit]
On July 11, 2011[18][19] the group Anonymous, as part of its Operation AntiSec,[20] hacked into Booz Allen servers, extracting e-mails and non-salted passwords from the U.S. military. This information and a complete dump of the database were placed in a file shared on The Pirate Bay.[21] Despite Anonymous' claims that 90,000 emails were released, the Associated Press counted only 67,000 unique emails, of which only 53,000 were military addresses. The remainder of the addresses came from educational institutions and defense contractors.[22] Anonymous also said that it accessed four gigabytes of Booz Allen source code and deleted those four gigabytes. According to a statement by the group, "We infiltrated a server on their network that basically had no security measures in place."[23][24]
Anonymous accused Booz Allen of working with HBGary Federal by creating a project for the manipulation of social media. Anonymous also accused Booz Allen of participating in intelligence-gathering and surveillance programs of the U.S. federal government and, as stated by Kukil Bora of the International Business Times, "possible illegal activities."[20] Booz Allen confirmed the intrusion on 13 July, but contradicted Anonymous' claims in saying that the attack never got past their own systems, meaning that information from the military should be secure.[25] In August of that year, during a conference call with analysts, Ralph Shrader, the chairman and CEO, stated that "the cost of remediation and other activities directly associated with the attack" were not expected to have a "material effect on our financial results."[26]
PRISM media leak[edit]
Main articles: PRISM (surveillance program) and Edward Snowden
In June 2013, Edward Snowden — at the time a Booz Allen employee[27] contracted to projects of the National Security Agency (NSA) — publicly disclosed details of classified mass surveillance and data collection programs, including PRISM. The alleged leaks are said to rank among the most significant breaches in the history of the NSA[28] and led to considerable concern worldwide. Booz Allen condemned Snowden's leak of the existence of PRISM as "shocking" and "a grave violation of the code of conduct and core values of our firm".[29] The company fired Snowden in absentia shortly after and stated he had been an employee for less than three months at the time. Market analysts considered the incident "embarrassing" but unlikely to cause enduring commercial damage.[30] Booz Allen stated that it would work with authorities and clients to investigate the leak. Charles Riley of CNN/Money said that Booz Allen was "scrambling to distance itself from Snowden."[31]
According to Reuters, a source "with detailed knowledge on the matter" stated that Booz Allen's hiring screeners detected possible discrepancies in Snowden's résumé regarding his education, since some details "did not check out precisely", but decided to hire him anyway; Reuters stated that the element which triggered these concerns, or the manner in which Snowden satisfied the concerns, were not known.[32]
On Wednesday July 10, 2013, the United States Air Force stated that it cleared Booz Allen of wrongdoing regarding the Snowden case.[33]
Political contributions[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (June 2013)


In 2013 David Sirota of Salon said that Booz Allen and parent company The Carlyle Group make significant political contributions to the Democratic Party and the Republican Party as well as individual politicians, including Barack Obama and John McCain.[34] According to Maplight, a company that tracked campaign donations, Booz Allen gave a total of just over $87,000 to U.S. lawmakers from 2007 to June 2013.[35] Sirota concluded that "many of the politicians now publicly defending the surveillance state and slamming whistleblowers like Snowden have taken huge sums of money from these two firms", referring to Booz Allen and Carlyle, and that the political parties are "bankrolled by these firms."[34]
Activities in foreign countries[edit]
In June 2012 Booz Allen expanded its operations in North Africa and the Middle East, with initial plans to add operations in Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, United Arab Emirates. It planned to later add operations to Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, during a time when those countries, as stated by Jill R. Aitoro of the Washington Business Journal, were "recover[ing] from the turmoil associated with the Arab Spring."[36] The Booz Allen employee base, when it was a part of Booz & Company, had long-term relationships with many North African and Middle Eastern countries; Booz Allen had split from Booz & Company[36] David Sirota of Salon said that politicians in the United States who received financing from Booz Allen and "other firms with a similar multinational business model" have vested interests in "denigrating the democratic protest movements that challenge Mideast surveillance states that make those donors big money, too."[34]
Booz Allen helped the Government of the United Arab Emirates create an equivalent of the National Security Agency for that country. According to David E. Sanger and Nicole Perlroth of The New York Times, "one Arab official familiar with the effort" said that "They are teaching everything. Data mining, Web surveillance, all sorts of digital intelligence collection."[37] In 2013 Sanger and Perlroth said that the company "profits handsomely from its worldwide expansion".[37]
Employee demographics[edit]
In 2013 Booz Allen had 25,000 employees, of which half carried top secret security clearances.[37] In 2014, Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation was awarded a "Top 2014 Workplace" by the Washington Post in their annual feature.[38]

	Introduction




	This Conflict Minerals Report of Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation ("we," "us," "our," "Booz Allen" or the "Company") is prepared for calendar year 2016 in accordance with Rule 13p-1 (the "Rule") under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The term "Conflict Minerals" is defined in the Rule and refers to gold and columbite-tantalite (coltan), cassiterite, wolframite, or their derivatives, which are limited to tantalum, tin and tungsten (the "Conflict Minerals" or "3TG"). The Rule requires disclosure of certain information when a company manufactures or contracts to manufacture products containing Conflict Minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of those products if the company has reason to believe that the Conflict Minerals may have originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or any of the adjoining countries of Angola, Burundi, the Central African Republic, the Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia (the "Covered Countries").




	Company and Product Overview




	Booz Allen is a leading provider of management and technology consulting, engineering, analytics, digital solutions, mission operations, and cyber expertise to U.S. and international governments, major corporations, and not-for-profit organizations. We support critical missions for a diverse base of federal government clients, including nearly all of the U.S. government's cabinet-level departments, as well as increasingly for top-tier commercial and international clients. We support these clients by helping them tackle their most complex and pressing challenges such as protecting soldiers in combat and supporting their families, advancing cyber capabilities, keeping our national infrastructure secure, enabling and enhancing digital services, transforming the healthcare system, and improving government efficiency to achieve better outcomes. Our U.S. commercial clients are primarily in the financial services, healthcare and life sciences, energy, high-tech manufacturing, retail, and automotive industries. Our international clients are primarily in the Middle East, along with a growing presence in Southeast Asia. Although the vast majority of our revenue is derived from our service offerings, a certain portion of our operations involves manufacturing or contracting to manufacture low production numbers of special purpose products for various clients, primarily our U.S. government clients, which include electronic components containing 3TG necessary to the functionality or production of such products (the "Covered Products").




	Design of Conflict Minerals Program




	Our due diligence has been designed to conform, in all material respects, with the internationally recognized five-step framework set forth in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas (Second Edition) and related supplements for 3TG, specifically as it relates to our position in the minerals supply chain as a "downstream" company.




	Step 1: Establish strong company management systems




	Step 2: Identify and assess risks in the supply chain




	Step 3: Design and implement a strategy to respond to identified risks




	Step 4: Carry out independent third-party audit of smelter/refiner's due diligence practices




	Step 5: Report annually on supply chain due diligence




	 As a downstream company, generally, there are multiple tiers between us and the source of raw materials that enter the manufacturing process. Therefore, we must rely on our direct suppliers to work with their upstream suppliers to provide us with information on the origin of the 3TG contained in components of our Covered Products.








	1

















	Due Diligence Measures Performed




	Step 1: Establish strong company management systems













	•






	We have a multidisciplinary internal working group to oversee our compliance efforts and implement our due diligence measures. Our working group is comprised of representatives from legal, ethics, procurement, finance, sustainability and engineering.
















	•






	We have a Conflict Minerals position statement that sets forth our commitment to responsibly sourcing minerals and establishes our expectations of our suppliers. This statement is publicly available on our website at http://www.boozallen.com/insights/better-our-world/sustainability/conflict-minerals.
















	•






	We have an ethics and compliance hotline and a conflict minerals e-mail address that provides employees and suppliers with a mechanism to report violations of our Conflict Minerals compliance program or other concerns.
















	•






	We maintain records relating to our Conflict Minerals program in accordance with recommended record retention guidelines.
















	•






	We provide reports to the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors at least annually about the Company's practices with respect to Conflict Minerals due diligence.







	Step 2: Identify and assess risks in the supply chain













	•






	We analyzed our products, managed services and tools offerings to identify the products that were likely to contain 3TG and analyzed contract and subcontract data to identify the contracts in which we manufactured or contracted to manufacture a product likely to contain 3TG. We worked with the corresponding client-facing teams to develop a list of suppliers associated with each such product.
















	•






	We informed the identified suppliers of our compliance requirements and our intention to comply with the Rule. We also provided the identified suppliers a copy of our Conflict Minerals position statement.
















	•






	We requested that each identified supplier complete and return to us a copy of the Conflict Minerals reporting template developed by the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition and The Global e-Sustainability Initiative (the "EICC Template") and provide us with any updates of any changes to their responses.
















	•






	We reviewed the completed EICC Templates for reasonableness of responses and to identify incomplete information, inconsistencies or other apparent inaccuracies.







	Step 3: Design and implement a strategy to respond to identified risks













	•






	We followed up with direct suppliers that did not respond to our request for Conflict Minerals information by the requested date or to obtain further information from them as necessary.
















	•






	The large majority of the responses received from our direct suppliers provided data at a company or divisional level or were unable to specify the smelters or refiners used for components or materials supplied to us. Several of our direct suppliers indicated that they had not finished the due diligence on their own supply chain and therefore could not complete the EICC Template.
















	•






	If a risk is identified in our supply chain, we engage with our direct supplier and take appropriate steps to mitigate the risk.











	2












	Step 4: Carry out independent third-party audit of smelter's/refiner's due diligence practices













	•






	Due to our position in the supply chain, we do not conduct or commission independent third-party audits of smelters or refiners and rely on independent, third-party audits conducted by the Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative ("CFSI") as necessary.







	Step 5: Report annually on supply chain due diligence













	•






	This Report and the accompanying Form SD are publicly filed with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission and available on our website at www.boozallen.com.







	Results of Our Due Diligence Measures




	As previously discussed, we requested identified suppliers to complete the EICC Template to determine the facilities used to process 3TG and the mines or locations of origin of the 3TG in our supply chain. The large majority of the responses received from our direct suppliers provided data at a company or divisional level and were unable to specify the smelters or refiners used for components supplied to us. We were therefore unable to determine whether any of the 3TG that these suppliers reported was actually contained in components or parts that the suppliers supplied to us, or determine if any of the smelters or refiners were actually in our supply chain. Based on our due diligence, we were unable to determine the country of origin of the 3TG contained in the Covered Products, the facilities used to process them, their mine or location of origin, or to determine whether they came from recycled or scrap sources.




	Future Efforts to Mitigate Risk




	We intend to continuously improve our due diligence efforts to further mitigate any risk that the necessary 3TG in our products could benefit armed groups in the Covered Countries by:













	•






	Continuing to make our suppliers aware of our position statement on Conflict Minerals.
















	•






	Continuing to engage suppliers to obtain current, accurate and complete information about our supply chain.
















	•






	Encouraging suppliers to increase the participation rate of smelters and refiners in the Conflict-Free Smelter Program developed by the CFSI.







	We expect to continue our risk mitigation efforts, monitor evolving best practices and implement those we believe will help us address the ongoing issue of Conflict Minerals in the global supply chain.




	Forward-Looking Statements




	This document contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Any statements that do not relate to historical or current facts or matters are forward-looking statements. You can identify some of the forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking words, such as "believe," "intend," "expect," "will" or the use of future tense. Statements concerning current conditions may also be forward-looking if they imply a continuation of current conditions.




	Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual actions or performance to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: (1) the continued implementation of satisfactory traceability and other compliance measures by the Company’s direct and indirect suppliers, on a timely basis or at all, (2) whether market participants responsibly source Conflict Minerals, and (3) changes in the Rule and other political and regulatory developments, whether in the Covered Countries, the United States or elsewhere. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of filing of this document. The Company does not intend, and undertakes no obligation, to publish revised forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of filing of this document or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

RADNOR, Pa., June 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- The law firm of Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP announces that a shareholder class action lawsuit has been filed against Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corp. (NYSE:    BAH) ("Booz Allen" or the "Company") on behalf of purchasers of the Company's securities between May 19, 2016 and June 15, 2017, inclusive (the "Class Period").








Investors who purchased Booz Allen securities during the Class Period may, no later than August 18, 2017, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class. For additional information, or to learn how to participate in this action, please visit: https://www.ktmc.com/new-cases/booz-allen-hamilton-holding-corporation#join
Booz Allen shareholders who wish to discuss this action and their legal options are encouraged to contact Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP (Darren J. Check, Esq., D. Seamus Kaskela, Esq. or Adrienne O. Bell, Esq.) at (888) 299 – 7706 or at info@ktmc.com.  
Booz Allen provides management and technology consulting, engineering, analytics, digital, mission operations, and cyber solutions to governments, corporations, and not-for-profit organizations in the United States and internationally. 
The shareholder class action complaint alleges that Booz Allen and certain of its senior executive officers made a series of false and misleading statements to investors about the Company's business, operations, and compliance policies. Specifically, the defendants are alleged to have made false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Booz Allen engaged in improper accounting practices in its contracts with the U.S. government; (ii) consequently, the Company's revenues derived from services provided to the U.S. government were inflated and unsustainable; and (iii) discovery of the foregoing conduct would subject the Company to heightened regulatory scrutiny, potential criminal sanctions, and jeopardize its business relationship with the U.S. government.
On June 15, 2017, Booz Allen disclosed that "the U.S. Department of Justice is conducting a civil and criminal investigation relating to certain elements of the Company's cost accounting and indirect cost charging practices with the U.S. government."  
Following this news, shares of the company's stock declined $7.43 per share, or 18.9%, to close on June 16, 2017, at $31.90 per share, on heavy trading volume. 
Booz Allen shareholders may, no later than August 18, 2017, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class through Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, or other counsel, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class members in directing the litigation. In order to be appointed as a lead plaintiff, the Court must determine that the class member's claim is typical of the claims of other class members, and that the class member will adequately represent the class in the action. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision of whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff.  
Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check prosecutes class actions in state and federal courts throughout the country. Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check is a driving force behind corporate governance reform, and has recovered billions of dollars on behalf of institutional and individual investors from the United States and around the world.  The firm represents investors, consumers and whistleblowers (private citizens who report fraudulent practices against the government and share in the recovery of government dollars). The complaint in this action was not filed by Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check.  For more information about Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, please visit www.ktmc.com.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

History[edit]
Early years[edit]
After graduating from Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois in 1914, Edwin G. Booz developed the business theory that companies would be more successful if they could call on someone outside their own organizations for expert, impartial advice.[7] This theory developed into a new profession — management consulting — and the firm that would bear his name.
According to the company, "In 1940, the firm was hired to help the United States Secretary of the Navy with World War II preparations. Since then, Booz Allen has had a hand in several notable private and public engagements throughout its years, such as advising on the breakup of Ma Bell and helping organize the National Football League in the 1960s."[8]
The firm has gone through several name changes in its 100 years of existence. These include: Edwin G. Booz, Business Engineering Service; Edwin G. Booz Surveys; Edwin G. Booz and Fry Surveys; Booz, Fry, Allen & Hamilton; Booz, Allen & Hamilton; and finally Booz Allen Hamilton.[9]
Organization[edit]
In 1970, Booz Allen first went public with an initial offering of 500,000 shares at $24 per share.[10] However, in 1976 public trading ceased in the largest-ever leveraged buyout involving a consulting firm where Booz Allen's partners bought back the stock, through one of the first management buyouts (MBO), and returned the firm to private ownership with a new governance structure. In 2007 managing director Marc Gerencser said that being privately held allowed the firm to consider long-range investments that companies beholden to shareholders might not be able to make.[11]
New South Wales, Australia[edit]
In 1988, the newly elected Greiner State Government commissioned a report into the State Rail Authority by Booz Allen Hamilton. The resulting report recommended up to 8,000 job losses, including the withdrawal of staff from 94 country railway stations, withdrawing services on the Nyngan- Bourke line, Queanbeyan – Cooma line and Glen Innes- Wallangarra line, the discontinuation of several country passenger services (the Canberra XPT, the Silver City Comet to Broken Hill and various diesel locomotive hauled services) and the removal of sleeper trains from services to Brisbane and Melbourne. The report also recommended the removal of all country passenger services and small freight operations, but the government did not consider this to be politically feasible.[12] The SRA was divided into business units – CityRail, responsible for urban railways; CountryLink, responsible for country passenger services; FreightRail, responsible for freight services; and Rail Estate, responsible for rail property.
Internal Revenue Service[edit]
In 1998, Booz Allen was chosen to help the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) modernize and shed its reputation for dismal customer service. The firm developed a strategy for the IRS to reshuffle its 100,000 employees into units focused on particular taxpayer categories: individuals, charities, businesses and so on. "We made some very dramatic changes in the way the IRS is organized," said CEO Ralph Shrader.[13] (Reports from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) have pointed to mixed results, including poor management of the IRS's IT portfolio and contractors.)[14]
SWIFT[edit]
In 2006 at the request of the Article 29 Working Party (an advisory group to the European Commission) the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Privacy International (PI) investigated the U.S. government's SWIFT surveillance program and Booz Allen's role therein. The ACLU and PI filed a memo at the end of their investigation which called into question the ethics and legality of a government contractor (in this case Booz Allen) acting as auditors of a government program, when that contractor is heavily involved with those same agencies on other contracts. The basic statement was that a conflict of interest may exist. Beyond that, the implication was also made that Booz Allen may be complicit in a program (electronic surveillance of SWIFT) that may be deemed illegal by the European Commission.[15][16]
Homeland Security[edit]
A June 28, 2007 article in The Washington Post related how a United States Department of Homeland Security contract with Booz Allen increased from $2 million to more than $70 million through two no-bid contracts, one occurring after the DHS's legal office had advised DHS not to continue the contract until after a review. A Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on the contract characterized it as not well-planned and lacking any measure for assuring valuable work to be completed.
According to the article,

A review of memos, e-mail and other contracting documents obtained by The Washington Post show that in a rush to meet congressional mandates to establish the information analysis and infrastructure protection offices, agency officials routinely waived rules designed to protect taxpayer money. As the project progressed, the department became so dependent on Booz Allen that it lost the flexibility for a time to seek out other contractors or hire federal employees who might do the job for less.

Elaine C. Duke, the department's chief procurement officer, acknowledged the problems with the Booz Allen contract. But Duke said those matters have been resolved. She defended a decision to issue a second no-bid contract in 2005 as necessary to keep an essential intelligence operation running until a competition could be held.[17]
National Institutes of Health[edit]
In March 2011, The National Institutes of Health reported that Booz Allen Hamilton spent at least $350M of public funds to develop the caBIG "Cancer biomedical Informatics Grid" not including supplemental grants and stimulus recovery funds. The NIH report recommended an immediate moratorium on software contracts and a full audit of budget expenditures. The original goals of the program were to share cancer data between NIH funded study centers. caBIG quickly grew in scope beyond the funded objectives, which the NIH cited as a key cause of failure. Funding levels for caBIG were the largest ever spent for a US biomedical research network. As of May 2012, the caBIG program was retired.
2011 Anonymous hack[edit]
On July 11, 2011[18][19] the group Anonymous, as part of its Operation AntiSec,[20] hacked into Booz Allen servers, extracting e-mails and non-salted passwords from the U.S. military. This information and a complete dump of the database were placed in a file shared on The Pirate Bay.[21] Despite Anonymous' claims that 90,000 emails were released, the Associated Press counted only 67,000 unique emails, of which only 53,000 were military addresses. The remainder of the addresses came from educational institutions and defense contractors.[22] Anonymous also said that it accessed four gigabytes of Booz Allen source code and deleted those four gigabytes. According to a statement by the group, "We infiltrated a server on their network that basically had no security measures in place."[23][24]
Anonymous accused Booz Allen of working with HBGary Federal by creating a project for the manipulation of social media. Anonymous also accused Booz Allen of participating in intelligence-gathering and surveillance programs of the U.S. federal government and, as stated by Kukil Bora of the International Business Times, "possible illegal activities."[20] Booz Allen confirmed the intrusion on 13 July, but contradicted Anonymous' claims in saying that the attack never got past their own systems, meaning that information from the military should be secure.[25] In August of that year, during a conference call with analysts, Ralph Shrader, the chairman and CEO, stated that "the cost of remediation and other activities directly associated with the attack" were not expected to have a "material effect on our financial results."[26]
PRISM media leak[edit]
Main articles: PRISM (surveillance program) and Edward Snowden
In June 2013, Edward Snowden — at the time a Booz Allen employee[27] contracted to projects of the National Security Agency (NSA) — publicly disclosed details of classified mass surveillance and data collection programs, including PRISM. The alleged leaks are said to rank among the most significant breaches in the history of the NSA[28] and led to considerable concern worldwide. Booz Allen condemned Snowden's leak of the existence of PRISM as "shocking" and "a grave violation of the code of conduct and core values of our firm".[29] The company fired Snowden in absentia shortly after and stated he had been an employee for less than three months at the time. Market analysts considered the incident "embarrassing" but unlikely to cause enduring commercial damage.[30] Booz Allen stated that it would work with authorities and clients to investigate the leak. Charles Riley of CNN/Money said that Booz Allen was "scrambling to distance itself from Snowden."[31]
According to Reuters, a source "with detailed knowledge on the matter" stated that Booz Allen's hiring screeners detected possible discrepancies in Snowden's résumé regarding his education, since some details "did not check out precisely", but decided to hire him anyway; Reuters stated that the element which triggered these concerns, or the manner in which Snowden satisfied the concerns, were not known.[32]
On Wednesday July 10, 2013, the United States Air Force stated that it cleared Booz Allen of wrongdoing regarding the Snowden case.[33]
Political contributions[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (June 2013)


In 2013 David Sirota of Salon said that Booz Allen and parent company The Carlyle Group make significant political contributions to the Democratic Party and the Republican Party as well as individual politicians, including Barack Obama and John McCain.[34] According to Maplight, a company that tracked campaign donations, Booz Allen gave a total of just over $87,000 to U.S. lawmakers from 2007 to June 2013.[35] Sirota concluded that "many of the politicians now publicly defending the surveillance state and slamming whistleblowers like Snowden have taken huge sums of money from these two firms", referring to Booz Allen and Carlyle, and that the political parties are "bankrolled by these firms."[34]
Activities in foreign countries[edit]
In June 2012 Booz Allen expanded its operations in North Africa and the Middle East, with initial plans to add operations in Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, United Arab Emirates. It planned to later add operations to Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, during a time when those countries, as stated by Jill R. Aitoro of the Washington Business Journal, were "recover[ing] from the turmoil associated with the Arab Spring."[36] The Booz Allen employee base, when it was a part of Booz & Company, had long-term relationships with many North African and Middle Eastern countries; Booz Allen had split from Booz & Company[36] David Sirota of Salon said that politicians in the United States who received financing from Booz Allen and "other firms with a similar multinational business model" have vested interests in "denigrating the democratic protest movements that challenge Mideast surveillance states that make those donors big money, too."[34]
Booz Allen helped the Government of the United Arab Emirates create an equivalent of the National Security Agency for that country. According to David E. Sanger and Nicole Perlroth of The New York Times, "one Arab official familiar with the effort" said that "They are teaching everything. Data mining, Web surveillance, all sorts of digital intelligence collection."[37] In 2013 Sanger and Perlroth said that the company "profits handsomely from its worldwide expansion".[37]
Employee demographics[edit]
In 2013 Booz Allen had 25,000 employees, of which half carried top secret security clearances.[37] In 2014, Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation was awarded a "Top 2014 Workplace" by the Washington Post in their annual feature.[38]

History[edit]
Early years[edit]
After graduating from Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois in 1914, Edwin G. Booz developed the business theory that companies would be more successful if they could call on someone outside their own organizations for expert, impartial advice.[7] This theory developed into a new profession — management consulting — and the firm that would bear his name.
According to the company, "In 1940, the firm was hired to help the United States Secretary of the Navy with World War II preparations. Since then, Booz Allen has had a hand in several notable private and public engagements throughout its years, such as advising on the breakup of Ma Bell and helping organize the National Football League in the 1960s."[8]
The firm has gone through several name changes in its 100 years of existence. These include: Edwin G. Booz, Business Engineering Service; Edwin G. Booz Surveys; Edwin G. Booz and Fry Surveys; Booz, Fry, Allen & Hamilton; Booz, Allen & Hamilton; and finally Booz Allen Hamilton.[9]
Organization[edit]
In 1970, Booz Allen first went public with an initial offering of 500,000 shares at $24 per share.[10] However, in 1976 public trading ceased in the largest-ever leveraged buyout involving a consulting firm where Booz Allen's partners bought back the stock, through one of the first management buyouts (MBO), and returned the firm to private ownership with a new governance structure. In 2007 managing director Marc Gerencser said that being privately held allowed the firm to consider long-range investments that companies beholden to shareholders might not be able to make.[11]
New South Wales, Australia[edit]
In 1988, the newly elected Greiner State Government commissioned a report into the State Rail Authority by Booz Allen Hamilton. The resulting report recommended up to 8,000 job losses, including the withdrawal of staff from 94 country railway stations, withdrawing services on the Nyngan- Bourke line, Queanbeyan – Cooma line and Glen Innes- Wallangarra line, the discontinuation of several country passenger services (the Canberra XPT, the Silver City Comet to Broken Hill and various diesel locomotive hauled services) and the removal of sleeper trains from services to Brisbane and Melbourne. The report also recommended the removal of all country passenger services and small freight operations, but the government did not consider this to be politically feasible.[12] The SRA was divided into business units – CityRail, responsible for urban railways; CountryLink, responsible for country passenger services; FreightRail, responsible for freight services; and Rail Estate, responsible for rail property.
Internal Revenue Service[edit]
In 1998, Booz Allen was chosen to help the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) modernize and shed its reputation for dismal customer service. The firm developed a strategy for the IRS to reshuffle its 100,000 employees into units focused on particular taxpayer categories: individuals, charities, businesses and so on. "We made some very dramatic changes in the way the IRS is organized," said CEO Ralph Shrader.[13] (Reports from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) have pointed to mixed results, including poor management of the IRS's IT portfolio and contractors.)[14]
SWIFT[edit]
In 2006 at the request of the Article 29 Working Party (an advisory group to the European Commission) the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Privacy International (PI) investigated the U.S. government's SWIFT surveillance program and Booz Allen's role therein. The ACLU and PI filed a memo at the end of their investigation which called into question the ethics and legality of a government contractor (in this case Booz Allen) acting as auditors of a government program, when that contractor is heavily involved with those same agencies on other contracts. The basic statement was that a conflict of interest may exist. Beyond that, the implication was also made that Booz Allen may be complicit in a program (electronic surveillance of SWIFT) that may be deemed illegal by the European Commission.[15][16]
Homeland Security[edit]
A June 28, 2007 article in The Washington Post related how a United States Department of Homeland Security contract with Booz Allen increased from $2 million to more than $70 million through two no-bid contracts, one occurring after the DHS's legal office had advised DHS not to continue the contract until after a review. A Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on the contract characterized it as not well-planned and lacking any measure for assuring valuable work to be completed.
According to the article,

A review of memos, e-mail and other contracting documents obtained by The Washington Post show that in a rush to meet congressional mandates to establish the information analysis and infrastructure protection offices, agency officials routinely waived rules designed to protect taxpayer money. As the project progressed, the department became so dependent on Booz Allen that it lost the flexibility for a time to seek out other contractors or hire federal employees who might do the job for less.

Elaine C. Duke, the department's chief procurement officer, acknowledged the problems with the Booz Allen contract. But Duke said those matters have been resolved. She defended a decision to issue a second no-bid contract in 2005 as necessary to keep an essential intelligence operation running until a competition could be held.[17]
National Institutes of Health[edit]
In March 2011, The National Institutes of Health reported that Booz Allen Hamilton spent at least $350M of public funds to develop the caBIG "Cancer biomedical Informatics Grid" not including supplemental grants and stimulus recovery funds. The NIH report recommended an immediate moratorium on software contracts and a full audit of budget expenditures. The original goals of the program were to share cancer data between NIH funded study centers. caBIG quickly grew in scope beyond the funded objectives, which the NIH cited as a key cause of failure. Funding levels for caBIG were the largest ever spent for a US biomedical research network. As of May 2012, the caBIG program was retired.
2011 Anonymous hack[edit]
On July 11, 2011[18][19] the group Anonymous, as part of its Operation AntiSec,[20] hacked into Booz Allen servers, extracting e-mails and non-salted passwords from the U.S. military. This information and a complete dump of the database were placed in a file shared on The Pirate Bay.[21] Despite Anonymous' claims that 90,000 emails were released, the Associated Press counted only 67,000 unique emails, of which only 53,000 were military addresses. The remainder of the addresses came from educational institutions and defense contractors.[22] Anonymous also said that it accessed four gigabytes of Booz Allen source code and deleted those four gigabytes. According to a statement by the group, "We infiltrated a server on their network that basically had no security measures in place."[23][24]
Anonymous accused Booz Allen of working with HBGary Federal by creating a project for the manipulation of social media. Anonymous also accused Booz Allen of participating in intelligence-gathering and surveillance programs of the U.S. federal government and, as stated by Kukil Bora of the International Business Times, "possible illegal activities."[20] Booz Allen confirmed the intrusion on 13 July, but contradicted Anonymous' claims in saying that the attack never got past their own systems, meaning that information from the military should be secure.[25] In August of that year, during a conference call with analysts, Ralph Shrader, the chairman and CEO, stated that "the cost of remediation and other activities directly associated with the attack" were not expected to have a "material effect on our financial results."[26]
PRISM media leak[edit]
Main articles: PRISM (surveillance program) and Edward Snowden
In June 2013, Edward Snowden — at the time a Booz Allen employee[27] contracted to projects of the National Security Agency (NSA) — publicly disclosed details of classified mass surveillance and data collection programs, including PRISM. The alleged leaks are said to rank among the most significant breaches in the history of the NSA[28] and led to considerable concern worldwide. Booz Allen condemned Snowden's leak of the existence of PRISM as "shocking" and "a grave violation of the code of conduct and core values of our firm".[29] The company fired Snowden in absentia shortly after and stated he had been an employee for less than three months at the time. Market analysts considered the incident "embarrassing" but unlikely to cause enduring commercial damage.[30] Booz Allen stated that it would work with authorities and clients to investigate the leak. Charles Riley of CNN/Money said that Booz Allen was "scrambling to distance itself from Snowden."[31]
According to Reuters, a source "with detailed knowledge on the matter" stated that Booz Allen's hiring screeners detected possible discrepancies in Snowden's résumé regarding his education, since some details "did not check out precisely", but decided to hire him anyway; Reuters stated that the element which triggered these concerns, or the manner in which Snowden satisfied the concerns, were not known.[32]
On Wednesday July 10, 2013, the United States Air Force stated that it cleared Booz Allen of wrongdoing regarding the Snowden case.[33]
Political contributions[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (June 2013)


In 2013 David Sirota of Salon said that Booz Allen and parent company The Carlyle Group make significant political contributions to the Democratic Party and the Republican Party as well as individual politicians, including Barack Obama and John McCain.[34] According to Maplight, a company that tracked campaign donations, Booz Allen gave a total of just over $87,000 to U.S. lawmakers from 2007 to June 2013.[35] Sirota concluded that "many of the politicians now publicly defending the surveillance state and slamming whistleblowers like Snowden have taken huge sums of money from these two firms", referring to Booz Allen and Carlyle, and that the political parties are "bankrolled by these firms."[34]
Activities in foreign countries[edit]
In June 2012 Booz Allen expanded its operations in North Africa and the Middle East, with initial plans to add operations in Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, United Arab Emirates. It planned to later add operations to Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, during a time when those countries, as stated by Jill R. Aitoro of the Washington Business Journal, were "recover[ing] from the turmoil associated with the Arab Spring."[36] The Booz Allen employee base, when it was a part of Booz & Company, had long-term relationships with many North African and Middle Eastern countries; Booz Allen had split from Booz & Company[36] David Sirota of Salon said that politicians in the United States who received financing from Booz Allen and "other firms with a similar multinational business model" have vested interests in "denigrating the democratic protest movements that challenge Mideast surveillance states that make those donors big money, too."[34]
Booz Allen helped the Government of the United Arab Emirates create an equivalent of the National Security Agency for that country. According to David E. Sanger and Nicole Perlroth of The New York Times, "one Arab official familiar with the effort" said that "They are teaching everything. Data mining, Web surveillance, all sorts of digital intelligence collection."[37] In 2013 Sanger and Perlroth said that the company "profits handsomely from its worldwide expansion".[37]
Employee demographics[edit]
In 2013 Booz Allen had 25,000 employees, of which half carried top secret security clearances.[37] In 2014, Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation was awarded a "Top 2014 Workplace" by the Washington Post in their annual feature.[38]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
