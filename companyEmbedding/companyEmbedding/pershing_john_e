Air Products to Add Three New Independent Directors John McGlade to Retire in 2014; Company to Commence CEO Search
















News ReleaseAir Products to Add Three New Independent Directors / John McGlade to Retire in 2014; Company to Commence CEO Search


September 26, 2013 Lehigh Valley, Pa.Air Products (NYSE: APD) today announced that it will add three new independent directors to its Board of Directors and will commence a search to identify a successor to chairman and CEO John E. McGlade, who will retire in 2014. The actions reflect the Board’s ongoing focus on best-in-class corporate governance and leadership succession planning to ensure the Air Products Board and management has the appropriate experience and expertise to deliver long-term value for Air Products shareholders. 

The CEO search will commence promptly, led by a newly formed search committee of the Board with the assistance of a leading executive search firm. The search will be conducted in a manner consistent with recruiting an accomplished executive with the skills and experience necessary to successfully lead a large, global industrial gas company. McGlade will continue to serve as chairman and CEO during the search process and then as chairman for an agreed-upon transition period in 2014. The incoming CEO will also join the Board as a director. 

McGlade said, “Air Products is a long-cycle business, and we have taken significant actions in recent years to position the company for accelerated earnings growth in an economic recovery. As I approach age 60 and the Board plans for my retirement, the actions our Board is announcing today will ensure an orderly leadership transition and a company that is well positioned to deliver long-term shareholder value. We have had a constructive dialogue with Pershing Square, our largest shareholder, and are pleased they are supportive of the actions our Board is announcing today for the benefit of all Air Products shareholders.” 

Bill Ackman, CEO of Pershing Square, said, “We invested in Air Products because it is a great business in an industry with excellent long-term prospects. In recent weeks, we have been delighted to get to know John and the rest of the board working with them on their mission of continuous improvement and long-term shareholder value creation. We look forward to a successful long-term partnership.” 

The three new independent directors will join the Board immediately. Two of the new independent directors, Edward Monser and Matthew Paull, will stand for election at the Air Products 2014 Annual Meeting. Pershing Square has agreed to vote in favor of the company’s slate of nominees recommended by the Board at the 2014 Annual Meeting. The third independent director, Seifi Ghasemi, will stand for election at the 2015 Annual Meeting.

Bill Ackman Wins Air Products Management Shakeup






Antoine Gara



Sep 26, 2013 1:11 PM EDT













 




























































  Updated from 8:20 a.m. to include Valence Group comments and share prices. NEW YORK ( TheStreet) -- Air Products ( APD) will replace its CEO John E. McGlade in 2014 and elect three new independent directors to its Board of Directors, after Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital Management took a large stake in the chemicals manufacturer and pressed for change. The management and board shakeup at Air Products is Ackman's first successful activist move since he resigned from J.C. Penney's ( JCP) board of directors in August and sold Pershing's stake in the struggling retail chain for a loss of more then half a billion dollars. Ackman's Air Products campaign also comes as the hedgie continues to press a $1 billion short position in Herbalife ( HLF) that has drawn criticism from peers such as Carl Icahn of Icahn Associates and Dan Loeb of Third Point Capital Management. The unsuccessful campaign to turn J.C. Penney around and a controversial short position in Herbalife has caused some in the media to treat Ackman as a spectacle and question whether he has lost his clout on Wall Street. Ackman's involvement in the shakeup at Air Products, however, indicates that he still holds significant influence as an activist investor and has the ability to impact change on large corporations. "While we can debate whether Ackman's authority as an activist was tarnished after his J.C. Penney and Herbalife setbacks, Air Products proves that he still wields clout," Alex Khutorsky, managing director of The Valence Group, an M&A advisory investment bank focused on the chemical industry, said in an e-mail. "The avoidance of a noisy fight should satisfy shareholders who have benefited from Ackman's investment in the firm, and for the moment, appease Ackman," he added. Pershing Square built an over $2.2 billion stake in Air Products, about 10% of the company's outstanding shares, and advocated for management and board change after the company fell short on targets on its strategic initiative to grow revenue to $15 billion by 2015. Air Products currently has a market capitalization of over $22 billion and the company's over 27% year-to-date stock gain, largely influenced by Ackman's investment, is a turn from a spell of underperformance. Pershing Square also appears to have had an influence in change atop other prominent corporations this year. Earlier in 2013, Dow Jones Industrial Average component Procter & Gamble ( PG) replaced its CEO with A.G. Lafley, in a move cheered on by Ackman after Pershing took a large stake in the consumer products giant. Air Products said in a Thursday statement that the retirement of current CEO John E. McGlade in 2014, taken with its board change, will ensure that the company has appropriate experience and expertise to deliver long-term value for shareholders. "We invested in Air Products because it is a great business in an industry with excellent long-term prospects. In recent weeks, we have been delighted to get to know John and the rest of the board working with them on their mission of continuous improvement and long-term shareholder value creation," Bill Ackman said in a statement. "We look forward to a successful long-term partnership." The three new independent directors will join Air Products' board immediately. As part of the board change, Pershing Square has agreed to vote in favor of an Air Products slate of nominees recommended by the board at the company's 2014 annual meeting. Two of Air Products' new independent directors, Edward Monser and Matthew Paull, will stand for election at the 2014 meeting, while Seifi Ghasemi, will stand for election at the 2015 meeting.

                                  in Hedge Funds,News                 Bill Ackman, Air Products: Bill Ackman’s hedge fund Pershing Square is the largest individual shareholder of Air Products & Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE:APD), currently owning 9.8% of the company. The activist fund originally announced its APD stake in last quarter’s 13F, and a late-July 13D nearly doubled the size of this position. In their filing with the SEC this afternoon, Pershing Square disclosed its Letter Agreement with Air Products & Chemicals. The letter is attached below.  At current prices, the hedge fund’s 20.6 million share-stake amounts to more than $2.2 billion in market value. The Letter Agreement between Ackman and the Air Products involves several agreements between the parties, including: (1) increasing the size of the Board from 12 to 14 members, (2) that Matthew H. Paull and Seifi Ghasemi fill these extra spots, (3) setting a maximum size on the Board of 15 until the 2014 Annual Meeting, and most importantly (4) the search for a new CEO to replace John E. McGlade who is retiring next year. Edgar Wachenheim’s Greenhaven Associates and Ric Dillon’s Diamond Hill Capital are also invested here, for the hedge fund piggybackers reading this.
