  Meet the Creator of a New, Clean Skincare Line for Cancer PatientsWe talked to David Pollock, creator of skincare line Pur Attitude, about his line of products and the inspiration behind it.

Courtesy of Pur AttitudeAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below A few months ago, we met with David Pollock, a chemist and creator of a skincare line called Pur Attitude. Pollock, who has more than 20 years experience in the cosmetic industry formulating products, created his anti-aging skincare line with the goal of keeping it simple (hence the name "Pur"). Offering cleansers and anti-aging moisturizers and serums, Pur Attitude products skip using ingredients that some people prefer to avoid, such as parabens, phthalates, synthetic fragrances and more.
Most PopularWhat we really found exciting is a "professional" product from Pur Attitude, HA Pur Relief, that's specifically formulated to treat the special needs of the skin of chemotherapy and radiation patients. We asked Pollock to explain a little bit more about his line and the inspiration behind it.GH: Why was it important to you to create the line Pur Attitude?
DP: I have spent my entire career creating some of the most recognized products in the industry. But, after being in the room when a family member was diagnosed with cancer and hearing the doctor explain how some cancers are caused by certain chemicals, I was speechless. That is when I decided something had to be done. While there were natural products out there, I wanted to create a truly scientifically based line using safe ingredients and none of the [controversial] chemicals.GH: Why did you choose the active ingredients that you did?
DP: What better way than to use ingredients naturally found in our body. As a matter of fact, one of the key components (hyaluronate or hyaluronic acid) is an ingredient found in almost every cell of our bodies. It can draw up to 1,000 times its weight in moisture and bind it to the skin. So, by combining very specific molecular weights of the HA and combining it with other components in the skin's natural barrier, we are able to work synergistically with the body to increase the delivery of key ingredients, optimize skin pH, and dramatically increase skin hydration — all day long. I then realized that since this technology could moisturize the skin like no other, why not replace water (which is the main ingredient in most moisturizers) with our technology. The end result is no water, just 100% pure ingredients, which is also a first for the skincare industry.RELATED: The Anti-Aging Ingredients You Need to KnowGH: How did your background in the field influence your work now?
DP: I have formulated for dermatological brands and luxury brands for more than 20 years. And the one thing I know is that a successful product must deliver clinically proven results. So, when I made the shift in my career to create only safe formulations, I knew they had to be more than just natural — they had to be based in science and deliver results.GH: You're coming out with a new, "professional" moisturizer formulated specially for cancer patients undergoing chemo and radiation. Can you tell us a little more about that?
DP: Chemotherapy and radiation treatment targets fast-growing cells — the most important of which being the cancer cells. But it also kills hair follicles, skin cells, etc. — leading to dry/chapped skin, discomfort, pain, chemical burns and even radiation burns. Plus, I was concerned about relieving the discomfort from the cancer treatment. By incorporating an acetyl hexpeptide and a quaternary compound, I was able to work to neutralize the natural communications or signaling between the cells. The end result was a product that worked to optimize skin pH, trigger the skin's natural repair mechanisms, and hydrate, soothe, relieve and protect the skin — helping the patient have an easier time through the process. [This] is the first product to address the multiple side-effects of cancer treatment, without the known carcinogens, without an aroma and without oil (two big issues for cancer patients). Particularly since lotions with oil have to be scrubbed off a wound/burn before each treatment. As painful as that might sound, if the oil sits on their skin, it can act like frying oil — cooking their skin during the next round of radiation.For more information on David Pollock and Pur Attitude Line, visit PurAttitude.com.More from Good Housekeeping:
