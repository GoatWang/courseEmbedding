	ITEM 1. BUSINESS.


	In General


	     NVE Corporation, referred to as NVE, we, us, or
	our, develops and sells devices that use spintronics, a nanotechnology that relies
	on electron spin rather than electron charge to acquire, store and transmit information.
	We manufacture high-performance spintronic products including sensors and couplers
	that are used to acquire and transmit data. We have also licensed our spintronic
	magnetoresistive random access memory technology, commonly known as MRAM.



	NVE History and Background


	     NVE is a Minnesota corporation headquartered in
	a suburb of Minneapolis. We were founded in 1989 by James M. Daughton, Ph.D.,
	a spintronics pioneer. Our common stock became publicly traded in 2000 through
	a reverse merger and became NASDAQ listed in 2003. Since our founding, we have
	been awarded more than $50 million in government research contracts. These
	contracts have helped us develop products and build our intellectual property
	portfolio. We have adopted a March 31 fiscal year, so fiscal years referenced
	in this report end March 31.



	Industry Background


	     Much of the electronics industry is devoted to the
	acquisition, storage, and transmission of information. We have focused on three
	applications for our spintronic technology: magnetic sensors, couplers, and memories.
	Sensors acquire information, couplers transmit information, and memories store
	information. In that sense, our technology can provide the eyes, nerves, and brains
	of electronic systems.


	     Magnetic sensors can be used for a number of purposes
	including detecting the position or speed of robotics and mechanisms, or for communicating
	with implantable medical devices. We believe our spintronic sensors are smaller,
	more precise, and more reliable than competing devices.


	     Couplers are widely used in factory automation,
	providing reliable digital communication between electronic subsystems in factories.
	For example, couplers are used to send high-speed data between robots and central
	controllers. As manufacturing automation expands, there is a need for higher speed
	data and more channel density. Because of their unique properties, we believe
	our couplers transmit more data at higher speeds and over longer distances than
	conventional devices.


	     Near-term potential MRAM applications include mission-critical
	storage such as military, industrial, and antitamper applications. Long term,
	MRAM could address the market for ubiquitous high-density memory.



	Our Enabling Technology


	     Our designs are generally based on either giant
	magnetoresistance or tunneling magnetoresistance. These structures produce a large
	change in electrical resistance depending on the electron spin orientation in
	a free layer.


	     In giant magnetoresistance (GMR) devices, resistance
	changes due to conduction electrons scattering at interfaces within the devices.
	The GMR effect is only significant if the layer thicknesses are less than the
	mean free path of conduction electrons, which is approximately five nanometers.
	Our critical GMR conductor layers may be less than two nanometers, or five atomic
	layers, thick.

	Table
	of Contents



	 

	     The second type of spintronic structure we use is
	based on tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR). Such devices are known as Spin-Dependent
	Tunnel (SDT) junctions or Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs). SDT junctions use
	tunnel barriers that are so thin that electrons can tunnel through
	a normally insulating material to cause a resistance change. SDT barrier thicknesses
	can be in the range of one to four nanometers (less than ten molecular layers).


	     In our products, the spintronic elements are connected
	to integrated circuitry and packaged in much the same way as conventional integrated
	circuits.





	Our Strategy


	     Our vision is to become the leading developer of
	practical spintronics technology and devices. Our spintronic technology provides
	eyes, nerves, and brains for electronic systems, breathing life and intelligence
	into inanimate objects. Our unique products support global trends of smarter and
	smaller connections and an Internet of Things. We plan to monetize
	our technology by selling the products described below and licensing our MRAM
	technology. To grow product sales, we plan to broaden our sensor and coupler product
	lines, and longer term to target larger markets such as consumer electronics,
	automotive electronics, and biosensors.





	Our Products and Markets


	     We operate in a single business segment that includes
	research, design, and manufacture of spintronics for commercial and military markets.






	Sensor Products and Markets



	     Our sensor products detect the strength or gradient
	of magnetic fields and are often used to determine position or speed. The GMR
	changes its electrical resistance depending on the magnetic field. In our devices,
	GMR is combined with conventional foundry integrated circuitry and packaged in
	much the same way as conventional integrated circuits. We sell standard or catalog
	sensors, and custom sensors designed to meet customers exact requirements.
	Our sensors are quite small, very sensitive to magnetic fields, precise, and reliable.



	Standard sensors


	     Our standard, or catalog, sensors are generally
	used to detect the presence of a magnetic or metallic material to determine position
	or speed. We believe our spintronic sensors are smaller, more precise, and more
	reliable than competing devices. Our major market for standard sensors is factory
	automation.



	Custom and medical sensors


	     Our primary custom products are sensors for medical
	devices, which are customized to our customers requirements and manufactured
	under stringent medical device quality standards. Most are used to replace electromechanical
	magnetic switches. We believe our sensors have important advantages in medical
	devices compared to electromechanical switches, including no moving parts for
	inherent reliability, and being smaller, more sensitive, and more precise. Our
	sensors can be customized using customer-specific integrated signal processing
	and design variations that can include the range and sensitivity to magnetic fields,
	electrical resistance, and multisensor elements configuration. Future custom sensor
	target markets include consumer electronics, automotive electronics, and biosensors.






	Coupler Products and Markets



	     Our spintronic couplers combine a GMR sensor element
	and an IsoLoop integrated microscopic coil. The coil creates a small
	magnetic field that is picked up by the spintronic sensor, transmitting data almost
	instantly. Couplers are also known as isolators because they electrically
	isolate the coupled systems. Our IsoLoop couplers are faster than the fastest
	optical couplers.


	     We have five lines of coupler products: cost-effective
	IL500-Series couplers; IL600-Series passive-input couplers; IL700/IL200-Series
	high-speed couplers; IL4/IL3-Series isolated network couplers; and IL800-Series
	top-of-the-line couplers.






	MRAM Products and Markets



	     MRAM uses spintronics to store data. It has been
	called the ideal or universal memory because of its potential to combine the speed
	of SRAM, the density of DRAM, and the nonvolatility of flash memory. Data is stored
	in the spin of the electrons in thin metal alloy films, and read with spin-dependent
	tunnel junctions. Unlike electrical charge, the spin of an electron is inherently
	permanent. We have invented several types of MRAM memory cells including inventions
	related to advanced MRAM designs and MRAM for tamper prevention or detection.


	     Our strategy is to develop, manufacture, and sell
	low bit-density MRAM for applications such as tamper prevention and detection.
	For high bit-density MRAM, our strategy is to license our technology to companies
	with large-scale memories manufacturing capabilities.

	Product Manufacturing


	     The heart of our fabrication facility is a cleanroom
	area with specialized equipment to deposit, pattern, etch, and process spintronic
	materials. Most of our products are fabricated in our facility using either raw
	silicon wafers or foundry wafers. Foundry wafers contain conventional electronics
	that perform housekeeping functions such as voltage regulation and signal conditioning
	in our products.


	     Each wafer may include thousands of devices. We
	build spintronics structures on wafers in our fabrication facility. We either
	saw wafers to be sold in die form, or send wafers to Asia for dicing and packaging.
	Other production operations include wafer-level inspection and testing. Packaged
	parts are returned to us to be tested, inventoried, and shipped.





	Sales and Product Distribution


	     We rely on distributors who stock our products and
	sell them in more than 75 countries. Distributors of our products include America II
	Electronics, Inc., Digi-Key Corporation, and Premier Farnell plc companies.
	Our distributor agreements generally renew annually. In addition, we distribute
	versions of some of our products under private-brand partnerships with large integrated
	device manufacturers. These private-brand partnerships broaden our distribution
	and enhance our sales support, technical support, and brand awareness.





	New Product Status


	     In the past year we began marketing a number of
	new products, including:





	          


	 


	new angle sensor models for energy and resource management that use less energy
	or less magnetic field;




	


	rotation sensors for robotics and resource management;




	


	new sensors for medical devices; and




	


	new antitamper sensors.




	 

	     Long-term product development programs in fiscal
	2017 included:





	          


	 


	smart sensor interfaces for connection to the Internet of
	Things;




	


	biosensors for food safety and medical diagnostics;




	


	new current sensors for energy management;




	


	ultra-high speed couplers;




	


	low-power couplers; and




	


	MRAM for antitamper and security applications.




	 




	Our Competition


	Industrial Sensor Competition



	     Several other companies either make or may have
	the capability to make GMR or TMR sensors. Also, several competitors make solid-state
	industrial magnetic sensors including silicon Hall-effect sensors and anisotropic
	magnetoresistive (AMR) sensors. We believe those types of sensors are not as sensitive
	as our GMR or TMR sensors.




	Medical Sensor Competition



	     Our sensors for medical devices face competition
	from electromechanical magnetic sensors and from other solid-state magnetic sensors.
	Electromechanical magnetic sensors such as reed and micro-electromechanical system
	(MEMS) switches have been in use for several decades. Because our sensors have
	no moving parts, we believe they are inherently more reliable than electromechanical
	magnetic sensors. We also believe our sensors are smaller than the smallest electromechanical
	magnetic sensors, more precise in their magnetic switch points, and more sensitive.
	Compared to other solid-state sensors, our medical sensors may have advantages
	in size, sensitivity to small magnetic fields, or electrical interface simplicity.




	Coupler Competition



	     Competing coupler technologies include optical couplers,
	inductive couplers (transformers), capacitive couplers, and radio-frequency modulation
	couplers. Prominent optical coupler suppliers include Broadcom Limited, Fairchild
	Semiconductor International, Lite-On Technology Corporation, Renesas Electronics
	Corporation, Toshiba Corporation, and Vishay Intertechnology.


	     Our strategy is to compete based on product features
	rather than to compete solely on price. IsoLoop couplers are smaller and therefore
	require less circuit board space per channel than most competing couplers. Our
	other advantages over competing technologies may include less signal distortion,
	longer product life, and lower power consumption.




	MRAM Competition



	     A number of companies compete or may compete with
	us for MRAM research and development or service business, or may be attempting
	to develop MRAM intellectual property for licensing to others. Emerging technologies
	that could compete with MRAM include graphene and carbon nanotubes, phase-change
	memory (PCM; also known as chalcogenide, 3D XPoint, or Ovonic memory), resistive
	RAM (ReRAM or RRAM), conductive bridge RAM (CBRAM), memory
	resistors (memristors), and conductive metal oxide (CMOx) memory.
	MRAM may have advantages over these technologies in either manufacturability,
	speed, bit density, data retention, or endurance.

	of raw silicon and semiconductor foundry wafers that are incorporated into our
	products, and suppliers of device packaging services. Our wafers sources are based
	around the world; most of our packaging services take place in Asia.





	Intellectual Property


	Patents



	     As of March 31, 2017 we had more than 50 issued
	U.S. patents assigned to us. We also have a number of foreign patents, a number
	of U.S. and foreign patents pending, and we have licensed patents from others.
	There are no patents we regard as critical to our current business owned by us
	or licensed to us that expire in the next 12 months.


	     Much of our intellectual property has been developed
	with U.S. Government support. Under federal legislation, companies normally may
	retain the principal worldwide patent rights to any invention developed with U.S.
	Government support.


	     Certain of our patents cover inventions we believe
	may be necessary for successful high-density, high-performance MRAMs. We believe
	U.S. patent 6,744,086 titled Current switched magnetoresistive memory cell
	is particularly important. The patent has been reissued as RE 44,878 and
	expires May 15, 2022.

	 

	     We also have patents on advanced MRAM designs that
	we believe are important, including patents that relate to magnetothermal MRAM,
	spin-momentum MRAM, and synthetic antiferromagnetic storage.




	Trademarks



	     NVE and IsoLoop are our
	registered trademarks. Other trademarks we claim include GMR Switch
	and GT Sensor.





	Seasonality


	     In some years we have observed weak product sales
	late in the calendar year, possibly due to ordering patterns or customer vacations
	and shutdowns. We cannot predict whether this seasonal pattern will occur in future
	years.





	Working Capital Items


	     Like other companies in the electronics industry,
	we have historically invested in capital equipment for manufacturing and testing
	our products, as well as research and development equipment. We have also deployed
	significant capital in inventories to have finished products available from stock,
	to receive more favorable pricing for raw materials, and to guard against raw
	material shortages.





	Dependence on Major Customers


	     We rely on several large customers for a significant
	percentage of our revenue, including Abbott Laboratories (formerly St. Jude
	Medical, Inc.), Sonova AG (formerly known as Phonak AG), certain
	other medical device manufacturers, and certain distributors. The loss of one
	or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on us.





	Firm Backlog


	     As of March 31, 2017 we had $886,156 of contract
	research and development backlog we believed to be firm, compared to $2,117,547
	as of March 31, 2016. We expect the firm backlog as of March 31, 2017
	to be filled in fiscal 2018. Certain contracts have performance requirements and
	milestones, and there can be no assurance that backlog will result in future revenue.
	Our product sales are made primarily under standard purchase orders, which are
	generally cancellable. Therefore product order backlog is not included in firm
	backlog, and product sales backlog as of any particular date may not be
	indicative of future results. We also have certain agreements that require customers
	to forecast purchases; however, these agreements do not generally obligate the
	customer to purchase any particular quantity of products. Based on semiconductor
	industry practice and our experience, we do not believe that such agreements are
	meaningful for determining backlog amounts.

	Research and Development Activities


	     Over the past three fiscal years our research and
	development activities have included development of new sensors, couplers, and
	memories, as well as related underlying technologies. We spent $3,003,656 for
	fiscal 2017, $2,691,303 for fiscal 2016, and $2,472,341 for fiscal 2015 in company-sponsored
	research and development activities. Additionally, we spent $1,830,857 for fiscal
	2017, $2,762,406 for fiscal 2016, and $1,112,813 during fiscal 2015 on customer-sponsored
	research and development contract activities. These research and development contracts
	were with various agencies of the U.S. Government as well as non-government entities.





	Environmental Matters


	     We are subject to environmental laws and regulations,
	particularly with respect to industrial waste and emissions. Compliance with these
	laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures,
	earnings, or competitive position to date. Existing and future environmental laws
	and regulations could result in expenses related to emission abatement or remediation,
	but we are currently unable to estimate such expenses.





	Number of Employees


	     We had 51 employees as of March 31, 2017. Our
	employment can fluctuate due to a variety of factors. None of our employees are
	represented by a labor union or are subject to a collective bargaining agreement,
	and we believe we maintain good relations with our employees.





	Financial Information About Geographic Areas


	     Foreign sales accounted for approximately 52% of
	our revenue in fiscal 2017. More information about geographic areas is contained
	in Note 8  Concentrations to the Financial Statements
	included in this report.





	Available Information


	     All reports we file with the SEC, including our
	annual reports on

	Form 10-K

	, quarterly
	reports on

	Form 10-Q

	, current reports
	on

	Form 8-K

	, and proxy statements and
	additional proxy materials on Schedule 14A, as well as any amendments to
	those reports and schedules, are accessible at no cost through the Investors
	section of our Website (www.nve.com). We make those filings available as soon
	as reasonably practicable after filing. These filings are also accessible through
	the SECs Website (www.sec.gov).







	ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.


	     We caution readers that the following important
	factors, among others, could affect our financial condition, operating results,
	business prospects or any other aspect of NVE, and could cause our actual results
	to differ materially from that projected or estimated by us in the forward-looking
	statements made by us or on our behalf. Although we have attempted to list below
	the important factors that do or may affect our financial condition, operating
	results, business prospects, or any other aspect of NVE, other factors may in
	the future prove to be more important. New factors emerge from time to time and
	it is not possible for us to predict all of such factors. Similarly, we cannot
	necessarily assess or quantify the impact of each such factor on the business
	or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual
	results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements.




	We may lose revenue if any of our large customers cancel, postpone, or reduce
	their purchases.



	     We rely on several large customers for a significant
	percentage of our revenue. These large customers include Abbott Laboratories (formerly
	St. Jude Medical, Inc.), Sonova AG (formerly known as Phonak AG),
	certain other medical device manufacturers, and certain distributors. Although
	we have agreements with certain large customers, these agreements do not obligate
	customers to purchase from us and may not prevent price reductions. Furthermore,
	orders from our large customers can generally be reduced, postponed, or canceled.
	Any decreases in purchase quantities or purchase prices, or the loss of any of
	our large customers, could have a significant impact on our revenue and our profitability.




	We risk losing business to our competitors.



	     Known product competitors include Analog Devices, Inc.;
	Broadcom Limited; Fairchild Semiconductor International; Hermetic Switch, Inc.;
	Linear Technology Inc.; Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.; Meder Electronic AG;
	Memscap SA; NEC Corporation; Sharp Corporation; Silicon Laboratories, Inc.;
	Texas Instruments Incorporated; Toshiba Corporation; Vishay Intertechnology; and
	others. Many of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater
	financial, technical, and marketing resources than us. We believe that our competition
	is increasing as the technology and markets mature. This has meant more competitors
	and more severe pricing pressure. In addition, our competitors may be narrowing
	or eliminating our performance advantages. We expect these trends to continue,
	and we may lose business to competitors or it may be necessary to significantly
	reduce our prices in order to acquire or retain business. These factors could
	cause a material adverse impact on our financial condition, revenue, gross profit
	margins, or income.

	We may lose revenue if we are unable to renew customer agreements.



	     We have agreements with certain customers, including
	a Supply Agreement, as amended, with Sonova AG (formerly known as Phonak AG),
	which expires March 1, 2020, and a Supplier Partnering Agreement, as amended,
	with Abbott Laboratories (formerly St. Jude Medical, Inc.) expires January 1,
	2021. We cannot predict if these agreements will be renewed, or if renewed, under
	what terms. Although it is possible we could continue to sell products to these
	customers without formal agreements, an inability to agree on mutually acceptable
	terms or the loss these customers could have a significant adverse impact on our
	revenue and our profitability.




	We will lose revenue if government contract funding is reduced, delayed,
	or eliminated.



	     Although our revenue from agencies of the U.S. Government
	was less than 10% of our total revenue in each of the past three fiscal years,
	a material decrease in U.S. Government funded research or disqualification as
	a vendor to the U.S. Government for any reason could hamper future research and
	development activity and decrease related revenue. In addition to direct Government
	funding, certain of our non-Government customers and prospective customers depend
	on Government support to fund their contracts with us. Our direct and indirect
	Government funding depends on adequate continued funding of the agencies and their
	programs. Such funding is affected by Government budgets and priorities that can
	change and over which we have no control, and delays in such funding can occur
	for a number of reasons. Interruptions in the Government funding process such
	as federal budget delays, debt ceiling limitations, shutdowns,
	or sequestration may impact Government contract funding. Furthermore,
	some of our Government funding has been through Small Business Innovation Research
	(SBIR) or Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) contracts. SBIR and
	STTR budgets, eligibility, or funding limits may be changed by legislation or
	by agencies such as the Department of Defense or Department of Agriculture.




	If we were barred for any reason from U.S. government contracts there could
	be a significant adverse impact on our revenue and our ability to make research
	and development progress.



	     If we were to be charged with violation of certain
	laws or if the U.S. Government were to determine that we are not a presently
	responsible contractor, we could be temporarily suspended or, in the event
	of a violation, barred for up to three years from receiving new U.S. Government
	contracts or government-approved subcontracts. In addition, we could expend substantial
	amounts in defending against such charges and in damages, fines and penalties
	if such charges are proven or result in negotiated settlements. Being barred for
	any reason from U.S. Government contracts could have a material adverse effect
	on our revenue, profits, and research and development efforts.




	We face an uncertain economic environment in the industries we serve, which
	could adversely affect our business.



	     We sell our products into the semiconductor market,
	which is highly cyclical. Additionally, effects of U.S. healthcare reform legislation
	could have an adverse effect on the economic environment for the medical device
	industries we serve. We cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any
	economic slowdown or subsequent recovery, worldwide or in the industries we serve.
	The economic environment could have a material adverse impact on our business
	and revenue.




	Failure to meet stringent customer requirements could result in the loss
	of key customers and reduce our sales.



	     Some of our customers, including certain medical
	device manufacturers, have stringent technical and quality requirements that require
	our products to meet certain test and qualification criteria or to adopt and comply
	with specific quality standards. Certain customers also periodically audit our
	performance. Failure to meet technical or quality requirements or a negative customer
	audit could result in the loss of current sales revenue, customers, and future
	sales.




	We could be subject to claims based on warranty, product liability, or delivery
	failures.



	     Claims based on warranty, product liability, or
	delivery failures that could lead to significant expenses as we defend such claims
	or pay damage awards. We may also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected
	customer or end consumer for such claims. In addition, if our customers recall
	products containing our products, we may incur costs and expenses relating to
	the recall. Costs or payments we may make in connection with warranty, delivery
	claims or product recalls may adversely affect our business and financial condition.




	Some of our products are incorporated into medical devices, which could
	expose us to a risk of product liability claims and such claims could seriously
	harm our business and financial condition.



	     Certain of our products are used in medical devices,
	including devices that help sustain human life. We are also marketing our technology
	to other manufacturers of cardiac pacemakers and ICDs. Although we have indemnification
	agreements with certain customers including provisions designed to limit our exposure
	to product liability claims, there can be no assurance that we will not be subject
	to losses, claims, damages, liabilities, or expenses resulting from bodily injury
	or property damage arising from the incorporation of our products in devices sold
	by our customers. Our indemnifying customers may not have the financial resources
	to cover all liability. Existing or future laws or unfavorable judicial decisions
	could limit or invalidate the provisions of our indemnification agreements, or
	the agreements may not be enforceable in all instances. A successful product liability
	claim could require us to pay, or contribute to payment of, substantial damage
	awards, which would have a significant negative effect on our business and financial
	condition.

	Table
	of Contents



	 



	Federal legislation may not protect us against liability for the use of
	our products in medical devices and a successful liability claim could seriously
	harm our business and financial condition.



	     Although the Biomaterials Access Assurance Act of
	1998 may provide us some protection against potential liability claims, that Act
	includes significant exceptions to supplier immunity provisions, including limitations
	relating to negligence or willful misconduct. A successful product liability claim
	could require us to pay, or contribute to payment of, substantial damage awards,
	which would have a significant negative effect on our business and financial condition.
	Any product liability claim against us, with or without merit, could result in
	costly litigation, divert the time, attention, and resources of our management
	and have a material adverse impact on our business.




	Any malfunction of our products in existing medical devices could lead to
	the need to recall devices incorporating our products from the market, which may
	be harmful to our reputation and cause a significant loss of revenue.



	     Any malfunction of our products could lead to the
	need to recall existing medical devices incorporating our products from the market,
	which may be harmful to our reputation because it is dependent on product safety
	and efficacy. Even if assertions that our products caused or contributed to device
	failure do not lead to product liability or contract claims, such assertions could
	harm our reputation and our customer relationships. Any damage to our reputation
	and/or the reputation of our products, or the reputation of our customers or their
	products could limit the market for our and our customers products and harm
	our results of operations.




	We may lose business and revenue if our critical production equipment fails.



	     Our production process relies on certain critical
	pieces of equipment for defining, depositing, and modifying the magnetic properties
	of thin films. Some of this equipment was designed or customized by us, and some
	may no longer be in production. While we have an in-house maintenance staff, maintenance
	agreements for certain equipment, some critical spare parts, and back-ups for
	some of the equipment, we cannot be sure we could repair or replace critical manufacturing
	equipment were it to fail.




	The loss of supply from any of our key single-source wafer suppliers could
	impact our ability to produce and deliver products and cause loss of revenue.



	     Our critical suppliers include suppliers of certain
	raw silicon and semiconductor foundry wafers that are incorporated in our products.
	We maintain inventory of some critical wafers, but we have not identified or qualified
	alternate suppliers for many of the wafers now being obtained from single sources.
	Increased industry demand or other factors beyond our control or ability to predict
	could cause or exacerbate wafer supply shortages. Wafer supply interruptions for
	any reason, including acts of God such as floods, typhoons, cyclones, or earthquakes,
	could seriously jeopardize our ability to provide products that are critical to
	our business and operations, and may cause us to lose revenue.




	The loss of supply of any critical chemicals or supplies could impact our
	ability to produce and deliver products and cause loss of revenue.



	     There are a number of critical chemicals and supplies
	that we require to make products. These include certain gases, photoresists, polymers,
	metals, and specialized alloys. We maintain inventory of critical chemicals and
	materials, but in many cases we are dependent on single sources, and some of the
	materials could be subject to shortages or be discontinued by their suppliers
	at any time. Furthermore, current and future climate change regulations could
	increase our costs or cause the loss of supply of critical chemicals. We use chemicals
	such as sulfur hexafluoride in our manufacturing process that have been identified
	as greenhouse gases. If such chemicals were restricted or prohibited we would
	need to obtain substitutes that might be more expensive or less available. Supply
	interruptions or shortages for any reason could seriously jeopardize our ability
	to provide products that are critical to our business and operations and may cause
	us to lose revenue.




	The loss of supply from any of our packaging vendors could impact our ability
	to produce and deliver products and cause loss of revenue.



	     We are dependent on our packaging vendors. Because
	of the unique materials our products use, the complexity of some of our products,
	and the high isolation voltage specifications of our couplers, many of our products
	are more challenging to package than conventional integrated circuits. Some of
	our products use processes or tooling unique to a particular packaging vendor,
	and it might be expensive, time-consuming, or impractical to convert to another
	vendor in the event of a supply interruption. We have alternate vendors or potential
	alternate vendors for the substantial majority of our product sales, but it could
	prove expensive, time-consuming, or technically challenging to convert certain
	products to an alternate vendor. We might not be able to recover work in process
	or finished goods in their possession if one of our packaging vendors were to
	become insolvent or disrupted by acts of God, including floods, typhoons, or earthquakes.
	Furthermore, an alternate vendor may not have sufficient capacity available to
	meet our requirements. Additionally, certain of our packaging vendors are in flood-susceptible
	areas. Flooding risks to such vendors may increase in the future due to possible
	higher ocean levels, extreme weather, and
	other potential effects of climate change. Any supply interruptions or loss of
	inventory could seriously jeopardize our ability to provide products that are
	critical to our business and operations and may cause us to lose revenue.

	We are subject to risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries
	that could impair our results of operations.



	     Foreign sales were approximately 52% of our revenue
	for fiscal 2017, and we expect foreign sales to continue to represent a significant
	portion of our revenue. Furthermore, we rely on suppliers in China, India, Taiwan,
	Thailand, and other foreign countries. Risks relating to operating in foreign
	markets that could impair our results of operations include economic and political
	instability; difficulties in enforcement of contractual obligations and intellectual
	property rights; changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs, customs, duties,
	and other trade barriers; transportation delays; acts of God, including floods,
	typhoons, cyclones and earthquakes; and other uncertainties relating to the administration
	of, or changes in, or new interpretation of, the laws, regulations, and policies
	of jurisdictions where we do business.




	Our business and our reliance on intellectual property exposes us to litigation
	risks.



	     If patent infringement claims or actions are asserted
	against us, we may be required to obtain a license or cross-license, modify our
	existing technology or design a new noninfringing technology. Such licenses or
	design modifications can be costly or could increase the cost of our products.
	In addition, we may decide to settle a claim or action against us, which settlement
	could be costly. We may also be liable for any past infringement, and we may be
	required to indemnify our customers against expenses relating to possible infringement.
	If there is an adverse ruling against us in an infringement lawsuit, an injunction
	could be issued barring production or sale of any infringing product. It could
	also result in a damage award equal to a reasonable royalty or lost profits or,
	if there is a finding of willful infringement, treble damages. Any of these results
	would increase our costs or harm our operating results.




	We may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights.



	     We protect our proprietary technology and intellectual
	property by seeking patents, trademarks, and copyrights, and by maintaining trade
	secrets through entering into confidentiality agreements with employees, suppliers,
	customers, and prospective customers depending on the circumstances. We hold patents
	or are the licensee of others owning patented technology covering certain aspects
	of our products and technology. These patent rights may be challenged, rendered
	unenforceable, invalidated, or circumvented. Two of our patents have been subject
	to

	inter partes

	reexamination proceedings by the U.S. Patent and Trademark
	Office initiated by Everspin Technologies, Inc. as a defensive action in connection
	with our litigation against Everspin. The claims of one of the patents were invalidated,
	and a final adverse decision on the other

	inter partes

	reexamination or
	any future reexamination proceedings could invalidate some or all of the patent
	claims. Additionally, rights granted under the patents or under licensing agreements
	may not provide a competitive advantage to us. We have filed a patent infringement
	lawsuit against Everspin and at least several other companies have described designs
	that we believe may infringe on our patents if such designs were commercialized.
	Efforts to enforce patent rights can involve substantial expense and may not be
	successful. Furthermore, others may independently develop similar, superior, or
	parallel technologies to any technology developed by us, or our technology may
	prove to infringe on patents or rights owned by others. Thus the patents held
	by or licensed to us may not afford us any meaningful competitive advantage. Also,
	our confidentiality agreements may not provide meaningful protection of our proprietary
	information. Our inability to maintain our proprietary rights could have a material
	adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.




	We may not be able to enforce our patents against Motorola, Freescale, or
	Everspin.



	     Our Patent License Option Agreement with Motorola
	provided for termination on December 31, 2005 or on the date Motorola ceases
	manufacturing MRAM Products, whichever is later. We believe such a termination
	is likely to have occurred as a result of Motorola apparently having eliminated
	its ability to manufacture MRAM Products through its spinoff of Freescale. In
	2008 Freescale announced that it had transferred its MRAM technology and intellectual
	property to an independent company, Everspin Technologies, Inc. We believe we
	are free to negotiate a new agreement with Freescale or Everspin, or an assignment
	of the Motorola Patent License Option Agreement, but we have said we would do
	so only with amendments thereto. A settlement agreement by and between Everspin
	and us limits our rights to sue Everspin for patent infringement and prevents
	us from asserting three specific patents against Everspin. There can be no assurance
	that we can successfully enforce any of our other patents, or that any agreement
	will be reached with Freescale or Everspin, or that NVE would receive any value
	under the existing agreement with Motorola or any value under any such further
	agreement with Freescale or Everspin.




	Our business success may be adversely affected if we are unable to attract
	and retain highly qualified employees.



	     We have employment agreements with certain employees,
	including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, but those agreements
	do not prevent employees from leaving the company. Competition for highly qualified
	management and technical personnel can be intense and we may not be able to attract
	and retain the personnel necessary for the development and operation of our business.
	The loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect
	on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

	We could incur losses on our marketable securities.



	     As of March 31, 2017, we held $76,402,756 in
	short-term and long-term marketable securities, representing approximately 81%
	of our total assets. A number of the securities we hold have been downgraded by
	Moodys or Standard and Poors indicating a possible increase in default
	risk. Conditions and circumstances beyond our control or ability to anticipate
	can cause downgrades and increases in default risk, and such downgrades or increases
	in default risk are possible at any time. Additionally, the assignment of a high
	credit rating does not preclude the risk of default on any marketable security.
	Defaults, default risks, or changes in market conditions could cause us to incur
	losses on our marketable securities, which could have a material adverse impact
	on our financial condition, income, or cash flows, and our ability to pay dividends.




	Any decisions to reduce or discontinue paying cash dividends to our shareholders
	could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.



	     While we currently plan to pay quarterly dividends
	indefinitely, our payment of cash dividends will be subject to, among other things,
	our results of operations, cash and marketable security balances, the timing of
	securities maturations, estimates of future cash requirements, fixed asset requirements,
	and other factors our Board may deem relevant. Because they are significantly
	more than our current cash flow from operations, recent and declared dividend
	amounts may be unsustainable. Any reduction or discontinuance by us of cash dividends
	could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.




	The price of our common stock may be adversely affected by significant price
	fluctuations due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control.



	     From time to time our stock price has decreased
	sharply, and could decline in the future. The market price of our common stock
	may be significantly affected by many factors, some of which are beyond our control,
	including:





	          


	 


	technological innovations by us or our competitors;




	


	the announcement of new products, product enhancements, contracts, or license
	agreements by us or our competitors;




	


	delays in our introduction of new products or technologies or market acceptance
	of these products or technologies;




	


	loss of customers, decreases in customers purchases, or decreases
	in customers purchase prices;




	


	changes in demand for our customers products;




	


	quarterly variations in our operating results, revenue, or revenue growth
	rates;




	


	changes in revenue estimates, earnings estimates, or market projections by
	market analysts;




	


	speculation in the press or analyst community about our business, potential
	revenue, or potential earnings;




	


	general economic conditions or market conditions specific to industries we
	or our customers serve or may serve;




	


	legal proceedings involving us, including intellectual
	property litigation or class action litigation; and




	


	our stock repurchase and dividend policies and decisions.

	of 21,362 square feet of offices, laboratories, and production areas, The facility
	is currently being utilized at less than maximum capacity to allow for growth,
	and we believe the facility is adequate to meet our current requirements. We hold
	no investments in real estate.

	Stock Repurchase Program


	     On January 21, 2009 we announced that our Board
	of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2,500,000 of our Common Stock
	from time to time in open market, block, or privately negotiated transactions.
	The timing and extent of any repurchases depends on market conditions, the trading
	price of the companys stock, and other factors, and subject to the restrictions
	relating to volume, price, and timing under applicable law. On August 27,
	2015, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized up to $5,000,000 of
	additional repurchases. Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date
	and does not obligate us to purchase any shares. The Program may be modified or
	discontinued at any time without notice. We intend to finance any stock repurchases
	with cash provided by operating activities or maturating marketable securities.
	We did not repurchase any Common Stock in fiscal 2017. The
	remaining authorization was $4,540,806 as of March 31, 2017.

	ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
	CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.


	     You should read this discussion together with our
	financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this Report. In addition
	to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking information
	that involves risks and uncertainties. Our actual future results could differ
	materially from those presently anticipated due to a variety of factors, including
	those discussed in Item 1A of this Report.



	General


	     We develop and sell devices that use spintronics,
	a nanotechnology that relies on electron spin rather than electron charge to acquire,
	store, and transmit information. We manufacture high-performance spintronic products
	including sensors and couplers to revolutionize data sensing and transmission.
	We also receive contracts for research and development and are a licensor of spintronic
	magnetoresistive random access memory technology, commonly known as MRAM.



	Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates


	     In accordance with SEC guidance, those material
	accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to an investors
	understanding of our financial results and condition and require complex management
	judgment are discussed below.




	Investment Valuation



	     Our investments consist primarily of corporate and
	municipal obligations. We have generally invested excess cash in high-quality
	investment grade long-term marketable securities with less than five years to
	maturity. We classify all of our marketable securities as available-for-sale,
	thus securities are recorded at fair value and any associated unrealized gain
	or loss, net of tax, is included as a separate component of shareholders
	equity, Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). If we judged
	a decline in fair value for any security to be other than temporary, the cost
	basis of the individual security would be written down and a charge recognized
	to net income. The fair values for our securities are determined based on quoted
	market prices as of the valuation date and observable prices for similar assets.
	We consider a number of factors in determining whether other-than-temporary impairment
	exists, including: credit market conditions; the credit ratings of the securities;
	historical default rates for securities of comparable credit rating; the presence
	of insurance of the securities and, if insured, the credit rating and financial
	condition of the insurer; the effect of market interest rates on the value of
	the securities; and the duration and extent of any unrealized losses. We also
	consider the likelihood that we will be required to sell the securities prior
	to maturity based on our financial condition and anticipated cash flows. If any
	of these conditions and estimates change in the future, or, if different estimates
	are used, the fair value of the investments may change significantly and could
	result in other-than-temporary decline in value, which could have an adverse impact
	on our results of operations.




	Inventory Valuation



	     Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net
	realizable value. Cost is determined by the first in, first out method. Where
	there is evidence that inventory could be disposed of at less than carrying value,
	the inventory is written down to the net realizable value in the current period.
	Additionally, we periodically examine our inventory in the context of inventory
	turnover, sales trends, competition and other market factors, and we record provisions
	to inventory reserve when we determine certain inventory is unlikely to be sold.
	If reserved inventory is subsequently sold, corresponding reductions in inventory
	and inventory reserves are made. Our inventory reserve was $225,000 as of March 31,
	2017 and $250,000 as of March 31, 2016.




	Deferred Tax Assets Estimation



	     In determining the carrying value of our net deferred
	tax assets, we must assess the likelihood of sufficient future taxable income
	in certain tax jurisdictions, based on estimates and assumptions to realize the
	benefit of these assets. We evaluate the realizability of the deferred assets
	quarterly and assess the need for valuation allowances or reduction of existing
	allowances quarterly. No valuation allowance was recorded as we believe it is
	more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.


	     We had $357,055 of net deferred tax assets as of
	March 31, 2017, and $51,188 of net deferred tax assets as of March 31,
	2016. Net deferred tax assets included $86,335 in deferred tax assets for stock-based
	compensation deductions as of March 31, 2017 and $115,257 as of March 31,
	2016.

	     Total revenue for fiscal 2017 increased 2% compared
	to fiscal 2016, due to a 7% increase in product sales, partially offset by a 35%
	decrease in contract research and development revenue. The increase in product
	sales for fiscal 2017 was due to new customers. The decrease in contract research
	and development revenue for fiscal 2017 was due to the completion of certain contracts.
	Total revenue decreased 9% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, due to an 18%
	decrease in product sales, partially offset by a 379% increase in contract research
	and development revenue. The decrease in product sales for fiscal 2016 was due
	to decreased purchase volume by existing customers and a more aggressive pricing
	strategy. The increase in contract research and development revenue for fiscal
	2016 was due to new contracts.


	     Gross profit margin increased to 79% of revenue
	for fiscal 2017 from 76% for fiscal 2016 due to a more profitable revenue mix.
	Gross profit margin for fiscal 2016 decreased from 80% due to a less profitable
	revenue mix because of a decrease in product sales and increase in contract research
	and development revenue.


	     Total expenses were approximately the same for fiscal
	2017 compared to fiscal 2016 as a 9% increase in research and development expense
	was offset by a 17% decrease in selling, general, and administrative expense.
	The increase in research and development expense for fiscal 2017 was due to increased
	new product development activities. The decrease in selling, general, and administrative
	expense was primarily due to decreased sales commissions. Total expenses decreased
	9% for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, due to a 24% decrease in selling,
	general, and administrative expense and a 2% increase in research and development
	expense. The decrease in selling, general, and administrative expense for fiscal
	2016 was primarily due to decreased sales commissions and performance-based compensation.


	     Interest income decreased 13% in fiscal 2017 compared
	to fiscal 2016 and 14% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. Decrease in interest
	income both years were due to decreases in interest-bearing marketable securities
	because we used a portion of the proceeds from maturating securities to help fund
	cash dividends in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 and repurchases of our common stock
	in fiscal 2016.


	     The effective income tax rate was approximately
	32% of income before taxes for fiscal 2017 and 2016, and 33% for fiscal 2015.
	Our effective tax rates could fluctuate, however, due to a number of factors,
	some of which are outside our control, including changes in Federal and state
	tax rates and regulations or their interpretation.


	      Net income increased 5% in fiscal 2017 compared
	to fiscal 2016 primarily due to increased total revenue and increased gross profit
	margin as a percentage of revenue, partially offset by decreased interest income.
	Net income decreased 14% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due
	to decreased product sales and interest income, partially offset by increased
	contract research and development revenue and decreased expenses.

	Overview



	     Cash and cash equivalents were $8,199,364 as of
	March 31, 2017 compared to $7,534,593 as of March 31, 2016. The $664,771
	increase in cash and cash equivalents was due to $12,379,160 in net cash provided

	Operating Activities



	     Net cash provided by operating activities related
	to product sales and research and development contract revenue as our primary
	source of working capital for fiscal years 2015 through 2017. For fiscal 2017,
	net cash provided by operating activities was $12,379,160.


	     Accounts receivable increased $1,192,716 in fiscal
	2017 primarily due to the timing of sales to and payments from certain customers.


	     Deferred revenue decreased $572,072 because we delivered
	most products associated with deferred revenue.




	Investing Activities



	     Net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal
	2017 was primarily due to marketable security maturities of $19,400,000 partially
	offset by marketable security purchases of $11,528,240.


	     As of March 31, 2017 our marketable securities
	had remaining maturities between 19 and 228 weeks (see Note 4 
	Marketable Securities to the Financial Statements, included elsewhere in
	this Report for additional information). Our entire portfolio of short-term and
	long-term marketable securities is classified as available for sale.


	     Purchases of fixed assets were $519,835 in fiscal
	2017, $287,275 in fiscal 2016, and $185,007 in fiscal 2015. Purchases all three
	years were primarily for capital equipment and leasehold improvements to increase
	our production capacity and were financed with cash provided by operating activities.
	Our capital expenditures can vary significantly from year to year depending on
	our needs and equipment purchasing opportunities.

	 



	Financing Activities



	     Net cash used in financing activities in fiscal
	2017 was primarily due to $19,346,040 in cash dividends to shareholders, partially
	offset by net proceeds from the sale of common stock of $247,110 from stock option
	exercises.


	     In addition to cash dividends to shareholders paid
	in fiscal 2017, on May 3, 2017 we announced that our Board had declared a
	cash dividend of $1.00 per share of Common Stock, or $4,841,010 based on shares
	outstanding as of April 28, 2017, to be paid May 31, 2017. We plan to
	fund dividends through cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from
	maturities of marketable securities. All future dividends will be subject to Board
	approval and subject to the companys results of operations, cash and marketable
	security balances, estimates of future cash requirements, and other factors the
	Board may deem relevant. Furthermore, dividends may be modified or discontinued
	at any time without notice.


	     We repurchased $1,695,466 of our Common Stock in
	fiscal 2016, and did not repurchase stock in fiscal 2017 or 2015. The repurchases
	were under a program announced January 21, 2009 authorizing the repurchase
	of up to $2,500,000 of our Common Stock and an additional $5,000,000 announced
	August 27, 2015. The remaining authorization was $4,540,806 as of March 31, 2017.
	We intend to finance any stock repurchases with cash provided by operating activities
	or maturating marketable securities. Additional information on our Stock Repurchase
	Program is contained in the section titled, Stock Repurchase Program
	under Part II, Item 5 of this Report.

	     Operating lease obligations are primarily for our
	facility lease. Note 9  Commitments and Contingencies
	to the Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this report, provides additional
	information about our lease obligations. Purchase obligations as of March 31,
	2017 consisted of raw materials commitments. We expect to meet these obligations
	from cash provided by operating activities or proceeds from maturities of marketable
	securities. We plan to evaluate raw materials purchases based on a variety of
	factors including forecasted requirements and anticipated supply leadtimes, and
	our obligations could vary significantly in the future. We plan to evaluate capital
	expenditures as needs and opportunities arise, and our future capital expenditures
	and purchase obligations could vary significantly from expenditures and obligations
	in the past.


	     We believe our working capital and cash generated
	from operations will be adequate for our needs at least through fiscal 2018.



	Inflation


	     Inflation has not had a significant impact on our
	operations in any of our three most recent fiscal years. Prices for our products
	and for the materials and labor costs for those products are governed by market
	conditions. It is possible that inflation in future years could impact both materials
	and labor used for the production of our products.



	Changes In Accounting Standards


	     See Note 2 to the financial statements for information
	on new accounting standards.

	 


	Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements


	     Our off-balance sheet arrangements consist of purchase
	commitments and operating leases for our facility. We believe that our off-balance
	sheet arrangements do not have a material current or anticipated future effect
	on our profitability, cash flows, or financial position.

	 





	ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
	RISK.



	     We are exposed to financial market risks, primarily
	marketable securities and, to a lesser extent, changes in currency exchange rates.



	Marketable Securities


	     The primary objective of our investment activities
	is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing after-tax yields without
	significantly increasing risk. To achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio
	of cash equivalents and marketable securities in securities including municipal
	obligations, corporate obligations, and money market funds. Short-term and long-term
	marketable securities are generally classified as available-for-sale and consequently
	are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses
	reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income or
	loss, net of estimated tax. Our marketable securities as of March 31, 2017
	had remaining maturities between 19 and 228 weeks. Marketable securities
	had a market value of $76,402,756 as of March 31, 2017, representing approximately
	81% of our total assets. We have not used derivative financial instruments in
	our investment portfolio.



	Foreign Currency Transactions


	     We have some limited revenue risks from fluctuations
	in values of foreign currency due to product sales abroad. Foreign sales are generally
	made in U.S. currency, and currency transaction gains or losses in the past three
	fiscal years were not significant.

	ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON
	ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.


	     None.








	ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

	Disclosure Controls and Procedures


	     Management, with the participation of the Chief
	Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has performed an evaluation of
	our disclosure controls and procedures that are defined in

	Rules
	13a-15(e)

	and

	15d-15(e)

	of the
	Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) as of the end of
	the period covered by this Report. This evaluation included consideration of the
	controls, processes, and procedures that are designed to ensure that information
	required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file under the Exchange Act is
	recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified
	in the SECs rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and
	communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
	Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
	disclosure. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
	Officer concluded that, as of March 31, 2017, our disclosure controls and
	procedures were effective.



	Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting


	     Our management is responsible for establishing and
	maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is
	defined in

	Rule 13a-15(f)

	under the
	Exchange Act. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
	Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
	reporting as of March 31, 2017. In making this assessment, management used
	the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
	Commission (COSO) in the 2013

	Internal ControlIntegrated Framework

	.

	Table
	of Contents




	     Based on our assessment using the criteria set forth
	by COSO in the 2013

	Internal ControlIntegrated Framework

	, management
	concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as
	of March 31, 2017. Our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31,
	2017 has been audited by Grant Thornton LLP, an independent registered public
	accounting firm, as stated in their report contained in Item 8 included elsewhere
	herein.


	     Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
	and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our internal control over financial
	reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how
	well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
	that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control
	system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits
	of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent
	limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
	assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVE have
	been detected. Our internal controls over financial reporting, however, are designed
	to provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of internal control over financial
	reporting are met.



	Changes in Internal Controls


	     During the quarter ended March 31, 2017, there
	was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that materially
	affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
	financial reporting.

	REPORT
	OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM





	 

	Board of Directors and Shareholders

	NVE Corporation


	We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of NVE Corporation
	(a Minnesota corporation) (the Company) as of March 31, 2017,
	based on criteria established in the 2013

	Internal
	ControlIntegrated Framework

	issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
	Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management
	is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
	and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
	reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control
	over Financial Reporting (Managements Report). Our responsibility
	is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial
	reporting based on our audit.


	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
	Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
	and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal
	control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
	audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
	assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
	design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
	and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.


	A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
	to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
	and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
	with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control
	over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
	to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
	reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
	reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
	of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
	and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
	with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
	reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
	acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have
	a material effect on the financial statements.


	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
	may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
	effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
	inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
	with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.


	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
	control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2017, based on criteria
	established in the 2013

	Internal ControlIntegrated Framework

	issued
	by COSO.


	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
	Oversight Board (United States), the financial statements of the Company as of
	and for the year ended March 31, 2017, and our report dated May 3, 2017
	expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

	REPORT
	OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM




	 

	Board of Directors and Shareholders

	NVE Corporation


	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of NVE Corporation (a Minnesota
	corporation) (the Company) as of March 31, 2017 and 2016, and the
	related statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders equity,
	and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2017.
	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management.
	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
	on our audits.


	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
	Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
	and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
	statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on
	a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
	statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
	significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
	statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
	for our opinion.


	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
	all material respects, the financial position of NVE Corporation as of March 31,
	2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each
	of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2017 in conformity with accounting
	principles generally accepted in the United States of America.


	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
	Oversight Board (United States), the Companys internal control over financial
	reporting as of March 31, 2017, based on criteria established in the 2013

	Internal ControlIntegrated Framework

	issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
	Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated May 3,
	2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

	NVE
	CORPORATION



	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	 




	NOTE 1.
	DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS


	     We develop and sell devices that use spintronics,
	a nanotechnology that relies on electron spin rather than electron charge to acquire,
	store, and transmit information. We operate in one reportable segment.





	NOTE 2.
	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

	Cash and Cash Equivalents


	     We consider all highly liquid investments with maturities
	of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.



	Fair Value of Financial Instruments


	     The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents,
	accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximates fair value because of the
	short maturity of these instruments. Fair values of marketable securities are
	based on quoted market prices.



	Marketable Securities


	     All of the investments we have held the past two
	years were marketable securities. We classify securities with original maturities
	greater than three months and remaining maturities one year or less as short-term
	marketable securities and securities with remaining maturities greater than one
	year as long-term marketable securities. We classify all of our marketable securities
	as available-for-sale, thus securities are recorded at fair value and any associated
	unrealized gain or loss, net of tax, is included as a separate component of shareholders
	equity, Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We use a specific-identification
	cost basis to determine gains and losses. The amortized cost of marketable securities
	is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity,
	both of which are included in interest income.


	     We consider an other-than-temporary impairment of
	our marketable securities to exist if we determine it is probable that we will
	be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of a debt
	security. If we judged a decline in fair value for any security to be other than
	temporary, the cost basis of the individual security would be written down and
	a charge recognized in net income. We consider a number of factors in determining
	whether other-than-temporary impairment exists, including: credit market conditions;
	the credit ratings of the securities; historical default rates for securities
	of comparable credit rating; the presence of insurance of the securities and,
	if insured, the credit rating and financial condition of the insurer; the effect
	of market interest rates on the value of the securities; and the duration and
	extent of any unrealized losses. We also consider the likelihood that we will
	be required to sell the securities prior to maturity based on our financial condition
	and anticipated cash flows. We determined that no write-downs for other-than-temporary
	impairment were required on available-for-sale securities during fiscal 2017,
	2016, or 2015.



	Concentration of Risk and Financial Instruments


	     Financial instruments potentially subject to significant
	concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, marketable
	securities, and accounts receivable.


	     Cash and cash equivalents have been maintained in
	financial institutions we believe have high credit quality, however these accounts
	are generally in excess of federally insured amounts.


	     We have invested our excess cash in corporate-backed
	and municipal-backed bonds and money market instruments. Our investment policy
	prescribes purchases of only high-grade securities, and limits the amount of credit
	exposure to any one issuer.


	     Our customers are throughout the world. We generally
	do not require collateral from our customers, but we perform ongoing credit evaluations
	of their financial condition. More information on accounts receivable is contained
	in the paragraph titled Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
	of this note.


	     Additionally, we are dependent on critical suppliers
	including our packaging vendors and suppliers of certain raw silicon and semiconductor
	wafers that are incorporated in our products.



	Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts


	     We grant credit to customers in the normal course
	of business and at times may require customers to prepay for an order prior to
	shipment. Accounts receivable are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts.
	We make estimates of the uncollectibility of accounts receivable. We specifically
	analyze accounts receivable, historical bad debts, and customer creditworthiness
	when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance. We had no charges or provisions
	to our allowance for doubtful accounts in fiscal 2017, 2016, or 2015.

	Table
	of Contents



	 


	Inventories


	     Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net
	realizable value. Cost is determined by the first in, first out method. We record
	inventory reserves when we determine certain inventory is unlikely to be sold
	based on sales trends, turnover, competition, and other market factors.

	 


	Product Warranty


	     In general we warranty our products to be free from
	defects in material and workmanship for one year.



	Fixed Assets


	     Fixed assets are stated at cost. Depreciation of
	machinery and equipment is recorded over the estimated useful lives of the assets,
	generally five years, using the straight-line method. Amortization of leasehold
	improvements is recorded using the straight-line method over the lesser of the
	lease term or five-year useful life. We record losses on long-lived assets used
	in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash
	flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets
	carrying amount. We have not identified any indicators of impairment during fiscal
	2017, 2016, or 2015. Depreciation and amortization expense related to fixed assets
	was $798,300 for fiscal 2017, $850,970 for 2016, and $934,371 for fiscal 2015.



	Revenue Recognition




	Product Sales Revenue Recognition



	     We recognize product sales revenue when evidence
	of an arrangement exists, the price to the buyer is fixed and determinable, collectability
	is reasonably assured and the product has shipped. Our sales are shipped FOB shipping
	point, meaning that our customers (end users and distributors) take title and
	assume the risks and rewards of ownership on shipment. Our customers may return
	defective products for refund or replacement under warranty, and have other very
	limited rights of return.


	     Shipping charges billed to customers are included
	in product sales and the related shipping costs are included in selling, general,
	and administrative expense. Such shipping costs were $12,760 for fiscal 2017,
	$20,721 for fiscal 2016, and $12,771 for fiscal 2015.


	     Our stocking distributors take title and assume
	the risks and rewards of product ownership. Payments from our distributors are
	not contingent on resale or any other matter other than the passage of time, and
	delivery of products is not dependent on the number of units resold to the ultimate
	customer. There are no other significant acceptance criteria, pricing or payment
	terms that would affect revenue recognition.




	Accounting for Commissions and Discounts



	     We sometimes utilize independent sales representatives
	that provide services relating to promoting our products and facilitating product
	sales but do not purchase our products. We pay commissions to sales representatives
	based on the amount of revenue facilitated, and such commissions are recorded
	as selling, general, and administrative expenses. Under certain limited circumstances,
	our distributors may earn commissions for activities unrelated to their purchases
	of our products, such as for facilitating the sale of custom products or research
	and development contracts with third parties. We recognize any such commissions
	as selling, general, and administrative expenses.


	     We presume consideration given to a customer is
	a reduction in revenue unless both of the following conditions are met: (i) we
	receive an identifiable benefit in exchange for the consideration and the identifiable
	benefit is sufficiently separable from the customers purchase of our products
	such that we could have purchased the products or services from a third party;
	and (ii) we can reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit received.
	We recognize discounts provided to our distributors as reductions in revenue.




	Contract Research and Development Revenue Recognition



	     We recognize contract research and development revenue
	pro-rata as work progresses. Our research and development contracts do not contain
	post-shipment obligations. Contracts may be either firm-fixed-price or cost-plus-fixed-fee.
	Firm-fixed-price contracts provide for a price that is not subject to any adjustment
	based on our cost in performing the contract.


	     Cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts are cost-reimbursement
	contracts that also provide for payment to us of a negotiated fee that is fixed
	at the inception of the contract. The costs for which we earn reimbursement are
	the actual costs incurred and are recorded in the period in which they are incurred.
	We recognize the contract fees pro-rata as work progresses.

	Income Taxes


	     We account for income taxes using the liability
	method. Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between the
	financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. We provide valuation
	allowances against deferred tax assets if we determine that it is less likely
	than not that we will be able to utilize the deferred tax assets.

	 


	Research and Development Expense Recognition


	     Research and development costs are expensed as they
	are incurred.

	 


	Stock-Based Compensation


	     We measure stock-based compensation cost at the
	grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize the compensation
	expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period.
	We estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures at the time of grant by analyzing historical
	data and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ
	from those estimates. Ultimately, the total expense recognized over the vesting
	period will only be for those awards that vest.



	Net Income Per Share


	     Net income per basic share is computed based on
	the weighted-average number of common shares issued and outstanding during each
	year. Net income per diluted share amounts assume conversion, exercise or issuance
	of all potential common stock instruments. Stock options were the only such instruments
	for the three most recent fiscal years. Stock options totaling 4,000 for fiscal
	2017, 6,000 for fiscal 2016, and 4,000 for fiscal 2015 were not included in the
	computation of diluted earnings per share because the exercise prices were greater
	than the market price of the common stock. The following table shows the components
	of diluted shares:

	Use of Estimates


	     The preparation of financial statements in conformity
	with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates
	and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
	accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


	Recently Issued Accounting Standards


	     In March 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards
	Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU)
	No. 2017-08,

	Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Subtopic 310-20)Premium
	Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities

	. This ASU is intended to
	enhance the accounting for the amortization of premiums for purchased callable
	debt securities. ASU 2017-08s amendments are effective for fiscal years
	beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years,
	which will be fiscal 2020 for us. We do not expect adoption of ASU 2017-08
	to have a significant impact on our financial statements.


	     In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,

	Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts
	and Cash Payments

	, which will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts
	and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.
	ASU 2016-15 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
	2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years, which will be fiscal 2019
	for us. ASU 2016-15 requires retrospective adoption unless it is impracticable
	to apply, in which case it is to be applied prospectively as of the earliest practicable
	date. We do not expect adoption of ASU 2016-15 to have a significant impact
	on our financial statements.


	     In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,

	Financial
	InstrumentsCredit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial
	Statements

	. This ASU requires a financial asset (or a group of financial assets)
	measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to
	be collected. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted
	from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset(s) to present the net carrying
	value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. The amendment
	is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
	December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those fiscal years, which will be
	fiscal 2021 for us. We do not expect adoption of ASU 2016-13 to have a significant
	impact on our financial statements.

	 

	     In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,

	CompensationStock Compensation

	, which simplifies the accounting for
	the taxes related to stock based compensation, including adjustments to how excess
	tax benefits and a companys payments for tax withholdings should be classified.
	The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and
	interim periods within those fiscal years, which will be fiscal 2018 for us. We
	do not expect adoption of ASU 2016-09 to have a significant impact on our
	financial statements.

	    &nbspIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,

	Lease Accounting

	. ASU 2016-02 requires recognition of lease assets and
	lease liabilities on the balance sheet of lessees. This update is effective for
	financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
	2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years, which will be fiscal 2020
	for us. ASU 2016-02 requires a modified retrospective transition approach
	and provides certain optional transition relief. We have not yet evaluated the
	impact of ASU 2016-02 on our financial statements.


	     In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,

	Financial InstrumentsOverall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial
	Assets and Financial Liabilities

	. The amendment changes the accounting for
	and financial statement presentation of equity investments, other than those accounted
	for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation
	of the investee. The amendment provides clarity on the measurement methodology
	to be used for the required disclosure of fair value of financial instruments
	measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet and clarifies that an entity should
	evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to
	available-for-sale securities in combination with the entitys other deferred
	tax assets, among other changes. The amendment is effective for financial statements
	issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods
	within those fiscal years, which will be fiscal 2019 for us. We do not expect
	adoption of ASU 2016-01 to have a significant impact on our financial statements.

	 

	     In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,

	Simplifying
	the Measurement of Inventory

	. ASU 2015-11 requires inventory that is
	recorded using the first-in, first-out method to be measured at the lower of cost
	or net realizable value. ASU 2015-11 will be effective prospectively for
	our fiscal 2018, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect adoption of ASU 2015-11
	to have a significant impact on our financial statements.

	 

	     In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU  No. 2014-09,
	which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards
	Codification 605,

	Revenue Recognition

	. ASU 2014-09 is based on the
	principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services
	to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity
	expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. It also requires
	additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue
	and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments
	and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or
	fulfill a contract. The guidance permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively
	to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative
	effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application.
	In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,

	Revenue from Contracts
	with Customers: Deferral of the Effective Date

	, which deferred the effective
	date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. As a result, ASU 2014-09 is effective
	for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within
	those fiscal years, which will be fiscal 2019 for us. Based on our preliminary
	assessment, we do not expect adoption of ASU 2014-09 to have a significant
	impact on our financial statements, because we do not expect to change the manner
	or timing of recognizing revenue. We recognize revenue on product sales to customers
	and distributors when we satisfy our performance obligations as the products are
	shipped. We recognize contract research and development revenue pro-rata as work
	progresses, and our research and development contracts do not contain post-shipment
	obligations.

	NOTE 3.
	FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS


	     Generally accepted accounting principles establish
	a framework for measuring fair value, provide a definition of fair value and prescribe
	required disclosures about fair-value measurements. Generally accepted accounting
	principles define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset
	or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement that
	should be determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing
	an asset or liability. Generally accepted accounting principles utilize a valuation
	hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements. The categorization within
	the valuation hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant
	to the fair value measurement. The valuation hierarchy categories are as follows:


	     Level 1  Financial instruments with quoted
	prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Our Level 1
	financial instruments consist of publicly-traded marketable corporate debt
	securities, which are classified as available-for-sale. On the balance sheets,
	these securities are included in Marketable securities, short term
	and Marketable securities, long term. The fair value of our Level 1
	marketable securities was $75,098,153 as of March 31, 2017 and $84,045,869
	as of March 31, 2016.


	     Level 2  Financial instruments with quoted
	prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities. Level 2 fair
	value measurements are determined using either prices for similar instruments
	or inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable, such as interest
	rates. We had one Level 2 financial instrument, a municipal debt security,
	which is classified as available-for-sale. The fair value of the Level 2
	marketable security was $1,304,603 as of March 31, 2017 and $1,346,850 as
	of March 31, 2016. The security is included in Marketable securities,
	short term on the March 31, 2017 balance sheet, and Marketable
	securities, long term on the March 31, 2016 balance sheet.


	     Level 3  Inputs to the fair value measurement
	are unobservable inputs or valuation techniques. We do not have any financial
	assets or liabilities being measured at fair value that are classified as Level 3
	financial instruments.

	      Gross unrealized losses totaled $247,149 as
	of March 31, 2017, and were attributed to nine corporate bonds and a municipal bond
	out of a portfolio of 23 bonds. The gross unrealized losses were due to market-price
	decreases after the bonds were purchased.


	     None of our securities had been in continuous unrealized
	loss positions for 12 months or greater. All of the bonds we held had investment-grade
	credit ratings by Moodys or Standard and Poors. Because we expect
	to recover the cost basis of investments held, we do not consider any of our marketable
	securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of March 31, 2017.

	NOTE 6. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

	Stock Option Plan


	     Our 2000 Stock Option Plan, as amended, provides
	for issuance to employees, directors, and certain service providers of incentive
	stock options and nonstatutory stock options. Generally, the options may be exercised
	at any time prior to expiration, subject to vesting based on terms of employment.
	The period ranges from immediate vesting to vesting over a five-year period. The
	options have exercisable lives ranging from one year to ten years from the date
	of grant, and are generally not eligible to vest early in the event of retirement,
	death, disability, or change in control. Exercise prices are not less than fair
	market value of the underlying Common Stock at the date the options are granted.
	Stock-based compensation expense was $22,000 in fiscal 2017, $21,160 in fiscal
	2016, and $58,960 in fiscal 2015.



	Valuation assumptions


	     We use the Black-Scholes standard option-pricing
	model to determine the fair value of stock options. The following assumptions
	were used to estimate the fair value of options granted:











	Year
	Ended March 31






	2017






	2016






	2015





	Risk-free interest rate


	1.0


	%




	1.6


	%

	%




	Expected volatility

	Expected life (years)

	Dividend yield


	7.0


	%




	7.1


	%




	0


	%





	 

	     The determination of the fair value of the awards
	on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model is affected by our stock price
	as well as assumptions of other variables, including projected stock option exercise
	behaviors, risk-free interest rate, and expected volatility of our stock price
	in future periods. Our estimates and assumptions affect the amounts reported in
	the financial statements and accompanying notes.




	Expected life



	     We analyze historical exercise and termination data
	to estimate the expected life assumption. We believe historical data currently
	represents the best estimate of the expected life of a new option.




	Risk-free interest rate



	     The risk-free rate is based on the yield of U.S.
	Treasury securities on the grant date for maturities similar to the expected lives
	of the options.




	Volatility



	     We use historical volatility to estimate the expected
	volatility of our common stock.




	Dividend yield



	     We assumed a dividend yield of 7.0% for fiscal 2017
	and 7.1% for fiscal 2016, based on the dividend yield on the date the options
	were granted. We assumed a dividend yield of zero for fiscal 2015 because we had
	no plans to pay dividends at the time options were granted.



	Tax effects of stock-based compensation


	     Stock-based compensation increased deferred tax
	assets by $7,993 for fiscal 2017 and $7,688 for fiscal 2016.

	     Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects

	for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.

	     Realizations of stock-based compensation deductions
	are credited to Additional paid-in capital and included in Tax
	benefit of stock-based compensation on our statements of shareholders
	equity. Credits of $32,616 in fiscal 2017 and $352,294 in fiscal 2016 were attributed
	to stock-based compensation deductions. The Additional paid-in capital
	credits also included the tax benefit of stock-based compensation deductions in
	those years.


	     The amounts credited to Additional paid-in
	capital were the tax benefits of the deductions to the extent they exceeded
	the corresponding compensation expense recognized for financial reporting purposes.
	Tax benefit of stock-based compensation represented the tax benefits
	of deductions for stock-based compensation to the extent they exceeded the corresponding
	compensation expense recognized for financial reporting purposes. Cash we received
	from the exercise of stock options related to excess tax benefits is included
	in Proceeds from sale of common stock in the statement of cash flows
	for the year in which the option was exercised and cash received.


	     We had no unrecognized tax benefits as of March 31,
	2017, and we do not expect any significant unrecognized tax benefits within 12 months
	of the reporting date. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax
	matters in income tax expense. As of March 31, 2017 we had no accrued interest
	related to uncertain tax positions. The tax years 1999 and 2013 through
	2016 remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to
	which we are subject.

NVE Corp/Isolation Products
		- NVE is an electronics component manufacturer specializing in the combination of magnetically-sensitive materials with integrated circuits. This new solid-state magnetic technology is characterized by high sensitivity to magnetic fields coupled with small size and low power. NVE has applied these technologies to magnetic sensors, isolators and Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory (MRAM). These components often outperform existing devices, providing both cost-effective and performance-enhanced solutions to sensing and data transmission applications. NVE is ISO 9001 certified.

Since its founding in 1989 with technology from Honeywell International, NVE has become a recognized world leader in magnetically sensitive material research. In 1994, NVE introduced the world's first products using Giant Magnetoresistive (GMR) material. This product line, magnetic field sensors, is used for position, magnetic media, wheel speed and current sensing applications. 

Similarly, in 1999, NVE introduced its IsoLoop® product line of high-speed digital isolators for communications, industrial controls and computer applications. These 100 megabaud opto- replacement isolators are the fastest available in the world.		Request Quote Form

For Sale By Inventor Inventor Disclosure Your ideas are safe.



The purpose of the Inventor Disclosure is to inform inventors that the process of creating a new product/concept and developing it into a commercial success is extremely difficult, time consuming, often frustrating, confusing and usually costly. To succeed, inventors normally must accomplish, at a high level: the legal process (patents, copyrights, trademarks, etc); engineering, scientific or technical factors; production concerns; and, market distribution.  For an individual inventor, this can be a daunting task and should be carefully considered before risking talents, time, energies and capital.
Although an inventor can always represent themselves, inventors are strongly encouraged to seek advice and assistance only from licensed professionals. For Sale By Inventor’s mission is to provide coordinated, professional services for inventors to help launch their invention ideas into new products onto the market.
For Sale By Inventor specializes in consulting, researching and educating small and micro entity inventors. For Sale By Inventor never evaluates an invention in terms of potential marketability.
For Sale By Inventor refers all patent and engineering work to Montgomery Patent & Design on behalf of inventor clients. Advertising, virtual prototypes, websites and representation services are provided by Advertising – Generation, LLC through their proprietary website ForSaleByInventor.com.  This process ensures a coordinated effort and complete confidentiality.
For Sale By Inventor and any related entities neither singularly nor collectively, considers itself to be an invention promoter or developer; regardless, the following is disclosed in the spirit of full disclosure.
The total number of inventors who contacted For Sale By Inventor and any related entities over the past 5 years is approximately 125,000; from that total, approximately 60,000 submitted ideas for review with about 12,000 offered contracts for research services; resulting in 3,974 contracting for professional research services. Following research, 2,162 received positive professional opinions of patentability and feasibility and were proffered development agreements. 1,127 inventors contracted for some combination of our patent, engineering and marketing services.
Of the total clients contracting for our services, 53 received licensing agreements and 27 have reported a net financial profit while hundreds of cases still remain active. Licensing is just one option that an inventor can pursue to commercialize their invention and was not pursued by clients who only contracted for legal, engineering or sales representation services. An additional 182 inventions have reported commercial success meaning that they either have been or are currently available for sale. Since these clients have no obligation to report their specific financial records to us, we are not aware of how many of these have made more than they spent on their invention.
DISCLAIMER: Past performance of professional services can provide no guarantee of future profits or that anyone will agree to purchase, license, produce or distribute any invention idea. Bringing an invention from an idea to marketed product is a high risk venture.
