This is the story of Dave Peters' 33-year railroad career.  Dave worked a variety of jobs at the railroad repair shops in New Haven, CT.  Hiring out on the New Haven Railroad in 1961, Dave became a Penn Central employee in 1969 and then worked for Amtrak.  During the course of his long career, Dave repaired car wheels, maintained car and locomotive air brake systems, and serviced locomotives.

Dave is a well-known railroad historian, archivist, and collector who has a private "rail road" museum in his home.  He lives in Wallingford, CT with his wife Barbara.

"Dave Peters: Railroader" is a 6" x 9" perfect-bound softcover containing 151 pages.  It's of interest to anybody who's interested in the New Haven Railroad, Penn Central, Amtrak, or railroad history in general.

                                "Non Operating" Excellent story of the non operating crafts. Dave Peters feels the same way that most of us operating employees felt about PennCentral. We hated PennCentral. Most of us love the New Haven and read and write about it all the time. Good book Dave. I hope other people write about their experiences on the railroads in a very changing environment.  Don Forbes  http://www.lulu.com/forbes

Your future as a professional educator includes the responsibility to help your students meet the demands and challenges of society, and the elementary and middle school classroom is where it all begins.  It is your job to build the skills, content knowledge, and desire for inquiry that will allow your students to function in a society that will be highly scientific and technologically developed.  T his new edition of  Methods for Teaching Elementary School Science    has been crafted to help you do just that.    Focusing on the methods of teaching elementary and middle school science, the text centers on why science education is basic to children’s schooling and explains the foundations that give it form and substance. Each of the eight chapters develops a broad concept or a cluster of related teaching skills through descriptions and the use of many real-life examples.       The chapters and special features should enable you to     Decide what areas of science are basic, useful, and curious to children.   Recognize and assess differences in children’s thinking.   Use open-ended and closed-ended teaching activities in planning and implementing lessons and units.   Improve children’s scientific skills.   Develop technological applications.   Locate and use a variety of resources to teach science.   Arrange and manage learning centers, computer centers, and projects.   Assess science teaching.        Each chapter focuses on an overall concept such as learning, assessment, or technology. Practical teaching tips are highlighted and sprinkled throughout each chapter, and teaching concepts are aligned to the National Research Council’s National Science Education Standards. In addition, learning objectives are linked to the American Association for the Advancement of Science’s (AAAS) Benchmarks for Science Literacy, which are cited throughout the text when applicable. To help summarize and extend the content, each chapter includes a summary, reflection, and additional readings.        A Closer Look at the Text’s Features         Modeling Inquiry Teaching    By taking you into successful inquiry-based classrooms, we contextualize the concepts being covered and help you envision your own constructivist science classroom.         {ed: insert CD logo in margin}   Free CD-ROM   Science in Elementary Education: Visit an Inquiry Classroom,  containing footage of master teacher Glenn McKnight, models constructivist teaching and successful, inquiry-based science classroom management.     Visit an Inquiry Classroom  features throughout chapters integrate the chapter content, CD footage, and the text’s Companion Website.   Portfolio questions relating to the CD are found at the end of each Part I chapter.     {ed: insert CW logo in margin}  More CD-related activities are available on the text ’s Companion Website.     Focus on Inquiry  vignettes beginning every chapter and peppered throughout provide you with a glimpse of meaningful science lessons.         Addressing Today’s Science Teaching Realities    Today’s science teachers must be accountable to state and national standards as they ensure their teaching meets the needs of every learner in their classroom.      Benchmarks and Standards  features throughout chapters help you see how to integrate the National Science Education Standards in your own teaching.     Teaching Tips  throughout chapters provide starting points, suggest activities, and consider safety to help you master constructivist science teaching.         Supplements     {ed: insert CD icon in margin}   CD-ROM   Science in Elementary Education: Visit an Inquiry Classroom    By modeling a constructivist, inquiry approach to teaching science, master teacher Glenn McKnight and his lively 4th graders illustrate science teaching and learning at its best and most effective.        CD Features   The CD footage helps you envision all aspects of inquiry science teaching by exploring   ·         A model inquiry unit   ·         The nature of science   ·         Constructivist pedagogy   ·         Lesson planning and classroom management       Each topic illustrates its component parts through nine video clips.  To truly understand the construction and implementation of a Model Inquiry, for example, you’ll be able to watch footage of   ·         Instructional planning   ·         Preparing resources   ·         An invitation to explore   ·         Team formation   ·         Inquiry exploration   ·         Concept invention   ·         Concept application   ·         Ongoing assessment   ·         Putting it all together - 4 days of science       Accompanying every piece of footage are the perspectives of text author Joseph Peters, teacher Glenn McKnight, a teaching colleague, and fourth-grade students.  Each voice interprets what he or she sees in each clip, helping you notice the details of teaching and learning.  Quotes from the professional literature identify research that supports McKnight’s teaching discussions, stimulating further thinking about the video contents.       Additional Features   ·         Bonus lessons on the CD provide you with meaningful lessons you can use right in your own classroom.   ·         Links to the Internet allow you to move back and forth between the CD and the Companion Website, where more questions and lessons connect the footage to the text material and to your own classroom.   ·         Look for CD icons throughout the text to point you toward features, reflection questions, and applications that will help you make the most of this meaningful media.   ·         Visit an Inquiry Classroom features in the text lead you to reflect on specific clips in terms of their relation to the chapter concepts.  Answer questions about these clips on our Companion Website.   ·         Chapter ending questions help you make connections between the material you learned in the chapter and the footage you find on the CD.        Companion Website    This robust online support system offers many rich and meaningful ways to deepen and expand the information presented to you in the text.     Focus Questions provide a useful advanced organizer for each chapter’s online companion.
