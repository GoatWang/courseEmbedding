Mining :: Trecora Resources (TREC)

Mining
The Al Masane project consists of a mining lease area of approximately 44 square kilometers in southwestern Saudi Arabia approximately 640 km southeast of Jeddah. The Saudi government granted ARSD a thirty (30) year mining lease which commenced on May 22, 1993 with the option to renew or extend the term of the lease for additional periods not to exceed twenty (20) years. Presently, the site can be accessed by heavy trucks via the 20 kilometer improved asphalt road from Sifah. The elevation of the Al Masane project is approximately 1,620 meters above sea level.
The Al Masane project contains extensive ancient mineral workings and smelters which were discovered by Hatem El-Khalidi, President and CEO of the Company while flying over the area and later mapped by him on camel back during 1967. From ancient inscriptions in the area, it is believed that mining activities went on sporadically from 1000 BC to 700 AD. The ancients are believed to have extracted mainly gold, silver and copper. Various regional investigations of the Al Masane area have been carried out by the United States Geological Survey ("USGS") mission.
The Company and eight Saudi investors formed a Saudi joint stock company under the name Al Masane Al Kobra Mining Company (AMAK) and received a commercial license from the Ministry of Commerce in January 2008. The Company's mining lease has been transferred to AMAK and AMAK is building the mining and treatment facilities, and will operate the mine. The Saudi investors have contributed capital of USD$60 million cash and have loaned AMAK another USD $12 million while financing is being pursued with the Saudi Industrial Development Fund (the SIDF). The SIDF issued a letter of commitment for USD$88 million in June of 2010 with certain conditions to be met prior to closing. The expected closing date is January 5, 2011. AMAK has all powers of administration over the Al Masane mining project. The Company has four directors representing its interests on an eight person board of directors with the Chairman of AMAK (holding the tie breaking vote) chosen from the directors representing the Saudi investors. The original documents are in Arabic, and English translations have been provided to the parties.

Overview
Trecora Resources, formerly Arabian American Development Company, was incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1967. The Company’s principal business activities are the manufacturing of various specialty petrochemical products and synthetic waxes and the provision of custom processing services.
The Company also owns a 33.4% interest in Al Masane Al Kobra Mining Company, a Saudi Arabian closed joint stock mining company which is in commercial production of copper and zinc concentrate and a 55% interest in Pioche Ely Valley Mines, Inc., a Nevada mining corporation which presently does not conduct any substantial business activity but owns undeveloped properties in the United States.
Our specialty petrochemical products segment is conducted through South Hampton Resources, Inc., a Texas corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Texas Oil & Chemical Co. II, Inc. South Hampton owns and operates a specialty petrochemical facility near Silsbee, Texas which produces high purity hydrocarbons and other petroleum based products including isopentane, normal pentane, isohexane and hexane which may be used in the production of polyethylene, packaging, polypropylene, expandable polystyrene, poly-iso/urethane foams, crude oil from the Canadian tar sands, and in the catalyst support industry. Our petrochemical products are typically transported to customers by rail car, tank truck and iso-container. South Hampton owns all of the capital stock of Gulf State Pipe Line Company, Inc., a Texas corporation, which owns and operates pipelines that connect the South Hampton facility to a natural gas line, to South Hampton’s truck and rail loading terminal and to a major petroleum products pipeline owned by an unaffiliated third party.
Our specialty synthetic wax segment is conducted through Trecora Chemical, Inc., a Texas corporation, located in Pasadena, Texas which produces specialty polyethylene and poly alpha olefin waxes and provides custom processing services. The specialty polyethylene waxes are used in markets from paints and inks to adhesives, coatings, and PVC lubricants. The highly specialized synthetic poly alpha olefin waxes are used in applications such as toner in printers and as additives for candles providing rigidity and retention of fragrances. These waxes are sold in solid form as pastilles or, for large adhesive companies, in bulk liquid form.
