Published on Feb 5, 2015Alan Wake has many real-world brands: Microsoft, Verizon, Ford, Verizon (most infamously). However, Coleman lanterns also exist in-game. They are barely noticeable, making it somewhat rewarding when you realize they were made by Coleman. I didn't even know this until my 4th or 5th playthrough.Song- "Going up the country" by Canned HeatI apologize for my idiotic misspelling of "dual-fuel" as "duel-fuel". If you couldn't tell, I'm a major Coleman/Alan Wake fan.

Dr. Alan Colman recently retired from his position as Executive Director of the Singapore Stem Cell Consortium and a Principal Investigator at the A*STAR Institute of Medical Biology, in Singapore, having recently and concurrently acted as Professor of Regenerative Medicine at King’s College, London, UK. His main interest was the development of human disease models using induced pluripotent stem cells.
Alan Colman obtained a BA degree in Biochemistry in Oxford (1971) and a PhD under John Gurdon, a pioneer of the field of nuclear transfer, at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK (1974).
After a series of academic appointments in Oxford and Warwick Universities, he became Professor of Biochemistry in the University of Birmingham, UK from 1987-1992. The focus of his academic career was the area of eucaryotic protein secretion, with a particular emphasis on the use of frog oocytes and eggs as in vivo test tubes.
From 1987 until March 2002, he was research director of the company PPL Therapeutics in Edinburgh, UK. This company specialized in the production of transgenic livestock that produced human therapeutic proteins in their milk PPL attracted considerable media attention because of their participation, together with the Roslin Institute, in the technique of somatic nuclear transfer. This work led to Dolly, the world’s first sheep cloned from an adult somatic cell (1996), Polly and Molly, the first cloned transgenic livestock (1997), Diana and Cupid, the first livestock with targeted genetic changes (2000), Millie et al., the first cloned pigs (2000) and, finally, Austin and crew, the first homozygous, alpha gal transferase knock out pigs (2003).
From 2002-2007, he was CSO and then CEO for the Singaporean human embryonic stem cell company, ES Cell International.

Alan Colman, Ph.D.


	Executive Director, Singapore Stem Cell Consortium and Principal Investigator, A*STAR Institute of Medical Biology, Singapore, and Professor of Regenerative Medicine, King's College, University of London, UK


Visit the Colman Lab



	Alan Colman is currently the Executive Director of the Singapore Stem Cell Consortium and a Principal Investigator in the Singapore A*STAR Institute of Medical Biology, Singapore. He is also Professor of Regenerative Medicine and Director of the Stem Cell Centre, King's College London, UK After nearly 20 years in the commercial sector (see below), he has recently embarked on a new line of academic research which will involve the differentiation of human (hESC) and mouse embryonic or embryonic-like (induced pluripotential stem cells-iPSC) stem cells that harbor deleterious mutations known in humans to cause distinctive pathological conditions. Neurodegenerative disease will comprise a major focus.

	Alan Colman obtained a BA degree in Biochemistry in Oxford (1971) and a PhD under John Gurdon, a pioneer of the field of nuclear transfer, at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK (1974). After a series of academic appointments in Oxford and Warwick Universities, he became Professor of Biochemistry in the University of Birmingham, UK. The focus of his academic career was the area of eukaryotic protein secretion, with a particular emphasis on the use of frog oocytes and eggs as in vivo test tubes.

	From 1987 until March 2002, he was research director of the company PPL Therapeutics in Edinburgh, UK. This company specialized in the production of transgenic livestock that produced human therapeutic proteins in their milk. PPL attracted considerable media attention because of its participation, together with the Roslin Institute, in the technique of somatic nuclear transfer. This work led to Dolly, the world's first sheep cloned from an adult somatic cell (1996), Polly and Molly, the first cloned transgenic livestock (1997), Diana and Cupid, the first livestock with targeted genetic changes (2000), Millie et al., the first cloned pigs (2000) and, finally, Austin and crew, the first homozygous alpha-gal-transferase knock-out pigs (2003).

	From April 2002 - June 2007, he worked for the Singapore - based company, ES Cell International (ESI), first as its Chief Scientific Officer (April 2002 - February 2005) and then its Chief Executive Officer (February 2005 - June 2007). ESI specialized in the development of human embryonic stem cell-based therapies for the treatment of diabetes and congestive heart failure. In Nov 2007, it published the first report on the derivation of clinically-compliant hESC in Cell Stem Cell.
