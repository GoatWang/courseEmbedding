NEW YORK and SAN DIEGO, July 22, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Promosome LLC ("Promosome"), a privately-held synthetic biology company focusing on a pipeline of first-in-class biotherapeutics and biosimilars which incorporate its unique, mRNA-based bioproduction tools, has appointed Christopher C. LeMasters as chief executive officer.  
Mr. LeMasters joins Promosome after founding and serving in senior management positions at several San Diego-based therapeutics companies.  Most recently, he was co-founder and chief business officer of Tragara Pharmaceuticals, a clinical-stage cancer therapeutics company.  Mr. LeMasters also served as co-founder and chief business officer of Cabrellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., where he negotiated its acquisition by Pharmion Corporation for $104 million, and as vice president, corporate development of Conforma Therapeutics, where he negotiated its acquisition by Biogen IDEC for $250 million.  Mr. LeMasters also worked in the corporate business development group at Eli Lilly & Company and was responsible for the successful negotiation of numerous partnerships and licenses across a range of therapeutic areas.  Earlier in his career, he was a management consultant with Coopers & Lybrand Consulting and an operational auditor with Owens Corning.  
Mr. LeMasters currently serves as a board member of Aarden Pharmaceuticals, where he is also a co-founder, and as a board member of the Hoosier Cancer Research Network, a clinical research organization. 
Regarding his new role, Mr. LeMasters said, "It is a privilege to join such a world-class team of innovators and lead the company's development of its expanding biotherapeutics pipeline.  I am deeply impressed with the continued advancement of Promosome's proprietary mRNA engineering technologies and pleased with how well this platform translates into important human therapeutics."
William J. Gedale, Chairman of Promosome's Board of Managers said, "Chris has a compelling combination of Big Pharma and small company experience, which is beneficial in managing people and operations, as well as deal-making experience with large, global industry players.  His discernible enthusiasm for leading Promosome into its next phase of growth is already having a positive impact on the organization." 
Mr. LeMasters will report to the Board of Managers and become a member of board.  He will join John F. Manzello, who will continue to serve as president and member of the board.  All members of senior management are looking forward to accelerating Promosome's biotherapeutics program while continuing to expand the commercialization of Promosome's bioproduction tools in non-mammalian manufacturing platforms.
