Integrated Freight Corporation Launches New Website


Becomes Fully XBRL Compliant
DANBURY, CT / ACCESSWIRE / January 5, 2016 / Integrated Freight Corporation (OTC PINK: IFCR) today announces that it has launched its new website at integratedfreightinc.com.
David N. Fuselier, CEO of Integrated Freight, said, "We are very excited to launch our new site after months of development. This new mobile-friendly, interactive design, is not only gorgeous but incorporates features and capabilities that will attract and retain new drivers, and acquisition candidates, as well as maintain our ongoing regulatory compliance."
Hank Hoffman, President and COO of Integrated Freight, said, "We have taken a significant amount of time to get our new site right, and the results speak for themselves. This initial platform provides an attractive look as well as a load of information and enhanced interactive functionality. The site also contains integrated social media buttons for our Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn pages to foster improved communication."
Company officials at web developer VoiceFlix pointed out that since the site is freshly launched it might take up to 24-48 hours for DNS propagation to complete so the website can be seamlessly viewed from anywhere in the world. It would similarly take a week or two for search engines to show it at the top of search results for Integrated Freight.
