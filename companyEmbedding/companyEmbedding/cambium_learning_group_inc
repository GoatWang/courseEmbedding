All subsidiaries, of which Voyager is the largest, handle their own product-related technology operations; employees of the parent company perform all other IT operations.

Cambium Learning Group has consolidated its enterprise systems into a cohesive and flexible platform using the JD Edwards EnterpriseOne ERP system integrated with Salesforce.com. Other production- and website-supportive business systems and platforms are developed and maintained by the same groups that handle the subsidiaries' client-facing development operations.

  Cambium Learning Group, Inc. not is planning to increase security spending.  The company has recently completed deploying a federated identity security solution, threat and intrusion detection technologies, and next-generation firewall solutions. It uses F5 BigIP as its storage security solution, and has no fraud detection solution. Cambium Learning Group's security safeguards include regular policy reviews, inventory of personal employee and customer data, documented incident response process, and malware and virus protection software on all devices; it also has a documented incident response process, a regular compliance review process, and a continuous compliance model in place.  The company uses a home-grown solution to monitor threats across its networks, security devices and data. 

The company is currently evaluating cloud solutions for a possible implementation.  It currently runs business applications, email, accounting, financials, storage, and backup in a cloud environment, and senior sources report maintaining 100% site uptime are the company's biggest cloud related security concerns.     To help store the large amount of information generated through these business systems, Cambium Learning Group has moved several databases to the cloud. These databases are based out of seven servers, some of which are virtualized. The company also maintains an additional seven development and backup servers. 

Infrastructure operations, including telecommunications operations, network services, data services, technical support, and desktop support, are handled by a small team of IT professionals.

Cambium Learning Group, Inc. has noted that it anticipates IT security spending to increase on perimeter and storage security, and infrastructure expenditures to increase for data storage, network performance and management, remote access control, data center infrastructure, network security, capacity planning, disaster recovery, and virtualization. 

The company has deployed IP KVM technology, switched APC power, and SSL VPN appliances at its data center. It has also implemented cloud-based platform and infrastructure services to reduce its use of human capital while increasing productivity. Cambium Learning Group has also deployed business line, productivity, analytics, and business-to-consumer mobile applications. 

The company's file sharing and code deployments across its wide area network (WAN) and its time and expense system cause the most strain on its network environment. 

The IT budget is typically finalized in Q4.

 What people are saying about Cambium Learning:


                	As a school system with a long track record with Kurzweil 3000, we've seen students' reading skills increase by as much as 2 or 3 grade levels within a single semester. Tom Turner, School Administrator, Chouteau Public Schools, Chouteau, OK


                	One Gizmo in the hand of a math or science teacher can provide almost limitless opportunities for conceptual and extended learning. Leslie Accardo, Model Schools Coordinator, Lower Hudson Regional Information Center, NY


                	The support we receive from our Voyager Sopris partners has consistently been reliable, professional, and personal.  I appreciate their eagerness�to assist our district with problem solving and building internal capacity. Deanna Parish, Coordinator of Curriculum & Instruction, Department of Exceptional Children Services,Charleston County School District, SC




                	My class of kindergarten students LOVE going on Raz-Kids. Often, they go there for their free time play. They are highly motivated to read and I find it a wonderful way to get leveled books into the hands of my early readers. Bless you all, for what you are providing for education! Birdy Hartman, Teacher, San Diego, CA


                	Our teachers are completely behind Reflex because they are seeing an amazing change in our students' math skills. Mary Armstrong, Math Instructional Facilitator, Bryant School District 25, AR
