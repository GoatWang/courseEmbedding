Fasano stepping down as High Point softball coach
Posted: Jan. 12, 2015 4:19 am Updated: Jan. 16, 2015 5:00 am







By PETER STEINpstein@njherald.comFor Barbara Fasano, the choice was clear. But that doesn't mean it was easy.Fasano loves teaching, it's in her blood, it's part of why she became High Point's head softball coach in the first place -- because that involves teaching, too.But, teaching in the classroom is one of her top priorities. She's been doing that for 21 years overall, 13 at High Point. So when Fasano, a Social Studies teacher, had the chance to take on an Advanced Placement World History course, a first-ever offering at the school, she jumped at it. It came at a time when she also had more familial obligations, which meant that something in her life had to give. That something was coaching softball.So, after 11 seasons coaching the Wildcats -- a stretch that included two state championships, two sectional championships, two Hunterdon Warren Sussex Tournament championships, and two NJAC American Division championships -- Fasano is stepping down."I'¹ve been part of the High Point softball family for over a decade, and I just felt it was the right time," said Fasano, the Herald's Softball Coach of the Year in 2012 and 2014. "It was an extremely difficult decision for me, though. I'm really going to miss the girls and the fun we've had over the years. ... I did have tears in my eyes when I handed in my resignation letter. I just had to go with my heart.""She had mentioned it to me before she had done it, so I kind of knew that it was coming," former High Point pitcher Ally Frei, now at Boston College, said of Fasano's resignation. "I completely understand. I think it was the best decision for her and her family. It was just the right time for her to step down."Fasano said she isn't sure whether Jim Fasano, her husband of 30 years and longtime softball assistant, will remain with the team. That, she says, will be up to whomever takes her place, which has yet to be decided, although she thinks another of her High Point assistants, Ryan Gallagher, would be a great choice.As Fasano leaves High Point softball behind -- at least the coaching, not the rooting aspect of it -- she does so with as much pride as sadness. Guiding the Wildcats to an extra-inning victory over Kingsway in the 2012 Group 3 final, and another one over Robbinsville in last year's Group 2 championship game, was certainly a thrill for Fasano. Climbing all the way up the mountain is what teams strive to do, and High Point did it twice in the past three seasons.But, it was not the end-all and be-all for Fasano, just a by-product of what she tried to instill in her players and the atmosphere she brought about."When I look back and I have all these memories, it's awesome,² Fasano said."But it wasn't really about winning. It was about building relationships. I have had very special moments and times with the girls. In years when we weren't the champions, we always had great relationships."Including one with player Aimee Stormes, who eventually became one of her assistant coaches. "That speaks so much about the rapport we've built over the years," Fasano said.And Stormes isn't the only one who still has a rapport with Fasano."Holidays, when I get a text from these girls that I haven't seen in a while, all of that is really special," Fasano said. "And that's why I'm blessed that I coached at High Point."Fasano took over High Point's head-coaching position in 2004. Though already ensconced as a Social Studies teacher, she admits she was a bit green when it came to coaching softball."That was really scary," Fasano recalled. "I had no high school softball coaching experience. I had coached my daughter (Lauren) when she was younger, but it (coaching high school softball) was a whole new ballgame. I did what I had to do -- I went to coaches clinics and I learned a lot. And then I got to coach. It's just been a wonderful journey."Barbara and Jim Fasano were fixtures in the High Point softball coaching ranks, so much so that their players referred to them as "Coach Mrs." and"Coach Mr." Before Frei was throwing perfect games, before Jamie Christensen and Ally Curry were catching them, before Carly Satter was breaking school batting average records, before Chelsea Eckert was excelling at both pitching and hitting, "Coach Mrs." and "Coach Mr." were there, "Mrs." coaching first base, "Mr." over at third.Jim Fasano yelling, "Lotsa hop, girls, lotsa hop," as they headed on and off the field between innings, Barb Fasano's "Get here, get here, get here," shouts when a High Point player was trying to beat out a grounder, were as familiar sounds at High Point games as the whoosh of a Frei fastball, as the crack of Satter's and Eckert's bats.Barbara Fasano's run coaching High Point softball is now over. But her relationships with the players, her softball-family ties, will go on. Fasano won't let her former players down, just as she didn't when they were her current ones."I remember her always being there for me, always supporting me in everything that I did," Frei said. "Not only just being there for softball; she was always there, whether it was school or outside of school, someone that I could go to in the building or at any time.""They knew my door was always open and I was always there, 24-7, if they needed me for advice, for school, whatever else they wanted to talk about," Fasano said. "It built a really nice rapport, and I treasured that."
