	ETF MANAGERS GROUP COMMODITY TRUST I






	Notes to Financial Statements




	March 31, 2017 (unaudited)



	 



	(1) Organization



	 


	SIT RISING RATE ETF (the “Fund”),
	a series of the ETF Managers Group Commodity Trust I (a Delaware statutory trust formed on July 23, 2014), commenced investment
	operations on February 19, 2015. The Fund offers common units of beneficial interest (the “Shares”) only to certain
	eligible financial institutions (the “Authorized Participants”) in one or more blocks of 50,000 Shares (a “Creation
	Basket”). ETF Managers Capital LLC (the “Sponsor”), a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary
	of Exchange Traded Managers Group LLC, serves as the managing owner and commodity pool operator of the Fund. The Sponsor seeded
	the Fund with a capital contribution of $1,000 in exchange for 40 Shares (Founders Shares) at the initial issuance price of $25.00
	per share on September 26, 2014. Sit Fixed Income Advisors II, LLC (“Sit”) is registered as a “commodity trading
	advisor” and acts as such for the Fund. On January 8, 2015, Sit increased the seeding of the Fund with a capital contribution
	of $5,000,000 at the initial issuance price of $25.00 per share. From September 26, 2014 through February 18, 2015 the Fund had
	no operating activities.


	 


	The Fund commenced investment operations
	on February 19, 2015. The Fund commenced trading on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (the “NYSE Arca”) on February 19, 2015 and
	trades under the symbol “RISE”.


	 


	Sit is paid a fee equal to 0.50% per annum,
	effective January 27, 2016, of the value of the Fund’s average daily net assets for its services as the commodity trading
	advisor to the Fund, payable by the Fund. Sit is a subsidiary of Sit Investment Associates, Inc.


	 


	The Fund’s investment objective is
	to profit from rising interest rates by tracking the performance of a portfolio (the “Benchmark Portfolio”) consisting
	of exchange traded futures contracts and options on futures on 2, 5 and 10 year U.S. Treasury securities (“Treasury Instruments”)
	weighted to achieve a targeted negative 10-year average effective portfolio duration (the “Benchmark Component Instruments”).
	The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in the Benchmark Component Instruments currently constituting the
	Benchmark Portfolio. The Benchmark Portfolio is maintained by Sit and will be rebalanced, reconstituted, or both, monthly (typically
	on the 15

	th

	of each month and on the next business day if the 15

	th

	is a holiday, weekend, or other day on
	which the national exchanges are closed) to maintain a negative 10-year average effective duration. The Benchmark Portfolio and
	the Fund will each maintain a short position in Treasury Instruments. The Fund does not use futures contracts or options to obtain
	leveraged investment results. The Fund will not invest in swaps or other over the counter derivative instruments.


	 


	The weighting of the Treasury Instruments
	constituting the Benchmark Component Instruments will be based on each maturity’s duration contribution. The expected range
	for the duration weighted percentage of the 2 year and 5 year maturity Treasury Instruments will be from 30% to 70%. The expected
	range for the duration weighted percentage of the 10-year maturity Treasury Instruments will be from 5% to 25%. The relative weightings
	of the Benchmark Component Instruments will be shifted between maturities when there are material changes in the shape of the yield
	curve, for example, if the Federal Reserve began raising short term interest rates more than long term interest rates. In such
	an instance, Sit, which maintains the Benchmark Portfolio, will elect to increase the weightings of the 2 year and reduce the weighting
	in the 10-year maturity. Conversely, Sit will do the opposite if the Federal Reserve began raising long term interest rates more
	than short term interest rates. Reconstitution and rebalancing each will occur monthly, on the 15th, except for as noted above
	or if there are radical changes in the yield curve such that effective duration is outside of a range from negative nine to negative
	11-year average effective duration, in which case Sit will adjust the maturities of the Treasury Instruments before the next expected
	monthly reconstitution.

	ETF MANAGERS GROUP COMMODITY TRUST I




	Notes to Financial Statements




	March 31, 2017 (unaudited) (continued)



	 


	The Sponsor anticipates that approximately
	5% to 15% of the Fund’s assets will be used as payment for or collateral for Treasury Instruments. In order to collateralize
	its Treasury Instrument positions the Fund will hold such assets, from which it will post margin to its futures commission merchant
	(“FCM”), SG Americas Securities, LLC, in an amount equal to the margin required by the relevant exchange, and transfer
	to its FCM any additional amounts that may be separately required by the FCM. When establishing positions in Treasury Instruments,
	the Fund will be required to deposit initial margin with a value of approximately 3% to 10% of the value of each Treasury Instrument
	position at the time it is established. These margin requirements are subject to change from time to time by the exchange or the
	FCM. On a daily basis, the Fund will be obligated to pay, or entitled to receive, variation margin in an amount equal to the change
	in the daily settlement level of its Treasury Instruments positions. Any assets not required to be posted as margin with the FCM
	will be held at the Fund’s administrator in cash or cash equivalents as discussed below.


	 


	The Benchmark Portfolio will be invested
	in Benchmark Component Instruments and rebalanced, as noted above to maintain a negative average effective portfolio duration of
	approximately 10 years. Duration is a measure of estimated price sensitivity relative to changes in interest rates. Portfolios
	with longer durations are typically more sensitive to changes in interest rates. For example, if interest rates rise by 1%, the
	market value of a security with an effective duration of 5 years would decrease by 5%, with all other factors being constant, and
	likewise the market value of a security with an effective duration of negative 5 years would increase by 5%, with all other factors
	being constant. The correlation between duration and price sensitivity is greater for securities rated investment-grade than it
	is for securities rated below investment-grade.


	 


	Duration estimates are based on assumptions
	by Sit and are subject to a number of limitations. Effective duration is calculated based on historical price changes of U.S. Treasuries
	and Treasury Instruments held by the Benchmark Portfolio, and therefore is a more accurate estimate of price sensitivity provided
	interest rates remain within their historical range. Investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates
	rise. The risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities.


	 


	The Fund will incur certain expenses in
	connection with its operations. The Fund will hold cash or cash equivalents such as U.S. Treasuries or other high credit quality,
	short-term fixed-income or similar securities for direct investment or as collateral for the Treasury Instruments and for other
	liquidity purposes and to meet redemptions that may be necessary on an ongoing basis. These expenses and income from the cash and
	cash equivalent holdings may cause imperfect correlation between changes in the Fund’s net asset value (“NAV”)
	and changes in the Benchmark Portfolio, because the Benchmark Portfolio does not reflect expenses or income.


	 


	The Fund seeks to trade its positions prior
	to maturity; accordingly, natural market forces may cost the Fund while rebalancing. Each time the Fund seeks to reconstitute its
	positions, barring movement in the underlying securities, the futures and option prices may be higher or lower. Such differences
	in price, barring a movement in the price of the underlying security, will constitute “roll yield” and may inhibit
	the Fund’s ability to achieve its investment objective.


	 


	Several factors determine the total return
	from investing in a futures contract position. One factor that impacts the total return that will result from investing in near
	month futures contracts and “rolling” those contracts forward each month is the price relationship between the current
	near month contract and the next month contract.


	 


	When the Fund purchases an option that
	expires “out of the money,” the Fund will realize a loss. The Fund may not be able to invest the its assets in futures
	and options contracts having an aggregate notional amount exactly equal to that which is required to achieve a negative 10-year
	average effective duration. For example, as standardized contracts, U.S. Treasury futures contracts are denominated in specific
	dollar amounts, and the Fund’s NAV and the proceeds from the sale of a Creation Basket are unlikely to be an exact multiple
	of the amounts of those contracts. As a result, in such circumstances, the Fund may be better able to achieve the exact amount
	of exposure desired through the use of other investments.


	 


	The Sponsor will close existing positions
	when it determines it would be appropriate to do so and reinvest the proceeds in other positions. Positions may also be closed
	out to meet orders for Redemption Baskets.

	ETF MANAGERS GROUP COMMODITY TRUST I




	Notes to Financial Statements




	March 31, 2017 (unaudited) (continued)



	 



	(2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies



	 



	(a) Basis of Accounting



	 


	The accompanying financial statements of
	the Fund have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.


	 


	The accompanying financial statements are
	unaudited, but in the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary
	to present fairly the financial statements have been made. These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with
	the Fund’s annual 10K filing and the Fund’s Prospectus dated January 20, 2017. Interim period results are not necessarily
	indicative of results for a full-year period.


	 



	(b) Use of Estimates



	 


	The preparation of the financial
	statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
	that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
	financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. There were no significant estimates
	used in the preparation of the financial statements.


	 



	(c) Cash




	 



	Cash, when shown in the Statements
	of Financial Condition, represents non-segregated cash with the custodian and does not include short-term investments.


	 



	(d) Cash Held by Broker




	 



	Sit is registered as a “commodity
	trading advisor” and acts as such for the Fund. Sit is a subsidiary of Sit Investment Associates, Inc. The Fund’s arrangement
	with SG Americas Securities, LLC, the Fund’s FCM, requires the Fund to meet its variation margin requirement related to the
	price movements, both positive and negative, on futures contracts held by the Fund by keeping cash on deposit with the Commodity
	Broker. These amounts are shown as Segregated cash held by broker in the Statements of Financial Condition. The Fund deposits cash
	and United States Treasury Obligations with the FCM subject to Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”) regulations
	and various exchange and broker requirements. The combination of the Fund’s deposits with its FCM of cash and United States
	Treasury Obligations and the unrealized gain or loss on open futures contracts (variation margin) represents the Fund’s overall
	equity in its brokerage trading account. The Fund uses its cash held by the FCM to satisfy variation margin requirements. The Fund
	earns interest on its cash deposited with the FCM and is recorded on the accrual basis.


	 



	(e) Final Net Asset Value for Fiscal
	Period



	 


	The calculation time of the Fund’s
	final net asset value for creation and redemption of Fund shares for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was at 4:00 p.m. Eastern
	Time.


	 


	Although the Fund’s shares may continue
	to trade on secondary markets subsequent to the calculation of the final NAV, the 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time represented the final
	opportunity to transact in creation or redemption baskets for the three months ended March 31, 2017.

	ETF MANAGERS GROUP COMMODITY TRUST I




	Notes to Financial Statements




	March 31, 2017 (unaudited) (continued)



	 


	Fair value per share is determined at the
	close of the NYSE Arca.


	 


	For financial reporting purposes, the Fund
	values its investment positions based upon the final closing price in their primary markets. Accordingly, the investment valuations
	in these financial statements differ from those used in the calculation of the Fund’s final creation/redemption NAV at March
	31, 2017.


	 



	(f) Investment Valuation



	 


	Short-term investments, excluding U.S.
	Treasury Bills, are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. U.S. Treasury Bills are valued as determined by an
	independent pricing service based on methods which include consideration of: yields or prices of securities of comparable quality,
	coupon, maturity and type; indications as to values from dealers; and general market conditions.


	 


	Futures contracts are valued at the last
	settled price on the applicable exchange on which that futures contract trades.


	 



	(g) Financial Instruments and Fair Value



	 


	The Fund discloses the fair value of its
	investments in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) fair value measurement and disclosure guidance which
	requires a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The disclosure
	requirements establish a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between: (1) market participant assumptions developed based on
	market data obtained from sources independent to the Fund (observable inputs); and (2) the Fund’s own assumptions about market
	participant assumptions developed based on the best information available under the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The three
	levels defined by the disclosure requirements hierarchy are as follows:


	 


	Level I: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in
	active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.


	 


	Level II: Inputs other than quoted prices
	included within Level I that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level II inputs include
	the following: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets
	or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability,
	and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means (market-corroborated
	inputs).


	 


	Level III: Unobservable pricing input at
	the measurement date for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs shall be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable
	inputs are not available.

	In some instances, the inputs used to measure
	fair value might fall in different levels of the fair value hierarchy. The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair
	value measurement in its entirety falls shall be determined based on the lowest input level that is significant to the fair value
	measurement in its entirety.


	 


	Fair value measurements also require additional
	disclosure when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased, as well as when circumstances
	indicate that a transaction is not orderly.


	 


	The following tables summarize the valuation
	of investments at March 31, 2017 and at June 30, 2016 using the fair value hierarchy:

	Transfers between levels are recognized
	at the end of the reporting period. During the nine months ended March 31, 2017 and the year ended June 30, 2016, the Fund recognized
	no transfers from Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3.


	 


	The inputs or methodology used for valuing
	investments are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.


	 



	(h) Investment Transactions and Related
	Income



	 


	Investment transactions are recorded on
	the trade date. All such transactions are recorded on the identified cost basis, and marked to market daily. Unrealized gain/loss
	on open futures contracts is reflected in Receivable/Payable on open futures contracts in the Statements of Financial Condition
	and the change in the unrealized gain/loss between periods is reflected in the Statements of Operations. Discounts on short-term
	securities purchased are accreted daily and reflected as Interest Income in the Statements of Operations.


	 



	(i) Federal Income Taxes



	 


	The Fund is registered as a Delaware statutory
	trust and is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, the Fund does not expect to incur U.S.
	federal income tax liability; rather, each beneficial owner is required to take into account their allocable share of the Fund’s
	income, gain, loss, deductions and other items for the Fund’s taxable year ending with or within the beneficial owner’s
	taxable year.


	 


	Management of the Fund has reviewed the
	open tax years and major jurisdictions and concluded that there is no tax liability resulting from unrecognized tax benefits relating
	to uncertain income tax positions taken or expected to be taken in future tax returns. The Fund is also not aware of any tax positions
	for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change in the next twelve
	months. On an ongoing basis, management will monitor its tax positions taken to determine if adjustments to its conclusions are
	necessary based on factors including, but not limited to, further implementation of guidance expected from the Financial Accounting
	Standards Board and on-going analysis of tax law, regulation, and interpretations thereof.

	(3) Investments




	 




	(a) Short-Term Investments



	 


	The Fund may purchase U.S. Treasury Bills,
	agency securities, and other high-credit quality short-term fixed income or similar securities with original maturities of one
	year or less. A portion of these investments may be used as margin for the Fund’s trading in futures contracts.



	 




	(b) Accounting for Derivative Instruments



	 


	In seeking to achieve the Fund’s
	investment objective, Sit uses a mathematical approach to investing. Using this approach, Sit determines the type, quantity and
	mix of investment positions that Sit believes in combination should produce returns consistent with the Fund’s objective.


	 


	All open derivative positions at March
	31, 2017 and June 30, 2016 for the Fund are disclosed in the Schedules of Investments and the notional value of these open positions
	relative to the shareholders’ capital of the Fund is generally representative of the notional value of open positions to
	shareholders’ capital throughout the reporting periods for the Fund. The volume associated with derivative positions varies
	on a daily basis as the Fund transacts in derivative contracts in order to achieve the appropriate exposure, as expressed in notional
	value, in comparison to shareholders’ capital consistent with the Fund’s investment objective.


	 


	Following is a description of the derivative
	instruments used by the Fund during the reporting period, including the primary underlying risk exposures.



	 




	(c) Futures Contracts



	 


	The Fund enters into futures contracts
	to gain exposure to changes in the value of the Benchmark Portfolio. A futures contract obligates the seller to deliver (and the
	purchaser to accept) the future cash settlement of a specified quantity and type of a treasury futures contract at a specified
	time and place. The contractual obligations of a buyer or seller of a treasury futures contract may generally be satisfied by making
	an offsetting sale or purchase of an identical futures contract on the same or linked exchange before the designated date of delivery.


	 


	Upon entering into a futures contract,
	the Fund is required to deposit and maintain as collateral at least such initial margin as required by the exchange on which the
	transaction is affected. The initial margin is segregated as Cash held by broker, as disclosed in the Statements of Financial Condition,
	and is restricted as to its use. Pursuant to the futures contract, the Fund agrees to receive from or pay to the broker an amount
	of cash equal to the daily fluctuation in value of the futures contract. Such receipts or payments are known as variation margin
	and are recorded by the Fund as unrealized gains or losses. The Fund will realize a gain or loss upon closing a futures transaction.


	 


	Futures contracts involve, to varying degrees,
	elements of market risk (specifically treasury price risk) and exposure to loss in excess of the amount of variation margin. The
	face or contract amounts reflect the extent of the total exposure the Fund has in the particular classes of instruments. Additional
	risks associated with the use of futures contracts include imperfect correlation between movements in the price of the futures
	contracts and the market value of the underlying securities and the possibility of an illiquid market for a futures contract. With
	futures contracts, there is minimal counterparty risk to the Fund since futures contracts are exchange-traded and the exchange’s
	clearinghouse, as counterparty to all exchange-traded futures contracts, guarantees the futures contracts against default.

	(4) Agreements




	 




	(a) Management Fee



	 


	The Fund pays the Sponsor an annual management
	fee, monthly in arrears, in an amount calculated as the greater of 0.15% of its average daily net assets, or $75,000 effective
	February 20, 2016 ($56,250 prior to February 20, 2016) (the “Sponsor Fee”). The Sponsor Fee is paid in consideration
	of the Sponsor’s advisory services to the Fund. Additionally, Sit receives an annual fee, monthly in arrears, for its services
	equal to 0.50% effective January 27, 2016 (0.35% prior to January 27, 2016) of the Fund’s average daily net assets. As of
	February 19, 2015, Sit has agreed to waive its license and service fee (“CTA fee”) and the Sponsor has voluntarily
	agreed to correspondingly assume the remaining expenses of the Fund so that Fund expenses do not exceed an annual rate of 1.50%,
	excluding brokerage commissions and interest expense, of the value of the Fund’s average daily net assets (the “Expense
	Cap”). The assumption of expenses and waiver of the CTA fee are contractual on the part of the Sponsor and Sit, respectively,
	through June 1, 2018. Effective January 1, 2017, the annual Sponsor Fee was reduced to $18,750.


	 


	The waiver of the CTA fees, pursuant to
	the undertaking, amounted to $17,060 and $22,205 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016, respectively, and
	$46,460 and $36,620 for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016, respectively, as disclosed in the Statements of
	Operations. The Fund currently accrues its daily expenses up to the Expense Cap. At the end of each month, the accrued amount is
	remitted to the Sponsor as the Sponsor has assumed, and is responsible for the payment of, the routine operational, administrative
	and other ordinary expenses of the Fund in excess of the Expense Cap which aggregated $30,181 and $49,362 for the three months
	ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016, respectively, and $200,471 and $206,591 for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 and March
	31, 2016, respectively, as disclosed in the Statements of Operations.


	 



	(b) The Administrator, Custodian, Fund Accountant and Transfer
	Agent



	 


	The Fund has appointed U.S. Bank, a national
	banking association, with its principal office in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as the custodian (the “Custodian”). Its affiliate,
	U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, is the Fund accountant (“the Fund accountant”) of the Fund, transfer agent (the “Transfer
	Agent”) for Fund shares and administrator for the Fund (the “Administrator”). It performs certain administrative
	and accounting services for the Fund and prepares certain SEC, NFA and CFTC reports on behalf of the Fund. (U.S. Bank and U.S.
	Bancorp Fund Services are referred to collectively hereinafter as “U.S. Bank”).


	 


	Effective February 19, 2016, the Fund has
	agreed to pay U.S. Bank 0.05% of assets under management (“AUM”), with a $50,000 minimum annual fee payable for its
	administrative, accounting and transfer agent services and 0.01% of AUM, with an annual minimum of $4,800 for custody services.
	For the first year of services, the Fund paid U.S. Bank 0.05% of AUM, with a $45,000 minimum annual fee payable for its administrative,
	accounting and transfer agent services and 0.01% of AUM, with an annual minimum of $4,800 for custody services. The Fund paid U.S.
	Bank $13,512 and $12,382 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016, respectively, and $41,136 and $37,418 for
	the nine months ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016, respectively, as disclosed in the Statements of Operations.


	 



	(c) The Distributor



	 


	Alps Distributors, Inc. (“ALPS”)
	provided statutory and wholesaling distribution services to the Fund through March 31, 2017. The Fund paid ALPS an annual fee for
	such distribution services, equal to 0.02% of Fund average daily net assets, with a minimum of $15,000 payable annually. Pursuant
	to the Distribution Services Agreement between the Sponsor, the Fund and ALPS, the former distributor assisted the Sponsor and
	the Fund with certain functions and duties relating to distribution and marketing services to the Fund, including reviewing and
	approving marketing materials and certain regulatory compliance matters. ALPS also assisted with the processing of creation and
	redemption orders.


	 


	Esposito Securities LLC (“Esposito”)
	provided statutory and wholesaling distribution services to the Fund through November 30, 2015. The Fund paid Esposito an annual
	fee for such distribution services, equal to 0.02% of Fund average daily net assets, with a minimum of $15,000 payable annually.
	Pursuant to the Distribution Services Agreement between the Sponsor, the Fund and Esposito, the former distributor assisted the
	Sponsor and the Fund with certain functions and duties relating to distribution and marketing services to the Fund, including reviewing
	and approving marketing materials and certain regulatory compliance matters. Esposito also assisted with the processing of creation
	and redemption orders.


	 


	The Fund incurred $3,699 and $3,729 in
	distribution and related administrative services for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016, respectively, and
	$11,465 and $11,269 for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016, respectively, as disclosed in the Statements of
	Operations.


	 


	Effective April 1, 2017, the Sponsor entered
	into a Marketing Agent Agreement (the “Marketing Agent Agreement”) on behalf of the Trust and the Fund with ETFMG Financial
	LLC. (“ETFMG”), pursuant to which ETFMG will provide certain marketing services to the Fund. The Fund pays an annual
	fee for such distribution services and related administrative services equal to 0.02% of the Fund’s average daily net assets,
	with a minimum of $15,000 payable annually. Pursuant to the Marketing Agent Agreement between the Sponsor, the Fund and ETFMG,
	ETFMG assists the Sponsor and US Bank Fund Services, Inc. with certain functions and duties relating to distribution and marketing,
	including reviewing and approving marketing materials.


	 



	(d) The Commodity Broker



	 


	SG Americas Securities, LLC (the “Commodity
	Broker”), a Delaware limited liability company, serves as the Fund’s clearing broker. In its capacity as clearing broker,
	the Commodity Broker executes and clears the Fund’s futures transactions and performs certain administrative services for
	the Fund.


	 


	The Fund pays respective brokerage commissions,
	including applicable exchange fees, National Futures Association (“NFA”) fees, give–up fees, pit brokerage fees
	and other transaction related fees and expenses charged in connection with trading activities in CFTC regulated investments. Brokerage
	commissions on futures contracts are recognized on a half-turn basis.


	 


	The Sponsor does not expect brokerage commissions
	and fees to exceed 0.204% of the net asset value of the Fund for execution and clearing services on behalf of the Fund, although
	the actual amount of brokerage commissions and fees in any year or any part of any year may be greater. The effects of trading
	spreads, financing costs associated with financial instruments, and costs relating to the purchase of U.S. Treasury Securities
	or similar high credit quality short-term fixed-income or similar securities are not included in the foregoing analysis. The Fund
	incurred $7,718 and 8,648 in brokerage commissions and fees for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016, respectively,
	and $19,688 and $18,571 for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016, respectively, as disclosed in the Statements
	of Operations.

	Notes to Financial Statements




	March 31, 2017 (unaudited) (continued)




	 




	(e) The Trustee



	 


	Under the Amended and Restated Declaration
	of Trust and Trust Agreement (the “Trust Agreement”), Wilmington Trust Company, the Trustee of the Fund (the “Trustee”)
	serves as the sole trustee of the Fund in the State of Delaware. The Trustee will accept service of legal process on the Fund in
	the State of Delaware and will make certain filings under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act. Under the Trust Agreement, the Sponsor
	has the exclusive management and control of all aspects of the business of the Fund. The Trustee does not owe any other duties
	to the Fund, the Sponsor or the Shareholders of the Fund. The Trustee has no duty or liability to supervise or monitor the performance
	of the Sponsor, nor does the Trustee have any liability for the acts or omissions of the Sponsor. The Fund incurred $1,233 and
	$1,243, in trustee fees for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016, respectively, and $3,753 and $3,755 for the
	nine months ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016, respectively, which is included in Other Expenses in the Statements of Operations.



	 




	(f) Routine Offering, Operational, Administrative and Other
	Ordinary Expenses



	 


	The Sponsor, in accordance with the Fund’s
	Expense Cap limitation pays all of the routine offering, operational, administrative and other ordinary expenses of the Fund in
	excess of 1.50% (excluding brokerage commissions and interest expense) of the Fund’s average daily net assets, including,
	but not limited to, accounting and computer services, the fees and expenses of the Trustee, Administrator, Custodian, Transfer
	Agent and Distributor, legal and accounting fees and expenses, tax return preparation expenses, filing fees, and printing, mailing
	and duplication costs. The Fund incurred $106,141 and $153,251, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and March
	31, 2016, and $406,001 and $396,596 for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016, respectively, in routine offering,
	operational, administrative or other ordinary expenses.


	 


	The CTA fee waiver by Sit and the assumption
	of Fund expenses above the Expense Cap by the Sponsor, pursuant to the undertaking (as discussed in Note 4a), amounted to $17,060
	and $30,181, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2017, $22,205 and $49,362, respectively, for the three months ended
	March 31, 2016, $46,460 and $200,471, respectively, for the nine months ended March 31, 2017, and $36,620 and $206,591, respectively,
	for the nine months ended March 31, 2016.



	 




	(g) Organizational and Offering Costs



	 


	Expenses incurred in connection with organizing
	the Fund and up to the offering of its Shares upon commencement of its investment operations on February 19, 2015, were paid by
	the Sponsor and Sit without reimbursement.


	 


	Accordingly, all such expenses are not
	reflected in the Statements of Operations. The Fund will bear the costs of its continuous offering of Shares and ongoing offering
	expenses. Such ongoing offering costs will be included as a portion of the Routine Offering, Operational, Administrative and Other
	Ordinary Expenses. These costs will include registration fees for regulatory agencies and all legal, accounting, printing and other
	expenses associated therewith. These costs will be accounted for as a deferred charge and thereafter amortized to expense over
	twelve months on a straight-line basis or a shorter period if warranted.


	 


	For the three and nine months ended
	March 31, 2017 and 2016, the Fund did not incur such expenses.



	 




	(h) Extraordinary Fees and Expenses



	 


	The Fund will pay all
	extraordinary fees and expenses, if any. Extraordinary fees and expenses are fees and expenses which are nonrecurring and
	unusual in nature, such as legal claims and liabilities, litigation costs or indemnification or other unanticipated expenses.
	Such extraordinary fees and expenses, by their nature, are unpredictable in terms of timing and amount. For the three and
	nine months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, the Fund did not incur such expenses.

	(5) Creations and Redemptions



	 


	The Fund issues and redeems Shares from
	time to time, but only in one or more Creation Baskets. A Creation Basket is a block of 50,000 Shares of the Fund. Baskets may
	be created or redeemed only by Authorized Participants.


	 


	Except when aggregated in Creation Baskets,
	the Shares are not redeemable securities. Retail investors, therefore, generally will not be able to purchase or redeem Shares
	directly from or with the Fund. Rather, most retail investors will purchase or sell Shares in the secondary market with the assistance
	of a broker. Thus, some of the information contained in these Notes to Financial Statements – such as references to the Transaction
	Fee imposed on creations and redemptions – is not relevant to retail investors.



	 




	(a) Transaction Fees on Creation and Redemption Transactions



	 


	In connection with orders to create and
	redeem one or more Creation Baskets, an Authorized Participant is required to pay a transaction fee, or AP Transaction Fee, of
	$500 per order, which goes directly to the Custodian. The AP Transaction Fees are paid by the Authorized Participants and not by
	the Fund.

	(6) Risk




	 




	(a) Investment Related Risk



	 


	The NAV of the Fund’s shares relates
	directly to the value of the U.S. treasuries, cash and cash equivalents held by the Fund and the portfolio’s negative effective
	duration established and maintained through the Fund’s investment in Treasury Instruments. Fluctuations in the prices of
	these assets could materially adversely affect the value and performance of an investment in the Fund’s shares. Past performance
	is not necessarily indicative of future results; all or substantially all of an investment in the Fund could be lost.


	 


	Investments in debt securities typically
	decrease in value when interest rates rise, however, the Fund attempts to maintain a portfolio with a negative effective duration
	and therefore anticipates that an increase in interest rates may increase the Fund’s value, and a decrease in rates may lower
	the Fund’s value. The NAV of the Fund’s shares relates directly to the value of U.S. Treasuries and Treasury Instruments
	held by the Fund which are materially impacted by interest rate movements. The magnitude of the impact on value from a change in
	interest rates is often greater for longer-term fixed income than shorter-term securities. Interest rates have been near historic
	lows since the market events of 2008 and may remain low.


	 


	Interest rate movements are heavily influenced
	by the action of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and other central banks. Their actions are based on judgments
	and policies which involve numerous political and economic factors which are unpredictable. Recent interest rate and monetary policies
	have been unprecedented and may continue to be so.

	ETF MANAGERS GROUP COMMODITY TRUST I




	Notes to Financial Statements




	March 31, 2017 (unaudited) (continued)



	 


	The Fund attempts to track a portfolio
	benchmark. The performance of the Fund may not closely track the performance of the benchmark portfolio for a variety of reasons.
	For example, the Fund incurs operating expenses and portfolio transaction costs not incurred by the benchmark. The Fund is also
	required to manage cash flows and may experience operational inefficiencies the benchmark does not. In addition, the Fund may not
	be fully invested in the contents of its benchmark at all times or may hold securities not included in its benchmark.


	 


	The Fund invests in Treasury Instruments
	and U.S. treasuries with exposure to different maturity dates. Generally, the Fund’s exposure to securities with maturities
	of 2 and 5 years will be greater than its exposure to securities with maturities of 10 years. Interest rates do not change uniformly
	for U.S. Treasuries of different maturities and therefore if interest rates rise, the investment performance of the Fund will be
	impacted by the Fund’s current maturity exposure which may be different from the expectations of the Sponsor and investors
	in the Fund. At any time, the Fund’s maturity exposure may not be optimal with respect to a movement in interest rates which
	would negatively impact performance.



	 




	(b) Liquidity Risk




	 



	In certain circumstances, such as the disruption
	of the orderly markets for the futures contracts or Financial Instruments in which the Fund invests, the Fund might not be able
	to dispose of certain holdings quickly or at prices that represent what the market value may have been in an orderly market. Futures
	and option positions cannot always be liquidated at the desired price. It is difficult to execute a trade at a specific price when
	there is a relatively small volume of buy and sell orders in a market. A market disruption can also make it difficult to liquidate
	a position. The large size of the positions that the Fund may acquire increases the risk of illiquidity both by making its positions
	more difficult to liquidate and by potentially increasing losses while trying to do so. Such a situation may prevent the Fund from
	limiting losses, realizing gains or achieving a high correlation with the Benchmark Portfolio.



	 




	(7) Profit and Loss Allocations and
	Distributions



	 


	Pursuant to the Trust Agreement, income
	and expenses are allocated

	pro rata

	among the Shareholders monthly based on their respective percentage interests as of
	the close of the last trading day of the preceding month. Any losses allocated to the Sponsor which are in excess of the Sponsor’s
	capital balance are allocated to the Shareholders in accordance with their respective interest in the Fund as a percentage of total
	Shareholders’ capital. Distributions (other than redemption of units) may be made at the sole discretion of the Sponsor on
	a

	pro rata

	basis in accordance with the respective interests of the Shareholders.



	 




	(8) Indemnifications



	 


	The Sponsor, either in its own capacity
	or in its capacity as the Sponsor and on behalf of the Fund, has entered into various service agreements that contain a variety
	of representations, or provide indemnification provisions related to certain risks service providers undertake in performing services
	which are in the best interests of the Fund. As of March 31, 2017, the Fund had not received any claims or incurred any losses
	pursuant to these agreements and expects the risk of such losses to be remote.



	 




	(9) Termination



	 


	The term of the Fund is perpetual unless
	terminated earlier in certain circumstances as described in the Prospectus.

	(10) Net Asset Value and Financial Highlights



	 


	The Fund is presenting the following net
	asset value and financial highlights related to investment performance for a Share outstanding throughout the Three Months Ended
	March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016, respectively, and the Nine Months Ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016, respectively. The
	net investment income and total expense ratios are calculated using average net assets. The net asset value presentation is calculated
	by dividing the Fund’s net assets by the average daily number of Shares outstanding. The net investment income (loss) and
	expense ratios have been annualized. The total return is based on the change in net asset value and market value of the Shares
	during the period. An individual investor’s return and ratios may vary based on the timing of their transactions in Fund
	Shares.

	Overview



	 


	The Trust is a Delaware statutory trust
	formed on July 23, 2014. It is a series trust currently consisting of one series: Sit Rising Rate ETF (the “Fund” and
	any future series will be a “Fund”). The Fund issues common units, called the “Shares,” representing fractional
	undivided beneficial interests in the Fund. The Trust and the Fund operate pursuant to the Trust’s Amended and Restated Declaration
	of Trust and Trust Agreement (the “Trust Agreement”).


	 


	The Sponsor has the power and authority
	to establish and designate one or more series and to issue shares thereof, from time to time as it deems necessary or desirable.  The
	Sponsor has exclusive power to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences as between the shares of any series as to
	the right of redemption, special and relative rights as to dividends and other distributions and on liquidation, conversion rights,
	and conditions under which the series shall have separate voting rights or no voting rights. The term for which the Trust is to
	exist commenced on the date of the filing of the Certificate of Trust, and the Trust, the Fund, and any additional series created
	in the future will exist in perpetuity, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Agreement.  Separate
	and distinct records shall be maintained for each Fund and the assets associated with a Fund shall be held in such separate and
	distinct records (directly or indirectly, including a nominee or otherwise) and accounted for in such separate and distinct records
	separately from the assets of any other series.  The Fund and each future series will be separate from all such series
	in respect of the assets and liabilities allocated to the Fund and each separate series and will represent a separate investment
	portfolio of the Trust.


	 


	The sole Trustee of the Trust is Wilmington
	Trust, N.A. (the “Trustee”), and the Trustee serves as the Trust’s corporate trustee as required under the Delaware
	Statutory Trust Act (“DSTA”).  The Trustee’s principal offices are located at 1100 North Market Street,
	Wilmington, Delaware 19890. The Trustee is unaffiliated with the Sponsor.  The rights and duties of the Trustee and the
	Sponsor with respect to the offering of the Shares and Fund management and the shareholders are governed by the provisions of the
	DSTA and by the Trust Agreement.


	 


	On January 29, 2015, the initial Form S-1
	for the Fund was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). On January 8, 2015, 4 Creation
	Baskets for the Fund were issued representing 200,000 shares and $5,000,000. The Fund began trading on the New York Stock Exchange
	(“NYSE”) Arca on February 19, 2015.


	 


	The Fund is designed and managed to track
	the performance of a portfolio (the “Benchmark Portfolio”) consisting of exchange traded futures contracts and options
	on futures on 2, 5 and 10-year U.S. Treasury securities (“Treasury Instruments”) weighted to achieve a targeted negative
	10-year average effective portfolio duration (the “Benchmark Component Instruments”).

	The Investment Objective of the Fund



	 


	The Fund’s investment objective is
	to profit from rising interest rates by tracking the performance of the Benchmark Portfolio consisting of exchange traded futures
	contracts and options on futures on 2, 5 and 10-year U.S. Treasury securities weighted to achieve a targeted negative 10-year average
	effective portfolio duration. The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in the Benchmark Component Instruments
	currently constituting the Benchmark Portfolio.


	 



	The Benchmark Portfolio



	 


	The Benchmark Portfolio is maintained by
	Sit Fixed Income Advisors II, LLC (“Sit”), which also serves as the Fund’s commodity trading advisor. The Benchmark
	Portfolio will be rebalanced, reconstituted, or both, monthly (typically on the 15th of each month or on the next business day
	if the 15th is a holiday, weekend, or other day on which the national exchanges are closed) to maintain a negative 10-year average
	effective duration. The Benchmark Portfolio and the Fund will each maintain a short position in Treasury Instruments. The Fund
	does not use futures contracts or options to obtain leveraged investment results.


	 


	The Fund will not invest in swaps or other
	over-the-counter derivative instruments.


	 


	The Benchmark Component Instruments currently
	constituting the Benchmark Portfolio as of March 31, 2017 include:

	The Benchmark Component Instruments currently
	constituting the Benchmark Portfolio and anticipated rebalancing dates, as well as the daily holdings of the Fund, are available
	on the Fund’s website at

	www.risingrateetf.com

	.


	 


	The weighting of the Treasury Instruments
	constituting the Benchmark Component Instruments will be based on each maturity’s duration contribution. The expected range
	for the duration weighted percentage of the 2-year and 5-year maturity Treasury Instruments will be from 30% to 70%. The expected
	range for the duration weighted percentage of the 10-year maturity Treasury Instruments will be from 5% to 25%. The relative weightings
	of the Benchmark Component Instruments will be shifted between maturities when there are material changes in the shape of the yield
	curve, for example, if the Federal Reserve began raising short term interest rates more than long term interest rates. In such
	an instance, Sit, which maintains the Benchmark Portfolio, will increase the weightings of the 2-year and reduce the weighting
	in the 10-year maturity Treasury Instruments. Conversely, Sit will do the opposite if the Federal Reserve began raising long term
	interest rates more than short term interest rates. Reconstitution and rebalancing each will occur monthly, on the 15th, except
	for as noted above or if there are radical changes in the yield curve such that effective duration is outside of a range from negative
	nine to negative 11-year average effective duration, in which case Sit will adjust the maturities of the Treasury Instruments before
	the next expected monthly reconstitution.


	 


	The Sponsor anticipates that approximately
	5% to 15% of the Fund’s assets will be used as payment for or collateral for Treasury Instruments. In order to collateralize
	its Treasury Instrument positions the Fund will hold such assets, from which it will post margin to its FCM, in an amount equal
	to the margin required by the relevant exchange, and transfer to its FCM any additional amounts that may be separately required
	by the FCM. When establishing positions in Treasury Instruments, the Fund will be required to deposit initial margin with a value
	of approximately 3% to 10% of the value of each Treasury Instrument position at the time it is established. These margin requirements
	are subject to change from time to time by the exchange or the FCM. On a daily basis, the Fund will be obligated to pay, or entitled
	to receive, variation margin in an amount equal to the change in the daily settlement level of its Treasury Instruments positions.
	Any assets not required to be posted as margin with the FCM will be held at the Fund’s administrator in cash or cash equivalents
	as discussed below.

	The Benchmark Portfolio will be invested
	in Benchmark Component Instruments and rebalanced, as noted above, to maintain a negative average effective portfolio duration
	of approximately 10 years. Duration is a measure of estimated price sensitivity relative to changes in interest rates. Portfolios
	with longer durations are typically more sensitive to changes in interest rates. For example, if interest rates rise by 1%, the
	market value of a security with an effective duration of 5 years would decrease by 5%, with all other factors being constant, and
	likewise the market value of a security with an effective duration of negative 5 years would increase by 5%, with all other factors
	being constant. Duration estimates are based on assumptions by Sit and are subject to a number of limitations. Duration is a more
	accurate estimate of price sensitivity provided interest rate changes are small and occur equally in short-term and long-term securities.
	Investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. The risk is usually greater for longer-term
	debt securities.


	 


	The Fund will incur certain expenses in
	connection with its operations. The Fund will hold cash or cash equivalents such as U.S. Treasuries or other high credit quality,
	short-term fixed-income or similar securities for direct investment or as collateral for the Treasury Instruments and for other
	liquidity purposes and to meet redemptions that may be necessary on an ongoing basis. These expenses and income from the cash and
	cash equivalent holdings may cause imperfect correlation between changes in the Fund’s NAV and changes in the Benchmark Portfolio,
	because the Benchmark Portfolio does not reflect expenses or income.

	Fund Share Price Performance




	 



	During the three months ended March 31,
	2017, the NYSE Arca market value of each Share decreased (-1.51%) from $23.77 per Share, representing the closing trade on December
	31, 2016, to $23.41 per Share, representing the closing price on March 31, 2017. The Share price high and low for the three months
	ended March 31, 2017 and related change from the closing Share price on December 31, 2016 was as follows: Shares traded from a
	high of $23.97 per Share (+0.84%) on March 13, 2017 to a low of $23.33 per Share (-1.85%) on March 27, 2017.


	 



	Fund Share Net Asset Performance




	 



	For the three months ended March 31, 2017,
	the net asset value of each Share decreased (-1.35%) from $23.68 per Share, representing the closing net asset value per Share
	on December 31, 2016, to $23.36 per Share. Unrealized losses in the futures and options contracts and Fund expenses more than offset
	net realized gains on futures and options contracts which resulted in the overall decrease in the NAV per Share during the three
	months ended March 31, 2017.


	 


	Net loss for the three months ended March
	31, 2017, was $251,313, resulting from net realized gains on futures and options contracts of $147,281, net unrealized losses on
	futures and options contracts of $357,457, and the net investment loss of $41,137. 


	 



	FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2016



	 



	Fund Share Price Performance



	 


	During the three months ended March 31,

	Calculating NAV



	 


	The Fund’s NAV is calculated by:


	 




	 



	·




	Taking the current market value of its total assets;





	 




	 



	·




	Subtracting any liabilities; and





	 




	 



	·




	Dividing that total by the total number of outstanding shares.





	 






	 


	-

	31

	-


	 







	 




	  


	The Administrator calculates the NAV of
	the Fund once each NYSE Arca trading day. The NAV for a particular trading day is released after 4:00 p.m. New York time. Trading
	during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca typically closes at 4:00 p.m. New York time. The Administrator uses the CME closing
	price (determined at the earlier of the close of the CME or 2:30 p.m. New York time) for the contracts traded on the CME, but calculates
	or determines the value of all other Fund investments using market quotations, if available, or other information customarily used
	to determine the fair value of such investments as of the earlier of the close of the NYSE Arca or 4:00 p.m. New York time, in
	accordance with the current Administrative Agency Agreement among U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, the Fund and the Sponsor. “Other
	information” customarily used in determining fair value includes information consisting of market data in the relevant market
	supplied by one or more third parties including, without limitation, relevant rates, prices, yields, yield curves, volatilities,
	spreads, correlations or other market data in the relevant market; or information of the types described above from internal sources
	if that information is of the same type used by the Fund in the regular course of its business for the valuation of similar transactions.
	The information may include costs of funding, to the extent costs of funding are not and would not be a component of the other
	information being utilized. Third parties supplying quotations or market data may include, without limitation, dealers in the relevant
	markets, end-users of the relevant product, information vendors, brokers and other sources of market information.


	 


	In addition, in order to provide updated
	information relating to the Fund for use by investors and market professionals, the NYSE Arca calculates and disseminates throughout
	the core trading session on each trading day an updated indicative fund value. The indicative fund value is calculated by using
	the prior day’s closing NAV per share of the Fund as a base and updating that value throughout the trading day to reflect
	changes in the most recently reported trade price for the futures and options held by the Fund traded on the CME. The indicative
	fund value share basis disseminated during NYSE Arca core trading session hours should not be viewed as an actual real time update
	of the NAV, because the NAV is calculated only once at the end of each trading day based upon the relevant end of day values of
	the Fund’s investments.


	 


	The indicative fund value is disseminated
	on a per share basis every 15 seconds during regular NYSE Arca core trading session hours of 9:30 a.m. New York time to 4:00 p.m.
	New York time. The normal trading hours of the CME are 10:00 a.m. New York time to 2:30 p.m. New York time. This means that there
	is a gap in time at the beginning and the end of each day during which the Fund’s shares are traded on the NYSE Arca, but
	real-time CME trading prices for contracts traded on the CME are not available. During such gaps in time the indicative fund value
	will be calculated based on the end of day price of such contracts from the CME’s immediately preceding trading session.
	In addition, other investments and U.S. Treasuries held by the Fund will be valued by the Administrator, using rates and points
	received from client-approved third party vendors (such as Reuters and WM Company) and advisor quotes. These investments will not
	be included in the indicative fund value.


	 


	The NYSE Arca disseminates the indicative
	fund value through the facilities of CTA/CQ High Speed Lines. In addition, the indicative fund value is published on the NYSE Arca’s
	website and is available through on-line information services such as Bloomberg and Reuters.


	 


	Dissemination of the indicative fund value
	provides additional information that is not otherwise available to the public and is useful to investors and market professionals
	in connection with the trading of the Fund shares on the NYSE Arca. Investors and market professionals are able throughout the
	trading day to compare the market price of the Fund and the indicative fund value. If the market price of the Fund shares diverges
	significantly from the indicative fund value, market professionals will have an incentive to execute arbitrage trades. For example,
	if the Fund appears to be trading at a discount compared to the indicative fund value, a market professional could buy the Fund
	shares on the NYSE Arca and take the opposite position in Treasury Instruments. Such arbitrage trades can tighten the tracking
	between the market price of the Fund and the indicative fund value and thus can be beneficial to all market participants.


	 



	Critical Accounting Policies



	 


	The Fund’s critical accounting policies
	are as follows:


	 


	Preparation of the financial statements
	and related disclosures in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires the application of appropriate
	accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The Fund’s application of these policies involves judgments
	and the use of estimates. Actual results may differ from the estimates used and such differences could be material. The Fund holds
	a significant portion of its assets in futures contracts and a money market fund, which are held at fair value.


	 


	The Fund calculates its net asset value
	as of the NAV Calculation Time as described above.


	 






	 


	-

	32

	-


	 







	 




	  


	The values which are used by the Fund for
	its Treasury Instruments are provided by its commodity broker who uses market prices when available. In addition, the Fund estimates
	interest income on a daily basis using prevailing rates earned on its cash and cash equivalents. These estimates are adjusted to
	the actual amount received on a monthly basis and the difference, if any, is not considered material.



	 




	Credit Risk



	 


	When the Fund enters into Benchmark Component
	Instruments, it will be exposed to the credit risk that the counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations. For purposes
	of credit risk, the counterparty for the Benchmark Component Instruments traded on the CME and other futures exchanges is the clearinghouse
	associated with those exchanges. In general, clearinghouses are backed by their members who may be required to share in the financial
	burden resulting from the nonperformance of one of their members, which should significantly reduce credit risk. There can be no
	assurance that any counterparty, clearinghouse, or their financial backers will satisfy their obligations to the Fund.


	 


	The Sponsor will attempt to minimize certain
	of these market and credit risks by normally:


	 




	 



	·




	executing and clearing trades with creditworthy counterparties, as determined by the Sponsor;





	 



	·




	limiting the outstanding amounts due from counterparties of the Fund;





	 



	·




	not posting margin directly with a counterparty;





	 



	·




	limiting the amount of margin or premium posted at the FCM; and





	 



	·




	ensuring that deliverable contracts are not held to such a date when delivery of an underlying asset could be called for.





	 


	The Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”)
	requires all FCMs, such as the Fund’s clearing broker, to meet and maintain specified fitness and financial requirements,
	to segregate customer funds from proprietary funds and account separately for all customers’ funds and positions, and to
	maintain specified books and records open to inspection by the staff of the CFTC. The CFTC has similar authority over introducing
	brokers, or persons who solicit or accept orders for commodity interest trades but who do not accept margin deposits for the execution
	of trades. The CEA authorizes the CFTC to regulate trading by FCMs and by their officers and directors, permits the CFTC to require
	action by exchanges in the event of market emergencies, and establishes an administrative procedure under which customers may institute
	complaints for damages arising from alleged violations of the CEA. The CEA also gives the states powers to enforce its provisions
	and the regulations of the CFTC.


	 


	On November 14, 2013, the CFTC published
	final regulations that require enhanced customer protections, risk management programs, internal monitoring and controls, capital
	and liquidity standards, customer disclosures and auditing and examination programs for FCMs. The rules are intended to afford
	greater assurances to market participants that customer segregated funds and secured amounts are protected, customers are provided
	with appropriate notice of the risks of futures trading and of the FCMs with which they may choose to do business, FCMs are monitoring
	and managing risks in a robust manner, the capital and liquidity of FCMs are strengthened to safeguard the continued operations
	and the auditing and examination programs of the CFTC and the self-regulatory organizations are monitoring the activities of FCMs
	in a thorough manner.



	 




	Liquidity and Capital Resources



	 


	The Fund does not anticipate making use
	of borrowings or other lines of credit to meet its obligations. The Fund meets its liquidity needs in the normal course of business
	from the proceeds of the sale of its investments or from the cash, cash equivalents and/or the collateralizing Treasury Securities
	that it holds. The Fund’s liquidity needs include: redeeming its shares, providing margin deposits for existing Benchmark
	Component Instruments, the purchase of additional Benchmark Component Instruments, and paying expenses.


	 


	The Fund generates cash primarily from
	(i) the sale of Creation Baskets and (ii) interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and their investments in collateralizing Treasury
	Securities. Generally, all of the net assets of the Fund are allocated to trading in Benchmark Component Instruments. Most of the
	assets of the Fund are held in Treasury Instruments, cash and/or cash equivalents that could or are used as margin or collateral
	for trading in Benchmark Component Instruments. The percentage that such assets bear to the total net assets will vary from period
	to period as the market values of the Benchmark Component Instruments change. Interest earned on interest-bearing assets of the
	Fund is paid to the Fund.

	The investments of the Fund in Benchmark
	Component Instruments could be subject to periods of illiquidity because of market conditions, regulatory considerations and other
	reasons. Such conditions could prevent the Fund from promptly liquidating a position in Benchmark Component Instruments.



	 




	Market Risk



	 


	Trading in Benchmark Component Instruments
	such as futures contracts will involve the Fund entering into contractual commitments to purchase or sell specific amounts of instruments
	at a specified date in the future. The gross or face amount of the contracts is expected to significantly exceed the future cash
	requirements of the Fund as the Fund intends to close out any open positions prior to the contractual expiration date. As a result,
	the Fund’s market risk is the risk of loss arising from the decline in value of the contracts, not from the need to make
	delivery under the contracts. The Fund considers the “fair value” of derivative instruments to be the unrealized gain
	or loss on the contracts. The market risk associated with the commitment by the Fund to purchase a specific contract will be limited
	to the aggregate face amount of the contracts held.


	 


	The exposure of the Fund to market risk
	will depend on a number of factors including the markets for the specific instrument, the volatility of interest rates and foreign
	exchange rates, the liquidity of the instrument-specific market and the relationships among the contracts held by the Fund.



	 




	Regulatory Environment



	 


	The regulation of futures markets, futures
	contracts, and futures exchanges has historically been comprehensive. The CFTC and the exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary
	actions in the event of a market emergency including, for example, the retroactive implementation of speculative position limits,
	increased margin requirements, the establishment of daily price limits and the suspension of trading.


	 


	The regulation of commodity interest transactions
	in the United States is a rapidly changing area of law and is subject to ongoing modification by governmental and judicial action.
	Considerable regulatory attention has been focused on non-traditional investment pools that are publicly distributed in the United
	States. There is a possibility of future regulatory changes within the United States altering, perhaps to a material extent, the
	nature of an investment in the Fund, or the ability of the Fund to continue to implement its investment strategy. The effect of
	any future regulatory change on the Fund is impossible to predict but could be substantial and adverse.


	 


	The CFTC possesses exclusive jurisdiction
	to regulate the activities of commodity pool operators and has adopted regulations with respect to the activities of those persons
	and/or entities. Under the CEA, a registered CPO, such as the Sponsor, is required to make annual filings with the CFTC describing
	its organization, capital structure, management and controlling persons. In addition, the CEA authorizes the CFTC to require and
	review books and records of, and documents prepared by, registered CPOs. Pursuant to this authority, the CFTC requires CPOs to
	keep accurate, current and orderly records for each pool that they operate. The CFTC may suspend the registration of a commodity
	pool operator (1) if the CFTC finds that the operator’s trading practices tend to disrupt orderly market conditions, (2)
	if any controlling person of the operator is subject to an order of the CFTC denying such person trading privileges on any exchange,
	and (3) in certain other circumstances. Suspension, restriction or termination of the Sponsor’s registration as a commodity
	pool operator would prevent it, until that registration were to be reinstated, from managing the Fund, and might result in the
	termination of the Fund if a successor sponsor is not elected pursuant to the Trust Agreement.


	 


	The Fund’s investors are afforded
	prescribed rights for reparations under the CEA. Investors may also be able to maintain a private right of action for violations
	of the CEA. The CFTC has adopted rules implementing the reparation provisions of the CEA, which provide that any person may file
	a complaint for a reparations award with the CFTC for violation of the CEA against a floor broker or an FCM, introducing broker,
	commodity trading advisor, CPO, and their respective associated persons.

	Pursuant to authority in the CEA, the NFA
	has been formed and registered with the CFTC as a registered futures association. At the present time, the NFA is the only self-regulatory
	organization for commodity interest professionals, other than futures exchanges. The CFTC has delegated to the NFA responsibility
	for the registration of CPOs and FCMs and their respective associated persons. The Sponsor and the Fund’s clearing broker
	are members of the NFA. As such, they will be subject to NFA standards relating to fair trade practices, financial condition and
	consumer protection. The NFA also arbitrates disputes between members and their customers and conducts registration and fitness
	screening of applicants for membership and audits of its existing members. Neither the Trust nor the Fund is required to become
	a member of the NFA.


	 


	The regulations of the CFTC and the NFA
	prohibit any representation by a person registered with the CFTC or by any member of the NFA, that registration with the CFTC,
	or membership in the NFA, in any respect indicates that the CFTC or the NFA has approved or endorsed that person or that person’s
	trading program or objectives. The registrations and memberships of the parties described in this summary must not be considered
	as constituting any such approval or endorsement. Likewise, no futures exchange has given or will give any similar approval or
	endorsement.


	 


	Futures exchanges in the United States
	are subject to varying degrees of regulation under the CEA depending on whether such exchange is a designated contract market,
	exempt board of trade or electronic trading facility. Clearing organizations are also subject to the CEA and the rules and regulations
	adopted thereunder as administered by the CFTC. The CFTC’s function is to implement the CEA’s objectives of preventing
	price manipulation and excessive speculation and promoting orderly and efficient commodity interest markets. In addition, the various
	exchanges and clearing organizations themselves exercise regulatory and supervisory authority over their member firms.


	 


	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
	Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) was enacted in response to the economic crisis of 2008 and 2009 and it significantly
	altered the regulatory regime to which the securities and commodities markets are subject. To date, the CFTC has issued proposed
	versions of all of the rules it is required to promulgate under the Dodd-Frank Act, and it continues to issue proposed versions
	of additional rules that it has authority to promulgate. The provisions of the new law include the requirement that position limits
	be established on a wide range of commodity interests, including agricultural, energy, and metal-based commodity futures contracts,
	options on such futures contracts and cleared and uncleared swaps that are economically equivalent to such futures contracts and
	options; new registration and recordkeeping requirements for swap market participants; capital and margin requirements for “swap
	dealers” and “major swap participants,” as determined by the new law and applicable regulations; and the mandatory
	use of clearinghouse mechanisms for sufficiently standardized swap transactions that were historically entered into in the over-the-counter
	market.


	 


	In addition to the rules and regulations
	imposed under the Dodd-Frank Act, certain participants that are European banks may also be subject to European Market Infrastructure
	Regulation. These regulations have not yet been fully implemented.


	 


	Current rules and regulations under the
	Dodd-Frank Act require enhanced customer protections, risk management programs, internal monitoring and controls, capital and liquidity
	standards, customer disclosures and auditing and examination programs for FCMs. The rules are intended to afford greater assurances
	to market participants that customer segregated funds and secured amounts are protected, customers are provided with appropriate
	notice of the risks of futures trading and of the FCMs with which they may choose to do business, FCMs are monitoring and managing
	risks in a robust manner, the capital and liquidity of FCMs are strengthened to safeguard the continued operations and the auditing
	and examination programs of the CFTC and the self-regulatory organizations are monitoring the activities of FCMs in a thorough
	manner.

	The effect of future regulatory change
	on the Fund, and the exact timing of such changes, is impossible to predict but it may be substantial and adverse. Specifically,
	the new law, the rules that have been promulgated thereunder, and the rules that are expected to be promulgated may negatively
	impact the ability of the Fund to meet its investment objectives, either through position limits or requirements imposed on it
	and/or on their counterparties. In particular, new position limits imposed on the Fund or any counterparties may impact the ability
	of the Fund to invest in a manner that most efficiently meets its investment objective. New requirements, including capital imposed
	on the counterparties of the Fund may increase the cost of the Fund’s investments and doing business.


	 


	In addition, considerable regulatory attention
	has recently been focused on non-traditional publicly distributed investment pools such as the Fund. Furthermore, various national
	governments have expressed concern regarding the disruptive effects of speculative trading in certain commodity markets and the
	need to regulate the derivatives markets in general. The effect of any future regulatory change on the Fund is impossible to predict,
	but could be substantial and adverse.


	 


	Management believes that as of March 31,
	2017, it had fulfilled in a timely manner all Dodd-Frank reporting requirements, both historical and on-going, for the categories
	under which the firm operates and is registered.



	 




	Off Balance Sheet Financing



	 


	As of March 31, 2017, neither the Trust
	nor the Fund has any loan guarantees, credit support or other off-balance sheet arrangements of any kind other than agreements
	entered into in the normal course of business, which may include indemnification provisions relating to certain risks service providers
	undertake in performing services which are in the best interests of the Fund. While the exposure of the Fund under these indemnification
	provisions cannot be estimated, they are not expected to have a material impact on the financial position of the Fund.



	 




	Redemption Basket Obligation



	 


	Other than as necessary to meet the investment
	objective of the Fund and pay the contractual obligations described below, the Fund will require liquidity to redeem Redemption
	Baskets. The Fund intends to satisfy this obligation through the transfer of cash of the Fund (generated, if necessary, through
	the sale of Treasury Instruments) in an amount proportionate to the number of Shares being redeemed.



	 




	Contractual Obligations



	 


	The Fund pays the Sponsor an annual management
	fee, monthly in arrears, in an amount calculated as the greater of 0.15% of its average daily net assets, or, as of January 1,
	2017, $18,750 (the “Management Fee”). The Management Fee is paid in consideration of the Sponsor’s advisory
	services to the Fund. Additionally, Sit receives an annual fee, monthly in arrears, for its services equal to 0.50% of the Fund’s
	average daily net assets. As of February 19, 2015, Sit has agreed to waive its license and services fee and the Sponsor has voluntarily
	agreed to correspondingly assume the remaining expenses of the Fund so that Fund expenses do not exceed an annual rate of 1.50%,
	excluding brokerage commissions, interest expense, and extraordinary expenses, of the value of the Fund’s average daily
	net assets. The assumption of expenses and waiver of the license and services fee are contractual on the part of the Sponsor and
	Sit, respectively, through June 1, 2018 (the “Expense Cap”).


	 


	The Fund’s ongoing fees, costs and
	expenses of its operation, not subject to the Expense Cap include brokerage and other fees and commissions incurred in connection
	with the trading activities of the Fund, and extraordinary expenses (including, but not limited to, legal claims and liabilities
	and litigation costs and any indemnification related thereto). Expenses subject to the Expense Cap include (i) expenses incurred
	in connection with registering additional Shares of the Fund or offering Shares of the Fund; (ii) the routine expenses associated
	with the preparation and, if required, the printing and mailing of monthly, quarterly, annual and other reports required by applicable
	U.S. federal and state regulatory authorities, Trust meetings and preparing, printing and mailing proxy statements to Shareholders;
	(iii) the routine services of the Trustee, legal counsel and independent accountants; (iv) routine accounting, bookkeeping, custodial
	and transfer agency services, whether performed by an outside service provider or by affiliates of the Sponsor; (v) postage and
	insurance; (vi) costs and expenses associated with client relations and services; (vii) costs of preparation of all federal, state,
	local and foreign tax returns and any taxes payable on the income, assets or operations of the Fund.

	While the Sponsor has agreed to pay registration
	fees to the SEC and any other regulatory agency in connection with the offer and sale of the Shares offered through the Fund’s
	prospectus, the legal, printing, accounting and other expenses associated with such registration, and the initial fee of $7,500

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  This information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report (the "Report"). The discussion and analysis which follows may contain trend analysis and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial results. Words such as "anticipate," "expect," "intend," "plan," "believe," "seek," "outlook" and "estimate," as well as similar words and phrases, signify forward-looking statements. ETF Managers Group Commodity Trust I's forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future results and conditions, and important factors, risks and uncertainties may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements.  You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Except as expressly required by the Federal securities laws, ETF Managers Capital, LLC undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements or the risks, uncertainties or other factors described in this Report, as a result of new information, future events or changed circumstances or for any other reason after the date of this Report.  Overview  ETF Managers Group Commodity Trust I (the "Trust") is a Delaware statutory trust formed on July 23, 2014, and it is a series trust consisting of one series: Sit Rising Rate ETF (the "Fund" and any future series will be a "Fund"). The Fund issues common units, called the "Shares," representing fractional undivided beneficial interests in the Fund. The Trust and the Fund operate pursuant to the Trust's Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement (the "Trust Agreement").  ETF Managers Capital, LLC (the "Sponsor") shall have the power and authority to establish and designate one or more series ("Funds") and to issue shares thereof, from time to time as it deems necessary or desirable. The Sponsor shall have exclusive power to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences as between the shares of any series as to the right of redemption, special and relative rights as to dividends and other distributions and on liquidation, conversion rights, and conditions under which the series shall have separate voting rights or no voting rights. The term for which the Trust is to exist commenced on the date of the filing of the Certificate of Trust, and the Trust and any Fund shall exist in perpetuity, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Agreement. Separate and distinct records shall be maintained for each Fund and the assets associated with a Fund shall be held in such separate and distinct records (directly or indirectly, including a nominee or otherwise) and accounted for in such separate and distinct records separately from the assets of any other Fund. Each Fund shall be separate from all other Funds created as series of the Trust in respect of the assets and liabilities allocated to that Fund and shall represent a separate investment portfolio of the Trust.  The sole Trustee of the Trust is Wilmington Trust, N.A. (the "Trustee"), and the Trustee serves as the Trust's corporate trustee as required under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act ("DSTA"). The Trustee's principal offices are located at 1100 North Market Street, Wilmington, Delaware 19890. The Trustee is unaffiliated with the Sponsor. The rights and duties of the Trustee and the Sponsor with respect to the offering of the Shares and Fund management and the shareholders are governed by the provisions of the DSTA and by the Trust Agreement.  On January 29, 2015, the initial Form S-1 for the Fund was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). On January 8, 2015, 4 Creation Baskets for the Fund were issued representing 200,000 shares and $5,000,000. The Fund began trading on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") Arca on February 19, 2015.  The Fund is designed and managed to track the performance of a portfolio (the "Benchmark Portfolio") consisting of exchange traded futures contracts and options on futures on 2, 5 and 10-year U.S. Treasury securities ("Treasury Instruments") weighted to achieve a targeted negative 10 year average effective portfolio duration (the "Benchmark Component Instruments").  - 20 -  The Investment Objective of the Fund  The Fund's investment objective is to profit from rising interest rates by tracking the performance of the Benchmark Portfolio consisting of exchange traded futures contracts and options on futures on 2, 5 and 10-year U.S. Treasury securities weighted to achieve a targeted negative 10 year average effective portfolio duration. The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in the Benchmark Component Instruments currently constituting the Benchmark Portfolio.  The Benchmark Portfolio is maintained by Sit Fixed Income Advisors II, LLC ("Sit") and will be rebalanced, reconstituted, or both, monthly (typically on the 15th of each month and on the next business day if the 15th is a holiday, weekend, or other day on which the national exchanges are closed) to maintain a negative 10 year average effective duration. The Benchmark Portfolio and the Fund will each maintain a short position in Treasury Instruments. The Fund does not use futures contracts or options to obtain leveraged investment results. The Benchmark Component Instruments currently constituting the Benchmark Portfolio as of March 31, 2015 include:  Name Ticker Market Value USD US 5YR FUTR OPTN MAY15C FVK5C1190 (60,586) US 5YR NOTE (CBT) JUN15 FVM5 (3,125,484 ) US 2 YR NOTE (CBT) JUN15 TUM5 (13,587,688 ) US 10YR FUT OPTN MAY15P TYK5P1275 4,813  The Benchmark Component Instruments currently constituting the Benchmark Portfolio and anticipated rebalancing dates, as well as the daily holdings of the Fund, are available on the Fund's website at www.risingrateetf.com.  The weighting of the Treasury Instruments constituting the Benchmark Component Instruments will be based on each maturity's duration contribution. The expected range for the duration weighted percentage of the 2 year and 5 year maturity Treasury Instruments will be from 30% to 70%. The expected range for the duration weighted percentage of the 10 year maturity Treasury Instruments will be from 5% to 25%. The relative weightings of the Benchmark Component Instruments will be shifted between maturities when there are material changes in the shape of the yield curve, for example, if the Federal Reserve began raising short term interest rates more than long term interest rates. In such an instance, Sit, which maintains the Benchmark Portfolio, will increase the weightings of the 2 year and reduce the weighting in the 10 year maturity Treasury Instruments. Conversely, Sit will do the opposite if the Federal Reserve began raising long term interest rates more than short term interest rates. Reconstitution and rebalancing each will occur monthly, on the 15th, except for as noted above or if there are radical changes in the yield curve such that effective duration is outside of a range from negative nine to negative 11-year average effective duration, in which case Sit will adjust the maturities of the Treasury Instruments before the next expected monthly reconstitution.  The Sponsor anticipates that approximately 5% to 15% of the Fund's assets will be used as payment for or collateral for Treasury Instruments. In order to collateralize its Treasury Instrument positions the Fund will hold such assets, from which it will post margin to its FCM, in an amount equal to the margin required by the relevant exchange, and transfer to its FCM any additional amounts that may be separately required by the FCM. When establishing positions in Treasury Instruments, the Fund will be required to deposit initial margin with a value of approximately 3% to 10% of the value of each Treasury Instrument position at the time it is established. These margin requirements are subject to change from time to time by the exchange or the FCM. On a daily basis, the Fund will be obligated to pay, or entitled to receive, variation margin in an amount equal to the change in the daily settlement level of its Treasury Instruments positions. Any assets not required to be posted as margin with the FCM will be held at the Fund's administrator in cash or cash equivalents as discussed below.  - 21 -  The Benchmark Portfolio will be invested in Benchmark Component Instruments and rebalanced, as noted above, to maintain a negative average effective portfolio duration of approximately 10 years. Duration is a measure of estimated price sensitivity relative to changes in interest rates. Portfolios with longer durations are typically more sensitive to changes in interest rates. For example, if interest rates rise by 1%, the market value of a security with an effective duration of 5 years would decrease by 5%, with all other factors being constant, and likewise the market value of a security with an effective duration of negative 5 years would increase by 5%, with all other factors being constant. Duration estimates are based on assumptions by Sit and are subject to a number of limitations. Duration is a more accurate estimate of price sensitivity provided interest rate changes are small and occur equally in short-term and long-term securities. Investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. The risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities.  The Fund will incur certain expenses in connection with its operations. The Fund will hold cash or cash equivalents such as U.S. Treasuries or other high credit quality, short-term fixed-income or similar securities for direct investment or as collateral for the Treasury Instruments and for other liquidity purposes and to meet redemptions that may be necessary on an ongoing basis. These expenses and income from the cash and cash equivalent holdings may cause imperfect correlation between changes in the Fund's NAV and changes in the Benchmark Portfolio, because the Benchmark Portfolio does not reflect expenses or income.  The Sponsor  ETF Managers Capital, LLC is the sponsor of the Trust and the Fund. The Sponsor is a Delaware limited liability company, formed on June 12, 2014. The principal office is located at 35 Beechwood Road, Suite 2B, Summit, NJ 07901. The Sponsor is registered as a commodity pool operator ("CPO") with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC") and became a member of the National Futures Association ("NFA") on September 23, 2014. The Trust and the Fund operates pursuant to the Trust Agreement.  The Sponsor is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Exchange Traded Managers Group LLC ("ETFMG"), a limited liability company domiciled and headquartered in New Jersey. The Sponsor maintains its main business office at 35 Beechwood Road, Suite 2B, Summit, NJ 07901.  Under the Trust Agreement, the Sponsor has exclusive management and control of all aspects of the Trust's business. The Trustee has no duty or liability to supervise the performance of the Sponsor, nor will the Trustee have any liability for the acts or omissions of the Sponsor. The shareholders have no voice in the day to day management of the business and operations of the Fund and the Trust, other than certain limited voting rights as set forth in the Trust Agreement. In the course of its management of the business and affairs of the Fund and the Trust, the Sponsor may, in its sole and absolute discretion, appoint an affiliate or affiliates of the Sponsor as additional sponsors and retain such persons, including affiliates of the Sponsor, as it deems necessary to effectuate and carry out the purposes, business and objectives of the Trust.  Results of Operations  COMPARISON OF PER SHARE RISE NAV TO RISE MARKET VALUE  FOR THE PERIOD FROM FEBRUARY 19, 2015 TO MARCH 31, 2015  [[Image Removed]]  NEITHER THE PAST PERFORMANCE OF THE FUND NOR THE PRIOR INDEX LEVELS AND CHANGES, POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE, SHOULD BE TAKEN AS AN INDICATION OF THE FUND'S FUTURE PERFORMANCE.  The per Share market value of RISE and its NAV tracked closely for the period from February 19, 2015 to March 31, 2015.  -22-  COMPARISON OF PER SHARE RISE NAV TO BENCHMARK PORTFOLIO  FOR THE PERIOD FROM FEBRUARY 19, 2015 TO MARCH 31, 2015  [[Image Removed]]  NEITHER THE PAST PERFORMANCE OF THE FUND NOR THE PRIOR BENCHMARK PORTFOLIO LEVELS AND CHANGES, POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE, SHOULD BE TAKEN AS AN INDICATION OF THE FUND'S FUTURE PERFORMANCE.  The graph above compares the return of RISE with the benchmark portfolio returns for the period from February 19, 2015 to March 31, 2015. The difference in the NAV price and the benchmark value often results in the appearance of a NAV discount to the benchmark. The difference is related to the cumulative impact on NAV of the Fund's expenses.  FOR THE PERIOD FROM FEBRUARY 19, 2015 TO MARCH 31, 2015  Fund Share Price Performance  During the period from February 19, 2015 (commencement of Shares trading on the NYSE Arca) to March 31, 2015, the NYSE Arca market value of each Share decreased (-2.56%) from $24.96 per Share, representing the initial trade on February 20, 2015, to $24.32 per Share, representing the closing price on March 31, 2015. The Share price high and low for the period from February 20, 2015 to March 31, 2015 and related change from the initial Share price on February 20, 2015 was as follows: Shares traded from a high of $25.17 per Share (+0.84%) on March 6, 2015 to a low of $24.50 per Share (-1.84%) on March 20, 2015.  Fund Share Net Asset Performance  For the period from February 19, 2015 (commencement of investment operations) to March 31, 2015, the net asset value of each Share decreased (-2.92%) from $25.00 per Share to $24.27 per Share. For the period from February 19, 2015 to March 31, 2015 losses in the futures and options contracts and fund expenses resulted in the overall decrease in the NAV per Share during the period from February 19, 2015 to March 31, 2015.  Net loss for the period from February 19, 2015 to March 31, 2015, was $178,267, resulting from net realized losses on futures and options contracts of $11,396, net unrealized losses on futures and options contracts of $156,031, and the net operating loss of $10,840.  Calculating NAV  The Fund's NAV is calculated by:  � Taking the current market value of its total assets;  - 23 -  The Administrator calculates the NAV of the Fund once each NYSE Arca trading day. The NAV for a particular trading day is released after 4:00 p.m. New York time. Trading during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca typically closes at 4:00 p.m. New York time. The Administrator uses the CME closing price (determined at the earlier of the close of the CME) for the contracts traded on the CME, but calculates or determines the value of all other Fund investments using market quotations, if available, or other information customarily used to determine the fair value of such investments as of the earlier of the close of the NYSE Arca or 4:00 p.m. New York time, in accordance with the current Administrative Agency Agreement among U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, the Fund and the Sponsor. "Other information" customarily used in determining fair value includes information consisting of market data in the relevant market supplied by one or more third parties including, without limitation, relevant rates, prices, yields, yield curves, volatilities, spreads, correlations or other market data in the relevant market; or information of the types described above from internal sources if that information is of the same type used by the Fund in the regular course of its business for the valuation of similar transactions. The information may include costs of funding, to the extent costs of funding are not and would not be a component of the other information being utilized. Third parties supplying quotations or market data may include, without limitation, dealers in the relevant markets, end-users of the relevant product, information vendors, brokers and other sources of market information.  In addition, in order to provide updated information relating to the Fund for use by investors and market professionals, the NYSE Arca calculates and disseminates throughout the core trading session on each trading day an updated indicative fund value. The indicative fund value is calculated by using the prior day's closing NAV per share of the Fund as a base and updating that value throughout the trading day to reflect changes in the most recently reported trade price for the futures and options held by the Fund traded on the CME. The indicative fund value share basis disseminated during NYSE Arca core trading session hours should not be viewed as an actual real time update of the NAV, because the NAV is calculated only once at the end of each trading day based upon the relevant end of day values of the Fund's investments.  The indicative fund value is disseminated on a per share basis every 15 seconds during regular NYSE Arca core trading session hours of 9:30 a.m. New York time to 4:00 p.m. New York time. The normal trading hours of the CME are 10:00 a.m. New York time to 2:30 p.m. New York time. This means that there is a gap in time at the beginning and the end of each day during which the Fund's shares are traded on the NYSE Arca, but real-time CME trading prices for contracts traded on the CME are not available. During such gaps in time the indicative fund value will be calculated based on the end of day price of such contracts from the CME's immediately preceding trading session. In addition, other investments and U.S. Treasuries held by the Fund will be valued by the Administrator, using rates and points received from client-approved third party vendors (such as Reuters and WM Company) and advisor quotes. These investments will not be included in the indicative fund value.  The NYSE Arca disseminates the indicative fund value through the facilities of CTA/CQ High Speed Lines. In addition, the indicative fund value is published on the NYSE Arca's website and is available through on-line information services such as Bloomberg and Reuters.  Dissemination of the indicative fund value provides additional information that is not otherwise available to the public and is useful to investors and market professionals in connection with the trading of the Fund shares on the NYSE Arca. Investors and market professionals are able throughout the trading day to compare the market price of the Fund and the indicative fund value. If the market price of the Fund shares diverges significantly from the indicative fund value, market professionals will have an incentive to execute arbitrage trades. For example, if the Fund appears to be trading at a discount compared to the indicative fund value, a market professional could buy the Fund shares on the NYSE Arca and take the opposite position in Treasury Instruments. Such arbitrage trades can tighten the tracking between the market price of the Fund and the indicative fund value and thus can be beneficial to all market participants.  Critical Accounting Policies  The Fund's critical accounting policies are as follows:  Preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires the application of appropriate accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The Fund's application of these policies involves judgments and the use of estimates. Actual results may differ from the estimates used and such differences could be material. The Fund holds a significant portion of its assets in futures contracts and a money market fund, which are held at fair value.  The Fund calculates its net asset value as of the NAV Calculation Time as described above.  - 24 -  The values which are used by the Fund for its Treasury Instruments are provided by its commodity broker who uses market prices when available. In addition, the Fund estimates interest income on a daily basis using prevailing rates earned on its cash and cash equivalents. These estimates are adjusted to the actual amount received on a monthly basis and the difference, if any, is not considered material.  Credit Risk  When the Fund enters into Benchmark Component Instruments, it will be exposed to the credit risk that the counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations. For purposes of credit risk, the counterparty for the Benchmark Component Instruments traded on the CME and other futures exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with those exchanges. In general, clearinghouses are backed by their members who may be required to share in the financial burden resulting from the nonperformance of one of their members, which should significantly reduce credit risk. There can be no assurance that any counterparty, clearinghouse, or their financial backers will satisfy their obligations to the Fund.  The Sponsor will attempt to minimize certain of these market and credit risks by normally:  � executing and clearing trades with creditworthy counterparties, as determined by the Sponsor;  � limiting the outstanding amounts due from counterparties of the Fund;  � not posting margin directly with a counterparty;  � limiting the amount of margin or premium posted at the FCM; and  � ensuring that deliverable contracts are not held to such a date when delivery of an underlying asset could be called for.  The Commodity Exchange Act ("CEA") requires all FCMs, such as the Fund's clearing broker, to meet and maintain specified fitness and financial requirements, to segregate customer funds from proprietary funds and account separately for all customers' funds and positions, and to maintain specified books and records open to inspection by the staff of the CFTC. The CFTC has similar authority over introducing brokers, or persons who solicit or accept orders for commodity interest trades but who do not accept margin deposits for the execution of trades. The CEA authorizes the CFTC to regulate trading by FCMs and by their officers and directors, permits the CFTC to require action by exchanges in the event of market emergencies, and establishes an administrative procedure under which customers may institute complaints for damages arising from alleged violations of the CEA. The CEA also gives the states powers to enforce its provisions and the regulations of the CFTC.  On November 14, 2013, the CFTC published final regulations that require enhanced customer protections, risk management programs, internal monitoring and controls, capital and liquidity standards, customer disclosures and auditing and examination programs for FCMs. The rules are intended to afford greater assurances to market participants that customer segregated funds and secured amounts are protected, customers are provided with appropriate notice of the risks of futures trading and of the FCMs with which they may choose to do business, FCMs are monitoring and managing risks in a robust manner, the capital and liquidity of FCMs are strengthened to safeguard the continued operations and the auditing and examination programs of the CFTC and the self-regulatory organizations are monitoring the activities of FCMs in a thorough manner.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  The Fund does not anticipate making use of borrowings or other lines of credit to meet its obligations. The Fund meets its liquidity needs in the normal course of business from the proceeds of the sale of its investments or from the cash, cash equivalents and/or the collateralizing Treasury Securities that it holds. The Fund's liquidity needs include: redeeming its shares, providing margin deposits for existing Benchmark Component Instruments, the purchase of additional Benchmark Component Instruments, and paying expenses.  The Fund generates cash primarily from (i) the sale of Creation Baskets and (ii) interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and their investments in collateralizing Treasury Securities. Generally, all of the net assets of the Fund are allocated to trading in Benchmark Component Instruments. Most of the assets of the Fund are held in Treasury Instruments, cash and/or cash equivalents that could or are used as margin or collateral for trading in Benchmark Component Instruments. The percentage that such assets bear to the total net assets will vary from period to period as the market values of the Benchmark Component Instruments change. Interest earned on interest-bearing assets of the Fund is paid to the Fund.  - 25 -  The investments of the Fund in Benchmark Component Instruments could be subject to periods of illiquidity because of market conditions, regulatory considerations and other reasons. Such conditions could prevent the Fund from promptly liquidating a position in Benchmark Component Instruments.  Market Risk  Trading in Benchmark Component Instruments such as futures contracts will involve the Fund entering into contractual commitments to purchase or sell specific amounts of instruments at a specified date in the future. The gross or face amount of the contracts is expected to significantly exceed the future cash requirements of the Fund as the Fund intends to close out any open positions prior to the contractual expiration date. As a result, the Fund's market risk is the risk of loss arising from the decline in value of the contracts, not from the need to make delivery under the contracts. The Fund considers the "fair value" of derivative instruments to be the unrealized gain or loss on the contracts. The market risk associated with the commitment by the Fund to purchase a specific contract will be limited to the aggregate face amount of the contracts held.  The exposure of the Fund to market risk will depend on a number of factors including the markets for the specific instrument, the volatility of interest rates and foreign exchange rates, the liquidity of the instrument-specific market and the relationships among the contracts held by the Fund.  Regulatory Environment  The regulation of futures markets, futures contracts, and futures exchanges has historically been comprehensive. The CFTC and the exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event of a market emergency including, for example, the retroactive implementation of speculative position limits, increased margin requirements, the establishment of daily price limits and the suspension of trading.  The regulation of commodity interest transactions in the United States is a rapidly changing area of law and is subject to ongoing modification by governmental and judicial action. Considerable regulatory attention has been focused on non-traditional investment pools that are publicly distributed in the United States. There is a possibility of future regulatory changes within the United States altering, perhaps to a material extent, the nature of an investment in the Fund, or the ability of the Fund to continue to implement its investment strategy. The effect of any future regulatory change on the Fund is impossible to predict but could be substantial and adverse.  The CFTC possesses exclusive jurisdiction to regulate the activities of commodity pool operators and has adopted regulations with respect to the activities of those persons and/or entities. Under the CEA, a registered CPO, such as the Sponsor, is required to make annual filings with the CFTC describing its organization, capital structure, management and controlling persons. In addition, the CEA authorizes the CFTC to require and review books and records . . .  May 15, 2015  (c) 1995-2015 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

The Sponsor causes the Fund to transfer the proceeds from the sale of Creation
Baskets to the Custodian or other custodian for trading activities. The Sponsor
will invest the proceeds in U.S. Treasuries with a maturity of 397 days or less,
cash and/or cash equivalents and in futures contracts and options on futures
contracts on U.S. Treasuries. When the Fund purchases a futures contract, the
Fund is required to deposit with the selling FCM on behalf of the exchange a
portion of the value of the contract or other interest as security to ensure
payment for the obligation at maturity. This deposit is known as initial margin.
The Fund will receive or pay, depending on market movement, variation margin as
the value of the futures position increase or decreases. The Fund will pay
premiums on the options contracts that it purchases. The Sponsor will invest the
assets that remain after margin and collateral are posted in U.S. Treasuries,
cash and/or cash equivalents Subject to these margin and collateral
requirements, the Sponsor has sole authority to determine the percentage of
assets that are:

· held on deposit with the FCM or other custodian,

· used for other investments, and

· held in bank accounts to pay current obligations and as reserves.

Approximately 10% of the Fund’s assets are expected to normally be committed as
margin for futures contracts. However, from time to time, the percentage of
assets committed as margin may be substantially more, or less, than such range.
Ongoing margin and collateral payments will generally be required for
exchange-traded contracts based on changes in their value. In light of the
differing requirements for initial payments under exchange-traded contracts and
the fluctuating nature of ongoing margin and collateral payments, it is not
possible to estimate what portion of the Fund’s assets will be posted as margin
or collateral at any given time. The U.S. Treasuries, cash and cash equivalents
held by the Fund will constitute reserves that will be available to meet ongoing
margin and collateral requirements. All interest income will be used for the
Fund’s benefit. The Sponsor invests the balance of the Fund’s assets not
invested in futures or options on U.S. Treasuries with a maturity of 397 days or
less, cash and cash equivalents and such funds are available as reserves for
changes in margin. All interest income is used for the Fund’s benefit.

An FCM, counterparty, government agency or commodity exchange could increase
margin or collateral requirements applicable to the Fund to hold trading
positions at any time. Moreover, margin is merely a security deposit and has no
bearing on the profit or loss potential for any positions held.

The assets of the Fund posted as margin for futures contracts will be held in
segregation pursuant to the CEA and CFTC regulations.


Not Specified.


Company Description
The ETF Managers Group Commodity Trust I (the “Trust”) is a Delaware statutory
trust formed on July 23, 2014. The Trust is a series trust formed pursuant to
the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, of which the Fund is currently the sole
series. The Fund is a commodity pool that continuously issues common


 shares of
beneficial interest that may be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca stock
exchange (“NYSE Arca”). The Fund is managed and controlled by ETF Managers
Capital LLC (the “Sponsor”), a Delaware limited liability company. The Sponsor
is registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) as a
commodity pool operator (“CPO”) and is a member of the National Futures
Association (“NFA”). Sit Fixed Income Advisors II, LLC (“Sit”) is registered as
a “commodity trading advisor” (“CTA”) and will act as such for the Fund.

The Fund’s investment objective is to profit from rising interest rates by
tracking the performance of a portfolio (the “Benchmark Portfolio”) consisting
of exchange traded futures contracts and options on futures on 2, 5 and 10-year
U.S. Treasury securities (“Treasury Instruments”) weighted to achieve a targeted
negative 10 year average effective portfolio duration (the “Benchmark Component
Instruments”). The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing
in the Benchmark Component Instruments currently constituting the Benchmark
Portfolio. The Benchmark Portfolio is maintained by Sit and will be rebalanced,
reconstituted, or both, monthly (typically on the 15th of each month and on the
next business day if the 15th is a holiday, weekend, or other day on which the
national exchanges are closed) to maintain a negative 10 year average effective
duration. The Benchmark Portfolio and the Fund will each maintain a short
position in Treasury Instruments. The Fund does not use futures contracts or
options to obtain leveraged investment results. The Benchmark Component
Instruments currently constituting the Benchmark Portfolio and anticipated
rebalancing dates, as well as the daily holdings of the Fund, are available on
the Fund’s website at www.risingrateetf.com.

The weighting of the Treasury Instruments constituting the Benchmark Component
Instruments will be based on each maturity’s duration contribution. The expected
range for the duration weighted percentage of the 2 year and 5 year maturity
Treasury Instruments will be from 30% to 70%. The expected range for the
duration weighted percentage of the 10 year maturity Treasury Instruments will
be from 5% to 25%. The relative weightings of the Benchmark Component
Instruments will be shifted between maturities when there are material changes
in the shape of the yield curve, for example, if the Federal Reserve began
raising short term interest rates more than long term interest rates. In 
such an instance, Sit, which maintains the Benchmark Portfolio, will 
increase the weightings of the 2 year and reduce the weighting in the 
10 year maturity Treasury Instruments. Conversely, Sit will do the opposite
if the Federal Reserve began raising long term interest rates more than 
short term interest rates. Reconstitution and rebalancing each will occur 
monthly, on the 15th, except for as noted above or if there are radical 
changes in the yield curve such that effective duration is outside of 
a range from negative nine to negative 11-year average effective duration, 
in which case Sit will adjust the maturities of the Treasury Instruments 
before the next expected monthly reconstitution.

The Sponsor anticipates that approximately 5% to 15% of the Fund’s assets will
be used as payment for or collateral for Treasury Instruments. In order to
collateralize its Treasury Instrument positions the Fund will hold such assets,
from which it will post margin to its futures commission merchant (“FCM”), in an
amount equal to the margin required by the relevant exchange, and transfer to
its FCM any additional amounts that may be separately required by the FCM. When
establishing positions in Treasury Instruments, the Fund will be required to
deposit initial margin with a value of approximately 3% to 10% of the value of
each Treasury Instrument position at the time it is established. These margin
requirements are subject to change from time to time by the exchange or the FCM.
On a daily basis, the Fund will be obligated to pay, or entitled to receive,
variation margin in an amount equal to the change in the daily settlement level
of its Treasury Instruments positions. Any assets not required to be posted as
margin with the FCM will be held at the Fund’s administrator in cash or cash
equivalents as discussed below.

The Benchmark Portfolio will be invested in Benchmark Component Instruments and
rebalanced, as noted above, to maintain a negative average effective portfolio
duration of approximately 10 years. Duration is a measure of estimated price
sensitivity relative to changes in interest rates. Portfolios with longer
durations are typically more sensitive to changes in interest rates. For
example, if interest rates rise by 1%, the market value of a security with an
effective duration of 5 years would decrease by 5%, with all other factors being
constant, and likewise the market value of a security with an effective duration
of negative 5 years would increase by 5%, with all other factors being constant.
Duration estimates are based on assumptions by Sit and are subject to a number
of limitations. Duration is a more accurate estimate of price sensitivity
provided interest rate changes are small and occur equally in short-term and
long-term securities. Investments in debt securities typically decrease in value
when interest rates rise. The risk is usually greater for longer-term debt
securities.

The Fund will incur certain expenses in connection with its operations. The Fund
will hold cash or cash equivalents such as U.S. Treasuries or other high credit
quality, short-term fixed-income or similar securities for direct investment or
as collateral for the Treasury Instruments and for other liquidity purposes and
to meet redemptions that may be necessary on an ongoing basis. These expenses
and income from the cash and cash equivalent holdings may cause imperfect
correlation between changes in the Fund’s NAV and changes in the Benchmark
Portfolio, because the Benchmark Portfolio does not reflect expenses or income.
