Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

As the investment and commercial banking community continues to focus on profitability and discrete transactions, increasingly there are conflicts that can arise from relying on traditional banking relationships to guide decisions.  As a result, governing boards and senior management have placed greater value on independent advice and assistance in evaluating and implementing financing decisions over the longer term.
Customized and analytic approach 
Given the unique nature of each institution’s needs, organizational structure and decision-making process, we tailor our engagements to reflect the specific scope and services desired by our clients. Despite the shared missions of many of our clients, there is no “one size fits all” approach, and the customized analytical tools and models we develop reflect the specific circumstances of each client.
Strategic guidance, advice and counsel
Although we are able to develop and execute complex (as well as straightforward) debt and/or swap transactions smoothly and efficiently due to the extensive banking experience of our professionals, our approach is longer term and more strategic in nature. We recognize, and enjoy sharing, the challenges our clients face in working through issues to determine an appropriate and thoughtful approach and strategy to assist in the capital planning and financing process within current and potential internal, and external, economic realities and constraints.
Informal Role as Industry Advocates
Although we are careful to respect the confidentiality of our clients and not to represent their views unless specifically requested, we are committed to serving as general advocates for the higher education and not-for-profit industry in our discussions and interactions with financial institutions and the rating agencies. We seek to do this in a congenial manner by developing collegial relationships with other market participants in order to engage in constructive dialogue that we hope will benefit our clients and the industry as a whole.

What's a "Yuba"?



Originally made by Buddhist monks and prized for its delicacy and nutritional value, yuba is derived from carefully skimming off the top of hot soybean milk.  According to legend, the first Chinese Emperor Qin Shi Huang (B.C. 259 to 210) believed that consuming yuba would prolong life.
The Yuba River runs through northern California and is considered one of the last strongholds for wild, self-sustaining salmon and steelhead runs. It is also home to the Yuba Goldfields created during the mid-1800s Gold Rush.

In recognition of the long-term implications of decisions made today, the firm’s name serves as a reminder of both the missions of our clients to serve future generations and our own commitment to their long-term financial and operating prosperity.

Jason Tetro
Senior Microbiologist



Jason Tetro has spent the last 25 years as a microbiologist learning about our relationship with germs both good and bad.  In 2007, while still publishing scientific articles, reviews, chapters in books, he ventured out of the lab and into the TV studio where he spent close to three years doing Q&A segments with CTV Ottawa as The Germ Guy.  He has since broadcast and written for a wide range of media including the Scientific American, The Huffington Post Canada, the CBC, and his own Germ Guy blog.  In November, his first book, The Germ Code, will be published by Random House/Doubleday Canada.  Jason knows that germs play an integral role in our lives and that we can learn how to improve our health and human relationships by giving them the attention they so deserve.

 Manufacturing
 We pioneered RTM (Rapid Time to Market) concurrent engineering process twenty years ago, providing unmatched speed and cost effectiveness of product design/build while maintaining quality.





Gibbs Group is a valuable Manufacturing asset to your company. The extensive resources of larger companies usually do not exist in small businesses; the processes of large companies can often stifle efficient manufacturing.

We enjoy these challenges and welcome even the smallest forward-thinking company looking for a reliable partner to meet their goals.

We strive for immediate profitability, followed by sustained cost reduction. It is well known that effective Project Management is key to success, and Gibbs Group has mastered a unique way to bring products to market. With our Rapid Time to Market (RTM) processes, we bring together a small, versatile team, selected just for your programs. We know that this tight communication yields results 100 to 1000 times better than large-scale product development environments. -Lean Manufacturing, MIT. Schedules must move so rapidly, that by the time information is disseminated through traditional company framework, it is stale.  

Globalization, outsourcing, and M&A activity have created a complex product development network of dispersed product teams, collaborating across multiple time zones, and speaking different languages. To be competitive (to stay in business), companies need to have multi-national presence, but many have found this complex global network to be incompatible with their existing US-based operations. Our RTM Teams can handle ALL the interchange for your product or your company. Leaving you to manage growth and cultivate markets. We have maintained overseas offices for decades, and handle the day-to-day project management activities for you. We have perfected the most effective blend of collaborative web-based project management tools and human interaction to bring projects to market....on time....on budget.  

Total Product Development Projects Launched (per 100 Sampled)  

Out of every 100 product development projects launched, 25 end up commercially successful, 63 are ultimately cancelled (after tremendous costs are incurred), and 12 fail outright.

Iso-Belt® presents at One Million Cups



Doug Gibbs, CEO of Iso-Belt™ presented their newest innovative medical product, the Iso-Gown at One Million Cups-Sacramento.  Incorporating a patented plastic belt integrated into standard hospital isolation gowns, the Iso-Gown eliminates the tie strings found on conventional products typically used in managed care facilities, hospitals and professional medical offices around the globe.  The isolation gowns are meant to insulate and protect the wearer from deadly pathogens found in such facilities.  Studies have found that because wearers often allow the tie strings to touch the ground during the donning process, the tie strings easily contaminate with deadly disease, infecting their hands, and consequently, the user, caregiver and patient!  The Iso-Gown eliminates this quiet and dangerous process because there are no tie strings to come in proximity of the hospital floor.  

1 Million Cups is a national program designed to educate, engage and connect entrepreneurs. Developed by the Kauffman Foundation, 1Milllion Cups is based on the notion that entrepreneurs discover solutions and network over a million cups of coffee and is led by more than 300 volunteers in 35+ states, one U.S. territory, and six time zones. It attracts an estimated national weekly attendance of more than 2,500 people. 
Protected by patent number 8037544, “Self Securing Garment” the Iso- Gown is currently under review at numerous hospitals and care facilities around the world.  The Company believes their patented Iso-Gown will esult in substantial reductions in Hospital Acquired Disease (HAI) as well as reduced rates of post-surgery re-admissions due to unabated infections.  Combined with antibiotic overuse, the frequency of HAI and re-admissions is many hospitals is excessively high and results in billions of dollars in societal costs and thousands of lives annually.

The team of Doug Gibbs (CEO) and Dr. Bob Burky (President) are principals in this medical PPE business and are located at 2182 Blevin Road in Yuba City, Ca.  95993 USA

Iso-Belt® Licenses Medical Patent



To compliment its own Intellectual Property, California-based Iso-Belt® announced it is the exclusive Licensee of US Patent number 8,037,544, Self Securing Garment, to utilize in its line of AAMI-II medical isolation gowns.  Iso-Belt®, who specializes in isolation gowns without the conventional tie strings makes and distributes these revolutionary gowns.  Studies have found that tie strings  
often come in contact with, or in proximity of the floor during the normal donning process.  The infected strings are then hand tied by the user, spreading deadly pathagens to patients and caregivers.  New federal Medicare penalties levied upon hospitals with high rates of Hospital Acquired Infections (HAI) and post-surgery re-admissions now cost care facilities tens of millions of dollars annually.
 

The Iso-Belt® products utilize a patented plastic band that provides automatic closure without conventional tie strings.   Not only does the product eliminate the potential of transferring floor contamination to patients, it is especially popular with obese users and those with limited mobility, since there are no inconvenient strings to tie.  The company anticipates global distribution through such GPO as  Vizient/Novation, the nation’s largest member-owned healthcare supplies company, and is under tests to expand its customer base throughout North America.  IsoBelt™ is also distributed through independent medical supply companies and direct to hospitals and managed care facilities.
The Principals of Iso-Belt® include Dr. Robert Burky, Board Certified Orthopedic Surgeon and Doug Gibbs, BSME, MBA, JD and startup expert.  Gibbs is CEO and operations manager for this PPE business that combines an American team of Infection Prevention experts with international manufacturing alliances.  Tilmar LLC is located at 2182 Blevin Road in Yuba City, Ca.  95993 USA (530) 751-2765 x 12, http://www.iso-belt.com, or Doug Gibbs at doug@iso-belt.com.

Live Oak's Sannar patents guitar amplifier design


DATELINE: April 14, 2013 | by Michael Hatamiya for appealdemocrat.com
A Mid-Valley industrial designer has received a US patent for a guitar amplifier that is lightweight and affordable yet has the sound of traditional tube-type amplifiers.Jason Sannar, product design manager for Gibbs Group LLC of Yuba City, was granted his first patent, which protects the design of the EM-1 guitar amplifier made by Four Force. The EM-1 won Best of Show at the National Association of Music Merchants trade show in Nashville, Tenn., in July last year, competing against heavyweights like Peavey, Marshall and Fender. Sannar, 44, a Gridley High School graduate who lives in Live Oak, won approval for the design patent, which covers the way it physically looks. Jim McGillivary, an executive with Tektronix, designed the amp's circuit technology. McGillivary's utility patent for the way the amplifier operates is pending.
"When Jim came to us, all he had was the circuit board, and he asked us to design something different than the typical amp," Sannar recounted last week. "I looked at literally thousands of amp designs. And what you could see was that they're all a box. So I knew I needed to do something other than that."We knew we had to make this look different from other amps. There are thousands of them on the market, and we knew it had to look different or no one would give it a second thought and no one would hear what it sounds like," he explained.

The EM-1 utilizes a solid-state circuit board, unlike traditional amps, which use vacuum tubes. It weighs only 12 pounds, relieving guitar players from having to lug around large, heavy tube-amplifiers. 
"They still use tubes today because musicians like the sound tube amps have a very distinct sound," Sannar said.  
"But they're expensive, they're delicate, the tubes can break. The problem with solid state is it doesn't have the same warm sound as a tube amp. "So Jim came up with a new type of solid-state circuitry to mimic the sound of a tube amplifier, with tube-like distortion, which guitar players want. Fender even tried to do it and fell short." 

Through Gibbs Group's China branch, a manufacturer in China was found for production of the EM-1. The factory also makes speakers for VOX and Fender. 

Four Force LLC, which is owned by McGillivary, was set up to make and distribute the EM-1. The amp went on the market in January 2012 with a retail price of $199. The first run of 500 has sold out, and they've ordered 1,000 more units.

Four Force is coming out with a 50-watt bass amp this summer. With the EM-1 at 5 watts, the company is also working on the 50-watt EM-2, which is due out in 2014.

Sannar isn't wallowing in his guitar amp success. He's currently involved with or has recently finished work on a portable steamer, anti-microbial sleeves for door handles and a line of protective hockey gear for an NHL player.

Forcing the Issue...


DATELINE: July 12, 2012
The struggle to find a solid-state amp that matches a tube amp has been raging from the day solid-state was invented the technology was cheaper, lighter, and in many ways more versatile, which all seemed like advantages to the early adopters. It didn't take long for amp designers to start scrambling to replicate the natural break-up and warm tones of classic tubes, though.

The new California-based company, Four Force, recently unveiled what could be the next step in this quest: an ultra-compact amp called the EM-1. It's a sleek, 13-pound solution to a decades-old problem, and the company says it's just getting started. 

The small EM-1 is initially the sole focus and identity of Four Force. It's a 5-watt combo amp with a 35-watt 10" speaker and a 3-band EQ, overdrive, and volume controls that can also power an extension cabinet for big-time volumes. The amps work on a circuit technology dubbed "Tube Illusion" that was developed by founder Jim McGillivary, an executive at a tech company. The group began showing off the amps at the 2012 Winter NAMM show and immediately started getting great response.
 


 

Indeed, at the NAMM show, they took to wearing the amps around their neck to demonstrate how lightweight they were. Rankin says the weight never gets in the way of a need for volume. "I took it home and hooked it up to a Marshall 412 cabinet, which is a 100w cabinet, and it was shaking the walls. You'd be surprised with this little 5w amp pushing a 16 ohm cabinet. It will take you by surprise. The 10" speaker is great for practice, but you can turn that up. If you're using it in more of a live band setting, you can hook it up to an extension cabinet two 10s, two 12s, four 12s, even a full stack. It will push them."

Sutton's talent for tinkering may mean new equipment line; 'Game-changing' protective gear under development


By J. Ireland | The Edmonton Journal | DATELINE: March 8, 2012 | Photography by Shaughn Butts, The Journal, File , Edmonton Journal
Tinkering has long been one of Andy Sutton's diversions but now the Edmonton Oilers defenceman is in the process of turning his interest in technology into an equipment line.

Sutton, who teamed up with the Gibbs Group, a California-based product and development company, currently has his product in the test lab. The end goal is to get a shinto-shoulder line of protective gear into the NHL.

It's going to provide significant weight savings without compromising protection. It's going to be game-changing," said Sutton, who was six classes from graduating from Michigan Tech with a degree in environmental engineering when he was signed by the San Jose Sharks in 1998. Over the years he's modified his golf clubs, altered his hockey gear, and about three years ago, got serious about developing his own line. Gibbs has been shipping samples to Sutton throughout the process and they have often scheduled meetings during the Oilers road trips to California. They know they are not the only ones looking for innovative solutions to curb the increasing number of injuries and that companies like Nike and Reebok are constantly pushing ideas through their research and development facilities. Still, they remain committed to their project. 


 

"I've been in product development all my life," said Doug Gibbs from his office in Sacramento. 

"The day you think you're the first one with an idea is the day that you retire. 

"This system is both lighter and more protective," he explained. "The gear hasn't changed much in the last 20 years. It does the job but it's bulky and hot and cumbersome. 

"Andy came to us to develop a technology that would change the shape and the performance of protection systems. Over the past year or so, we've tried a number of different inventions and technology applications and I think we have one that works."

Tehama County Landfill Diverting Waste


By Andrea Wagner, DN Staff Writer | Source: www.redbluffdailynews.com | DATELINE: February 18, 2011
Mountains of garbage and a lot of diligent work have compacted into an alliance between businesses and recycling efforts. The Tehama County Sanitary Landfill Agency has been combining grant funding, ingenuity and economic sensitivity to make waste management and recycling valuable and convenient for businesses.

One project has the Landfill Agency staff doing a one-month study, starting Feb. 15, to see how much expanded polystyrene, or plastic foam, is collected locally, said Kristina Miller, manager.

GreenFreak, LLC, a company based in Yuba City, has proposed creating a new manufacturing site in Tehama County to recycle used Styrofoam and other plastic foams into custom bobble-head cake toppers, skateboard decks, Hygenique baths and professional tool sets. 


 

CalRecycle offers low-interest loans and other tools to give incentives to businesses that divert waste from landfills, according to the website,www.calrecycle.ca.gov

Tehama County became one of the newest members of the Recycled Market Development Zone in October 2009, making it possible for local businesses to participate in the loan programs and other benefits.

The company is applying for a $365,000 loan that would fund up to 75 percent of the project costs at a 4 percent interest rate over seven years.

Along those same lines, the agency is in the process of creating a Green Business Guild program to give local businesses incentives and awards for recycling and waste reduction.

MThe landfill itself is distinctly organized. Gulls circle and squawk above one hill as trucks painted mostly dark green dart to and from the mound like bees to a hive. Driving closer to the top of the hill, to the open face of the landfill, plastic grocery bags that spin and jump in the wind like flies are confined by fencing to catch debris. Downhill, in the Material Recovery Center, a large garage contains machines, conveyer belts and large bins that are used to sort and bale recyclables brought in from curbside bins throughout the county. Outside, areas are designated for particular types of waste, such as leaves and grasses or hazardous wastes.

A proposal is to be presented to the Joint Powers Association for approval in March.

Y.C. Man Has Green Plan for Styrofoam


DATELINE: October 2, 2010
Doug Gibbs challenges anyone to tear his business card in half. The strongest resident could try, but it's doubtful they would shred it in two. The normal-looking card is made from recycled plastic and is just one product Gibbs hopes to soon see manufactured in the Yuba-Sutter area when the new business GreenFreak gets off the ground. By starting the plastic foam recycling company, he and others at Gibbs Group aim to put local residents back to work and help the environment. The business model is fairly simple: Divert expanded polystyrene, commonly known as Styrofoam, from the landfill, then recycle it into a higher-value product and train local residents how to manufacture, sell and market those new plastic products.

"I'm not trying to save the world," he said. "But I see so many people with no jobs and their lives are falling apart and this is what I can do." Last week, Gibbs presented the business to supervisors in Yuba and Sutter counties and the Yuba City economic development commission, hoping to gain their endorsement. 

GreenFreak can begin manufacturing plastic products in as little as two months, as soon as it signs a contractual agreement for expanded polystyrene with a waste management agency. Recology has first right of refusal, but several other landfill agencies are also waiting in the wings, Gibbs said. Polystyrene is a problem everywhere in the country, Gibbs said. If it can be reclaimed and processed into a higher value commodity, known as "upcycling," there is a profit to be made along with positive environmental benefits. A giant block of expanded foam that once cushioned and protected electronics is processed down to a small amount of pelletized resin, which can be made into any plastic object, whether skateboards, bobbleheads or medical equipment, Gibbs said. 

GreenFreak already has developed prototypes of possible products and has buyers lined up, he said. He plans to use existing business relationships with Wal-Mart, Williams-Sonoma and Ace Hardware, and offer to make any recycled plastic product they desire.
"This is building jobs, which is No. 1 on our list of things we need to accomplish," said Councilwoman Leslie McBride. 
"Because it is green, it's not being trucked off, polluting and clogging our roadways to go 300 miles to Los Angeles and then be trucked back here." 
"Styrofoam is an ongoing challenge," he said. "It has no recycling home at this point and ultimately ends up in the landfill."

The expanded polystyrene presents more of a volume issue than a weight issue, but also doesn't produce any methane for the landfill to capture and convert to energy. 
"It is a product that doesn't really break down or biodegrade. It just takes up space," he said. "It's of no value to the landfill." 

As GreenFreak grows, so will the number of jobs, profits for the waste management company and the lifespan of the landfill, Gibbs said. The waste management agency that partners with the company will receive a percentage of the profits. 

The plan is to start with premier-grade expanded polystyrene, the kind that is most often found cushioning electronics and other breakables. Once the business is established, it may eventually broach the market for second-grade polystyrene containers, such as Chinese takeout and convenience store coffee cups.

Company man in an unlikely place


DATELINE: May 09, 2009 | By Michael Hatamiya/Appeal-Democrat
Far from being a corporate drone, Doug Gibbs develops companies and their products. Gibbs Group LLC isn't your average business in the Yuba-Sutter area. It's not a retailer or a wholesaler. It has nothing directly to do with farming or forestry or construction or automobile repair. The essence of its business, strictly speaking, is not in manufacturing things like plywood or mobile homes. It's the kind of business one would think of as inhabiting some sleek office building in a place like Santa Clara or Irvine or an expansive college town like Boulder, Colo., or Austin, Texas. Doug Gibbs, co-founder of Gibbs Group, described his business: "We specialize in starting and running small companies and getting them over the crucial first four years of business. We get the machine working and functioning well, then hand it over to the client."





 	
Gibbs Group deals in ideas and business relationships. Along with launching companies, it helps develop products for companies and when there's no one else to make something and sell it, it becomes the manufacturer and seller itself. You wouldn't know this from the company's modest, nondescript building on Shasta Street on the edge of downtown Yuba City. Under a shingled roof, with "Gibbs Group, LLC" painted on the glass door in front, the premises could easily pass for a small-town insurance firm or law office. But step inside and you see the fruits of its labor, which are the things that fill the shelves and racks of Costco, AutoZone, Ace Hardware, Petsmart, Lowe's and other places selling the "stuff" of the American retail experience. In the Gibbs Group office, you can peruse retail displays of a line of hand tools and of Orange County Choppers gear for pets but the household tools and OCC items aren't for sale; they're for showing off the firm's work. There's also a Patagonia jacket on a mannequin and various products in cardboard and cellophane retail packaging.

Gibbs Group developed its Generation Tools line, which includes everything from adjustable wrenches and carpenter's levels to trowels and pipe shears, after one of its salesmen heard retailers lamenting that there was no unified tool line that they could offer tape measures had a different color scheme than bolt cutters which didn't color-coordinate with garden spades. Gibbs realized there was a niche to fill and decided to develop a matching line of tools.

Arcwave's System Passes Testing by Cox


DATELINE: June 15, 2005
 	
Arcwave Inc.'s fixed wireless system, which uses the DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specifications) protocol, has been approved by Cox Business Services for deployment throughout the cable operator's service areas.

Cox conducted field evaluations of Arcwave's ARCXtend wireless plant extension solution, finding that it could establish links within Cox's cable infrastructure without adverse impact.

"ARCXtend provides Cox with the ability to rapidly connect commercial buildings beyond the reach of our HFC [hybrid fiber coaxial] network without the delay and expense of digging up streets or deploying aerial fixed lines through a traditional plant extension," stated Kristine Faulkner, VP of product development and management for Cox Business Services.

Arcwave offers the ARCXtend product as a means for cable operators to reach unserved small-to-medium enterprise (SME) customers.

While cable infrastructure is typically located near such customers, about 50 percent of the SME market is still not readily accessible by the cable companies, according to Arcwave. Typical problems include zoning restrictions, right-of-way challenges and the expense of laying new cable infrastructure to reach SME customers.

CoWave Networks and Advanced Radio Cells, Inc. (ARCi) 
Merge to Form Arcwave


CAMPBELL, Calif., April 09, 2003
 	
CoWave Networks, a developer of protocol and application software for development of mesh-based BWA solutions, and Advanced Radio Cells Inc. (ARCi), an established provider of affordable broadband wireless access equipment operating in the 5GHz license-free band, announced their merger to form a new company called Arcwave Inc. ARCi is a leader in low-cost, highly reliable wireless antenna and radio technology, which is currently being delivered in the successful ARCell Point-to-Multipoint, license-free, 5GHz solution that utilizes DOCSIS, the leading broadband standard in the world, to deliver affordable, reliable, manageable and scalable broadband service in underserved markets.

In December, CoWave received an additional $3.7 million round of funding from its current investors, Mayfield, Venrock, and Lucent. The leveraged talents of the combined company will expand the product offering into other licensed and license-free bands and will explore promising, new market applications with major broadband service providers.

Gibbs Group acted as lead design team for ARCi in the development of its products. "Gibbs Group, LLC filled an important need in early growth stages at ARCI. Their hands-on technical prowess, seasoned staff and international operations proved invaluable to the timely and cost sensitive introduction of our wireless broadband products. THe Gibbs Group Team provided a novel and successful phased-process approach to the engineering, testing, production & introduction of these products. Under their guidance, a rapid tooling process was employed to produce our products (allowing immediate revenue), then they provided seamless transition to full production tooling (with higher retained margins). Their strategy paid off handsomely, and the product is performing very well in all weather conditions with customer (exterior) installations in some of the harshest climates around the globe"

Gibbs Group Develops Biodegradable Non-Petroleum Oil; Earns Motorcycle Industry's Dirt Rider Magazine "Best Product of 1998"


DATELINE: November 23,1998
 	
SACRAMENTO, CA; The Gibbs Group is proud to announce that its No-Toil Motorcycle Air Filter Oil and Cleaner has been awarded off-road motorcycle Dirt Rider Maaazine's coveted Best Product of the Year, 1998. (November,1998)

No-Toil Air Filter Oil and Cleaner, developed by the Gibbs Group, consultants for Northern California-based No-Toil Industries (http@//www.notoil.com), is applied to foam air filters to keep harmful dirt and grime from getting through the air filters and into off-road vehicle engines. Motocross motorcycles and ATVs live most of their life in notoriously dirty and dusty off-pavement environments. In order to keep dust from penetrating the foam filters and ruining expensive engines, very sticky petroleum-based oils have traditionally been applied to the filter to catch the small dust particles.
No-Toil filter oil is lOO%non-petroleum. Earlier attempts to develop non-petroleum filter oils by other manufacturers have resulted in oils that 'melt' or run at high temperatures, or oils that clog the air filter. The revolutionary oil's proprietary formulation (patent pending) not only overcomes these earlier problems, it actually increases air flow and engine Performance when compared to traditional filter oils.
Best of all, No-Toil filter oil, and its proprietary filter cleaner are the first of its genre that are 100% biodegradable, not a hazardous material as other oils are classified. Dirty filters can be washed in a washing machine with No-Toil cleaner -- dirty water and biodegradable oil can be flushed down the drain. This represents an end to dangerous and environmentally harmful solvent cleaning of oil from air filters, and the start of a new industry product category: performance PLUS environmental safety.
Motor-sports related products are not new to Andy and Doug Gibbs, the brothers who formed the Sacramento-based Gibbs Group Management Consulting. In 1990, they founded Sport Rack Systems which manufactured ski and bike racks for Jeeps, Minivans and other Sport Utility Vehicles. After acquisition of Sport Rack by MascoTech Accessories Div. (NYSE; MSX., http://www.mascotech.com), the Gibbs posted about 2 dozen patents, helped open domestic and international markets, off-shore manufacturing facilities, and numerous product lines for the Detroit auto supplier from their Sacramento facility. Company revenue has grown from $40 million in'92 to almost a half a billion dollors currently.
The Gibbs Group specializes in executive business and product development, and strategic marketing for start-ups to $150 million companies, in business planning and strategy, investment packaging, turnkey product development and manufacturing sourcing, operations and Internet E-Commerce business development.

The Gibbs Group spent nearly a year developing No-Toil's biodegradable oil and cleaner, and continues to develop No-Toil's consumer distribution channel strategy and is assisting with ongoing domestic and international patent and product development.

NEWS WATCH: ACCESSORIES; A Telescopting Table Lends Relief to Rumpled Laps


DATELINE: May 9, 2002
 	
Traveling laptop users may note that the lap doesn't always work well as a desk. A long session can leave it hot and sweaty. The Table Tote, a lightweight, portable desk from PC Tables, offers the lap a breather.

When folded lup and stowed away, the Table Tote could be mistaken for a second laptop. A bottom panel slides off the reveal four telescoping aluminum legs stored in the underbelly. Once the legs are attached to the fiber-filled plastic tabletop, they can be adjusted from 13 to 29 inches in height.

The Table Tote may revise the way you think about your office. With its modular document clop and side panel for a mouse pad, the table ensures that wherever you go, you're never far from a functional workstation. Although the table weighs 2.6 pounds, it can support up to 18 pounds.

Business users can set up camp while delayed at the airport, and college students can save some dorm-room space by using it rather than a conventional computer desk. The Table Tote could also easily accommodate a printer or projector.

The Table Top costs $49.99 and is available at www.pctabletote.com. Setting up the desk takes less than a minute, hardly enough time to work up a sweat.

Gibbs Brothers Open Firm Offering Consulting Entrepreneuring


DATELINE: November 23,1998
 	
SACRAMENTO, CA; After 20 years 'in the business', and following a Fortune 50 acquisition of their last company, Doug and Andy Gibbs have formed a new firm offering consulting entrepreneur services.

Gibbs Group Associates consulting entrepreneuring firm offers a unique team solution to mid-sized companies and investors - entrepreneurial team for rent. As a highly seasoned team, they assist in investment 'packaging', organization / re-organization, new market entry, strategic alliances, new product development and production, business planning, and team building, wearing all of the traditional entrepreneur hats.

Most management consulting firms place their seasoned professionals based on the task. In reality, many have never had their entire pacheck depend entirely on their performance-for months at a time. To find hands-on consultants who are true entrepreneurs, the guys with the battle scars and successes earned on the front line, is nearly an impossible task.

There is little in business they haven't done, from doing the dirty work, to building productive, self-confident organizations. Whether replacing a dysfunctional management team reporting to the Board, or launching a new division, the brothers are equally capable.

Entrepreneurs are running their own companies; so seasoned entrepreneurial talent is simply not available in the consulting marketplace. "We're making our entrepreneurial skills available as our business. And we don't work the traditional 40 hour, 8 - 5 consulting hours either; it's simply is not an option. Calling Taiwan or China at midnight on Sunday (8 AM Monday, Far East time), working through tooling issues with manufacturers is not uncommon. We do whatever it takes to get the job done-fast. That's what entrepreneurs do."

To the Gibbs, you're either first, or you're a footnote. For the '98 season, their 'firsts' Include: Bicycling Magazine's " 1999 EDITORS CHOICE AWARD" for a line of advanced wireless bicycle computers for Vetta USA, and Dirt Rider Motorcycle Magazine " 1998 PRODUCT OF THE YEAR" for the industry's first high-performance, biodegradable non-petroleum air filter oil for No-Toil Industries.

CNN/fn and USA Today profiled Gibbs Inventor's Resource (http: www.patentcafe.com), now considered the Internet's leading patent and intellectual property information resource. The Gibbs (and most investors) put a high value on intellectual property assets; Andy authored Ironman Inventing and Ironman Business Plan, workbooks that address the hard realities of technology and business development.

Gibbs' one million hit/day Website profiled by CNN and USA-Today. They have placed another 1/2 dozen businesses on the Internet, including law and venture capital firms, manufacturers and E-commerce sites.

In 1990, the brothers founded Sport Rack Systems, which manufactured bike and ski, racks for Detroit automakers. After acquisition of Sport Rack by Masco Tech Accessories Div. (NYSE; MSX), the Gibbs posted about 2 dozen patents, helped open domestic and international markets, offshore manufacturing facilities, and numerous product lines for the Detroit auto supplier from their Sacramento facility. The rack division revenue has grown from $40 million in'92 to almost a half a billion dollors currently. One of their racks has been hailed as the best-selling automotive OEM rack accessory ever.

The Gibbs experience includes business, product and market development in the automotive, sporting goods, electronics, medical, architectural & building products, environmental safety industries, and Internet E-commerce. They balance day-to-day activities against long term investor and shareholder objectives. Andy says "The 'real objectives' are always bigger than getting another product to the market. Many business tacticians will never be strategists, and most strategists have never turned a bolt on the assembly line. We bring, the program together in the most efficient package."


Right now, the Gibbs firm provide business development services to various companies in Silicon Valley, San Francisco and the Sacramento areas.
