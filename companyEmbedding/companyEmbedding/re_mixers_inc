Brian Pekron, left, and Eric Ronning, CEO of Re Mixers, Inc. of Madison, make adjustments to an automated testing device they used in their workspace at Sector67, a maker-space in Madison, to certify and repeat results for a patented-pending, nozzle-mixing design they developed and hope to bring to market this year. 


JEFF MILLER, UW-MADISON





















































In about a year’s time Re Mixers Inc. has evolved from an idea by UW-Madison College of Engineering alumni Eric Ronning and Brian Pekron for a disposable mixing nozzle into a business that could have a product on the market before year’s end.“A lot of things came together relatively quickly,” said Ronning, CEO of Re Mixers, who graduated with a mechanical engineering degree in spring 2015. “It’s great that we’ve gotten to this point.”The company on Tuesday was one of two named by the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. that received Qualified New Business Venture certification. This means investors can receive a 25 percent state tax credit on the amount they invest in the business.
Au Naturale Cosmetics Inc. of Green Bay was the other company that received the designation. Re Mixers and Au Naturale both were certified to receive up to $125,000 in investor tax credits.WEDC said the certification program helped 180 startups around the state raise $176 million in 2015.For startups, raising capital is a crucial piece to make ideas reality.Re Mixers secured a $500,000 investment from N29 Capital Partners in December, but more money will help get a product to market, Ronning said.The idea for the business also gained notoriety when Ronning and Pekron finished second in the 2016 Governor’s Business Plan Contest.
They also received help and advice from D2P, a partnership between UW-Madison and the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation, which assists entrepreneurs with business plans and product development strategies.Re Mixers’ disposable nozzle has numerous applications. One use would be a process where it was necessary to combine two products to form an adhesive, Ronning said.
Ronning said Re Mixers is working with a company to design a mold for their product.They also are meeting with plastic injection molders who could make the nozzles.“Great thing about Wisconsin is there are many molding options and we have a long list of companies to meet with,” he said.At some point, Re Mixers may have its own production facility, but the “goal now is to get sale (number) one,” Ronning said.“We want to get revenue going and grow as quickly as possible,” he said.

Armed with some know how, a few small touches and Walmart's Every Day Low Prices on home furnishings and decor, you can breathe new life into your living space   whether it be with fresh furniture like a bedroom set or something functional like a new bookshelf. Spaced out: Your living room life Are you rethinking your current living room? A new television is always a nice addition, but you may want a new sofa, arm chair or accent table first. When considering what furniture to buy, think about the space you have available and the look you want for the room. Possibly the most important piece of furniture in your living room will be the sofa. If you have a lot of space to work with, look for a big sofa that can accommodate your family and guests. If you don't have much space, look for something more compact, possibly even a loveseat. For additional seating (again, depending on how much space you have), you can add a loveseat, recliner or armless chair. An accent table and an ottoman can add functionality and style too. If you don't have a lot of interior design experience and you want a consistent look throughout the room, consider getting a living room furniture set. Living room sets come with different pieces to fit different spaces, so you can choose one that best serves your needs. You can also refresh the look of the room with smaller changes. Try reframing your pictures, adding some wall art or getting a new slipcover for the couch if you don't want to buy a new sofa. Decorative accent pillows are a great, inexpensive way to give your living room some personality as well. Stackable modular storage cubes are a simple design solution and they're eco-friendly. Cubes are an excellent home organizer for your modern living space. Each one is separate so you can stack them side by side or on top of each other, or you can get creative and build a pyramid or ladder design. You can also mix and match the colors or just keep it simple with a single shade. Build a better bedroom Getting a new set of bedding is a great way to give your bedroom a quick makeover, while providing the warmth and comfort you need. When picking out bedding, consider the size of your mattress, the climate and weather where you live, the material you want and whether you'd prefer a bedding set or separates. Bedding comes in the same sizes as mattresses (single, double, twin, full, queen, king and so on) so it's easy to match your sheets and blankets to your mattress size. For colder weather, choose bedding that is thicker, like a down duvet or comforter, and consider flannel-weave sheets if you tend to get cold more easily. For warmer weather, look for lighter top bedding and percale-weave or silk sheets. Cotton is the most popular material for sheets, but there are many varieties to pick from, including Pima and Egyptian cottons, both of which are extremely comfortable and luxurious. You can also choose from a variety of weaves, including percale, which is very soft, smooth and shiny. Easy kitchen solutions Your kitchen and dining area make up the heart of your home. Let's face it, with three meals per day, you spend a lot of time there eating, not to mention the time it takes to prepare the meals. With kitchenware, dinnerware, kitchen furniture and more from Walmart, you can make these areas functional, welcoming spaces for the entire family. The kitchen can easily be made more inviting by adding a fresh coat of paint to the cabinets and walls. For finishing touches, get some color-coordinated kitchen towels or potholders, and place a new plant in the kitchen window. Keep your kitchen neat and organized with storage and organization products, including pantries, racks, cabinet and counter organizers and food storage containers. Handy products like these make it easier to find what you need when you need it, so you can prepare meals with less confusion and frustration. Complete sets of pots, pans and knives make cooking easier, whether you're prepping for your family or a crowd. And if you like to bake, it's worth stocking up on bakeware, so you always have what you need. Let there be lighting New window treatments and lighting can really pick up the atmosphere throughout your home. Choose window furnishings that add both color and style and let in the natural light from your outdoor surroundings. Then use accent lights to highlight your favorite keepsakes and add light fixtures that complement your decor.

Or perhaps you're outfitting a new home or apartment and starting from scratch. This includes your large appliances like refrigerators and dishwashers as well as smaller appliances that make your time in the kitchen or when cleaning much simpler. When these items are relatively new   and hopefully covered under some kind of warranty   it makes sense to get them repaired when they malfunction. However, there comes a time when you must decide to replace a failing appliance with a brand new or refurbished one, and that is where we can help with low prices, every day, on everything.RefrigeratorsSimilar to a vehicle or other large-scale appliances, it pays to know what to look for when choosing a refrigerator for your kitchen or other spot in your home. For example, with refrigerators, it pays to know what to look for, such as how many doors you want, where you want the freezer to be situated, whether you want an external ice maker, water dispenser and amenities designed to keep your food fresher for longer periods of time. Size is a major consideration, as our refrigerators run as small as 1.7 cubic feet, which are ideal for offices, dorm rooms and man caves, to 26 cubic feet or more for full-size units. Other considerations, such as color, width, brand and ENERGY STAR rating are important as well.ToastersThe same care when choosing a large appliance should be done for smaller appliances as well. For example, it seems almost expected for a toaster to work forever, and most do last a long time. However, if you have recently moved and are trying to match a certain color scheme or simply want to upgrade to the latest technology, there are important things to consider when selecting a toaster too. For example, do you want it to be a two-slice or four-slice toaster, should it have manual timing or digital, and should it be a certain color or does stainless steel work with your decor? You could even choose a toaster oven that doubles as a toaster, giving you an appliance that does double duty in your kitchen.MicrowavesSpeaking of versatile appliances, none are more versatile in the kitchen than microwave ovens. These devices have come a long way from the days of the Radar Range. Microwaves not only reheat your food and beverages with electromagnetic waves (in other words, microwaves), but many also offer convection capabilities as well. No longer are they just for popping popcorn or heating TV dinners. Now, you can cook entire meals with just a microwave and do other tasks as well, such as defrosting frozen food and softening butter. Microwaves typically are available in three forms: countertop, over-the-range and built-in. Again, there are factors to consider regarding your choice of microwave, and we have many from which you can choose. We have units that are small   having a cooking space of 0.9 cubic feet or less to 1.4 cubic feet or more. Wattage is another consideration, and we have models that range from less than 700 watts to more than 1,000 watts - the higher the wattage, the quicker your foods are heated, essentially.Washers and DryersAppliances aren't exclusive to your kitchen. Many people like the convenience of having their own washing machine and dryer rather than making trips to the Laundromat or on-site laundry facility. We can help with these choices as well. For example, apartment dwellers who don't have room for a traditional-sized washer and dryer can select all-in-one units that work side by side, stack on top of each other or portable units that are usable on a countertop. For standard washers and dryers, considerations include top-loading or front-loading, capacity, overall size and brand.Vacuum CleanersAnother appliance that is often overlooked until it malfunctions is a vacuum cleaner. There have been many advances made in the making of vacuum cleaners, and it is not just limited to style. The variations here range from canister, uprights, stick and even handheld and robotic vacuum cleaners. There are also units that are ideal for doing deep carpet cleanings, including extractors   sometimes known as steam machines   and shampooers. There are even some vacuums specific to picking up pet hair and dander. For the do-it-yourselfer, there are also wet-dry vacuums that are ideal for working in the garage, shop or anywhere there is a need to vacuum up heavy-duty materials or liquids. Important considerations for vacuum cleaners focus on the surfaces to be cleaned, whether the unit is bagless or not, height, color and available accessories. We feature many brands of vacuum cleaners, and finding one that is ideal for your space is simple.air conditionersOne appliance that is crucial to upping the comfort level of your home is an air conditioner. Although many people live in homes with central air conditioning, many do not and that is where we can help. We offer units that fit snugly in a window and can keep several rooms cool at one time, and portable air conditioners ideal for keeping a single room at the desired temperature. Factors to consider when choosing an air conditioner include the coverage area to be cooled, the size of the space (if choosing a window unit) and the number of BTUs the unit possesses. BTUs refers to the amount of heat an air conditioner can remove from a room per hour, with up to 5,400 BTUs recommended for small rooms (150 square feet) and 32,000 BTUs for covering 1,600 square feet. As with most products of this nature, be sure to look for the ENERGY STAR label to ensure you are getting a unit that is cost-effective as well.Show moreElectrode, Comp-147332935, DC-prod-dal1, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-

Capital infusion prepares UW-Madison startup to stir up industrial adhesive market

Brian Pekron, left, and Eric Ronning, CEO of Re Mixers Inc., are both 2015 engineering graduates of the University of Wisconsin–Madison. They turned their idea for a better epoxy nozzle into a business plan while participating in a Discover to Product (D2P) program at UW–Madison. Photo: Jeff Miller
An idea hatched during an engineering class at the University of Wisconsin–Madison promises to reduce waste in a common industrial mixing process. Epoxy and hardener, which must be mixed just before application, are used in a broad range of industries, including construction, manufacturing — even dentistry.
These epoxies are blended in a “static mixing” nozzle — so named because it has no moving parts, says Eric Ronning, CEO of Re Mixers Inc., which was incorporated Dec. 27, 2016.
Upwards of 70 million static mixing nozzles are sold in the United States every year because epoxy quickly sets inside the nozzle and plugs it. The nozzle technology has changed little since the 1970s, Ronning says.
Ronning had his “eureka” moment while listening to Professor Tim Osswald discuss the shortcomings of static mixers in a class on plastics at UW–Madison.

As he pondered the problem of quickly and thoroughly mixing two fluids, he realized that the problem was more interesting than it sounds. “Mixing is such a fundamental, basic action, but what is the most efficient way to do it?  With a static mixer, there are not many factors to play with, not many tricks to employ.”
Mixing, whether active or static, is something that 2-year-olds enjoy, Ronning says. “It’s a natural process. If you are standing in a river and gently release a handful of sand, you can expect all of the individual grains to be dispersed as they flow downstream. But aside from the water itself, there aren’t any moving components along the riverbed. That’s a good way to envision what happens inside a static mixing nozzle, where there also aren’t any moving components.”
Static mixing and epoxy adhesive are critical to strong, lightweight construction in laptops, cellphones, cars and bikes, Ronning says. “These products could not exist in their present form without static mixers and the adhesives they make possible.”
In the world of products, epoxy adhesive, enabled by static mixers, “is in everything we see,” Ronning says, “but it’s not where you’re looking. Your computer, your phone, your car, your house — epoxy is everywhere, but it’s behind the scenes. And every time a nozzle plugs up with epoxy, a new nozzle must be used.”
To convert a eureka moment into a business, Ronning and Brian Pekron, a fellow engineering student at UW–Madison, entered the Discovery to Product program on campus. A $65,800 grant from D2P was devoted to product development, testing of prototypes, identifying customers and forming a company. “D2P helped us realize a business strategy that was realistic, which is vital when starting any venture,” Ronning says.

In December, Re Mixers received initial funding of $500,000 from N29 Capital Partners of Manitowish Waters, Wisconsin. “I have been really impressed with Re Mixers’ adhesive and epoxy mixing technology,” says Carl Ruedebusch, head of N29.  “Being a contractor, this is a technical area that I know well.”
The new design provides better mixing of the ingredients while dramatically reducing the amount of expensive material wasted when the epoxy hardens inside the nozzle. By improving bond strength, better mixing further cuts adhesive cost.
Re Mixers has filed a patent on the invention, which Ronning will not describe in detail at this point. However, like existing static mixers, he says it depends on a principle called the “baker’s transformation, which is a fancy way to describe how a baker kneads flour and liquid to make dough, by stretching and folding, over and over.”
Existing static mixers effectively double the mixing action with each folding; Re Mixers has figured out a fundamentally different folding action that results in a much more efficient mixing, so each fold is an order of magnitude more effective, Ronning says.
At their office at the Sector67 makerspace in Madison, Pekron and Ronning have worked to refine the revolutionary shape that Ronning envisioned back in the engineering class. They built a robotic testing apparatus to measure bond strength for different nozzle designs. The final shape increases bond strength by 5 to 20 percent over current designs, Ronning says, but the primary advantage comes from mixing efficiency, which allows a shorter nozzle to mix better than existing nozzles. As a result, less expensive epoxy is wasted when the nozzle inevitably plugs as the epoxy sets inside it.
“Our big selling point is reducing adhesive cost for the end user,” says Ronning, “and at the same time, they get a stronger adhesive.“
Ronning and Pekron hope to be on the market with their product within a year.
Beyond epoxy, Ronning says the development process could apply more broadly to the problem of industrial mixing applications. “This shape was developed by a genetic algorithm and experimentation. With each design, the algorithm looked at the performance of the bond. Then, we ran another iteration, and went through that 5,000 times. So we have developed a process that could be applied to all forms of chemical mixing.”

At Walmart, you'll find a wide variety of kitchen appliances at Every Day Low Prices, which means more room in the budget to better equip your kitchen. We offer options in a range of finishes to coordinate with your kitchen's decor and style while adding convenience and faster prep time to your mealtimes.MicrowavesMicrowaves provide fast cooking, steaming and reheating, which makes them an ideal addition to the kitchen, especially if you have a busy schedule. Built-in models save counter space by installing into the cabinets or wall. They can also cost more but deliver higher power for fast cooking. Countertop models are easy to move, and they're available in a variety of power ranges. Microwaves with higher watts deliver faster cooking and more power Commonly available finishes include stainless steel, black and white Look for microwaves with preprogrammed cooking cycles for easy cookingCoffee and Espresso MakersWe carry everything from traditional full-pot brewing systems to single-serve and specialty brew makers that brew coffee, tea and unique coffee drinks. We also carry french presses for a low-tech, high-flavor option for coffee lovers wanting to try a new way to brew.Check pod compatibility for single-serve brewers Integrated grinders offer the freshest grind and brew experience Look for coffee makers with adjustable temperatures, integrated water filters and permanent filters for optimal versatility  Helpful features include programming, automatic shut-off and pause-and-serve slow cookers, Rice Cookers and SteamersSlow cookers are a must-have for every busy household. Simply add your ingredients, set the time and temperature, and let the cooker do all the work while you're at work or running errands. On the other end of the spectrum, pressure cookers deliver richly flavored meals in a fraction of the time it takes with traditional cooking methods. Rice cookers and steamers aren't strictly necessary, but these kitchen appliances make easy work of cooking rice, whole grains and vegetables without having to stand over the stove. Choose from from 1 quart to 10+ quarts Removable, dishwasher-safe liners offer easy cleaning Look for added features such as reheating, programmable timers and the ability to switch from searing ingredients to slow or pressure cooking your foodblenders and JuicersHigh-powered blenders often perform multiple functions, from pureeing and blending to chopping and smoothie making. Juicers aren't essential kitchen appliances, but if you're committed to a healthy lifestyle that includes freshly prepared juices, juice extractors deliver the performance you need. Blenders with higher wattage can handle blending frozen fruits, pulverizing ice and processing nuts Sizes range from 4 to 9 cups Look for BPA-free plastic or clear glass for safety and visibility Detachable bases offer the easiest cleaning options toasters and Toaster OvensTraditional toasters take up less space, but they only provide a single function. Toaster ovens toast, bake and broil, eliminating the need to preheat your oven. Convection toasters offer even, fast toasting and cooking by circulating the air with a special fan. Look for models with four to six slots and extra-wide openings to fulfill family-sized toasting needs. MixersA must for anyone who enjoys baking, mixers do everything from beating eggs and blending batters to kneading dough and prepping ingredients. Hand mixers store neatly without taking up counter space Look for stand mixer attachments for making ice cream and pasta or slicing fruits and vegetables Planetary mixers move the bowl and beater; standard mixers only move the beaters Food Prep and ProcessorsSave valuable prep time by letting your food processor do the heavy lifting. From spiralizers that create magical veggie "noodles" to high-powered processors that can grind meat and process nuts into nut butter, we carry a large selection of appliances to make food prep a breeze.Look for models with accessories such as grinders, slicers and chopping blades that let you handle multiple tasks Removable attachments allow easy cleaning Look for food processors with feed tubes that let you add ingredients while the appliance runs Other Kitchen AppliancesAlthough not necessary, these appliances perform special functions that make life and certain recipes a little easier. Electric griddles cook everything from eggs to burgers without using your stovetop Ice cream makers let you churn your own sweet, frozen treats Deep fryers offer safety and less mess for making fries, chicken and other crispy favorites Get More from Your Kitchen AppliancesLook for kitchen appliance bundles that include multiple attachments or multiple appliances to save money on buying extras If you're short on space, look for kitchen appliances that perform multiple functions; think blenders that can also perform the function of a juicer, food processor and coffee grinder, or mixers that chop, process and make ice cream.Show moreElectrode, Comp-167313233, DC-prod-dal2, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-

Mixers & AttachmentsWhy do it by hand when an electric mixer can get the job done in no time? These kitchen appliances feature a powerful motor that turns the whisks, blades and other attachments at a variety of speeds to vigorously beat, mix & stir bowls of ingredients for you. Precision controls and settings allow the user to ensure they receive their desired results. Stand mixers can be used on any countertop for hands-free operation while hand blenders offer more control using only one-handed use. Available from quality brands including KitchenAid®, Hamilton Beach® & Cuisinart®.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page.

How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
