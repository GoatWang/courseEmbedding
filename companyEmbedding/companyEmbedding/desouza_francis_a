                            Papacostandinour a Greek national. Domingos is the

                            (Anjuna). Domingos and Elpiniki got married in Ethiopia 
                            where he worked as Commercial Representative of C. 
                            Itoh & Co. Ltd Japan. He later transferred to 
                            their Dubai office and hence the family moved there. 
                            They have five children:
 Anthony, 
                            MBA (Univ. of Chicago), who works for an IT start 
                            up company in Silicon Valley.

                            John, also ex-MIT, a Venture Capitalist. 
                            Sophie, who works at IBM.
                            Mario deSouza (Final year Brown University, Rhode 
                            Island).
He 
                            was admitted to MIT at 16 and says, “It was 
                            hugely exciting. It was my first time in America. 
                            I was very excited. It was all new and exciting. I 
                            came here by myself. My family was still in the United 
                            Arab Emirates. So, I was the first in my family to 
                            come to the United States. I didn't know how banks 
                            worked. We did not have the tax system in Dubai. My 
                            parents moved here a couple of years ago. But I would 
                            go back home once a year. I had a job at MIT's media 
                            laboratory for the first year. The school was very 
                            friendly. I got so busy at MIT that once school started 
                            it was go, go, go.” He traces his Goan roots 
                            to ? (name of village) 

Francis

 Francis 
                      Desouza of Imlogic, on Instant Messaging 
                      23 February 2003
                      The Boston Globe 

Teenagers 
                      have been doing it for awhile. Now, companies are using 
                      instant messaging to connect employees and clients from 
                      any location in real time. Corporate America's fascination 
                      with IM is not without problems, however. That's where Francis 
                      deSouza and his company, IMLogic of Waltham, come in. Founded 
                      in 2001, IMLogic is an instant messaging infrastructure 
                      vendor that helps us firms set up their own proprietary 
                      systems. Tomorrow, deSouza, President and CEO of IMLogic, 
                      will give a keynote address at the Instant Message Planet 
                      Spring 2003 Conference and Expo at the Boston Park Plaza 
                      Hotel. Globe reporter Diane Lewis interviewed deSouza about 
                      the IM trend. 
Q. 
                      What can teenagers teach businesses about instant messaging? 
                      
A. 
                      They can teach them lots. It turns out that the big story 
                      for instant messaging was the teenage story. Instant messaging 
                      became the fastest growing communications medium ever in 
                      2000, reaching 200 million users, primarily teenagers. This 
                      was well before it was discovered by the corporate market. 
                      
Q. 
                      What makes IM unique? 
A. 
                      Presence - that you know the person is there before you 
                      send the message and, as the recipient, you can tell the 
                      world that you are available. The message is instant. It 
                      pops up, flashes, and grabs your attention. 
Q. 
                      Under the Securities and Exchange Commission's revised rule, 
                      17-a-4, US companies must keep detailed records of all transactions, 
                      including e-mail and instant messaging. How much demand 
                      has this created for IM security services? 
A. 
                      The revision of the rule highlighted to IT departments that 
                      instant messaging was happening and they needed to get ahead 
                      of it. More and more [companies] see it as a competitive 
                      advantage. There are now over 20 million users in the corporate 
                      market. Last year, the number of [corporate] users grew 
                      200 percent. 
Q. 
                      What does the future hold for IM? 
A. 
                      I think instant messaging will become the front-end for 
                      most of our communications. It will be on cellphones, desk 
                      tops and personal digital assistants. If I have a cellphone, 
                      the message will flash on my cellphone. 
Q. 
                      How do you take a form of communication that was primarily 
                      social and apply it to business? 
A. 
                      There is a whole element of reporting that allows for better 
                      network planning. Then, there is security. Companies need 
                      to make sure that viruses cannot come in over instant messaging. 
                      Then, there is archiving. Companies must comply with regulations 
                      around keeping communications on file for a certain number 
                      of years. . . Companies also need to have naming policies. 
                      At one company, for example, a worker had chosen the name, 
                      Biceps2big. Someone else had the name Studbroker. The names 
                      were not in keeping with the company's naming policies. 
                      
Q. 
                      You were admitted to MIT at 16. What was that like? 
A. 
                      It was hugely exciting. It was my first time in America. 
                      I was very excited. It was all new and exciting. I came 
                      here by myself. My family was still in the United Arab Emirates. 
                      So, I was the first in my family to come to the United States. 
                      I didn't know how banks worked. We did not have the tax 
                      system in Dubai. My parents moved here a couple of years 
                      ago. But I would go back home once a year. I had a job at 
                      MIT's media laboratory for the first year. The school was 
                      very friendly. I got so busy at MIT that once school started 
                      it was go, go, go.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
