For patients with advanced lung cancer, time matters. Understand more than just the tumor … understand the cancer disease state: the tumor mutation profile (GeneStrat) and patient response to the tumor (VeriStrat.)
VeriStrat and GeneStrat are blood tests that provide important information within 72 hours to help guide treatment decisions.
 

VeriStrat®
is a predictive and prognostic test for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)

VeriStrat Poor signature correlates with a more aggressive disease for all lines of therapy
VeriStrat Good signature correlates with a more favorable prognosis for all lines of therapy
VeriStrat classification is also predictive of differential treatment benefit for single agent therapy




GeneStrat™
is a targeted liquid biopsy mutation test

Identifies specific driver mutations with proven clinical utility
GeneStrat uses droplet digital PCR to analyze cell-free DNA in the blood
Order the full panel (EGFR, KRAS, BRAF) or choose gene variants a la carte
Reflex to VeriStrat is available for those patients who are EGFR wild-type

About Us

 

Founded in 2005, Biodesix discovers and commercializes cancer tests (diagnostics) that help patients and their doctors make more informed decisions about treatment based on a patient’s unique molecular profile. We’re advancing precision medicine by helping oncologists provide the right patient with the right treatment at the right time.
Unlike most cancer diagnostics, our tests require only a blood draw (instead of a biopsy, where a sample of the tumor is removed from a patient’s body) and results are available within 72 hours. Biodesix collaborates with leading researchers and builds strategic partnerships with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to develop companion diagnostics and build our pipeline of new products.
Biodesix’ research and development activities are conducted with the highest clinical integrity, including external validation with medical experts and properly designed and controlled clinical trials. Our internal controls are designed to ensure compliance with applicable federal, state, and local statutes and regulations relevant to providers of healthcare services.

Team Stories

 
 
 
 




 


“For Biodesix to excel in a highly competitive environment, we have to continually improve our value to our customers which is why I love working in the Quality department. Quality is perhaps the most important contributor to our success. Our tests play an integral role in patient care and our customers count on us to continuously deliver innovative tests and services to improve personalized medicine. I am honored to be a part of an organization that continuously works to improve our ability to consistently deliver quality tests that meet or exceed our customers’ expectations and puts Quality in the forefront of everything we do.”
Brianna Phillips
Quality Director

 
 
 



“I enjoy working at Biodesix because we aim to positively impact the lives of patients with cancer every day.  Whether we are discovering and validating new tests or brainstorming the optimal strategy to take new tests to market, our main goal is to always remember the patient and their needs first. With that mentality, Biodesix continues to be at the forefront of innovation in oncology while also nurturing the next generation of business leaders in the biotech space. I am proud to be a part of that team.
My job is extremely rewarding because it is my responsibility to ensure access and payment for our tests for the many patients that may benefit from their use.  Reimbursement is a subtle balance of policy, clinical data, health economics, and billing – all of which are essential for a company to continue innovation and remain successful.  The Reimbursement environment in diagnostics is always changing, so I learn something new every day, and that is the type of job that keeps me happy and motivated.”
Abby Coffin Wright
Sr. Director of Reimbursement Policy

 
 



 
 




 


“Here in Customer Support, we perform multiple tasks; interacting with Patients, Nurses, Physicians and just about every other Department in the Company.
Our primary role is to provide help and information to our customers – anything needed to help in the ordering, processing and resulting of our tests, but as with any busy customer-orientated environment, the Customer Support team are ready to assist with any situation.
The department is very vibrant and fast moving, creating learning opportunities and new situations every day that require solutions; the team is ready to shift gears and help wherever necessary. Our Department works closely with the Commercial Laboratory in processing tests and delivering timely results to Physicians, allowing for better treatment decisions that help our Patients – we pride ourselves on our un-rivaled turnaround times and care very much about fast response.
Additionally, we support our Field Sales team in providing information and assistance to help them be as efficient and knowledgeable as possible as they go about their daily jobs.
I feel personally very proud to be involved with a company that provides such innovative products that help Physicians to make better treatment decisions. It is extremely satisfying that the work we do here makes a real difference in the lives of Patients and their families all over the world.”
Steve Haywood
Manager of Customer Support

Biodesix’ team of scientists in Research and Development utilize an array of technologies to develop clinically validated proteomics and genomics blood- based assays. Our goal is to help our partners rapidly pilot, develop and commercialize clinically relevant tests, including companion diagnostics. 
The combination of reproducible high-throughput protein expression measurements with proprietary advanced machine learning algorithms allows us to take advantage of the correlations between protein expression and clinically relevant data to build molecular tests which can be validated and commercialized using the same development platform. VeriStrat®, our serum proteomic test, is one example of our capabilities to discover and develop a robust diagnostic test with clinical utility.

Biodesix, Inc. Key Developments

Biodesix® and Positive Bioscience Announces Partnership to Bring Cancer Tests to India
Jun 12 17
Biodesix, Inc. and Positive Bioscience announced that they have entered into an agreement where Positive Bioscience will make Biodesix’s GeneStrat ® and VeriStrat ® liquid biopsy tests for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients available in India. All testing will be performed at Biodesix’s CLIA/CAP/CLEP/ISO certified laboratory in Boulder, Colorado, USA. The GeneStrat test is a blood-based genomic test for patients with lung cancer that can inform the use of targeted therapies. The test delivers results for EGFR sensitizing; EGFR resistance (T790M), KRAS, and BRAF mutations; and EML4-ALK, ROS1 and RET fusion variants. The liquid biopsy test measures circulating tumor DNA and RNA with a highly-sensitive droplet digital PCR platform. Terms of the agreement were not disclosed.


Biodesix, Inc. Announces New Data Demonstrating Use of the VeriStrat
Apr 3 17
Biodesix, Inc. announced new data demonstrating that use of the VeriStrat® test in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) reduces the aggregate costs of end-of-life treatment while improving survival and quality of life. The data were presented at the American College of Medical Quality (MQ2017) annual meeting, which was held March 29 - April 1 in Washington, DC. The VeriStrat test helps guide treatment decisions for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without an EGFR-sensitizing mutation. The blood-based test classifies patients into two categories, VeriStrat-Good and VeriStrat-Poor. Extensive clinical data demonstrate that patients classified as VeriStrat-Good have a more favorable prognosis and benefit from receiving active treatment, whereas patients classified as VeriStrat-Poor have a more aggressive cancer, a less favorable prognosis, and exhibit no significant response to EGFR-TKIs. In the current study, use of the VeriStrat test saved an average of $1,050 per patient while improving survival outcomes (as compared to patients treated without the use of the test). This cost savings was amplified in patients with a test result of VeriStrat-Poor; for this group, testing saved more than $10,000 per patient through the avoidance of ineffective therapies.


Biodesix, Inc. and Progenetics LTD Announce Distribution Agreement for Israel
Mar 9 17
Biodesix, Inc. and Progenetics LTD announced that they have entered into an international agreement where Progenetics will market and distribute kits for Biodesix’s GeneStrat® and VeriStrat® liquid biopsy tests for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Both tests are now available for clinical use in Israel. Terms of the agreement were not disclosed.
