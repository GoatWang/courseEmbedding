Short Interest In ERA Group Declines 22.6%
The most recent short interest data has been released by the NASDAQ for the 03/01/2016 settlement date, which shows a 256,605 share decrease in total short interest for ERA Group Inc , to 877,883, a decrease of 22.62% since 02/12/2016. Total short interest is just one way to look at short data; another metric that we here at Dividend Channel find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares traded.
