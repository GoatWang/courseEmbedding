James L. Pavitt (born February 19, 1946) was Deputy Director for Operations (DDO) for the CIA from 1999 until June 4, 2004. His sudden resignation – as well as that of his chief, DCI George Tenet the previous day – led to speculation that it was over the controversy surrounding Iraq weapons of mass destruction or 9-11 intelligence issues.[citation needed]

Background[edit]
Pavitt was born in St. Louis, Missouri and graduated from the University of Missouri (B.A., 1968) in Columbia, Missouri[1] as a member of Phi Beta Kappa.[2] After graduation, he was a National Defense Education Act fellow at Clark University (1969). He is currently a Principal of The Scowcroft Group, an international business advisory firm,[2] and was formerly on the board of the Association of Former Intelligence Officers (AFIO).
He is married with two children (from a previous marriage) and resides in McLean, Virginia.
His hobbies include collecting art, especially primitive American art.[1]
Intelligence career[edit]
Pavitt served in the United States Army from 1969-1971 as an intelligence officer and was a legislative assistant with the House of Representatives from 1971 until 1973.
Pavitt joined the CIA in 1973 as a Career Trainee with postings to Europe, Asia and Washington.[citation needed] He was posted to Vienna (1976-1978), East Berlin (1978-1980), Budapest, Hungary and Malaysia (1980-1983).[3] He was expelled (PNG'd) from East Germany.[3] He was chief of station in Luxembourg (1983-1986).[3][4] He served as a Branch Chief in the Africa Division.[5] From 1990 to 1993, he served on the National Security Council team under Brent Scowcroft as Senior Intelligence Advisor to President George H.W. Bush.[6] After being assigned to work across the Agency operational/analytical divide in the Directorate of Intelligence, he became the founder and first Chief of the Directorate of Operation's Counterproliferation Division (CPD). Gordon Oehler, then Chief of the Directorate of Intelligence's Non-Proliferation Center, criticized this as being redundant and stepping on his turf. This was considered a specious critique by veteran Agency HUMINT Operations Officers, however, especially those who had been assigned under Oehler previously and realized that Oehler held HUMINT counterproliferation operations—indeed, covert operations in general—in considerable disdain. Pavitt hand picked operations officers, some of which were Nonofficial Cover Officers (NOCs) including Valerie Plame, to staff the CPD.[5] In 1997 he was appointed Associate Deputy Director of Operations. He was Deputy Director of Operations from 1999 until his resignation in 2004.[1][7] In 2003, the CPD took down the nuclear black market being operated by Abdul Qadeer Khan.[5]
After September 11, 2001, Pavitt was responsible for sending Special Activities Division teams to Afghanistan, Pakistan, Indonesia, Thailand, and Somalia to capture Al Qaeda members. The first Hellfire missiles fired from drones were under his command. They were aimed at an Al Qaeda convoy in Sudan in which all occupants, including an American citizen, were killed.[1]
In April 2004 he appeared before the 9/11 Commission.[7] The BBC called his 9/11 commission appearance 'unprecedented'.[7] The commission's report said that shortly after Bush's election, Pavitt told the President-elect that Osama bin Laden was one of the gravest threats to the country. He also added that killing the Al Qaeda leader would have an effect but not stop the threat posed by the terrorist organization.[8]
When Bush put Porter Goss in charge of the agency, Pavitt reportedly opposed the internal reorganizations announced by Goss, on the ground that they might "do damage to a strategic effort that has produced excellent work on terrorism and a variety of other important issues."[9] On June 4, 2004, he unexpectedly announced his retirement one day after George Tenet. The CIA says Pavitt's decision was unconnected with Tenet's departure.[citation needed] Pavitt was succeeded by his deputy, Stephen Kappes. On June 21, 2004, Pavitt delivered one of his last speeches as DDO to the Foreign Policy Association.[10]
Pavitt is a recipient of the CIA's Distinguished Intelligence Medal.[2] He is also a recipient of the CIA Distinguished Career Intelligence Medal, the CIA Director’s Medal and the Donovan Award.[11]
Post-CIA work[edit]
He is an advisor to the Patriot Defense Group, LLC, a defense and intelligence contracting company that directly supports the training requirements of the defense and intelligence communities.[6] to Olton Solutions Ltd. in the United Kingdom and to The Scowcroft Group.[2][11]
He is a director of CACI International, Inc.[11]
Criticism and controversy[edit]
Some former operations officers are critical of Pavitt, citing 4 international postings over 10 years in a 30-year career as insufficient experience for a Deputy Director of Operations.[4] The Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture found that Pavitt was told that rectal exams of at least two CIA prisoners had been conducted with "excessive force" but he took action to stop this behavior.[12]

James Pavitt

James L. Pavitt (born February 19, 1946) was Deputy Director for Operations (DDO) for the CIA from 1999 until June 4, 2004. His sudden resignation – as well as that of his chief, DCI George Tenet the previous day – led to speculation that it was over the controversy surrounding Iraq weapons of mass destruction or 9-11 intelligence issues.[citation needed]Contents1 Background2 Intelligence career2.1 Post-CIA work2.2 Criticism and controversy3 External links3.1 Speeches3.2 ReferencesBackgroundPavitt was born in St. Louis, Missouri and graduated from the University of Missouri (B.A., 1968) in Columbia, Missouri[1] as a member of Phi Beta Kappa.[2] After graduation, he was a National Defense Education Act fellow at Clark University (1969). He is currently a Principal of The Scowcroft Group, an international business advisory firm,[2] and was formerly on the board of the Association of Former Intelligence Officers (AFIO).He is married with two children (from a previous marriage) and resides in McLean, Virginia.His hobbies include collecting art, especially primitive American art.[1]Intelligence careerPavitt served in the United States Army from 1969-1971 as an intelligence officer and was a legislative assistant with the House of Representatives from 1971 until 1973.Pavitt joined the CIA in 1973 as a Career Trainee with postings to Europe, Asia and Washington.[citation needed] He was posted to Vienna (1976-1978), East Berlin (1978-1980), Budapest, Hungary and Malaysia (1980-1983).[3] He was expelled (PNG'd) from East Germany.[3] He was chief of station in Luxembourg (1983-1986).[3][4] He served as a Branch Chief in the Africa Division.[5] From 1990 to 1993, he served on the National Security Council team under Brent Scowcroft as Senior Intelligence Advisor to President George H.W. Bush.[6] After being assigned to work across the Agency operational/analytical divide in the Directorate of Intelligence, he became the founder and first Chief of the Directorate of Operation's Counterproliferation Division (CPD). Gordon Oehler, then Chief of the Directorate of Intelligence's Non-Proliferation Center, criticized this as being redundant and stepping on his turf. This was considered a specious critique by veteran Agency HUMINT Operations Officers, however, especially those who had been assigned under Oehler previously and realized that Oehler held HUMINT counterproliferation operations—indeed, covert operations in general—in considerable disdain. Pavitt hand picked operations officers, some of which were Nonofficial Cover Officers (NOCs) including Valerie Plame, to staff the CPD.[5] In 1997 he was appointed Associate Deputy Director of Operations. He was Deputy Director of Operations from 1999 until his resignation in 2004.[1][7] In 2003, the CPD took down the nuclear black market being operated by Abdul Qadeer Khan.[5]After September 11, 2001, Pavitt was responsible for sending Special Activities Division teams to Afghanistan, Pakistan, Indonesia, Thailand, and Somalia to capture Al Qaeda members. The first Hellfire missiles fired from drones were under his command. They were aimed at an Al Qaeda convoy in Sudan in which all occupants, including an American citizen, were killed.[1]In April 2004 he appeared before the 9/11 Commission.[7] The BBC called his 9/11 commission appearance 'unprecedented'.[7] The commission's report said that shortly after Bush's election, Pavitt told the President-elect that Osama bin Laden was one of the gravest threats to the country. He also added that killing the Al Qaeda leader would have an effect but not stop the threat posed by the terrorist organization.[8]When Bush put Porter Goss in charge of the agency, Pavitt reportedly opposed the internal reorganizations announced by Goss, on the ground that they might "do damage to a strategic effort that has produced excellent work on terrorism and a variety of other important issues."[9] On June 4, 2004, he unexpectedly announced his retirement one day after George Tenet. The CIA says Pavitt's decision was unconnected with Tenet's departure.[citation needed] Pavitt was succeeded by his deputy, Stephen Kappes. On June 21, 2004, Pavitt delivered one of his last speeches as DDO to the Foreign Policy Association.[10]Pavitt is a recipient of the CIA's Distinguished Intelligence Medal.[2] He is also a recipient of the CIA Distinguished Career Intelligence Medal, the CIA Director’s Medal and the Donovan Award.[11]Post-CIA workHe is an advisor to the Patriot Defense Group, LLC,a defense and intelligence contracting company that directly supports the training requirements of the defense and intelligence communities.[6] to Olton Solutions Ltd. in the United Kingdom and to The Scowcroft Group.[2][11]He is a director of CACI International, Inc.[11]Criticism and controversySome former operations officers are critical of Pavitt, citing 4 international postings over 10 years in a 30-year career as insufficient experience for a Deputy Director of Operations.[4] The Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture found that Pavitt was told that rectal exams of at least two CIA prisoners had been conducted with "excessive force" but he took action to stop this behavior.[12]External linksAppointment of James L.

Remarks by Deputy Director for Operations James L. Pavitt
















 
 














 Remarks by Deputy
Director for Operations James L. Pavitt
at the
Foreign Policy Association
21 June 2004 

 (as prepared for delivery)




Thank you very much. It is a privilege to be here this evening. In
the tradition of the men charged with keeping America's most sensitive
secrets, I rarely speak in public. But I decided it was important to
come to this city and speak to this audience, to speak openly about
the Directorate of Operations—the clandestine service—the
most secret, yet, least understood part of the Central Intelligence
Agency. 
I would like to borrow the words of an Englishman from another time
who—better than any spy novel—captured the spirit and ethos
of the clandestine service:
"From time to time, God causes men to be born who have a lust
to go abroad at the risk of their lives and discover news—today
it may be far off things, tomorrow, of some hidden mountain, and the
next day of some nearby men who have done a foolishness against the
state. These souls are very few; and of these few, not more than ten
are of the best."
For the most secret part of the U.S. intelligence community, there
has been far too much buzz over the past few years on what it is we
do. My officers have been described as gun slinging cowboys on the one
hand and, risk-averse on the other and, worse yet, just plain incompetent.
In the media there has been a lot of talk—some complimentary, a
great deal critical, but most of the commentary is from sources who
are far from informed. It seems a lot of people with very short careers
in the clandestine service or, more often, people at the periphery of
the intelligence profession consider themselves qualified pundits. The
title "intelligence expert" is one all of us see with increasing
regularity on television these days. Yet, for all the experts and all
the expert opinion, I fear the American people don't get much real insight
into my business from these "experts."
So I thought it perhaps worth your time to hear from me—the man
who runs America's spy service. I will retire in August after 31 years
of service at CIA. Despite a long tradition of silence, a tradition
of allowing the wildest statements about my business to go unanswered,
I feel both compelled and obligated as the leader of the clandestine
service to set the record straight about America's spy service.
But first, let me tell you a little more about what I won't tell you.
I will not divulge the names of officers, I will not divulge ongoing
operations, I will do nothing to compromise information which is vital
to our national security. But I will provide some insider details. I
will offer some real insight into the operations and the people who
make up the clandestine service—one of America's best, but least
known, and least appreciated national treasures. Hopefully, you will
get some appreciation of the men and women who fill the ranks of the
clandestine service. These are truly extraordinary Americans doing extraordinary
things—who work in silence on the front lines of the intelligence
war.
My good friend George Tenet often says he has the greatest job in the
world: I beg to differ—I think as Deputy Director for Operations,
I do. Every morning, I am briefed on an astounding array of incredible
secret operations, agent meetings, recruitments of new agents, placement
of technical devices, captures of terrorists, near misses and harrowing
escapes clandestine service officers have carried out in the past 24
hours. Not a day goes by in which I am not astounded by the imagination,
the creativity and the bravery the men and women of the Directorate
use to keep our nation safe and collect human intelligence of incalculable
value. 
These have been particularly challenging times for America and for
our nation's spy service. We are now nearly three years beyond the devastation
of September 11—a day that indelibly scarred this city and this
nation. Like Pearl Harbor—the event which led to the creation of
America's intelligence services—9/11 redefined us, refocused us,
and made our mission all the more critical. It changed what we do and
how we do it forever.
We are no strangers to criticism, and the events of the past few years
have generated a great deal of it. Some is very thoughtful, and we welcome
that.
We have learned, adjusted and grown from thoughtful and honest critique.
We are better for many changes made, and we are more able. But some
of the criticism is unwarranted and frankly, ill-informed—for example,
the charges that the CIA has lost its status as the gold standard in
intelligence or that our officers are unwilling to go to the hardest,
most dangerous places. I can tell you that is simply not true!
Shallow uninformed criticism provides precious little insight into
what America's clandestine service is all about. What human intelligence
is and what it is not. Let me do that for you tonight.
For all the critique, for all the rhetoric about failure, no one has
ever asked me to stop recruiting spies and stop producing human intelligence
reports. Indeed, the demand grows and customers at every level want
more.
Many of those who criticize us for not having enough spies, enough
agents on Iraq, on terrorism, on North Korea, on Iran, do not have the
first idea of what a spy, an agent really is. An agent—a human
being with access to vital, secret information who agrees to give this
information to us—is not a simply attainable commodity. Contrary
to popular fiction—they cannot simply be bought—indeed, some
of the very best agents have never taken a dime. They are human beings—carefully
cultivated, developed, and brought to a relationship based on a level
of trust that transcends any simple business arrangement. 
Among the trendy sound bites on intelligence is the clamor for "connecting
the dots," for sharing sensitive operational information with analysts
and other consumers of intelligence so they have all the dots connected,
so that nothing whatsoever is overlooked.
I fully support information sharing. Information sharing is essential—the
information from our sources and the "product" of our operations
is meant to be used—to inform our top policymakers and to enable
law enforcement officials to thwart terrorist attacks. We risk agents
and officers every day to collect that data.
But that sharing does not eliminate our sacred duty to protect our
sources and methods. We always balance expanded access to information
with smart compartmentation and what we call the "need-to-know"
principle.
I know the spy business and the people who conduct it better than most,
and I am here tonight to give you a bit of an insider's view. As the
DDO, I know better than anyone the men and women who spend their days
recruiting spies and stealing secrets. I know their commitment, their
integrity, their desire to serve, their sense of duty and patriotism
and their willingness to make tremendous personal sacrifices for the
national good. 
The officers of the clandestine service work in the most dangerous
and most demanding places in the world. Places like Qandahar, Afghanistan—where
Al-Qai'da and the Taliban target our personnel for assassination. Places
like Moscow—the heart of our number one global competitor, working
under the toughest, most pervasive surveillance in the world. Places
like Bogota, where narcoterrorists conduct assassinations in broad daylight.
Places like Baghdad where our officers are constantly under attack from
an enemy bent on their deaths—where we lose to hostile fire armored
vehicles at the rate of one a week. In times that demand heroes, America
is fortunate to have these heroes serving on the front lines.
Let me tell you more about my officers: 
The officer abroad who spent more than 20 hours on the streets to collect
critical intelligence, meeting an agent for whom the consequences of
exposure would be certain death.
The officer in Iraq—who dealt with a nervous, jumpy intelligence
volunteer who promised—and delivered, the location of Uday and
Qusay Hussein.
The officer in Afghanistan who, wounded in an Al-Qa'ida firefight,
turned his vehicle into the line of fire to protect his Afghan and American
partners—and gave his life to ensure his colleagues could return
home.
The officer abroad who ventures into the toughest immigrant neighborhoods—where
the local police think twice about going—to scour the Islamic community
for a penetration of a terrorist cell, an Al-Qa'ida fundraiser, someone
who can provide a critical piece of intelligence. 
The officer who posed as a foreigner to gain access to the inner circle
of a major terrorist facilitator in one of the toughest, most dangerous
areas in South Asia. 
A young paramilitary officer, recently married, with a young child
who has spent more time in Afghanistan and Iraq since 9/11 than with
his family and whose only proviso when asked to travel into the toughest
of environments was, "tell me where I can be of the most service."

Sometimes the officers themselves speak most eloquently about what
they do and what the job means. This from a first-tour officer injured
in a firefight that took the lives of his military partners last fall
while hunting terrorists in Afghanistan: "What the best training
cannot prepare you for is what it feels like to be shot, what it feels
like to see a friend in significant pain, what it feels like to have
your weapon jam under fire…I have to admit, I was feeling sorry
for myself, but it was the thought of my family and friends that kept
me level headed and focused on surviving. I continue to be committed
to our profession because I believe in our mission."
Organizations often show their true colors—indeed as some have
put it—their cultures—in the worst of times. In February 2003,
we faced such a period with the tragic loss of a young first tour officer
who was killed in Afghanistan in a terrible training accident. My Chief
of Station in Kabul wrote me a note shortly thereafter, which, I believe,
captures the spirit and ethos of the clandestine service. I quote from
his note: "One thing we cannot do, and every single officer here
shares this view, is back away from the job at hand, and that necessarily
means accepting attendant risks…it is dangerous here, in Kabul,
at the bases, all around. To a man, the attitude remains, if not me,
who then?"
I've spent some time now discussing how the clandestine service is
taking on the challenges of the present. Now I'd like to provide some
history. Let's go back to the darkest days of the Cold War—the
mid-1970s, when the Soviet Union and the United States seemed close
to the nuclear confrontation we all dreaded during those dark days.
In Moscow, our small station was under incredible, close surveillance—our
officers were constantly watched and followed, tracked by trained dogs
and technical devices. It was the toughest operating environment imaginable.
Through the lens of the past 13 years, it is hard to remember the Soviet
Union for the evil, repressive, society it was; in many ways, it was
the model for the "republic of fear" Saddam created in Iraq.
In mid-1977, a small furtive man, hiding near the official gas station
reserved for foreign diplomats, approached an official he believed to
be an American and passed him a note, quickly, carefully, under the
noses of surveillance. He was disgusted with the Soviet regime, quietly
worshipped America from afar, and believed he was in a position to help.
Adolf Tolkachev—a senior research scientist in the Russian military
aerospace program—did more than just help. The operation at which
he was at the very center ensured us air superiority at a critical juncture
of the Cold War. The intelligence he provided from 1977 to 1985 saved
the U.S. taxpayers literally billions of dollars in research and development
fees on look-down/shoot-down radar, aeronautics design, and early stealth
technology.
Working in secret—in the basement of his office complex, in the
toilets of the Lenin library, risking his life at every turn, Tolkachev
silently fought one of the greatest battles of the Cold War. Passing
literally thousands of documents that were nothing short of pure gold.
Tolkachev never left Russia throughout the operation. As someone who
held the highest level clearances, he was denied the privilege of foreign
travel. Our officers went to tremendous lengths to elude and escape
surveillance to meet him in the dead of night or early morning, quickly
passing film and documents. Tolkachev, fighting his solo battle, was
glad for the rare moments of contact with his allies.
In the end, Tolkachev was caught—and paid the ultimate price for
his service—death in the basement of the notorious Lubyanka Prison
in Moscow. Oleg Gordiyevskiy may have been the spy who "saved the
world" during the Cuban missile crisis—but in the secret archives
of the Cold War, Adolf Tolkachev and our officers who worked with him
were heroes in one of the decisive battles in the Cold War.
These accounts describe the clandestine service I know. It is a national
treasure that only a few people have the privilege to serve. 
These rare, extraordinary men and women, who go abroad to the world's
toughest places, understand the high stakes of their work and they are
willing to take the necessary risks. They accept that, in the secret
world, success is unheralded and failure is trumpeted. Yet they continue
their difficult, demanding work, in silent service to our country.
Let me say it again: they are a national treasure.
As the result of exceptional leadership within the Agency and a new
appreciation of the value of human intelligence by our nation's leaders,
we are in a much stronger position today than we were a decade ago.
As you know from recent press articles, we embarked on a wholesale rebuilding
of the clandestine service in the late 1990s. We have made tremendous
strides but still have work to do.
The fact is, despite strong protests from within my agency, the clandestine
service was left to wither during most of the '90s. As part of the so-called
"peace dividend" after the Cold War ended, too many in Washington
believed that intelligence was no longer needed and our operations officer
corps could shrink without consequence.
And shrink it did. We trained roughly two dozen new officers in 1995.
Even as our missions were expanding and changing, the number of intelligence
positions throughout the Government, especially overseas, dropped by
almost a quarter in the mid-90s. At CIA, recruitment of both operations
officers and analysts came to a virtual halt.
Compare that with today: Our recruiting and training efforts are unprecedented.
And interest in CIA from talented men and women from all over this country
is at an all time high.
We get 2200 resumes a week from some of America's best and brightest.
Not only young college graduates, but also experienced professionals:
retired military and law enforcement officers, linguists, scientists,
lawyers, engineers, doctors.
Today, the average clandestine service trainee classes number significantly
higher and we aim to double the number of new officers in two years.
Recruits spend a full year learning every aspect of our tradecraft,
from how to detect surveillance, to the fine art of recruitment and
agent handling to armed defense in extreme situations. 
In the last five years, the clandestine service has grown 30 percent.
And we plan to grow it another 30 percent in the next five years. But
as good as our recruiting and training is, I can't buy experience, and
it will take time for our skilled new graduates to become the seasoned
pros we need them to be.
The world we face today, the challenges we face are far more dangerous
and require as great if not a greater commitment than those associated
with the Cold War. We face a global enemy in the terrorists bent on
our destruction, the challenge of providing force protection for nearly
a quarter million U.S. troops in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Balkans, the
Korean Peninsula, preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,
dealing with regional challenges such as Iran, North Korea, Russia,
and China.
The fight against Al-Qa'ida and the hate-filled extremist movement
it fuels across the globe is an intelligence war—as much as if
not more than any conflict in our nation's history. We will not prevail
against this agile and determined enemy without creative, vibrant and
expanded human intelligence capabilities.
The CIA has known this for years. The opening shots in the war on terrorism
were fired well before 11 September 2001. The Directorate's Counterterrorist
Center will mark its 20th anniversary in 2006. Even in our leanest years—the
1990s, when Congress was cutting our funding—we were ensuring sustained
resources to counterterrorism, not as much as we needed to meet the
gathering threat, but as much as we could given our limited resources.

Well before 11 September, 2001 we understood the important connection
between domestic and international terrorism. We were working side by
side with the FBI and other law enforcement agencies to counter the
threat. The partnership was real.
Well before 11 September 2001, we were fighting Al-Qa'ida and disrupting
its activities. We unraveled terrorist plots that aimed to murder innocents
and shatter peace. Plans for attacks in the U.S., Jordan and Israel
around the millennium were thwarted. Others still were quashed in the
fall of 2000, and again in the summer of 2001.
Well before 11 September 2001, we told the public and we told the Congress
and the Executive Branch, that terrorists threatened our nation.
Well before 11 September 2001, we knew Al-Qa'ida was planning something
bigger than we had seen, something terrible. All the while, we at CIA
were loudly sounding the alarm and constantly seeking more resources
to counter this threat. The bombings of our embassies in Africa and
the U.S.S. Cole were not enough. The chatter we picked up in early summer
2001 was not enough to provide us specific information about the attack.

The tragedy of September 11th changed everything. The intelligence community,
at long last, received the funding and the tools it needed to fight
the war on terrorism—at the cost of 3,000 innocent souls. 
People still ask me if I think we could have stopped the horror of
that day—if we had, in fact, connected all the dots before us.
There are some who have placed the blame on a handful of individual
officers for not ensuring the FBI watch listed two of the hijackers.
It is a question my officers have asked themselves, have tormented themselves
with, for it is only human to wonder "what if?"
Although we can speculate endlessly, given what we had that day, I
sadly conclude that the answer is no. Short of cracking Usama bin Laden's
impenetrable inner circle, sealing our borders and recognizing box cutters
as potential weapons, we could not have stopped those planes from hitting
the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and that field in Pennsylvania.
In a chilling interview on Al-Jazeera, bin Laden himself bragged that
not even all of the hijackers knew the full extent of their mission
that day.
We did not foil the evil of September 11. We failed to stop this horror.
Indeed, not only did we fail, much of our national security apparatus
failed as well to protect the American people. But we did not allow
the horror to prevent us from fighting back—right from the start.
Ignoring the order to evacuate CIA Headquarters, many of my CTC officers
stayed to take charge of the intelligence counterattack. Many officers
from other parts of the DO volunteered to stay on—many for several
days without break. One senior officer who had retired from the government
on the 11th was driving to his retirement home, literally swung his
car around on the road when he heard of the attacks, drove back in the
gates, revoked his retirement, and went right back to work.
In less then two weeks, CIA paramilitary officers were on the ground
in Afghanistan, working with old friends in familiar places, in the
traditions of their OSS forefathers, preparing the way for the eventual
military campaign that deposed the Taliban and deprived bin Laden and
his lieutenants of a sanctuary in which to plan future attacks.
Destroying terrorism and those who have attacked us is the primary
mission of my officers, not only in Pakistan and Afghanistan, but worldwide.
A worldwide threat requires a worldwide response.
And, our efforts have had significant impact on our enemies. We've
captured or killed nearly two-thirds of known Al-Qa'ida top leadership.
Khalid Shaykh Mohammed, Khalid bin Attash, Abu Zubaydah, Hambali, Abu
Musab al Baluchi, and a host of others are in custody. 
None of this—none of this—would be possible without human
intelligence: my operations officers, the agents they recruit and the
partnerships they build with foreign intelligence services all serve
the counterterrorist mission. Satellite photos and communications intercepts
can get you only so far. It is the human source that so often delivers
the final piece of a puzzle. Human intelligence from the spies the clandestine
service recruits, resulted in many of the captures. A human source gave
us the critical piece of intelligence to conduct the operation leading
to the capture of the architect of 9/11, the Al-Qa'ida mastermind Khalid
Shaykh Muhammed; a human source provided us the trail to Hambali, Al-Qa'ida's
ringleader for a second wave of terror attacks on America; and it is
human intelligence that will eventually help us bring Usama bin Ladin
to justice, or justice to him.
Let me be clear: the threat from Al-Qa'ida remains. Let me be even
clearer: as sure as I am of anything, I am sure all of us here are sitting
in the cross hairs. Al-Qa'ida has unambiguous plans to hit the homeland
again, and New York City, I am certain, remains a prime target. Human
intelligence will play a critical role in preventing future attacks,
but I can't offer you guarantees—and I wouldn't trust anyone who
does.
Let me move away from terrorism for a moment to another issue challenging
America and its spy service.
From the task of collecting intelligence before the war in Iraq to
the current task of supporting the new republic's first breaths of freedom,
the clandestine service has been fully engaged in Iraq.
I am often asked why Iraq was so hard?
Simply put, Iraq under Saddam was the republic of fear. If you were
suspected of or caught assisting his adversaries, your family was tortured
and you were shot. Indeed, it was no secret to Iraqis that getting caught
working with us meant the end for them and their families.
As I mentioned at the outset, some of our critics have been on the
mark regarding Iraq. Indeed, as some critics have claimed—during
the pre-war period, we did not have many Iraqi sources. We certainly
did not have enough! Until we put people on the ground in northern Iraq,
we had less than a handful. As I mentioned before, the operating environment
was tremendously prohibitive and developing the necessary trust with
those Iraqis who had access was extraordinarily difficult in light of
the risks they faced. Once on the ground, however, our officers recruited
literally dozens of agents—some of whom paid the ultimate price
for their allegiance to us—who were determined to help all Iraqis
win their freedom.
Did we get access to the heart of Saddam's weapons programs? No. In
those final months, did we get closer to the inner circle of the military
and political process? Absolutely! And in that compressed period of
a few months, we collected intelligence our own military deemed of vital
importance.
CIA officers first played pathfinder roles, moving well ahead of the
combat lines, obtaining critical intelligence that informed battlefield
planners. Then, when U.S. troops launched on March 19, 2003, my officers
were right there with them. 
And well before Saddam's statue was toppled in Baghdad, our officers,
their equipment and communications gear flew into the capital under
hostile fire. We needed to be there—to provide crucial intelligence
to the advancing combat forces. 
Today, as Iraq transitions from tyranny to self-determination, Baghdad
is home to the largest CIA station since the Vietnam war. I am extremely
proud of our performance in Iraq, and of our role in liberating its
people from decades of repression.
The missions the clandestine service takes on for America are not all
fast-breaking. Many take years or longer. Human intelligence led the
way to one of the most significant counter-proliferation successes in
years: Libya's renunciation of weapons of mass destruction last December.

As the result of a patient, decade long operation involving million
dollar recruitment pitches, covert entries, ballet like sophistication
and a level of patience we are often accused of not possessing, the
clandestine service exposed the network of Pakistani scientist AQ Khan.
Khan was the source of nuclear materials in Libya, Iran and North Korea
and the potential source to non-state actors. Working with British intelligence,
we surprised Libya's leaders with the depth of our knowledge about its
weapons programs. We pressed them on the right questions, exposed inconsistencies
and convinced the Libyans that holding back was counterproductive. 
In the end, Colonel Qadhafi had no option but to abandon his WMD programs
and accept international inspections. Nice work by any high standard!
None of this comes easily. Espionage is not James Bond or Jason Bourne
or any of the hundreds of other fictional spies who occupy the world
of novels and movies. Human intelligence demands a balance of delicacy,
poise, timing, and understanding of human beings. It relies on an operations
officer getting to know an agent or potential agent as well as he or
she knows a member of his or her family. The officer must learn the
motivations, emotions, loyalties, vulnerabilities, and limits that drive
this most unique of human beings. It requires professional detachment
that allows the officer to see the truth from the half-truth, the nuance
of fact, the coloration of bias. It is no wonder why human intelligence
is, as I told you, more art than science.
It has been well established that the intelligence community, including
the clandestine service, did not have the resources it required before
the 9/11 attacks. Most of you are aware of the traumatic resource reductions
we received throughout the decade of the 90s, cuts made in the wake
of the supposed post-Cold War "peace dividend," the reluctance
of Congress and the nation's leadership to sustain the clandestine service
so that we could answer the alarm we had been sounding about Al-Qa'ida's
threat to America. These cuts, the lack of funding, left America's spy
service weakened and America vulnerable. As I said before, 9/11 changed
all that—the Congress provided a tremendous influx of counterterrorism
funding in the wake of 9/11 and Iraq focused funding prior to the war
in Iraq.
The tremendous resources devoted to the war on terrorism and the effort
in Iraq have made a difference; the influx of funding has helped. But
it has helped us catch up in a race in which we had been allowed to
fall too far behind. Frankly speaking, the men and women of the clandestine
service have been in a flat out sprint since 9/11. The increased funding
has helped us to grow our capability in the global war on terrorism
and support our troops in Iraq. But we will need longer term, strategic
funds to win the race around the globe. For the sake of America's security,
for our future, we need sustained congressional and executive commitment
to grow and nurture a clandestine service worthy of this country and
the challenges we face.
In my opinion, now is not the time for radical reorganization of the
intelligence community, for creating a new structure, a different framework
in the hope of always getting it right and always connecting the dots.
Some have said my retirement and George Tenet's resignation create the
"perfect storm" for radical restructuring in the intelligence
community. Let me remind you that in the book and the movie "the
perfect storm," the ship sank and the crew drowned.
I would argue against change for the sake or appearance of change particularly
in these politically charged times and at a time of great terrorist
threat. No one really seeks a perfect storm. The aftermath of 9/11 brought
about tremendous change in the way we do business; but change for its
own sake is dead wrong. I believe thoughtful empowerment of the DCI
and sustained executive and congressional commitment to improve our
nation's intelligence capabilities will serve our nation well.
No amount of intelligence funding, no amount of threat integration,
no amount of rebuilding the intelligence community, as some have called
for, will or can guarantee perfect results. 
At its very best, human intelligence is an inexact art, and while we
may be able to find and connect many of the dots; I would be lying to
you if I said we can connect them all. I would be suspect of anyone
offering quick solutions or quick answers through hasty reorganization
and centralization. 
Even with all that we have learned from 9/11, from the war on terrorism—as
good as we've become, there will be failures. Perfection is impossible
in a profession devoted to the complexities and unknowns of the world.
You already know what I worry about—another attack by terrorists
on the homeland—indeed this is what I lose sleep over. But I also
worry that racing to change risks many things to include our nation
and the clandestine service. The clandestine service provides the American
public with no balance sheet, no scorecard at the end of the year tallying
victories and losses. Our failures—real or perceived—are the
stuff of headlines—our successes are largely unheralded. Therefore,
I hope I have expanded your understanding of what we do.
As we search for ways to improve our intelligence capability, we as
a nation must take care not to dismiss or undo the magnificent gains
of human intelligence. There is far more at stake than an organization's
pride. Our challenges remain daunting, our responsibility enormous.

I fear that we are being pushed into a "mistake-free zone,"
and only bad can come of that. Fear of failure creates caution—in
people and in organizations. One of the bedrocks of my business is a
willingness to take risks—calculated risks that withstand legal
scrutiny—but risks that are inherent to all we do. Mistakes and
failure come with the territory as well—we will always strive for
perfection with the understanding it is unattainable.
As my friend and former director Richard Helms put it, "secret
intelligence has never been for the fainthearted." In my business,
you simply have to accept the real probability of failure, learn from
your shortcomings and do better. Those afraid to make mistakes will
never be bold or creative enough to solve the problems our nation faces.
This business is not for everyone.
Imagine for a moment what would have happened if the CIA, during the
height of the Cold War, had abandoned its effort to send the first spy
satellite into space. The program was called Corona and it failed 12
times over two and a half years. Finally, in August 1960, it launched,
orbited and sent back to America the first overhead photos of the Soviet
Union. The vast amounts of intelligence it gathered quickly overtook
all we had gained from the U-2 spy program.
Indeed, some of our best officers have learned from their mistakes.
In the previous century, a junior intelligence officer in Switzerland
received word on Sunday evening that a disturbed Russian sought to speak
to an American official. Not wanting to spoil his weekend tennis outing,
our officer told the duty officer to direct the disturbed Russian to
return the next day—Monday—during duty hours. Unfortunately,
Vladimir Lenin chose not to return to the mission. Allen Dulles, our
first DCI, was the junior intelligence officer. He recovered admirably
from this early stumble and learned a lesson he imparted to future generations
of operations officers.
Today, a willingness to think creatively and to take risks is arguably
more important than ever. Our enemies in the war on terror seek our
destruction. They have been weakened but not beaten. And there will
be more deadly attacks.
And there is an important analogy.
Al-Qa'ida succeeded, with terrible human toll, on 11 September. Many
times before, and many times after that horrid day in 2001, the terrorists
failed and intelligence succeeded. Too often that is forgotten in the
endless rush to assign blame.

70 terrorists were brought to justice before 9/11, and hundreds
after.
The millenium plot, which targeted us among others, was disrupted
with dozens of terrorists apprehended.
The Ramadan plot in the Gulf was foiled.
We stopped attacks against the U.S. in Yemen and Saudi Arabia.
We disrupted attacks against the U.S. military in Europe and a U.S.
embassy in a European capitol.
A major arrest deterred plans to kidnap Americans in three countries
and carry out hijackings overseas.

We must be agile and aggressive in our response to this shrewd and
single-minded foe. 
We are and will continue to be. 
As George Tenet once put it, "in times like these, the need for
heroes is compelling." If you remember nothing else I have said
tonight, remember this: There is no shortage of heroes in the company
I keep. 

From the South Asian Muslim woman who became a U.S. citizen and
is now—in her words—"living the American dream"
by serving in the clandestine service, 
to the Arabic-speaking former operations officer who returned to
us on September 12th, 2001, after leaving us for the private sector,
because he decided there was no more important calling;
from the Chief of Station targeted for assassination in South America;
To the memory of Mike Spann—the first American hero to fall
in Afghanistan fighting the Taliban and Al-Qai'da.

I am tremendously proud of the people—the heroes—I have led
for the last five years. They are heroes for whom there are no parades,
no public accolades, and rare acknowledgement of their deeds. They are
a living national treasure. They have earned your adulation and they
need your support.

James L. PavittTorture Connection: Pushed the CIA to the Forefront
		Born 1946, St. Louis

		B.A. University of Missouri, graduate study at Clark University

		1969-73, U.S. Army intelligence officer, congressional liaison

		1973, joined CIA clandestine service

		1999-2004, Deputy Director for Operations under George Tenet

		Private intelligence consultant with Scowcroft firm
 


	James Pavitt's Superman Scenario

	As chief of CIA operations at the time of 9/11, Pavitt defended the agency's pre-9/11 counterterrorism activities and simultaneously defined a new role for the post-9/11 CIA. Both these efforts were based on a view, shared by Cofer Black, of al-Qaeda as nearly superhuman in its professionalism and organizational discipline. Normal intelligence efforts could not have prevented 9/11, Pavitt argued; even infiltration into the ranks of al-Qaeda would not have provided access to the leaders' plans. Only someone from the highest levels of al-Qaeda would have known the goals or details of the plans, according to this view. Henceforth, Pavitt focused the CIA on capturing and interrogating high-value terror suspects. His "superman scenario" led directly to the ticking-time-bomb justification for torture.

	Pavitt's Operational Responsibility

	Pavitt opposed entanglement in Iraq as a distraction in the war against al-Qaeda. He hired Joe Wilson, agent Valerie Plame's husband, to help debunk the administration's pro-Iraq mythology. In and around Afghanistan, he was responsible for approving specific renditions, kidnappings, and torture. He controlled half the CIA's budget and worked with many private contractors, to provide services including rendition flights. He left the CIA suddenly in 2004, one day after George Tenet.

	"Hard, Fast, Unambiguous Rules"

	As was the case for so many of the Bush-administration torturers, Pavitt's world view and professional identity were forged during the years of the Iran-Contra affair, which had led to shrinking and partial hobbling of the CIA. The lessons he took from Iran-Contra concerned the consequences of allowing low-level agents and contractors to take the fall while high-level policymakers hid behind secrecy and deniability. That way of operating, Pavitt believed, destroyed agency morale and also left the public impression that CIA leaders could not control rogue agents. Pavitt's CIA was tightly run from the top, with paperwork backing up all operations and procedures. Memos providing legal justification for torture are a reflection of this mindset.

James Pavitt - Wikipedia





















 






James Pavitt

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

James L. Pavitt (born February 19, 1946) was Deputy Director for Operations (DDO) for the CIA from 1999 until June 4, 2004. His sudden resignation – as well as that of his chief, DCI George Tenet the previous day – led to speculation that it was over the controversy surrounding Iraq weapons of mass destruction or 9-11 intelligence issues.[citation needed]

3.2 References





Background[edit]
Pavitt was born in St. Louis, Missouri and graduated from the University of Missouri (B.A., 1968) in Columbia, Missouri[1] as a member of Phi Beta Kappa.[2] After graduation, he was a National Defense Education Act fellow at Clark University (1969). He is currently a Principal of The Scowcroft Group, an international business advisory firm,[2] and was formerly on the board of the Association of Former Intelligence Officers (AFIO).
He is married with two children (from a previous marriage) and resides in McLean, Virginia.
His hobbies include collecting art, especially primitive American art.[1]
Intelligence career[edit]
Pavitt served in the United States Army from 1969-1971 as an intelligence officer and was a legislative assistant with the House of Representatives from 1971 until 1973.
Pavitt joined the CIA in 1973 as a Career Trainee with postings to Europe, Asia and Washington.[citation needed] He was posted to Vienna (1976-1978), East Berlin (1978-1980), Budapest, Hungary and Malaysia (1980-1983).[3] He was expelled (PNG'd) from East Germany.[3] He was chief of station in Luxembourg (1983-1986).[3][4] He served as a Branch Chief in the Africa Division.[5] From 1990 to 1993, he served on the National Security Council team under Brent Scowcroft as Senior Intelligence Advisor to President George H.W. Bush.[6] After being assigned to work across the Agency operational/analytical divide in the Directorate of Intelligence, he became the founder and first Chief of the Directorate of Operation's Counterproliferation Division (CPD). Gordon Oehler, then Chief of the Directorate of Intelligence's Non-Proliferation Center, criticized this as being redundant and stepping on his turf. This was considered a specious critique by veteran Agency HUMINT Operations Officers, however, especially those who had been assigned under Oehler previously and realized that Oehler held HUMINT counterproliferation operations—indeed, covert operations in general—in considerable disdain. Pavitt hand picked operations officers, some of which were Nonofficial Cover Officers (NOCs) including Valerie Plame, to staff the CPD.[5] In 1997 he was appointed Associate Deputy Director of Operations. He was Deputy Director of Operations from 1999 until his resignation in 2004.[1][7] In 2003, the CPD took down the nuclear black market being operated by Abdul Qadeer Khan.[5]
After September 11, 2001, Pavitt was responsible for sending Special Activities Division teams to Afghanistan, Pakistan, Indonesia, Thailand, and Somalia to capture Al Qaeda members. The first Hellfire missiles fired from drones were under his command. They were aimed at an Al Qaeda convoy in Sudan in which all occupants, including an American citizen, were killed.[1]
In April 2004 he appeared before the 9/11 Commission.[7] The BBC called his 9/11 commission appearance 'unprecedented'.[7] The commission's report said that shortly after Bush's election, Pavitt told the President-elect that Osama bin Laden was one of the gravest threats to the country. He also added that killing the Al Qaeda leader would have an effect but not stop the threat posed by the terrorist organization.[8]
When Bush put Porter Goss in charge of the agency, Pavitt reportedly opposed the internal reorganizations announced by Goss, on the ground that they might "do damage to a strategic effort that has produced excellent work on terrorism and a variety of other important issues."[9] On June 4, 2004, he unexpectedly announced his retirement one day after George Tenet. The CIA says Pavitt's decision was unconnected with Tenet's departure.[citation needed] Pavitt was succeeded by his deputy, Stephen Kappes. On June 21, 2004, Pavitt delivered one of his last speeches as DDO to the Foreign Policy Association.[10]
Pavitt is a recipient of the CIA's Distinguished Intelligence Medal.[2] He is also a recipient of the CIA Distinguished Career Intelligence Medal, the CIA Director’s Medal and the Donovan Award.[11]
Post-CIA work[edit]
He is an advisor to the Patriot Defense Group, LLC, a defense and intelligence contracting company that directly supports the training requirements of the defense and intelligence communities.[6] to Olton Solutions Ltd. in the United Kingdom and to The Scowcroft Group.[2][11]
He is a director of CACI International, Inc.[11]
Criticism and controversy[edit]
Some former operations officers are critical of Pavitt, citing 4 international postings over 10 years in a 30-year career as insufficient experience for a Deputy Director of Operations.[4] The Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture found that Pavitt was told that rectal exams of at least two CIA prisoners had been conducted with "excessive force" but he took action to stop this behavior.[12]

James Pavitt

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

James L. Pavitt (born February 19, 1946) was Deputy Director for Operations (DDO) for the CIA from 1999 until June 4, 2004. His sudden resignation – as well as that of his chief, DCI George Tenet the previous day – led to speculation that it was over the controversy surrounding Iraq weapons of mass destruction or 9-11 intelligence issues.[citation needed]

Background[edit]
Pavitt was born in St. Louis, Missouri and graduated from the University of Missouri (B.A., 1968) in Columbia, Missouri[1] as a member of Phi Beta Kappa.[2] After graduation, he was a National Defense Education Act fellow at Clark University (1969). He is currently a Principal of The Scowcroft Group, an international business advisory firm,[2] and was formerly on the board of the Association of Former Intelligence Officers (AFIO).
He is married with two children (from a previous marriage) and resides in McLean, Virginia.
His hobbies include collecting art, especially primitive American art.[1]
Intelligence career[edit]
Pavitt served in the United States Army from 1969-1971 as an intelligence officer and was a legislative assistant with the House of Representatives from 1971 until 1973.
Pavitt joined the CIA in 1973 as a Career Trainee with postings to Europe, Asia and Washington.[citation needed] He was posted to Vienna (1976-1978), East Berlin (1978-1980), Budapest, Hungary and Malaysia (1980-1983).[3] He was expelled (PNG'd) from East Germany.[3] He was chief of station in Luxembourg (1983-1986).[3][4] He served as a Branch Chief in the Africa Division.[5] From 1990 to 1993, he served on the National Security Council team under Brent Scowcroft as Senior Intelligence Advisor to President George H.W. Bush.[6] After being assigned to work across the Agency operational/analytical divide in the Directorate of Intelligence, he became the founder and first Chief of the Directorate of Operation's Counterproliferation Division (CPD). Gordon Oehler, then Chief of the Directorate of Intelligence's Non-Proliferation Center, criticized this as being redundant and stepping on his turf. This was considered a specious critique by veteran Agency HUMINT Operations Officers, however, especially those who had been assigned under Oehler previously and realized that Oehler held HUMINT counterproliferation operations—indeed, covert operations in general—in considerable disdain. Pavitt hand picked operations officers, some of which were Nonofficial Cover Officers (NOCs) including Valerie Plame, to staff the CPD.[5] In 1997 he was appointed Associate Deputy Director of Operations. He was Deputy Director of Operations from 1999 until his resignation in 2004.[1][7] In 2003, the CPD took down the nuclear black market being operated by Abdul Qadeer Khan.[5]
After September 11, 2001, Pavitt was responsible for sending Special Activities Division teams to Afghanistan, Pakistan, Indonesia, Thailand, and Somalia to capture Al Qaeda members. The first Hellfire missiles fired from drones were under his command. They were aimed at an Al Qaeda convoy in Sudan in which all occupants, including an American citizen, were killed.[1]
In April 2004 he appeared before the 9/11 Commission.[7] The BBC called his 9/11 commission appearance 'unprecedented'.[7] The commission's report said that shortly after Bush's election, Pavitt told the President-elect that Osama bin Laden was one of the gravest threats to the country. He also added that killing the Al Qaeda leader would have an effect but not stop the threat posed by the terrorist organization.[8]
When Bush put Porter Goss in charge of the agency, Pavitt reportedly opposed the internal reorganizations announced by Goss, on the ground that they might "do damage to a strategic effort that has produced excellent work on terrorism and a variety of other important issues."[9] On June 4, 2004, he unexpectedly announced his retirement one day after George Tenet. The CIA says Pavitt's decision was unconnected with Tenet's departure.[citation needed] Pavitt was succeeded by his deputy, Stephen Kappes. On June 21, 2004, Pavitt delivered one of his last speeches as DDO to the Foreign Policy Association.[10]
Pavitt is a recipient of the CIA's Distinguished Intelligence Medal.[2] He is also a recipient of the CIA Distinguished Career Intelligence Medal, the CIA Director’s Medal and the Donovan Award.[11]
Post-CIA work[edit]
He is an advisor to the Patriot Defense Group, LLC, a defense and intelligence contracting company that directly supports the training requirements of the defense and intelligence communities.[6] to Olton Solutions Ltd. in the United Kingdom and to The Scowcroft Group.[2][11]
He is a director of CACI International, Inc.[11]
Criticism and controversy[edit]
Some former operations officers are critical of Pavitt, citing 4 international postings over 10 years in a 30-year career as insufficient experience for a Deputy Director of Operations.[4] The Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture found that Pavitt was told that rectal exams of at least two CIA prisoners had been conducted with "excessive force" but he took action to stop this behavior.[12]

Bush.[6] After being assigned to work across the Agency operational/analytical divide in the Directorate of Intelligence, he became the founder and first Chief of the Directorate of Operation's Counterproliferation Division (CPD). Gordon Oehler, then Chief of the Directorate of Intelligence's Non-Proliferation Center, criticized this as being redundant and stepping on his turf. This was considered a specious critique by veteran Agency HUMINT Operations Officers, however, especially those who had been assigned under Oehler previously and realized that Oehler held HUMINT counterproliferation operations—indeed, covert operations in general—in considerable disdain. Pavitt hand picked operations officers, some of which were Nonofficial Cover Officers (NOCs) including Valerie Plame, to staff the CPD.[5] In 1997 he was appointed Associate Deputy Director of Operations. He was Deputy Director of Operations from 1999 until his resignation in 2004.[1][7] In 2003, the CPD took down the nuclear black market being operated by Abdul Qadeer Khan.[5]
After September 11, 2001, Pavitt was responsible for sending Special Activities Division teams to Afghanistan, Pakistan, Indonesia, Thailand, and Somalia to capture Al Qaeda members. The first Hellfire missiles fired from drones were under his command. They were aimed at an Al Qaeda convoy in Sudan in which all occupants, including an American citizen, were killed.[1]
In April 2004 he appeared before the 9/11 Commission.[7] The BBC called his 9/11 commission appearance 'unprecedented'.[7] The commission's report said that shortly after Bush's election, Pavitt told the President-elect that Osama bin Laden was one of the gravest threats to the country. He also added that killing the Al Qaeda leader would have an effect but not stop the threat posed by the terrorist organization.[8]
When Bush put Porter Goss in charge of the agency, Pavitt reportedly opposed the internal reorganizations announced by Goss, on the ground that they might "do damage to a strategic effort that has produced excellent work on terrorism and a variety of other important issues."[9] On June 4, 2004, he unexpectedly announced his retirement one day after George Tenet. The CIA says Pavitt's decision was unconnected with Tenet's departure.[citation needed] Pavitt was succeeded by his deputy, Stephen Kappes. On June 21, 2004, Pavitt delivered one of his last speeches as DDO to the Foreign Policy Association.[10]
Pavitt is a recipient of the CIA's Distinguished Intelligence Medal.[2] He is also a recipient of the CIA Distinguished Career Intelligence Medal, the CIA Director’s Medal and the Donovan Award.[11]
Post-CIA work[edit]
He is an advisor to the Patriot Defense Group, LLC, a defense and intelligence contracting company that directly supports the training requirements of the defense and intelligence communities.[6] to Olton Solutions Ltd. in the United Kingdom and to The Scowcroft Group.[2][11]
He is a director of CACI International, Inc.[11]
Criticism and controversy[edit]
Some former operations officers are critical of Pavitt, citing 4 international postings over 10 years in a 30-year career as insufficient experience for a Deputy Director of Operations.[4] The Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture found that Pavitt was told that rectal exams of at least two CIA prisoners had been conducted with "excessive force" but he took action to stop this behavior.[12]

Background
 
�The Central Intelligence Agency was told by an
  informant in the spring of 2001 that Iraq had abandoned a major element of
  its nuclear weapons program, but the agency did not share the information
  with other agencies or with senior policy makers, a former C.I.A. officer has
  charged.
 
�In a lawsuit filed in federal court here in
  December, the former C.I.A. officer, whose name remains secret, said that the
  informant told him that Iraq�s uranium enrichment program had ended years
  earlier [�]


�The officer, an employee at the agency for more
  than 20 years, including several years in a clandestine unit assigned to
  gather intelligence related to illicit weapons, was fired in 2004. In his
  lawsuit, he says his dismissal was punishment for his reports questioning the
  agency�s assumptions on a series of weapons-related matters. Among other
  things, he charged that he had been the target of retaliation for his refusal
  to go along with the agency�s intelligence conclusions. [�]�

U.S. District Court for the District of
  Columbia
No. 1:04-cv-02122 (GK)
 
Action filed: December 6th,
  2004
 
August 11th, 2009 - Order
 
�[�] On June 30, 2009, the Court ruled that by July
  15, 2009, Plaintiff should either reinstate discovery procedures or file an
  appropriate dispositive motion regarding the remaining privacy claim. The
  Court warned Plaintiff that �failure to do this may well result in dismissal
  of this five year old case for lack of prosecution.� Plaintiff has taken no
  action since issuance of this Order on June 30, 2009.
 
�On July 27, 2009, the Government filed a Motion to
  Dismiss for Failure to Prosecute. The Opposition was due August 10, 2009. No
  Opposition has been filed. The Government pointed out in its Motion that �Plaintiff
  has filed nothing for the past 12 months, during the time Defendants and the
  Court have made 33 filings or docket entries.� [�]
 
�For all these reasons, as well as those contained
  in the Government�s unopposed Motion, it is hereby ordered, that this case is
  dismissed. [�]�
 
July 27th, 2009 - Defendants� Motion to
  Dismiss for Failure to Prosecute
 
�[�] Pursuant to Rule 41(b) of the Federal Rules of
  Civil Procedure and Local Rule 83.23, the defendants, by their undersigned
  counsel, hereby respectfully move for dismissal of the remainder of this
  action, with prejudice, due to plaintiff's failure to prosecute.
 
�The grounds for this motion are more fully set
  forth in the accompanying Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of
  Defendants' Motion to Dismiss for Failure to Prosecute. [�]
 
�[�] The history of this case presents a pattern of �inaction�
  and �dilatoriness� on the part of the plaintiff. [�] For example, plaintiff refuses
  to agree on a motion schedule to resolve his one remaining claim, but he has
  also failed to pursue discovery proceedings. The plaintiff has not complied
  with an order to submit supplemental briefing by February 9, 2009, nor with
  an order requiring him either to reinstitute discovery procedures or file a
  dispositive motion by July 15, 2009 - even though the last order clearly
  warned that non-compliance may result in dismissal for lack of prosecution.
  Indeed, the plaintiff has filed nothing for the past twelve months, during
  which time defendants and the Court have made thirty-three filings or docket
  entries. Under these circumstances, dismissing plaintiff's remaining claim
  for failure to prosecute would clearly be within the Court's discretion, and
  defendants so request. [�]�
 
May 11th, 2009 - Order & Memorandum
  Opinion
 
�[�] Plaintiff Doe, a former employee of the Central
  Intelligence Agency (�CIA�), brings this suit against Leon E. Panetta,
  Director of the CIA; the CIA; James Pavitt, CIA Deputy Director of Operations
  (�DDO�); and two Defendants Doe, whom Plaintiff identifies as current or
  former agents, officers and employees of the United States acting under color
  of Federal law. Plaintiff�s true name and address are classified, and
  therefore he has been allowed to file as �Doe.�
 
�[�] This matter is now before the Court on Plaintiff�s
  Motion for Partial Judgment on the Pleadings [�]. Upon consideration of the
  Motion, Opposition, and Reply, the entire record herein, and for the reasons
  stated in the accompanying Memorandum Opinion, it is hereby ordered that
  Plaintiff�s Motion for Partial Judgment on the Pleadings is denied; [�]�
 
August 7th,
  2008 - Plaintiff�s Reply
  in Support of his revised Motion
 
�[�] The portions of Plaintiff�s SAC for which he
  seeks declassification, or more properly, unredaction contain nothing that
  remains classified. Indeed, Defendants have a duty to unredact those portions
  of the SAC that have been officially declassified. Information made available
  to the public by the President and the FBI cannot remain classified for
  purposes of Plaintiff�s SAC.
 
�Plaintiff suggests that the Court merely obtain a
  copy of the classified version of the SAC, together with classified copies of
  Plaintiff�s original and revised motion to declassify, and do a side by side
  comparison of what has been officially declassified but remains redacted in
  Plaintiff�s SAC. The Court can then easily determine what should remain
  redacted. Defendants themselves suggest such s similar such approach in their
  Opposition at 6, n. 3.
 
�In conclusion, this Court clearly has the authority
  to order declassification of information and the portions of Plaintiff�s SAC
  that remain redacted even though most of the information contained therein
  has already been officially declassified should be ordered unredacted by this
  Court. [�]�
 
July 10th,
  2008 - Defendant's
  Opposition to Plaintiff�s Revised Motion
 
�[� ] Plaintiff Doe�s motion to have the Court
  declassify certain paragraphs of the Second Amended Complaint that the
  Central Intelligence Agency (�CIA�) instructed Plaintiff to redact is
  unsupported by either law or fact. There is, in fact, no citation to any
  legal authority in support of the motion at bar. It is not for Plaintiff to
  decide whether the information in the Second Amended Complaint is classified;
  that decision is left to the Executive Branch, and courts traditionally defer
  to the Executive Branch�s determinations regarding classification.
 
�Here, release of the information at issue in the
  Second Amended Complaint has been determined to pose a risk to national
  security. The paragraphs are thus properly classified; accordingly, the Court
  should deny Plaintiff�s motion. [�]�
 
June 27th,
  2008 - Plaintiff�s
  Revised Motion to Partially Declassify Second Amended Complaint
 
�[�] Now comes Plaintiff Doe, by and through
  undersigned counsel, and moves this Honorable Court to order the immediate
  declassification of Paragraphs 15, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 29, 33, and 35
  of Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint (�SAC�) (Doc. 30). [�]�

  2008 - Minute Order
 
Minute Order granting the Joint Motion to Withdraw
  Motion to Partially Declassify Amended Complaint. Signed by Judge Gladys
  Kessler on 3/18/08.
 
March 18th, 2008 - Joint Motion to Withdraw
  Motion to Partially Declassify Amended Complaint
 
�[�] The parties hereby jointly move the Court to
  treat Plaintiff�s Motion to Partially Declassify Amended Complaint as
  withdrawn. This request is made in good faith and with good cause, as set
  forth below:
 
�1. Plaintiff filed his Motion to Partially Declassify
  Amended Complaint on March 3, 2008 [�].
 
�2. The Motion referenced the Amended Complaint and
  its paragraph numbers, however the operative complaint at this point in the
  litigation is the Second Amended Complaint. Plaintiff therefore intends to
  re-file the Motion with reference to the Second Amended Complaint and its
  paragraph numbers.
 
�4. [sic] On March 18, 2008, the parties jointly
  spoke with the Court�s clerk and informed her of Plaintiff�s intent to
  withdraw the motion and re-file a revised motion once the Central
  Intelligence Agency has an opportunity to perform its standard classification
  review. The clerk advised the parties to file a motion alerting the Court as
  to their intentions.
 
�Accordingly, the parties respectfully request that
  Plaintiff�s Motion to Partially Declassify the Amended Complaint be treated
  as withdraw. [�]�

�[�] On July 31, 2007 Defendant Pavitt was
  personally served with a copy of the Summons and Second Amended Complaint in
  the above-captioned matter. [�] Defendant Pavitt is a private citizen sued in
  his individual capacity and has 20 days to respond to a Summons and
  Complaint. To date more than 20 days have passed with no response whatsoever
  from Defendant Pavitt, either in the form of an Answer, motion to dismiss,
  motion for enlargement of time in which to respond, or even Notice of
  Appearance of Counsel. This is consistent with Defendant Pavitt�s attitude
  towards this action by refusing to execute a Rule 4, Fed.R.Civ.Proc., waiver
  of summons and evident evasion of service over a four month period. Defendant
  Pavitt is therefore in default in this action. [�]�

�B. Procedural History
 
�[�] Plaintiff filed the instant action on December
  6, 2004. On April 27, 2005, he filed an amended complaint; on November 15,
  2005, he filed a Second Amended Complaint with leave of the Court. The Second
  Amended Complaint alleges violation of the APA, 5 U.S.C. �� 706(1) &
  (2)(A) - (D); violation of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. �� 552a(e)(2) & (5);
  breach of contract pursuant to the Little Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. � 1346(a)(2);
  �failure to convert Plaintiff to staff employee�; �tortious violation of
  Plaintiffs� [sic] rights under the U.S. Constitution and amendments thereto�;
  and violation of the Federal Tort Claims Act (�FTCA�).
 
�Plaintiff seeks injunctive relief to reinstate his
  CIA employment at the GS-15 staff level and to order the CIA Director to
  undertake rule-making to promulgate regulations to ensure protection of
  Plaintiff�s rights relating to his CIA employment; restitution of back pay;
  compensatory damages and attorneys� fees as a result of the foregoing.
 
�Defendants filed the present Motion to Dismiss the
  Second Amended Complaint on December 19, 2005, which Plaintiff opposed on
  March 9, 2006 (�Pl.�s Opp�n�). Defendants filed a Reply on April 3, 2006
  (�Defs.� Reply�). [�]
 
�IV. Conclusion
 
�For the foregoing reasons, Defendants� Motion to
  Dismiss is granted in part and denied in part. The following counts remain in
  this case: Count II (Privacy Act claim) and Count V (Bivens claim). An Order
  will issue with this Memorandum Opinion. [�]�

  Plaintiff�s Motion to Attend Scheduling Conference
 
April 28th, 2005 - Amended Complaint
 
March 21st, 2005 - Defendants� Motion to Dismiss
 
�[�] Plaintiff Doe sued Defendants Porter J. Goss
  (�the Director�) and the Central Intelligence Agency (�CIA� or �the Agency�)
  (collectively �Defendants�), alleging that Defendants violated the
  Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. �� 701 et seq. (�APA�), and the
  Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. � 552a. Because the allegations in the Complaint are
  insufficient to state a claim under either statute, Defendants seek dismissal
  of the case with prejudice.
 
�Plaintiff asserts two claims under the Privacy Act.
  First, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants violated 5 U.S.C. � 552a(e)(5), by
  failing to maintain records �with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness
  as is reasonably necessary.� 5 U.S.C. � 552a(e)(5). Second, Plaintiff claims
  that Defendants violated 5 U.S.C. � 552a(e)(2), which requires the collection
  of information �to the greatest extent practicable� from the subject
  individual when the information may result in an adverse determination
  against the individual. 
 
�Both claims must fail. In order to survive a motion
  to dismiss on the accuracy claim, Plaintiff must identify specific documents
  or categories of documents which are inaccurate. Plaintiff has not done so.
  With respect to the information-collection claim, Plaintiff has not
  adequately alleged that it would have been practicable for Defendants to
  gather any more information from him than they did.
 
�Both Privacy Act claims fail because Plaintiff has
  not alleged any adverse effect from the allegedly inaccurate information or
  failure to collect information. In fact, his Complaint alleges that the
  Agency�s violations of the Privacy Act were not the cause of the adverse
  decision he claims to have suffered. In addition, both claims are, in fact,
  collateral attacks on the substance of an underlying agency decision, which
  is an improper use of the Privacy Act.
 
�Plaintiff also purports to allege a violation of
  the APA, claiming that Defendants violated certain CIA regulations which
  require the integrity of intelligence collection and reporting. Plaintiff has
  failed to adequately plead this claim because has not identified any
  regulations that has been violated, nor would he have standing to raise such
  a claim if such regulations existed. Furthermore, Plaintiff is entitled to no
  possible relief for such a claim. There is no entitlement to damages under
  the APA�only injunctive relief. As Plaintiff no longer works for the Agency,
  there is no meaningful injunctive relief that he could be granted, and he is
  unable to establish any future risk of harm. For these reasons, Plaintiff�s
  claim should be dismissed. [�]�
 
December 6th, 2004 - Complaint
 
�[�] 1. The jurisdiction of this Court is based upon
  the existence of a Federal question. Plaintiff is a citizen of the United
  States of America and a current employee of the Central Intelligence Agency.
  Defendant Goss is the Director of Central Intelligence (�DCI�). Defendant CIA
  is an agency of the United States.
 
�2. Beginning in 2001 and continuing to the present,
  Defendant Goss has injured and continues to injure Plaintiff through acts and
  omissions violating Plaintiff�s rights under the Administrative Procedures
  Act, 5 U.S.C. �� 706(1) & (2)(A) - (D). [�]
 
�11. Plaintiff is being subjected to retaliation by
  Defendants for his refusal to falsify intelligence collected by him
  [censored] [�]
 
�12. Plaintiff is a male of Near Eastern ancestry
  who joined the CIA as a contract covert Operations officer in 1982. During
  the ensuing twenty-two year period Plaintiff has conducted numerous
  successful covert operations against a variety of intelligence targets while
  serving in the CIA Directorate of Operations (�CIA/DO�). This service and his
  significant contributions resulted in his eventual approval for promotion to
  the rank of GS-15 and for receipt of the CIA Special Intelligence Medal in
  recognition of his [censored] recruitment of an [censored] penetrating a target
  country�s WMD program [censored] [�].
 
�13. In 1995 Plaintiff was advised by Defendant CIA
  that his employment had been converted from that of a contractor to a staff
  employee. Thereafter, Plaintiff received regular GS promotions, bi-weekly
  payment stubs and other related documents reflecting his current �GS� status,
  salary and benefits.
 
�14. In 1995 Plaintiff was assigned to the CIA/DO
  Counter Proliferation Division (�CIA/DO/CPD�) where his mission was to
  collect intelligence on and interdict the proliferation of WMD, [censored]
  [�] 
 
�15. At all times pertinent hereto CIA/DO/CPD served
  as the primary collection point at CIA/DO for Near Easter WMD programs,
  [censored] [�]
 
�16. While serving at CIA/DO/CPD Plaintiff recruited
  many �hard-target� human �assets,� [censored] [�]
 
�17. Plaintiff was first subjected to a demand that
  he alter his intelligence reporting in 2000, [censored] [�] Plaintiff
  reported this information via formal CIA cable channels. Plaintiff was subsequently
  advised by CIA management that his report did not support the earlier
  assessment [censored] and instructed that if he did not alter his report to
  support this assessment it would not be received well by the intelligence
  community. Plaintiff was aware that earlier reporting underlying the
  assessment was less-than-genuine and refused to alter his report. As the
  result, CIA/DO/CPD refused to disseminate his report to the intelligence
  community despite Plaintiff�s efforts.
 
�18. In 2001, Plaintiff met with a highly respected
  human asset [censored] [�] Plaintiff immediately reported this information to
  his supervisor who in-turn met with CIA/DO/CPD management. Plaintiff was
  later instructed that he should prepare no written report of the matter and that
  the Deputy Director of Operations (�DDO�) together with the Chief of
  CIA/DO/CPD would personally brief the President. Upon information and belief,
  Plaintiff avers that no such briefing ever occurred and therefore the
  President was misled by the withholding of vital intelligence. Subsequently,
  in 2002, the Chief of CIA/DO/CPD advised Plaintiff that his promotion to
  GS-15 and receipt of the Special Intelligence Medal had been approved by the
  DDO but were being withheld until Plaintiff removed himself from further
  handling of this asset.
 
�19. In 2001, Plaintiff, attempted to report
  �actionable� intelligence [censored] [�] Plaintiff reported this information
  to CIA/DO/CPD via formal cable channels. However, the CIA never disseminated
  this information in the intelligence community despite Plaintiff�s pleas to
  do so, effectively sequestering intelligence [censored] [�] Later, a
  co-worker of Plaintiff warned him that CIA management planned to �get him�
  for his role in reporting intelligence contrary to official CIA dogma
  [censored] [�]
 
�20. In 2002, Plaintiff attempted to report routine
  intelligence [censored] [�] but was thwarted by CIA superiors. Plaintiff had
  met with a human asset [censored] [�] Plaintiff reported this information to
  CIA/DO/CPD via formal cable channels. Plaintiff was subsequently approached
  by a senior [censored] [�] desk officer who insisted that Plaintiff falsify
  his reporting of the matter [censored] [�] Plaintiff refused. Subsequently,
  CIA/DO/CPD management determined that Plaintiff should remove himself from
  any further �handling� of this asset.
 
21. [Censored] [�] After Plaintiff reported this
  information via formal CIA cable channels, CIA/DO/CPD instructed Plaintiff to
  remove himself from further handling of the asset. [censored] [�]
 
�22. Subsequently, in 2003 Plaintiff learned that he
  was under a counter-intelligence (�CI�) investigation for allegedly having
  sex with a female asset, which Plaintiff did not do. In addition, Plaintiff
  was told five days after he began a new position at CIA that the position had
  been canceled because of pressure from the DDO, James Pavitt. Plaintiff also
  was told by the Chief of CIA/DO/CPD that the DDO was angry with Plaintiff
  because he believed Plaintiff was blackmailing him [censored] which Plaintiff
  did not do.
 
�23. In September, 2003 the Chief of the CIA Counter
  Intelligence Center (�CIA/CIC�) placed Plaintiff on paid administrative leave
  without explanation, barring Plaintiff from entering any CIA facilities or
  engaging in any further operations on behalf of CIA.
 
�24. During this period the DDO determined to
  withhold from Plaintiff his previously approved promotion to GS-15 and award
  of the CIA �Medal of Intelligence�.
 
�25. Some eight months later Plaintiff was contacted
  by the CIA Office of Inspector General (�CIA/OIG�), which advised him that he
  was under investigation for diverting to his own use monies provided to him
  for payment to human assets, which Plaintiff did not do. These allegations
  were made by the same CIA/DO/CPD managers who managed the operations and
  reporting [censored] in which Plaintiff had been involved as described above.
  Plaintiff subsequently cooperated with requests for detailed financial
  information from the CIA/OIG.
 
�26. During the week of July 26, 2004 Plaintiff
  again met with investigators from CIA/OIG who presented him with a list of
  financial items to explain, including one outgoing check for $30.00 that
  predated the time period of any of the CI issues. Plaintiff explained all of
  the deposits.
 
�27. On August 6, 2004 Plaintiff met with two
  representatives from CIA who presented him with a letter of termination for
  unspecified reasons, effective September 10, 2004. The letter described
  Plaintiff as a contractor whose services were no longer required. Despite his
  repeated requests, Plaintiff has never been advised of the outcome of either
  the CI or OIG investigations of his conduct.
 
�28. On information and belief, Plaintiff avers that
  both the CI and OIG investigations of him were a sham, initiated for the sole
  purpose of discrediting him and retaliating against him for questioning the
  integrity of the WMD reporting [censored] [�] and for refusing to falsify his
  intelligence reporting to support the politically mandated conclusion
  [censored] [�]
 
�29. On information and belief, Plaintiff avers that
  the termination of his employment at CIA was in further retaliation for, and
  to contrive a pretext to discredit, his refusal to falsify his intelligence
  reporting to support the politically mandated conclusion [censored] [�]�

Background
 
1) James L. Pavitt - undated - File photo from �The
  Scowcroft Group� (http://www.scowcroft.com);
 
Text of Pavitt�s r�sum�: �A Principal of The
  Scowcroft Group, James L. Pavitt draws on more than 30 years of experience in
  the Intelligence Community to provide strategic advice and risk assessments
  to clients in the financial services, defense, information technology,
  homeland security and counterterrorism fields, among others.
 
�As the Deputy Director for Operations at the
  Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), he managed more than one-third of the
  CIA�s globally deployed personnel and nearly half of the CIA�s
  multi-billion-dollar budget. His responsibilities involved unparalleled
  cooperation with leaders of the intelligence and security communities in
  capitals throughout the world. As head of America�s Clandestine Service, he
  led the CIA�s operational response to the attacks of September 11, 2001. As
  Chief of the CIA�s Counterproliferation Division, he managed and directed
  intelligence operations against sophisticated global weapons proliferation
  networks. Working closely with the Department of Energy and its National
  Laboratories, he worked to identify new technologies required to identify and
  halt the proliferation of these weapons. He spent many years abroad as a
  member of the Clandestine Service. 
 
�Mr.
  Pavitt served as Senior Intelligence Advisor to President George H.W. Bush as
  a member of the National Security Council team from 1990 to 1993. He has had
  extensive experience in assessing and representing critical national security
  issues at meetings with the President, Cabinet, Congress, U.S. policymakers,
  heads of foreign intelligence services and senior government officials around
  the globe. Early in his career, he served as a Legislative Assistant in the
  U.S. House of Representatives. He received a B.A. in History from the
  University of Missouri and was a National Defense Education Act Fellow at
  Clark University. Mr. Pavitt is a recipient of the CIA�s Distinguished
  Intelligence Medal. He is a member of Phi Beta Kappa.�

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
