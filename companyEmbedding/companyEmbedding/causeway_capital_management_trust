SEI Investments Distribution Co. (1 Freedom Valley Drive, Oaks, PA, 19456) is the distributor for the Causeway Funds. Check the background of SIDCO on FINRA's BrokerCheck.  






Investing involves risk including loss of principal. In addition to the normal risks associated with investing, international investments may involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuation in currency values, from differences in generally accepted accounting principles or from economic or political instability in other nations. Emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors as well as increased volatility and lower trading volume. Diversification does not prevent all investment losses.
To determine if a Fund is an appropriate investment for you, carefully consider the Fund's investment objectives, risk factors, charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus, which may be viewed and downloaded by clicking here or by calling 1-866-947-7000. Read it carefully before investing.
There is no guarantee that the Causeway Funds will meet their stated objectives. The Funds are available to U.S. investors only. Except for Causeway Global Absolute Return Fund, there is a 2% redemption fee on shares held less than 60 days to protect shareholders from short-term investors. If your account incurred a redemption fee, your performance will be lower than the performance quoted. If you invest through a financial intermediary, it may apply the Fund’s redemption fee or other frequent trading restrictions.
#The Causeway Funds are distributed by SEI Investments Distribution Co. (SIDCO). SIDCO is not affiliated with Causeway Capital Management LLC.

About Causeway



Causeway Capital Management LLC is an employee owned investment management firm based in Los Angeles, California, specializing in managing global, international, emerging market and absolute return equities. Our clients include corporations, pension plans, sovereign wealth funds, superannuation funds, public retirement plans, Taft-Hartley pension plans, endowments and foundations, mutual funds and other collective investment vehicles, charities, private trusts and funds, wrap fee programs, and other institutions, and are located around the world.


          Causeway’s mission is to provide our clients with superior risk-adjusted returns while maintaining a culture of responsibility and accountability. We believe that our fusion of fundamental and quantitative research gives us a global knowledge advantage, which we put to work for our clients efficiently. Our firm's value strategies employ a deeply ingrained research culture in which ideas are debated vigorously, creating an environment that fosters unconventional thinking and innovative insights. The Causeway fundamental research team has a 25-year record (including its prior firm) of continuity in its principals. This has led to stability of personnel, investment style, clients and intellectual perspective. Causeway manages approximately $49.2 billion in assets (at 3/31/17) and the firm has 82 employees, including 29 investment professionals. We invest in major equity markets across the globe, spanning the U.S., international, and emerging markets. A comprehensive research department of fundamental and quantitative analysts supports our global equity strategies, available through separate accounts and commingled vehicles and managed with a team approach by our portfolio managers.

SEI Investments Distribution Co. (1 Freedom Valley Drive, Oaks, PA, 19456) is the distributor for the Causeway Funds. Check the background of SIDCO on FINRA's BrokerCheck.  






Investing involves risk including loss of principal. In addition to the normal risks associated with investing, international investments may involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuation in currency values, from differences in generally accepted accounting principles or from economic or political instability in other nations. Emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors as well as increased volatility and lower trading volume. Diversification does not prevent all investment losses.
To determine if a Fund is an appropriate investment for you, carefully consider the Fund's investment objectives, risk factors, charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus, which may be viewed and downloaded by clicking here or by calling 1-866-947-7000. Read it carefully before investing.
There is no guarantee that the Causeway Funds will meet their stated objectives. The Funds are available to U.S. investors only. Except for Causeway Global Absolute Return Fund, there is a 2% redemption fee on shares held less than 60 days to protect shareholders from short-term investors. If your account incurred a redemption fee, your performance will be lower than the performance quoted. If you invest through a financial intermediary, it may apply the Fund’s redemption fee or other frequent trading restrictions.
#The Causeway Funds are distributed by SEI Investments Distribution Co. (SIDCO). SIDCO is not affiliated with Causeway Capital Management LLC.
