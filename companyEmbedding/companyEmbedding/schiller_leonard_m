Leonard M. Schiller

 About
For over 35 years, Leonard has devoted his career to all aspects of state and local property tax and general real estate matters, which includes not only ad valorem appeals, but an expertise in property tax exemptions, state and local property tax incentives and local government property tax finance.  Leonard has secured over $50 million in tax savings for his clients.
 
Leonard has represented owners of office buildings, shopping centers, restaurants, retail stores, hotels, manufacturing plants, distribution centers, warehousing facilities, landfills, mixed use developments, leasehold properties, nursing homes, hospitals, condominium properties, apartments and single family homes.  He has provided counsel to clients and represented them in seeking tax exemption status, and incentives, and has argued valuation and legal issues at all levels in the process.
 
Leonard’s representative client base is national in scope, litigating real estate taxation matters and developed creative legal theories in response to the valuation issues and ranges from Fortune 500 companies to local homeowners.
 
Leonard has served on the Illinois State Bar Association Committee on Property Taxation, and is an active member of the Illinois Lawyer’s Property Tax Association.  He has served as president of a multistate property management company and on the boards of several public corporations.  His professional affiliations include the American and Illinois Bar Associations.  He graduated from the University of Iowa with a Bachelor of Science degree in Political Science, and attained his Juris Doctor degree from Chicago-Kent College of Law.

How do I choose a lawyer?Consider the following: 
Comfort Level - Are you comfortable telling the lawyer personal
information? Does the lawyer seem interested in solving your problem? 
Credentials - How long has the lawyer been in practice? Has
the lawyer worked on other cases similar to yours? 
Cost - How are the lawyer's fees structured - hourly or flat
fee? Can the lawyer estimate the cost of your case? 
City - Is the lawyer's office conveniently located?
Not sure what questions to ask a lawyer?Here are a few to get you started:

How long have you been in practice?
How many cases like mine have you handled?
How often do you settle cases out of court?
What are your fees and costs?
What are the next steps?
