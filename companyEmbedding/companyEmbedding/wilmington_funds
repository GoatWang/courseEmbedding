WILMINGTON, Del., March 12, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- M&T Bank and Wilmington Trust have reorganized the MTB Group of Funds and Wilmington Funds into one fund family. The new and expanded "Wilmington Funds" offers a broader portfolio of investment choices for clients. 
Wilmington Funds (www.wilmingtonfunds.com) now boasts 25 funds and $13.8 billion in assets as of Dec. 31, 2011. The new continuum of funds offer investment depth and asset class coverage through a total of four money market funds, nine fixed income funds, three asset allocation funds, seven equity funds, a multi-manager real asset fund, and an alternatives fund. The complete list of funds is below.
"The reorganization of these two fund families creates a strategic spectrum of mutual funds designed to address a wide range of investor goals with choices ranging from money market, fixed income, equity, and asset allocation funds," said Ken Thompson, senior vice president of Asset Management. "Through the new Wilmington Funds we can provide our clients with a wide array of mutual funds to help meet their investment goals."
Wilmington Funds, advised by Wilmington Funds Management Corporation (WFMC), offers focused equity choices including: small, mid, and large cap growth, large cap value, and a multi-manager international equity fund. 
"Having worked alongside and served ultra-high-net-worth and institutional clients, we've learned something about their unique needs," said Sam Fraundorf, president of Wilmington Trust Investment Advisors, Inc. (WTIA), the primary sub-adviser to the Wilmington Funds. "This experience has enabled us to develop differentiated mutual fund solutions that provide for these needs."
Recognizing the increasing income needs of clients, Wilmington Trust broadens its taxable fixed income offerings to include short-duration corporate and government funds, and intermediate and broad market funds. 
"Given our expertise working with successful individuals and families, there is a particular focus on our municipal operation, where we offer both national municipal and state specific municipal bond funds," said Bob Truesdell, head of Wilmington Trust's Fixed Income team.
Wilmington Trust will also maintain its suite of money market offerings including U.S. Government, U.S. Treasury, prime, and tax-exempt funds.
In addition, Wilmington Funds offers a range of strategic allocation funds, a multi-manager real asset fund, and an alternatives fund that invests in a variety of hedge strategies.

RISKS:
Investing in mutual funds involves risks, including the potential loss of the initial amount invested. 
Asset allocation does not assure a profit or protect against a loss.
An investment in money market funds is neither insured nor guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.  Although money market funds seek to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investment in these funds.
All investments involve risks, including possible loss of principal.  Stock markets, especially foreign markets, are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market or economic developments.
Alternative strategies may use aggressive investment approaches, which can be riskier than those typically associated with mutual funds.  If a fund employing alternative strategies is unsuccessful, the fund and you may lose more money than if you had invested in another fund that did not invest aggressively.  Alternative strategies are subject to risks associated with sub‐advisers making trading decisions independently, investing in other investment companies, using a particular style or set of styles, basing investment decisions on historical relationships and correlations, trading frequently, using leverage, making short sales, being non‐diversified and investing in securities with low correlation to the market.  The use of leverage may magnify losses.  Alternative strategies are also subject to risks associated with investments in developed foreign markets, emerging market securities, small cap companies, debt securities, derivatives, commodity‐linked instruments, illiquid securities, asset‐backed securities and CMOs.  Please read the prospectus and summary prospectus for any fund for detailed information on risk considerations.

Single-Stock Diversification Strategies

 









Learn how to limit risk and save taxes when diversifying a concentrated stock position.

A portfolio that is top-heavy in one security poses tremendous downside risk, so it’s critical to employ diversification strategies.
These strategies can help an investor hedge, monetize, and diversify out of a concentrated equity position while deferring capital gains tax.
Each strategy has advantages and disadvantages, and selecting the right one for you should involve careful planning with your financial, tax, and legal advisors.

Many corporate executives, directors, and officers, especially those of fast-growing companies, find themselves in a quandary these days. If they own millions of shares in those companies, their net worth can be substantial. So what’s the downside?
A portfolio that is top-heavy in one security poses tremendous downside risk. How, then, can an executive diversify his or her portfolio in the most effective, tax efficient manner?
Here is a brief look at some single-stock diversification strategies to help an investor achieve three goals – to hedge, monetize, and diversify out of a concentrated equity position while deferring capital gains tax.
Collars
Collars are types of hedging strategies used to limit the price risk of a stock and permit the investor to participate in further appreciation, up to a specific price. A collar also allows an investor to monetize— that is, borrow against— a concentrated equity position.
One well-known type of collar is the zero-premium collar, or zero-cost collar. With this approach, “put options” provide protection from a price decline below a specified price, and “call options” provide appreciation potential, up to a specified price. A “put” is a contract that gives an investor the right, but not the obligation, to sell a certain number of shares at a specified price until a certain date. A “call” gives its holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy a specific number of shares of stock at a predetermined price, until a certain date.
For example, if a stock is trading at $100, an investor could simultaneously buy a put option at $90 and sell a call option at $125. The call strike price is set so that the premium received for the call option will match and, therefore, cover, the cost of the premium that the investor must pay to purchase the put option; hence the term “zero-premium collar.” The strike price is the price at which the owner of a call can buy the underlying stock or the owner of a put can sell the underlying stock.
In this scenario, if the collar were to expire, say, after three years, the investor would have a floor price of $90, while enjoying a potential price rise to $125 during a 36-month period.
Another kind of collar is the “income-producing collar.” It is similar to the zero-premium collar, except that it generates income to defray the cost of borrowing against the value of the stock. With an income-producing collar, the net premium received from the sale of a call option after covering the cost of the put option is available for payment to the investor.
Pre-paid forward sale
A pre-paid forward sale may be helpful for investors who wish to create tax-deferred liquidity from a concentrated stock position. Like collars, pre-paid forward sales involve the purchase of a put and the sale of a call. The difference, however, is that the put option is usually set at a higher level to allow for greater monetization of an equity position and, thus, to maximize liquidity.
A pre-paid forward sale is usually a privately negotiated contract with a counter-party in which an investor receives a tax-deferred, interest-free, up-front payment of up to 90 percent of the value of his or her stock, in exchange for selling forward a number of his or her shares. At maturity, the investor will have the option of settling the contract by delivering stock or cash.
Both collars and pre-paid forward sales offer many benefits. In addition to those already mentioned, investors also retain control of their shares, receive dividends, and have the possibility of deferring taxes.
Exchange funds
The goal of an exchange fund is to allow an investor to shift from a concentrated position to a diversified position without triggering capital gains tax, as would be the case if the investor simply sold shares.
An exchange fund works in a straight forward way: Investors contribute stock to a limited partnership or limited liability corporation. In return, they receive partnership units in exchange for their contributed shares, which gives them a shared ownership of all securities in the fund. To avoid registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), exchange funds are offered only to “qualified purchasers” with a net worth of at least $1 million.
Exchange funds are offered by many major brokerage firms, fund companies, money managers, and banks. Portfolio managers oversee the funds and decide what assets to hold. Hence, not all shares that are offered are accepted.
Portfolio construction is important because the manager will avoid selling contributed shares for the life of the fund in order to preserve the tax deferral. Some funds restrict withdrawals and charge withdrawal fees during the first several years. After seven years, most funds will redeem partnership units with shares of at least 10 different securities contributed to the fund. At this time, the cost basis of the contributed shares will be transferred to these securities.
Like any investment, exchange funds carry risks. Nonetheless, the risks may be outweighed by the key benefit of such funds – the ability to convert a low-basis, single-stock concentration into a well-diversified portfolio, without paying capital gains tax.
Executive Diversification and Investment Trust (EDIT)
This type of trust, also referred to as a Blind Trust, allows executives to diversify their investments through the sale of restricted stock without limiting the timing of the sales to so-called “window periods,” which would otherwise put constraints on when stock can be sold.
Window periods are imposed by publicly held companies. Windows usually begin late each quarter and end a month after a company’s earnings report has been issued. Window periods are designed to keep insiders from running afoul of securities regulations, which prohibit the trading of stock using material, non-public information about companies.
With an EDIT, an investor gives a trustee sole authority to decide on the timing of sales. All sales are made in accordance with the SEC’s Rule 144 and within the parameters of the trust, without the insider’s knowledge or participation. Hence, sales may be made at any time, even if the executive possesses material, nonpublic information about his or her company.
EDITs may be used by corporate executives and insiders, senior officers, directors, and anyone owning 10 percent or more of the company’s outstanding shares.
There are other ways to diversify concentrated holdings of stock, including variations on collars and forwards, investment swaps, and the issuance of exchangeable equity-linked notes for blocks of appreciated stock. Each strategy has advantages and disadvantages. Selecting the right one for you should involve careful planning and consultation with your financial, tax, and legal advisors.

This article is for information purposes only and is not intended as an offer, recommendation, or solicitation for the sale of any financial product or service or as a recommendation or determination that any investment strategy is suitable for a specific investor. Investors should seek financial advice regarding the suitability of any investment strategy based on the investor’s objectives, financial situation, and particular needs.  Investing involves risk, and you may incur a profit or loss. Diversification does not ensure a profit or guarantee against a loss. There is no assurance that any investment strategy will be successful.  Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Our failure to insist at any time upon strict compliance with any term of this Agreement, or any delay or failure on our part to exercise any power or right given to us in this Agreement, or a continued course of such conduct on our part shall at no time operate as a waiver of such power or right, nor shall any single or partial exercise preclude any other future exercise.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
