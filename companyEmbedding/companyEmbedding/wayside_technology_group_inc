 Q2 2017:  Revenue:$103.0 millionIncome from operations:$1.7 millionNet income:$1.3 millionDiluted earnings per share: $0.30 per share Dividend declared - $0.17 per share  EATONTOWN, N.J., July 27, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) Wayside Technology Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:WSTG) today announced financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2017.  The results will be discussed in a conference call to be held on Friday, July 28, 2017 at 10:00 a.m. EDT.  The dial-in telephone number is (844) 683-0552 and the pass code is “WSTG.”  This conference call will be webcast by NASDAQ OMX and can be accessed at Wayside Technology’s website at www.waysidetechnology.com/site/content/webcasts. “We are pleased to report solid financial results. Our Lifeboat Distribution segment continued to deliver year over year sales growth, while our TechXtend division was down as compared to an exceptionally strong quarter last year. We see opportunities for growth in the remainder of this year,” said Simon F. Nynens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  “On a year to date basis, our earnings per share are up $0.04 or 7%.”  Operating Results: Net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 decreased 2% to $103.0 million compared to $105.3 million for the same period in 2016 as growth in our Lifeboat Distribution segment was offset by a decline in TechXtend due to quarterly variability in enterprise account sales. Lifeboat Distribution segment net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 increased 7% to $95.7 million, compared to $89.7 million for the same period in 2016. TechXtend segment net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 decreased 53% to $7.3 million, compared to $15.6 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a large enterprise sale of approximately $7.0 million recorded in the second quarter of 2016 which affects the comparability of results. Sales in our TechXtend segment may vary significantly from quarter to quarter based on the timing of IT spending decisions by our larger customers. Gross profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 decreased 6% to $6.6 million compared to $7.0 million for the same period in 2016. Lifeboat Distribution segment gross profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 increased 1% to $5.6 million, compared to $5.5 million in the same period in 2016. TechXtend segment gross profit for the second quarter of 2017 decreased 34% to $1.0 million, compared to $1.5 million in 2016. Gross profit margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 decreased by 0.3 percentage points to 6.4%, compared to 6.7% for the same period in 2016. Lifeboat Distribution segment gross profit margin for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 decreased by 0.3 percentage points to 5.9%, compared to 6.2% for the same period last year. TechXtend segment gross profit margin for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 increased 3.8 percentage points to 13.1%, compared to 9.3% for the same period in 2016. Total selling, general, and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 increased 2% or $0.1 million over the same quarter last year to $4.8 million. The increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to increased employee related expenses to support our growth. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 4.7% in 2017 compared to 4.5% in 2016 as a result of the lower TechXtend sales. Net income for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 decreased 16% to $1.3 million, compared to $1.5 million during the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 decreased 12% to $0.30, compared to $0.34, for the same period in 2016.  On July 25, 2017, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.17 per share of its common stock payable August 18, 2017 to shareholders of record on August 11, 2017. For the quarter ended June 30, 2017, the Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $0.6 million. About Wayside Technology Group, Inc. Wayside Technology Group, Inc.

Q2 2017: 


 


Revenue:
$103.0 million


Income from operations:
$1.7 million


Net income:
$1.3 million


Diluted earnings per share: 
$0.30 per share


 


Dividend declared - $0.17 per share 


EATONTOWN, N.J., July  27, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Wayside Technology Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:WSTG) today announced financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2017.  The results will be discussed in a conference call to be held on Friday, July 28, 2017 at 10:00 a.m. EDT.  The dial-in telephone number is (844) 683-0552 and the pass code is "WSTG."  This conference call will be webcast by NASDAQ OMX and can be accessed at Wayside Technology's website at www.waysidetechnology.com/site/content/webcasts.
"We are pleased to report solid financial results. Our Lifeboat Distribution segment continued to deliver year over year sales growth, while our TechXtend division was down as compared to an exceptionally strong quarter last year. We see opportunities for growth in the remainder of this year," said Simon F. Nynens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  "On a year to date basis, our earnings per share are up $0.04 or 7%." 
Operating Results:
Net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 decreased 2% to $103.0 million compared to $105.3 million for the same period in 2016 as growth in our Lifeboat Distribution segment was offset by a decline in TechXtend due to quarterly variability in enterprise account sales. Lifeboat Distribution segment net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 increased 7% to $95.7 million, compared to $89.7 million for the same period in 2016. TechXtend segment net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 decreased 53% to $7.3 million, compared to $15.6 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a large enterprise sale of approximately $7.0 million recorded in the second quarter of 2016 which affects the comparability of results. Sales in our TechXtend segment may vary significantly from quarter to quarter based on the timing of IT spending decisions by our larger customers. Gross profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 decreased 6% to $6.6 million compared to $7.0 million for the same period in 2016. Lifeboat Distribution segment gross profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 increased 1% to $5.6 million, compared to $5.5 million in the same period in 2016. TechXtend segment gross profit for the second quarter of 2017 decreased 34% to $1.0 million, compared to $1.5 million in 2016.
Gross profit margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 decreased by 0.3 percentage points to 6.4%, compared to 6.7% for the same period in 2016. Lifeboat Distribution segment gross profit margin for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 decreased by 0.3 percentage points to 5.9%, compared to 6.2% for the same period last year. TechXtend segment gross profit margin for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 increased 3.8 percentage points to 13.1%, compared to 9.3% for the same period in 2016.
Total selling, general, and administrative ("SG&A") expenses for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 increased 2% or $0.1 million over the same quarter last year to $4.8 million. The increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to increased employee related expenses to support our growth. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 4.7% in 2017 compared to 4.5% in 2016 as a result of the lower TechXtend sales.
Net income for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 decreased 16% to $1.3 million, compared to $1.5 million during the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 decreased 12% to $0.30, compared to $0.34, for the same period in 2016. 
On July 25, 2017, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.17 per share of its common stock payable August 18, 2017 to shareholders of record on August 11, 2017.
For the quarter ended June 30, 2017, the Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $0.6 million.

Falling By The Wayside: A Post Mortem On Wayside Technology Group - Wayside Technology Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:WSTG) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Falling By The Wayside: A Post Mortem On Wayside Technology GroupSep. 3.15 | About: Wayside Technology (WSTG) Brian Grosso Deep ValueSummaryI made a nice profit due to my initial sale prior to the pullback and the dividend in a down market, but my analysis was over-optimistic in hindsight.The various issues with my analysis are primarily due to the same, acute thing that causes most of my errors: speed. I found the stock, researched, and wrote in.A week or two. That does not allow for much thought, reflection, or opposing perspective. Turtle's my name for a reason - it's crucial to make investment decisions SLOWLY.This article also explores WSTG in the context of my portfolio positioning and view on US equities. Ideas can't be assessed in a vacuum.Holding Narrative
I originally recommended and purchased shares of Wayside Technology Group (NASDAQ:WSTG) on February 19th of this year at $17/share, and wrote a long SA article explaining the rationale for that purchase on that date. I'd taken a ~20% position, all of which was within my Roth IRA due WSTG paying a large dividend. I sold half of the position on June 24th at a very nice annualized return as indicated by the red star in the below image because it had gone up a fair amount fairly quickly and I'd already begun questioning my assumptions at this point.

The stock has pulled back since and is up just a little bit since February on a total return basis, albeit outperforming the market by a good margin.
For several company-specific and idiosyncratic reasons, I think now is a good time for me to get out completely.
Too Aggressive on Margin and Multiple
Looking back, I was too aggressive on several of the most important assumptions that drove my valuation. Here's the original valuation calculation:


For one, I didn't use a probability tree. I acknowledge in the article that the valuation represents a bullish scenario, which implies that worse things can happen, but I didn't explicitly state or quantify those 'worse things' or include them in my valuation. In other words, I tacitly said that the above represented the best thing that could happen but then also argued that that is what I expected to happen, rather than averaging out multiple future realities as the logically sound who cannot predict the future (good, human investors) do. This really just represents development on my part. I'm still young and figuring out how I want to think about value.
I've got a 3.5% EBITDA margin there, even though the business had averaged under 3% in the 10 years prior, the number had been declining for 3 years, and was at ~2.5% on a trailing basis at the time:

My rationale for margin improvement was rather weak - reversion to the mean and the company getting larger and scaling fixed costs like public company costs.
I assumed a 9x EV/EBIT multiple. Assuming a 35% tax rate and no debt, this equates to a 13.8x PE. While this seems reasonable for a decent business considering it is a good bit below market, it assumed pretty significant improvement from what the stock was at then - 5.71x. Since then I've become much more wary of assuming large multiple expansions. It's just not very conservative because market perception is market perception and multiples are kind of out of my control. Do I want to get all the projections right and still earn a lousy return because the market continues to be less optimistic about a company than I am? Relying on multiple expansions for the bulk of returns is not dependable and does not give you as much control over outcomes in terms of your analysis. So I've toned that down as well to a weighted 8x. The updated valuation is below. Some of the other assumptions will be further covered later on.


Unfair Comparison
A key component of my thesis was that margins should improve and EV/EBIT multiple increase because WSTG's peers were earning higher margins and valued higher. That's a fair argument if they're fair comps, but I'm not sure they are. To see, I did some research on Ingram Micro (NYSE:IM), WSTG's largest peer, and, incidentally, a company that heavily recruits at my college. I came across an excellent article on Value Investors Club. Wayside is a distributor and reseller, primarily of software. Ingram Micro also distributes technology products, but distributes more hardware than software and this is only one of its business segments. This is problematic for two reasons.
For one, the primary bear argument on the distribution/VAR industry is that it will be disintermediated by the cloud. However, some basic thought indicates that not all distributors/VARs will be impacted equally. More companies will download programs via the internet or access the program via the cloud with the actual program running centrally, but these end users will still need hardware locally, if not quite as new or powerful. I interned over the summer at a large bank and as part of the onboarding process had to get set up with the technology I'd be using. I was given a computer, keyboard, several monitors, etc. I also had to download a lot of software. Some, like Microsoft Office, was downloaded after I gained access via the company's technology marketplace. However most others were never downloaded. I gained access to the program through the marketplace, but then just accessed it using a user interface in the browser. In other words, most of the software was already in the cloud, proprietary or not. I think software will be hit much harder and quicker and that means WSTG will be hit harder and quicker than its peers.

Second, IM's consolidated margins don't reflect the margins it is earning on its distributor/VAR activities, since it does much more than that:

Expansion Into Faster Growth/Higher Margin Services: Ingram Micro has recently been expanding into new business that are higher margin and faster growing than its core technology solutions businesses (technology services a 1.4% margin business growing at 2 - 5% annually):


In fact, the core distributor/VAR business seems to be earning the lowest margins of the bunch at 1.4% EBIT margin as stated by the author. Incidentally, that's a good chunk lower than what WSTG is earning now. Put simply, the comparison in my original analysis was not apples to apples and that enabled some misplaced optimism.
Misidentification
In my original article I got a little wrapped up in the technology expertise component of WSTG's business and said things like: "Distributors like Wayside get all of the benefits of these secular tailwinds without the typical product development/obsolescence risks."
It is important to remember that WSTG is NOT a technology company though. It's primary business activities are sales and customer service. I should have realized this when, in my first article, I detailed the story about CEO Simon Nynens and the bell he had installed at the company to ensure incoming calls were answered promptly. It was drilled in again though in the 2Q call when EVP Bill Botti said:
So Phoenix being the largest call center city in the country, I believe with many, many major corporations here, the opportunity for talent is much larger. So we already have people in the office working.
Call centers are a big part of WSTG and that just doesn't strike me as a terribly high quality business. I can read all about a business and what it's grown at and earned on invested capital, but no matter what, my appraisal of the quality of the business is driven in large part by the few things I anchor on as being core to the business model. In the case of WSTG, I anchored on technology - what they're moving, instead of call centers - what they're doing, and that resulted in a misappraisal.

Not A Serious Response to Cloud
I just read this article, titled "Where's the Value Going to Be in Value Added Resellers?" It is about the declining value proposition of VARs and what must be done to stay relevant. Below is an excerpt:
Hayes, whose father was a turnaround CEO, tells me that his team came to this stark conclusion in 2009. "It wasn't that hard to see. Our clients were telling us we'd be out of business in 18 months if we didn't add more value". Hayes took the initiative and began to dramatically re-shape the company. The team realized that in order to add value, they needed a different staff profile and mix. They moved from 2:1 engineering to sales ratio to a 5:1 ratio today.
The radical shift toward expertise and away from sales makes sense. The actual distribution of product is easier now and adding expertise/reducing sales allows VARs to engage customers in a more mutually beneficial manner. We've not seen this kind of dramatic response to the secular changes at WSTG. Yes, the company is more a distributor than a VAR, but again, it's all channel, and I don't think the response should be much different. WSTG has invested in virtual distribution, but this hasn't gotten much attention on conference calls so unless management is being modest it doesn't seem overly significant. And the company is actually increasing the size of its salesforce with the new teams and Arizona office.
Tactical Asset Allocation
The biggest factor impacting my decision to consider closing my WSTG position is actually not company-specific. It has to do with my desire to position myself to capitalize when better opportunities in the US market appear. As I said in my article "A Time to Act Fearful," I think now is a good time to be heavy on cash and maintain very high absolute criteria on individual ideas. In my PA, I could use some more cash, and I'm not sure WSTG still fits that very high criteria. Should I really be 10% in something that I now only think will deliver a 45% return over 3 years with risk of some capital impairment, when my goal at the outset is 25%/yr returns and minimal/no impairment potential? And at a time when I want to have plenty of cash? I think the answer is no.

To hold or not to hold
Ultimately I think that WSTG is still a good idea that I expect to deliver above market returns over the next few years, but I was over-optimistic at the outset. As is so often the case for me because of the way my brain is wired, time has given me the chance to develop a more objective, System 2 understanding of the company and idea. That, and a more conservative view on US equities and the way I want to be positioned, result in my decision to close my position. Hopefully this is an interesting lesson on the mental biases impacting initial research, viewing investment ideas in the context of opportunity costs and the portfolio they sit in, and WSTG itself.
