In this post, we’ll break it down in a simple comparison of apples to oranges, or, rather, Dropbox to Thinspace. In the end, the choice comes down to needs. Personal or business, your needs will determine which type of cloud computing provider is the best fit.The technology that many are familiar with and even utilize today is Dropbox. While Dropbox is considered a part of cloud technology, there are key differences in its features and functionality that separate it from other cloud technology providers, such as Thinspace.Dropbox is a simple, widely-used, easy-to-master cloud technology. Dropbox has one main service offering – data storage in the cloud. For the small business, non-profit or solo entrepreneur or individual, Dropbox is the ideal provider as it works equally well on PCs and Macs, Android and iOS. Features like no limits in terms of file size restrictions, 2GB of free data storage upfront, combined with the ability to earn additional storage and more robust data plans starting at just $10/month make Dropbox an easy and cost-effective data storage solution.For these data- and feature-light users, Dropbox is everything they want and need. But what happens when your business grows in employees and locations? What happens when your technology needs grow beyond your current provider’s services? The answer: You look for a provider that can accommodate your business’ current AND future needs, which are destined to evolve as your business evolves.In order for businesses to continue growing and competing effectively in the market, it’s important to move beyond free storage and find opportunities to scale your operations through improvements in technology. Consider a provider that does not require high upfront costs of purchasing and installing hardware across the business, only to require upgrades a year later. Cloud computing is an area of the market that is generally affordable and effective at servicing these necessary evils (i.e. improvements).Thinspace’s unique product and service offering is designed to allow small and medium sized customers to select what they need now such as end-to-end desktop delivery from anywhere (TSConsole), or the ability for IT managers to operate from a centralized management platform and deploy applications to users instantly and seamless from anywhere (TSConsole). Customers always have option to add-on more expansive services as they grow or reduce services as their needs change.To recap, cloud technology providers such as Dropbox, while limited in their offering, make for perfect cloud partners for data and feature light users. Growing small and medium-sized enterprises could better benefit from cloud computing providers like Thinspace that offer affordable, reliable and scalable solutions that can grow with the business.Publicly traded under the ticker symbol THNS, Thinspace is the ultimate provider reliable, scalable and affordable application delivery, virtualization, and cloud client technology to public and private sector companies and organizations of all sizes.

OneGate Secure Enterprise Application Gateway | Thinspace | Application Delivery, Desktop Virtualization, and Cloud Client Technology  SupportEmail Us(214) 306-9670      Simplified Control for ITThe Thinspace OneGate solution has an intuitive, easy to use web interface with graphical dashboard allowing administrators to deploy, configure and monitor the OneGate server from any web browser. Administrators can login using high-security, certificate based authentication providing an extra level of security.OneGate Web PortalUsers login to a customized Web Portal which displays the applications available to them along with admin messages, OneGate client status, endpoint security result and change password options. Administrators can now customize the OneGate web portal directly from the management console.OneGate Access ClientsThinspace OneGate supports Windows, Mac OS X and Linux platforms. Users can access OneGate either through a Web Portal (Java) or locally installed Desktop Client. The Thinspace HTML5 RDP Client enables browser based access to SkyDesk and RDP applications. Today, organizations of all sizes face the pressure to be able to deliver applications and data to ever increasing numbers of mobile workers. Whether this is home users, roaming users, customers or even business partners the need for a Remote Access solution that is easy to use and yet secure is the key requirement; this is where Thinspace OneGate (SSL VPN) can help.Organizations which are looking at secure remote access will often engage with current VPN solutions, whether IPsec or SSL VPN, which rely on layer 2 VPNs to provide seamless access to applications. This creates a security hole in perimeter security deployed at the corporate network level and opens up the network to unknown vulnerabilities generated from unmanaged desktop machines. It should be noted that the requirement is to deliver the application and network services to end-users rather than necessarily bridging unknown endpoints to corporate networks at untrusted locations.  FeaturesWeb ManagementSkyDeskEndPoint SecurityWhat's NewFeaturesSPAN TechnologyThinspace SPAN (Secure Private Application Network) technology enables a completely secure access method over any kind of network and devices. With SPAN technology, Thinspace OneGate can make applications available without bridging client device’s network with the corporate network. Other VPN solutions require a network adaptor with virtual IP Address for full functioning of client-server applications. SPAN technology has the following salient features:Secure remote access without creating unsecured holes in the network’s perimeter security.Makes application access possible without a virtual adaptor or routing changes on endpoint machine.Hide complete network information obfuscation. User can never find the actual IP address of hostname of the internal servers.Administrator can control each application available over VPN rather than opening up the whole network/subnets.Secure AuthenticationThinspace OneGate uses standards-based SSL/TLS Security. Users can be authenticated by methods such as Active Directory, LDAP, and RADIUS or local database. Fully integrated client-certificate based two factor authentication with automatic certificate provisioning is in built in to OneGate. Configurable Authentication and Authorization servers mean that users can login using multiple methods and still have resources assigned by group or role.Access Your ApplicationsAccess all of your Applications, including all TCP and UDP applications such as HTTP/S and FTP based apps, RDP, Email, Windows File sharing and Propalms TSE and VDI. Even custom or proprietary applications and protocols are supported by Thinspace OneGate. In-built application templates help administrator create standard applications as well as define additional parameters.Hardened Propalms OSThe OneGate application runs on Thinspace OS 4 which is a security hardened, enterprise class Linux Distribution derived from CentOS. Propalms OS hosts the required services for running Propalms OneGate and is maintained by Thinspace Development Team.OneGate Application LauncherThe OneGate Application launcher is a simple user interface for users to launch their applications when logging in through the OneGate desktop client. After login, the Application Launcher is shown to the user with the list of applications the user has access to. The following applications can be displayed:Thinspace SkyDesk ApplicationsVirtual Desktops from Thinspace SkyDirect VDI.Web Applications.Remote Desktop Connections including “My Desktop and Files”.Remote Meeting.Site to Site AccessThinspace OneGate provides a unique Site-to-Site access feature where it is possible to chain Thinspace OneGate servers and access applications across sites. Other VPN solutions either provide IPsec based site to site or their SSL based Site-to-Site is layer 2 tunnel which suffer from poor performance because of too much packet loss. (Read “TCP-over-TCP” meltdown).Simplified Control for ITThe Thinspace OneGate solution has an intuitive, easy to use web interface with graphical dashboard allowing administrators to deploy, configure and monitor the OneGate server from any web browser. Administrators can login using high-security, certificate based authentication providing an extra level of security. Administrators can perform tasks such as:Specify authentication services (native, LDAP, Active Directory, RADIUS, ProID).Create applications rules for remote access.(App templates included)Create user and application groups for defining access to applications.Control device access using endpoint policies and zones.Enable high availability.Configure remote meeting and view live sessions.Specify time-based access restrictions.View reports and manage current sessions plus much more…Web PortalUsers login to a customized Web Portal which displays the applications available to them along with admin messages, OneGate client status, endpoint security result and change password options. Administrators can now customize the OneGate web portal directly from the management console. It is possible to upload a custom logo and company name and set login and welcome messages to be displayed on OneGate web portal.32-bit & 64-bit VersionsThe OneGate ISO based on CentOS is available for both 32bit as well as 64bit hardware platforms. The ISO for 32bit hardware can be installed on 64bit hardware. With support for 64bit platform a large amount of RAM and CPU power can be made available to OneGate server for scalable deployments.iPad and Android SupportThinspace OneGate provides access to business applications and desktops from iPad and Android based tablet devices. The Thinspace Universal Client available from the Apple App Store and Android Market allows access to both SkyDesk and  SkyDirect VDI applications via OneGate.OneGate Portal – Kiosk ModeKiosk mode allows users to access certain applications without requiring any client software. Thinspace OneGate web portal delivers a set of Java applications enabling access to:Remote Desktop Connnections.FTP Applications.VNC Applications.File Share.SSH/TELNET Applications.Thinspace SkyDirect/SkyDesk.Citrix Web/ICA.My Desktop and Files.Remote Meeting.Thinspace SkyDesk IntegrationThinspace OneGate works in conjunction with Thinspace SkyDesk solution to deliver a highly efficient application delivery solution to enterprises. Thinspace SkyDesk provides presentation virtualization and OneGate provides secure remote access. Thinspace OneGate enables single sign-on, Web Portal & Desktop integration features for Thinspace SkyDesk enabled applications.Thinspace VDI IntegrationThinspace OneGate integrates with Thinspace VDI to deliver a seamless access mode to VDI managed virtual desktops. OneGate administrator can publish the Thinspace VDI setup for roaming users by simply creating an application with a target as the Thinspace VDI connection broker. Thinspace OneGate talks to the Thinspace VDI connection broker and publishes users allocated virtual desktop on Thinspace OneGate portal.My Desktop and FilesMy Desktop and Files feature provides direct access to your office PC and file shares via Thinspace OneGate. Administrator can create a My Desktop and Files application type and upload a list of usernames along with their desktop hostnames/IP addresses/fileshares to be made available to them when they log in to OneGate.Remote MeetingsThe remote meetings feature offers authorized OneGate users the ability to perform remote web meetings for the purpose or sharing presentations, text chat, file transfer or just use as a Helpdesk facility. Remote meeting feature is available in both OneGate Portal and OneGate Desktop Client. A user can select “give support” to connect to another OneGate user. User can select “get support” to request support from another OneGate user.Online License ServiceThinspace Online licensing portal allowing customers to login and manage their licenses and activate them. Activation can also be performed directly from the OneGate management console further simplifying the whole licensing process.DeploymentInstall OneGate in minutes using a simple, integrated installer or save even more time by downloading the Thinspace OneGate Virtual Appliance and import it directly into your VMware infrastructure or your other chosen virtualization platforms.Client AccessPropalms VPN supports Windows, Mac OS X and Linux platforms. Users can access OneGate either through a Web Portal (Java) or locally installed Desktop Client.EndPoint SecurityEnforces access restrictions based on customizable policies such as Anti-virus, Anti-spyware and firewall status ensuring devices are ‘safe’ for connection to the network. IP and Mac address restrictions can also be enforced.Web Management The Thinspace OneGate solution has an intuitive, easy to use web interface with graphical dashboard allowing administrators to deploy, configure and monitor the OneGate server from any web browser. Administrators can login using high-security, certificate based authentication providing an extra level of security. The Web Management console is organized into a navigation tree which is logically grouped into the following management sections:VPN STATUS – Displays real-time information about the OneGate server.ACCESS MANAGEMENT – Provides User, Group and Authentication configuration options.ENDPOINT MANAGEMENT – Configure Endpoint Security control and enforcement.RESOURCES – Miscellaneous settings for use with other admin tasks.HOST CONFIGURATION – Server specific settings and configuration.HOST MAINTENANCE – OneGate backup, upgrade and licensing options.MONITORING & REPORTING – Reports on User, Admin and Endpoint activities.HIGH AVAILABILITY – OneGate Clustering Options.REMOTE MEETINGS – OneGate Remote Meeting and Support Configuration.  Throughout the console, administrators can use the in-line help feature to assist them with their configuration.Common administration tasks would consist of:Creating/Adding Users (native, LDAP, Active Directory)Creating User and Application Groups for defining access to applications.Controlling device access using Endpoint Policies and Zones.Specifying time-based access restrictions to applications and resources.Viewing Reports and managing current user sessions. SkyDesk SkyDesk Integration Thinspace OneGate seamlessly integrates with Thinspace SkyDesk allowing secure remote access to SkyDesk applications through the gateway. OneGate can be used as a replacement for the Single Port Relay service that is built into SkyDesk allowing greater scalability, security and stability.Once a user logs into OneGate, if SkyDesk access has been assigned to them by OneGate Administrator then they are authenticated to SkyDesk using their OneGate credentials and seamlessly delivered access to their authorized SkyDesk applications. This single sign-on feature creates an intuitive user experience where the user only has to enter their domain credentials once and can immediately access the applications that he/she has been assigned. How this is presented to the user is dependent on the method of access:OneGate Web PortalThinspace OneGate Web Portal is a browser based access mode. Users simply browse to https://OneGate_FQDN and enter their domain credentials. These credentials will be used to sign you in to SkyDesk also. When logging in through the OneGate Web Portal with SkyDesk application assigned, the user will see an extra tab on the portal named SkyDesk Applications. This page will display the TSE applications that have been published to this user from the SkyDesk Management Console. If the OneGate and SkyDesk client software is not installed or a newer version is available then this is downloaded on demand.Thinspace Universal ClientThinspace Universal Client provides access to applications and windows desktops from your iPad/iPhone or Android tablet device whether you are in the office, at home or mobile. The universal client connects to Thinspace OneGate and SkyDesk/SkyDirect VDI solutions enabling Bring Your Own Device services by offering the ability for the users to access business applications such as Microsoft Office from their tablet device or smartphone.OneGate Desktop ClientThinspace OneGate Desktop Client has a built-in application launcher to enhance the user experience for access to SkyDesk Applications. Users can simply launch the client and login using their domain credentials. Rather than users having to open a seperate web browser once connected to access their SkyDesk apps, the OneGate desktop client presents their published SkyDesk applications in a user friendly Application Launcher window on the desktop. EndPoint SecurityThe primary driving factor for wide adoption of SSL VPNs is ubiquitous secure access from any device without any pre-requisites. However this opens up a new challenge for organizations as unknown and unmanaged devices including potentially harmful devices can connect to the corporate network. Moreover compliance becomes a challenge as it becomes impossible to enforce corporate policies to end users. Next generation SSL VPNs like Thinspace OneGate bring strong device profiling features that measure and calibrate each endpoint connecting to VPN against the corporate policies.Thinspace OneGate provides a flexible policy framework for administrators to keep the corporate network safe from unclean devices by either keeping such devices out of network, restricting them to a part of network or remediate them to be able to access network services.As part of device profiling, Thinspace OneGate can check for status of endpoint security software like antivirus, firewall and anti-spyware, OS and software updates and compliance to endpoint configurations. An intelligent cache wiper can clean the files and cache stored on the local hard disk by browsers or by users, whether residing in temporary folders or any of the drives.Although SSL VPNs provide broader access capability which clearly enhances productivity, it also inherently widens network exposure to uncontrolled environments.For Example: If a remote client machine is infected with virus/worms/Trojans/spy-wares, this un-wanted traffic is also sent to private network over secured connection. To effectively control these risks, it is no longer enough to manage access by user identity alone. The safety of the user’s endpoint environment must also be ensured by enforcing access policies based upon solid endpoint security.Thinspace OneGate Administrators can create 3 types of product policies:AntivirusAntispywareFirewallThus ensuring the most recent versions are installed and active on the user’s device before they can connect to the network. Further to this, Administrator’s can create Endpoint Zones which override Application Groups limiting access to applications based on the result of the user’s device profile from the Endpoint scan. For example, a ‘Quarantine’ Zone can be set to provide minimal access for non-compliant devices connecting to OneGate.OneGate access can be further secured by enforcing MAC address and IP address policies on the gateway. The administrator can define a list of allowed or blocked addresses that are checked when the device scan occurs.What's NewNew User InterfacePropalms OneGate comes with a brand new user interface. This interface is both modern and light on the web browser.Auto-Launch ApplicationsAdministrator can select applications to start automatically (only applications which supports portal based access) when end user logs in.New Access ControlsIn previous versions of VPN, access controls were only based on application groups – Allowing application group access to user groups. OneGate’s new improved access control management interface will allow creating access controls with added access control methods. Newly added methods are Device ID and EndPoint Connectivity based controls.Desktop Client – Alternate GatewaysOneGate client can access multiple gateways and will automatically connect to alternate gateways if primary gateway is not available.Desktop Client – User PreferencesIn the latest OneGate Desktop Client users can change a number of preferences such as start on logon, app auto-launch on/off, alternate gateway setup etc…Multiple Domain ConfigurationOneGate administrators can now configure multiple VPN Domains for user authentication. Admins can specify different authentication systems in these domains and enable/disable endpoint security. If multiple VPN domains are configured on OneGate server then at the time of login a new option will be shown to choose VPN domain in desktop client and web portal.SMS Gateway Integration for PassphraseAdministrator can configure SMS gateway details in OneGate server so that users can get their passphrase via SMS during successful user creation or if administrator resets the passphrase. Administrator can also modify the contents of SMSNTLM Application SSOAdministrator can enable single sign on for NTLM enabled web based applications, for e.g. MS OWA, SharePoint. This option is available only for web based applications. SSO options are available when you add specific web based applications in the console.NTP Support ImprovedAdministrator can start or stop NTP server, verify status and check for last update time from this page.

Our technology enables IT and service providers to manage and deploy secure application and desktop delivery solutions providing users instant access to applications on any device, over any network or cloud.  What is Cloud Computing?     Cloud computing, in a nutshell, is a form of accessing and saving programs or data to a pool of shared computing resources, e.g. the Internet (the ‘cloud’) and/or private networks. Popular examples include Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services and Apple iCloud.   An important aspect of cloud computing is the ability for users to access the same data from multiple devices (i.e. broad network access). Using Google as an example, people and businesses can access Google Drive from desktops, laptop, tablets, smartphones and other mobile devices. Essentially, other Google services can be placed in the same category as cloud computing, such as Google Voice and Gmail. One of the great advantages of cloud computing for businesses and people, alike, is the reassurance of knowing that if you do lose a device or it crashes, the cloud computing provider you’ve selected has this information and/or application stored – and hopefully, safely and securely – and can bring it back to your device of choice. The catch is that you must have everything you wanted to salvage saved onto the cloud. Thinspace’s cloud computing software skySpace, skyPoint, skyDesk, skyGate and other products allows our enterprise customers and users the ability to access their desktop and applications such as mail, files, programs, etc. securely from anywhere in the world at anytime – easily, efficiently and cost-effectively. Thinspace’s cloud computing and application delivery solutions are crucial for IT departments operating in multi-country and multi-office businesses and organizations. Users can easily access a document or program located on their desktop from anywhere in the world, and use multiple devices to get to it.        http://www.thinspace.com/skyspace/   skySpace is a solution suite from Thinspace comprising of hardware endpoint devices and management software that has been engineered to work together for the delivery of centralized desktops and applications. skySpace has been designed to offer organizations a simple, effective and affordable end-to-end desktop solution eliminating the complexity of dealing with multiple vendors and complex solutions.    skySpace brings together the concept of delivering virtual desktops using either VDI or RDS technology to our managed endpoints providing a centralized single vendor platform for all your desktop computing needs.   Benefits Zero Configuration Endpoint – centralize your desktops, eliminating endpoint complexity, moving all management into the data center Complete – one system from one Vendor providing everything you need for state-of-the-art virtual desktops Secure – zero client store-nothing architecture ensures that data leaks can never occur Productive – deploy and control everything through skyController, improving IT productivity, eliminating troubleshooting visits and downtime Green – energy efficient, eco-friendly thin clients used in place of PC hardware benefiting both the Organization and the environment.          How Cloud Computing Can Help Your Business     When it comes to cloud computing, how much of it is beneficial to your business when compared to hardware and software programs? The answer is – all of it! Here is how Thinspace and other cloud computing providers can help your business.   SAVES ALL OF YOUR DATA With cloud computing, the “oh no” moment of data not being saved or recent edits not being seen is quickly resolved – because the issue never exists! Not only does cloud computing prevent loss of data, but also it allows multiple users to update data universally – ensuring businesses and their employees have the most up-to-date documentation when and where needed. UNLIMITED STORAGE Another big benefit of cloud computing and how it can help your business is the fact that you have access to as much storage as you ever want or need –  without having to scramble around at the last minute to purchase additional storage. With digital data playing an increasingly large role in the world today, it’s important for businesses to save their data – all of it – and have access to centrally located data storage when and where you need it. PROVIDES 24/7 ACCESS Cloud computing, unlike, hardware such as a PC, allows you and your employees to save data and access it anywhere in the world. Moreover, specialty providers like Thinspace can even deliver your corporate desktop to a tablet or mobile device – anywhere in the world – at anytime. Thinspace users, typically dispersed across a customers’ multiple office locations, have 24/7 access to their data and desktop – and even a friendly support team on hand if they have issues. SAVES TIME AND MONEY Purchasing and installing the same program, application and/or updates on numerous, even thousands of employee PCs can cost a business a significant amount of money and their IT department or manager, an even more larger amount of time. Rather than cut into your business’ bottom line, we suggest selecting a cloud computing provider that is not only affordable, but also effective in quickly and seamlessly installing and deploying programs, updates and applications to employees without requiring huge cash and time investments. Thinspace’s enterprise customers have said goodbye to the age-old practice of purchasing expensive hardware to upgrade old PCs, and hello to the future of desktop virtualization and cloud computing. By opting for our more reliable, effective and cost-efficient solution, Thinspace not only saves customers and their IT departments valuable TIME and MONEY, but also helps their business and employees operate in a more efficient, organized manner, and from any device – anywhere in the world.    Our Customers Thinspace has partnered with thousands of customers worldwide. From small businesses to global enterprises, our customers are spread across every industry.         Thinspace Partners    USA / CANADA     Thinspace USA 5535 S.
