Investment Strategies




Since inception, Siguler Guff has managed over $15 billion of investor commitments, of which over $3 billion have been in separate accounts and other advisory activities.
 








Distressed, Special Situations and Specialty Finance










Distressed Opportunities Funds




Investor Commitments: $5.3 billion 



Siguler Guff’s Distressed Opportunities Funds are diversified portfolios that invest in the securities and other interests of companies, structures or assets undergoing financial distress, operating difficulties or restructuring. The portfolios use an active management, broad-based approach and include corporate debt and equity, structured credit, real estate, other special situations and niche opportunities, as well as secondary investments. The Firm takes a dynamic approach, looking across geographies, asset classes and strategies to tactically allocate capital to investments appropriate to the market opportunity and cycle. Siguler Guff actively reevaluates market conditions to target market inefficiencies and dislocations in value which are inherently limited in time. The strategy is implemented through a variety of fund structures, separate accounts, joint ventures, secondary transactions, and direct investments / co-investments.
 













Trade Finance Opportunities Fund




Investor Commitments: $263 million 



Through the Distressed Opportunities Funds, Siguler Guff identified a unique opportunity to take advantage of the disconnect between mandatory new capital charges for trade finance assets and low expected losses. Siguler Guff’s Trade Finance Opportunities Fund seeks to structure and enter into separate accounts or joint ventures with operating partners to negotiate investments primarily in trade finance regulatory capital relief transactions and to own, hold, sell or otherwise dispose of such investments.
 













Secondary Opportunities Fund




Investor Commitments: $337 million 



Siguler Guff has been investing in the secondary market since 2010 through its distressed investment platform. The Firm focuses on special situations/credit-focused secondary market opportunities including purchasing interests in funds managed by traditional distressed managers and out-of-favor managers/fallen angels, side pocket liquidations, and value and yield-oriented strategies.
 





 

 



Real Estate








Investor Commitments: $1.8 billion 



Siguler Guff’s Distressed Real Estate Opportunities Funds are diversified portfolios that invest in various types of real property interests, including equity interests in commercial property, commercial mortgages and commercial mortgage-backed securities, and the debt and equity securities of real estate operating companies and real estate investment trusts. The portfolios target high quality properties, primarily in the U.S. and Europe, which have deteriorated in value due to high levels of vacancy and deferred maintenance issues resulting from overleveraged capital structures. Siguler Guff employs a value-oriented, cycle-aware and structure-agnostic strategy to target the evolving opportunity in the current cycle. The Firm seeks to create a program with access to a broad universe of value opportunities at lower fees and with better governance than the traditional opportunity fund or fund-of-fund models, through greater control and alignment of managers.
Siguler Guff’s real estate experience dates back to 1993 when the Firm, in partnership with a leading small business lender, formed Business Mortgage Investors, Inc. in the wake of the Savings and Loan Crisis to purchase performing small business mortgages from the Resolution Trust Company and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

 



 

 



Small Business








Investor Commitments: $1.7 billion 



Siguler Guff’s Small Buyout Opportunities Funds are diversified portfolios that invest in small buyout funds (funds capitalized with less than $250 million) and small-lower middle market companies (companies with $3-$15 million of EBITDA) which are difficult for many investors to access. The program targets specialized, small, yet well-established, companies that are typically family-owned, founder-owned and/or owner-operated. Siguler Guff believes that the small and lower middle market offers inefficiencies and a variety of appealing characteristics, including substantial deal flow, less competitive transactions, lower purchase multiples, low leverage and significant value creation potential. To effectively and efficiently target this segment of the market, Siguler Guff works with small buyout fund managers as both a limited partner and a co-investment partner. The Firm seeks to partner with managers who have reliably demonstrated the ability to acquire high-quality companies at purchase price and leverage multiples below prevailing market multiples, stemming from their ability to source robust deal flow and exert a disciplined investment style.

 



 

 



Emerging Markets










BRIC Opportunities Funds and Emerging Markets Separate Accounts




Investor Commitments: $2.6 billion 



Siguler Guff’s BRIC Opportunities Funds are diversified portfolios that selectively invest in the rapidly growing economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China, and other emerging markets with attractive private equity characteristics. The Firm targets small and medium-sized businesses that benefit from the expanding middle class, growth of local industries and growth in per capita GDP of these emerging economies. Siguler Guff partners with local teams who are capable of sourcing attractively priced, high-growth companies in non-competitive processes and who focus on fast growing Tier II and Tier III cities and regions.
 













Russia Partners Funds




Investor Commitments:  $1.3 billion 



Operating since 1991, Russia Partners is a leading private equity investor in Russia and the countries of the former Soviet Union. Russia Partners has managed six private equity funds and more than 65 investments. The core investment strategy of Russia Partners is to make direct equity and equity-related investments in fast-growing medium-sized companies operating in industries that meet the developing demands of the region’s rapidly growing and maturing middle class. Russia Partners’ founding partners have worked together for over 20 years, investing in the region through numerous economic cycles, including the economic crises of 1998 and 2008.
 













RP Tech




Investor Commitments: $93 million 



RP Tech was established in 2011 to make direct equity and equity-related investments in high-growth businesses in areas related to technology and innovation in Russia and the countries of the former Soviet Union, as well as in companies that are implementing global technologies and processes throughout this region. Notable investments made by RP Tech include GlobalLogic, a full-lifecycle product development services leader, Viagogo, a leading European online ticket marketplace, Mirantis, a leading pure-play OpenStack software company, and RetailNext, the worldwide market leader for in-store retail analytics.

Separate Accounts








Investor Commitments: $2.8 billion 



Siguler Guff recognizes the need for certain clients to maintain a unique degree of focus and diversification within their private equity portfolios, and consequently works with select clients to provide customized solutions through separate accounts. The Firm currently manages separate accounts with aggregate investor commitments of approximately $2.8 billion on behalf of clients such as public and corporate pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, unions, endowments, foundations and superannuation funds.
Siguler Guff began managing its first separate account in 1993 and has prudently increased the number of separate accounts that it manages over time. These portfolios include a range of investment strategies such as buyouts, growth capital, distressed and special situations, venture capital, mezzanine, real estate, and secondary investments that invest globally across North America, Europe, and the emerging markets. Siguler Guff’s separate account mandates typically include direct investments / co-investments as well as underlying fund investments and leverage resources across the Firm to manage customized portfolios for investors.
As an advisor, Siguler Guff evaluates the global private equity market, assesses the best investment opportunities in the market at any given point in time and provides specific advice on sectors of particular interest to its clients. Siguler Guff provides extensive due diligence and a comprehensive evaluation of fund managers and direct investments / co-investments in these sectors. The Firm manages all transactions (investor capital calls and distributions) and provides consolidated, customized client reports and portfolio analysis. Siguler Guff also advocates on behalf of its clients through advisory board participation and active management of underlying investments.
 



 

 



Advisory Activities and Other Strategies










Venture Lending & Leasing




Investor Commitments: $374 million 



Venture Lending & Leasing was formed as a joint venture between Siguler Guff Advisers and Western Technology Investments in 1994. Siguler Guff served as a co-adviser to the first three Venture Lending & Leasing funds. Starting with Venture Lending & Leasing IV, Siguler Guff's role transitioned to that of a special limited partner.
The Venture Lending & Leasing funds were organized to provide asset-backed financing to carefully selected venture capital-backed companies in the form of secured loans and equipment leases and in exchange for current coupon payments and equity warrants. Loans to each company range from $1 million to $25 million, with warrant coverage of 7% to 12% of the loan amount. Venture Lending & Leasing provides an alternative, carefully structured layer of financing that complements venture capital equity. 
 













Siguler Guff Capital Partners




Investor Commitments: $265 million 



Established in 1999, Siguler Guff Capital Partners is a unique program in which Siguler Guff co-invests with investors in top-quality, best of breed private equity funds, both domestically and internationally, across a range of opportunities including buyouts, venture capital, distressed, mezzanine financing, and special situations/turnarounds. The Firm identifies, evaluates, and accesses these unique private equity opportunities and allows each investor in the Siguler Guff Capital Partners program to decide on a case-by-case basis whether to participate. In most cases, access to these top-tier private equity firms and investment minimums would otherwise be prohibitive to smaller investors.
 













WMAM Funds




Investor Commitments: $529 million 



In April 2009, Siguler Guff became the investment adviser to the WMAM funds, a portfolio of four multi-manager funds and one direct investment fund that were part of a joint venture between BNY Mellon and WestLB.

 The prolonged low interest rate environment has created enormous pressure to take greater risk in order to achieve higher returns and meet actuarial return targets. A fiduciary can most responsibly achieve target returns through active asset management and investing with strong, experienced partners.
  —   George Siguler, Managing Director & Founding Partner 



 A high rate of disposable income, increasing 4G and broadband penetration, and an educational system that produces over 50,000 graduates with technical degrees each year, make Russia strongly positioned to become one of the largest and most dynamic consumer Internet markets in the world.
 — Drew Guff, Managing Director & Founding Partner 



 Historically, the high returns in the buyout business have come from investments that were made during a recession or in the early stages of economic recovery.
 —  George Siguler, Managing Director & Founding Partner 



 In the coming years, emerging markets will continue to play a major role in global economic power and private consumption shifts. The private equity asset class in emerging markets continues to show strong returns and better downside protection compared to public markets. The recent discorrelation presents an interesting entry point for experienced investors looking to increase their emerging markets exposure in an attractive pricing and currency environment.
 — Ralph Jaeger, Managing Director 



 In both the U.S. and Europe, the hangover effects from over-indulgence in the prior economic cycle – risk aversion and low conviction – are leaving pockets of inefficiency and opportunity in today's market. This circumstance is particularly pronounced in Europe, where the Euro crisis of 2012 is still fresh and the disposition of non-performing loans and bad assets from the boom era is in full swing. In both markets, a value investor in commercial real estate has to be selective, but the opportunity remains to uncover good quality assets at a low basis by taking advantage of financially distressed situations.
 — James Corl, Managing Director 



 Siguler Guff takes a highly opportunistic approach to distressed investing and tactically allocates capital across assets and strategies. In a market of waning and waxing conviction, we continue to believe in a strategy of high selectivity and patience for investors with longer-term outlooks.
 — James Gereghty, Managing Director 



 Small buyout funds target a portion of the U.S. economy that is similar in aggregate size to the middle market, generating approximately $4.6 trillion of total annual revenue and employing 22 million people. However, only $26 billion of capital was raised by small buyout funds in 2013 to target a universe of 177,000 small companies. When compared to the middle market, this represents nearly ten times as many target companies but only a small fraction of the capital raised. We believe these compelling supply-demand characteristics make the small buyout market significantly more attractive than any other segment of the buyout space. (Sources: The Market that Moves America by GE Capital and The Ohio State University, 2011; Pitchbook, 2H 2014 PE and VC Fundraising and Capital Overhang Report)
 — Kevin Kester, Managing Director 



 We chose Siguler Guff as our partner due to their unparalleled experience investing in the region and long history of venture investing in the U.S.
 — Arkadiy Dobkin, Co-Founder, CEO & President of EPAM Systems 



 In our experience, small buyouts have remained inefficient and difficult for large investors to access. Providing capital to facilitate the transition of family-owned and owner-operated companies is private equity investing at its best.
 — Kevin Kester, Managing Director

 The prolonged low interest rate environment has created enormous pressure to take greater risk in order to achieve higher returns and meet actuarial return targets. A fiduciary can most responsibly achieve target returns through active asset management and investing with strong, experienced partners.
  —   George Siguler, Managing Director & Founding Partner 



 A high rate of disposable income, increasing 4G and broadband penetration, and an educational system that produces over 50,000 graduates with technical degrees each year, make Russia strongly positioned to become one of the largest and most dynamic consumer Internet markets in the world.
 — Drew Guff, Managing Director & Founding Partner 



 Historically, the high returns in the buyout business have come from investments that were made during a recession or in the early stages of economic recovery.
 —  George Siguler, Managing Director & Founding Partner 



 In the coming years, emerging markets will continue to play a major role in global economic power and private consumption shifts. The private equity asset class in emerging markets continues to show strong returns and better downside protection compared to public markets. The recent discorrelation presents an interesting entry point for experienced investors looking to increase their emerging markets exposure in an attractive pricing and currency environment.
 — Ralph Jaeger, Managing Director 



 In both the U.S. and Europe, the hangover effects from over-indulgence in the prior economic cycle – risk aversion and low conviction – are leaving pockets of inefficiency and opportunity in today's market. This circumstance is particularly pronounced in Europe, where the Euro crisis of 2012 is still fresh and the disposition of non-performing loans and bad assets from the boom era is in full swing. In both markets, a value investor in commercial real estate has to be selective, but the opportunity remains to uncover good quality assets at a low basis by taking advantage of financially distressed situations.
 — James Corl, Managing Director 



 Siguler Guff takes a highly opportunistic approach to distressed investing and tactically allocates capital across assets and strategies. In a market of waning and waxing conviction, we continue to believe in a strategy of high selectivity and patience for investors with longer-term outlooks.
 — James Gereghty, Managing Director 



 Small buyout funds target a portion of the U.S. economy that is similar in aggregate size to the middle market, generating approximately $4.6 trillion of total annual revenue and employing 22 million people. However, only $26 billion of capital was raised by small buyout funds in 2013 to target a universe of 177,000 small companies. When compared to the middle market, this represents nearly ten times as many target companies but only a small fraction of the capital raised. We believe these compelling supply-demand characteristics make the small buyout market significantly more attractive than any other segment of the buyout space. (Sources: The Market that Moves America by GE Capital and The Ohio State University, 2011; Pitchbook, 2H 2014 PE and VC Fundraising and Capital Overhang Report)
 — Kevin Kester, Managing Director 



 We chose Siguler Guff as our partner due to their unparalleled experience investing in the region and long history of venture investing in the U.S.
 — Arkadiy Dobkin, Co-Founder, CEO & President of EPAM Systems 



 In our experience, small buyouts have remained inefficient and difficult for large investors to access. Providing capital to facilitate the transition of family-owned and owner-operated companies is private equity investing at its best.
 — Kevin Kester, Managing Director
