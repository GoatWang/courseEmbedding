Why Ghost- the cult '90s slip dress label- is making a very stylish comeback

Why Ghost- the cult '90s slip dress label- is making a very stylish comeback












































































Ghost's latest collection














Sometimes, a brand taps so well into the mood of a moment, that when that moment is over- well, so is the brand. In the 1990s, Ghost was the off-duty uniform of it-girls. Founder by Tanya Sarne in 1984, the idea was to have ghost-designers working underneath Sarne to create an easy-to-wear, feminine brand. And it worked. During fashion week shows in New York, LA and London, all the supermodels - everyone from Kate Moss to Naomi Campbell - walked the Ghost show.
“As a student at Central Saint Martins in the ‘90s, I lived in my full length bias cut dress, flung on with Adidas Gazelles”, says fashion stylist Charlie Harrington. “It was a throw on at 7am get back at 1am kind of dress; anything was possible. It was never flashy, easy to wear; Ghost tapped into a no-logo generation”.

These were clothes for everyone, from fashion students and editors through to mothers of the bride. Widely flattering, near-impossible to crease, this was easy, elegant occasionwear that didn’t take itself too seriously. “The sample sale preview was one of the hottest tickets of the year,” remembers stylist Arabella Greenhill. “Everyone had something from Ghost in their wardrobe - and many a 90’s bride, bridesmaid and wedding guest wore Ghost.”

Which was, perhaps, the beginning of the end. As Ghost began to be seen as a bridal staple, it lost its fashionable edge. In 2004, Ghost had 11 boutiques, 8 perfumes, and plans to expand into swimwear and denim - by 2006, Sarne had left the brand. Ghost soon disappeared from the Fashion Week schedule, and was bought from administration by millionaire investor Touker Suleyman (owner of Hawes & Curtis) in 2008. Since then, Ghost has been quietly making sales, positioned in the bridal section of John Lewis.
Not that they haven’t been trying, of course. In 2009, there was a collaboration British design-duo Modernist; in 2012, a ‘reinvention’ that introduced a custom dyeing service (like Dulux for Dresses); in 2014, the brand launched an exclusive capsule collection at Urban Outfitters. Three years ago, Sameera Azeem came on board as fashion director - and it looks as though this time, Ghost has got it right - sales on Ghost’s website alone are up 95% in 2017 compared to 2014.





How to shop the most stylish looks on Instagram






In the last three years, the brand has gone from one UK shop to 4, as well as now being stocked in 32 bridal shops in the UK, and sold online at Harvey Nichols and Selfridges (though you can still find them as John Lewis). “Following on from the huge runway negligee trend, Ghost - famous for its original bias cut slip dresses - is back” says Heather Gramston, womenswear buying manager at Selfridges, who started stocking the label in April. According to global fashion search platform Lyst, searches for the label hit an all-time high this year, up 31% from last year. Brides to be have always searched for the longer gowns, but still-rising searches for Ghost blouses (up 43%) and more casual mid-length dresses (up 37%) suggest that customer demand for the brand is shifting away from bridalwear, and towards everyday dressing. The bridesmaid dresses have always sold well - but only know is the ready-to-wear collection that Sarne was known for coming back into its own.

Certainly, catwalk reiterations of slip dresses and bias cuts at Calvin Klein and Prada must certainly have boosted Ghost’s appeal. But the second - and perhaps most effective - prong in this attack is the brand’s growing number of instagram ambassadors. In the 1990s, the models were the ones designers fought to dress, but with more and more brands choosing the new breed of fashion ‘influencers’ to promote their brands, instagram has become a vital tool in reaching a new audience - and getting them to buy your clothes. 253000 followers saw Lucy Williams, author of fashionmenow.co.uk, in Ghost’s lemon yellow slip dress, 92000, banker-turned-blogger Hedvig Sagfjord Opshaug of the-northernlight.com in the ruffled lilac shift.

Whether or not you’re one of the growing number of women using instagram to window shop, Ghost’s appeal is clear. Instagram’s wellness-focused fashion stars might seem a new direction after the party-mad supers of the ‘90s, but at the crux of it all, here is a brand that really knows how to cut a dress.

S&P SmallCap 600 Dividend Dogs Hail Barnes & Noble As Top Gainer For July | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»S&P SmallCap 600 Dividend Dogs Hail Barnes & Noble As Top Gainer For JulyJul. 18, 2017  8:16 PM ET|| Includes: AHH, ARI, BKS, CBL, CMO, CNSL, DIN, FSP, GHL, GOV, KRG, PEI, RPT, SBRA, TLRDby: Fredrik ArnoldFredrik Arnold Dividend investing, Growth, momentum, research analystMarketplaceThe Dividend Dog CatcherSummary"The S&P SmallCap 600 measures the small-cap segment of the U.S. equity market. The index [tracks] companies that meet specific inclusion criteria to ensure they are liquid and financially viable."Top ten broker target-estimated July net gains ranged 20.66%-56% topped by BKS as of 7/10/17. I screened the master S&P 600 list to exclude firms with net returns under -6%.50 Top S&P SmallCap 600 index stocks ranged in estimated yield from 3.43% to 12.85%. Top ten, PEI, SBRA, CNSL, CMO, BKS, GHL, DIN, GOV, ARI, & CBL averaged 8.99%.S&P SmallCap 600 index top ten firms by broker target price upsides, CBL, FSP, SBRA, AHH, RPT, PEI, TLRD, KRG, DIN, & BKS averaged 26.98%.$5k invested in the lowest-priced five July top-yield S&P SmallCap 600 dividend dog stocks showed 12.8% more net-gain than from $5k invested in all ten.  Small Dogs topped the July S&P SmallCap 600.

 Actionable Conclusions (1-10): Broker Analysts Predicted 20.66% To 56% Net Gains For Ten By July 2018 Five of the ten top yield S&P SmallCap 600 dividend dogs were verified as being among the top ten of twenty gainers for the coming year based on analyst 1-year target prices. (They are tinted gray in the chart above). So, this yield-based forecast for S&P SmallCap 600 dogs was graded by Wall St. wizards was 50% accurate. Ten probable profit-generating trades were revealed in YCharts for July 2018: Barnes & Noble (BKS) was projected to net $560.42, based on dividends, plus a mean target price estimate from four analysts, less broker fees. The Beta number showed this estimate subject to volatility 137% more than the market as a whole. DineEquity (DIN) was projected to net $530.21, based on a median target estimate from six analysts, plus dividends, less broker fees. The Beta number showed this estimate subject to volatility 58% less than the market as a whole.
 Kite Realty Group Trust (KRG) was projected to net $379.45, based on a median target price estimate from eleven analysts, plus dividends, less broker fees. The Beta number showed this estimate subject to volatility 45% less than the market as a whole. Tailored Brands (TLRD) was projected to net $355.24, based on dividends, plus a mean target price estimate from five analysts, less broker fees. The Beta number showed this estimate subject to volatility 83% more than the market as a whole. Pennsylvania Real Estate (PEI) was projected to net $300.28, based on target price estimates from seven analysts, plus annual dividend, less broker fees. The Beta number showed this estimate subject to volatility 23% more than the market as a whole. Ramco-Gershenson (RPT) was projected to net $270.78, based on dividends, plus median target price estimates from eleven analysts, less broker fees. The Beta number showed this estimate subject to volatility 30% less than the market as a whole. CBL & Associates (CBL) was projected to net $247.88, based on dividends, plus a mean target price estimate from sixteen analysts, less broker fees. The Beta number showed this estimate subject to volatility 16% more than the market as a whole. Armada Hoffler Properties (AHH) netted $218.02 based on a median target price estimate from six analysts, plus dividends, less broker fees. The Beta number showed this estimate subject to volatility 46% less than the market as a whole. Sabra Health Care REIT (SBRA) was projected to net $217.63 based on dividends, plus a median target estimate from twelve brokers, less broker fees. The Beta number showed this estimate subject to volatility 10% more than the market as a whole.  Franklin Street Props (FSP) was projected to net $206.64, based on a median target price estimate from four analysts, plus the estimated annual dividend, less broker fees. The Beta number showed this estimate subject to volatility 30% less than the market as a whole. The average net gain in dividend and price was estimated at 32.87% on $10k invested as $1k in each of these ten dogs. This gain estimate was subject to average volatility 4% above the market as a whole.
 

 The Dividend Dogs Rule Stocks earned the "dog" moniker by exhibiting three traits: (1) paying reliable, repeating dividends, (2) their prices fell to where (3) yield (dividend/price) grew higher than their peers. Thus, the highest yielding stocks in any collection became known as "dogs." More precisely, these are, in fact, best called, "underdogs". 50 Top S&P SmallCap 600 Dividend Dogs By Yield 

 Actionable Conclusions (11-20): 10 Top S&P SmallCap 600 Dividend Stocks By Yield For July Top ten S&P SMallCap 600 stocks selected 7/10/17 by yield represented four of eleven Morningstar sectors. Top yielding stock, CBL & Associates (CBL) [1] was the first of six real estate sector representatives in the top ten.  The five remaining real estate sector firms placed second, third, seventh, ninth and tenth, Apollo Commercial Real Estate (ARI) [2], Government Properties IT (GOV) [3], Capstead Mortgage (CMO) [7], Sabra Health Care REIT (SBRA) [9], and Pennsylvania Real Estate (PEI) [10]. Two consumer cyclical representatives placed fourth, and sixth: DineEquity (DIN) [4], and Barnes & Noble (BKS) [6]. A lone financial services outfit placed fifth, Greenhill & Co (GHL) [5], and a single communication services firm placed eighth, Consolidated Communications Holdings (CNSL) [8], to complete the S&P SmallCap 600 top ten for July.  Actionable Conclusions: (21-30) Top Ten S&P SmallCap 600 Dogs Showed 13.9% To 49.65% Upsides To July, 2018; (31) Most Downside From One of Two Losers Was -3.03%. 
 

 To quantify top dog rankings, analyst mean price target estimates provide a "market sentiment" gauge of upside potential. Added to the simple high-yield "dog" metrics, analyst mean price target estimates provided another tool to dig out bargains. Actionable Conclusions: Wall St. Analysts Calculated (32) A 15.03% Median Target Price Upside And (33) A 20.61% Net Gain From 20 S&P SmallCap 600 Upside Dogs Come July, 2018 S&P SmallCap 600 top twenty stocks were graphed below to show relative strengths by dividend and price as of July 10, 2017, and those projected by analyst mean price target estimates to the same date in 2018. 

 A hypothetical $1,000 investment in each equity was divided by the current share price to find the number of shares purchased. The shares number was then multiplied by projected annual per share dividend amounts to find the dividend return. Thereafter, the analyst mean target price gauged the stock price upsides and net gains including dividends, less broker fees, as of 2018. Historic prices and actual dividends paid from $10,000 invested as $1k in each of the stocks and the aggregate single share prices of those ten stocks created data points for 2017. Projections based on estimated dividend amounts from $1,000 invested in the ten stocks and aggregate 1-year analyst target share prices from Yahoo Finance created the 2018 data points green for price and blue for dividend.
 YChart analysts' median 1-year targets projected a 11.5% lower dividend from $10k invested as $1k in ten dogs in this group while aggregate single share price for those ten was projected to increase by 15% in the coming year.  The number of analysts contributing to the target price estimate for each stock was noted in the next to the last column on the charts. Three to nine analysts was optimal for a valid projection estimate. Estimates provided by one analyst were generally not applied (n/a). A beta (risk) ranking for each stock was provided in the far right column of the above chart. A beta of 1 meant the stock's price would move with the market. Less than 1 showed lower than market movement. Higher than 1 showed greater than market movement. A negative beta number indicated the degree of a stock's movement opposite of market direction. Analysts Forecast A 12.8% Advantage For 5 Highest Yield, Lowest Priced S&P SmallCap 600 Dividend Stocks To July 2018 Ten top S&P 600 SMallCap dividend dogs were culled by yield for their monthly update. Yield (dividend / price) results verified by YCharts did the ranking. 

 As noted above, top ten S&P SmallCap 600 dividend dogs selected 7/10/17 showing the highest dividend yields represented four of eleven in the Morningstar sector scheme. Actionable Conclusions: Analysts Projected (34) 5 Lowest-Priced of the Top Ten Highest-Yield S&P SmallCap 600 Dogs Fetch 26.5% Vs. (35) 23.49% Net Gains by All Ten by July, 2018 


 $5000 invested as $1k in each of the five lowest-priced stocks in the top ten Dividend S&P SmallCap 600 kennel by yield were predicted to make 12.8% more gain than $5,000 invested as $.5k in all ten. The very lowest priced S&P SmallCap 600 top yield dog, Barnes & Noble (BKS), was projected to deliver the best net gain of 56.04%. 

 The five lowest-priced top yield S&P SmallCap 600 dividend dogs for July 10 were: Barnes & Noble (BKS); CBL & Associates (CBL); Capstead Mortgage (CMO); Pennsylvania Real Estate (PEI); Government Properties Investment Trust (GOV), with prices ranging from $7.00 to $18.48. Five higher-priced S&P SmallCap 600 dividend dogs for July 10 were: Apollo Commercial Real Estate (ARI); Greenhill & Co (GHL); Consolidated Comms Hldgs (CNSL); Sabra Health Care REIT (SBRA); DineEquity (DIN), whose prices ranged from $18.29 to $42.82. The distinction between five low-priced dividend dogs and the general field of ten reflected Michael B. O'Higgins' "basic method" for beating the Dow. The scale of projected gains based on analyst targets added a unique element of "market sentiment" gauging upside potential. It provided a here-and-now equivalent of waiting a year to find out what might happen in the market. Caution is advised, since analysts are historically only 20% to 80% accurate on the direction of change and just 0% to 20% accurate on the degree of change.

In today’s society, most 16-year-olds are buying their first car, working their first job or adjusting to high school, but in 1864, 16-year-old Thomas Harding Sr. was awarded the Medal of Honor.Born in Connecticut, Harding was buried in Laramie in 1911.However, for more than a century, his simple gravestone in Greenhill Cemetery sat bereft of any indication the valorous commendation he earned in service to his country.On Friday, veterans from around Laramie set about ensuring Harding would now be remembered for his selfless acts during the Civil War by placing a marker on his gravesite and performing a ceremony honoring his deeds.“Mr. Harding was a Union Navy Sailor in the American Civil War, who received the U.S. military’s highest decoration — the Medal of Honor — for attempting to save a officer from drowning,” American Legion Post No. 14 member E.J. McDonald said. “It’s never too late to honor courage.”After the boiler on a nearby ship exploded June 9, 1864, off the North Carolina coast, McDonald said Harding and other crew members of the U.S.S. Dacotah used a small boat to try to retrieve some of the destroyed ship’s cargo and personnel.“The small boat started to take on water and sink,” he said. “Captain of the Forecastle Harding tried to help acting Master’s Mate Jarvis G. Farrar, who could not swim, but was unsuccessful and Farrar drowned.”In the attempt, McDonald said Harding remarked, “If we are swamped, sir, I shall carry you to the beach or I will never go there myself.”Although Harding failed to keep his promise, McDonald said his official award citation states he made desperate attempts to save the officer “while others thought only of themselves.”Harding was awarded the Medal of Honor six months later.An obituary in the Laramie Republican states Harding was a lamplighter for the Union Pacific Railroad in Cheyenne when he died in 1911.McDonald said the American Legion Post No. 14 was notified of Harding’s story in late 2016 by the Medal of Honor Historical Society of the United States.The society is a nonprofit organization dedicated to researching, preserving and documenting the individuals who have been awarded the Medal of Honor.“At the time, I was a member of the (American Legion Post No. 14 Board of Trustees), and I kind of just took over the event,” McDonald said. “It took some time to research the group that informed us and dig up what we could about Harding.”

Once McDonald validated the society’s information and found Harding’s grave, he said he went to the other veterans groups in town for help putting together the ceremony.“I think most of the ceremonies outside of the day-to-day stuff is a collaborative effort among the veteran community,” he said. “Things like this are really important.”After visiting Montgomery-Stryker Funeral Home to order the Medal of Honor marker now accompanying Harding’s grave, McDonald said he was struck by John Montgomery’s generosity.“When I asked him how much the bill was, he said, ‘Don’t even worry about it. It’s just the right thing to do,’” McDonald said.With the grave marked, he said the site will be honored with a flag and a token each Memorial Day.“Veterans here are proud,” said Karl Lankford, a Vietnam War veteran and Albany County resident. “Being a part of this is an honor for all the veterans in the community.”

Dad's Army creator Jimmy Perry left £1.9million



Split between his wife and mistress
Dad’s Army creator Jimmy Perry split his fortune between his wife and his long-term mistress, it has been revealed.
The writer, who died aged 93 in October, left £1.3million to his wife of 63 years, Gilda.

However, he also gave his long-term mistress, Mary Husband, £50,000.

Perry wed in 1953, but started a relationship with Husband after meeting her at the BBC. She was a costume designer, who worked on Perry's other shows, including Ain’t Half Hot Mum and Hi-de-Hi! and You Rang M’Lord? .

While he shared a £400,000 family home with his wife in Northamptonshire, he spent many of his later years living with Husband in her West London home, the Daily Mail reports today. It was there where he died after a long battle with dementia.
He also left £495,000 to eight other relatives and friends, including a £250,000 flat in Hertfordshire to his former BBC colleague Jane Greenhill.

        EDITORIALLY SPEAKING: Bell tower fitting tribute
    


Muskogee Phoenix Editorial Board

10 hrs ago



















































Construction of a bell tower at Greenhill Cemetery would be a fitting tribute to two whose stories are woven into the fabric of the cemetery.Two families have donated nearly $30,000 toward the design of a bell tower.Regina Martin donated $17,500 for the project, which her late husband had begun before his death.Vernon Martin was the longtime cemetery superintendent.Perfect Petals, which is owned by Martin’s sister-in-law, donated $300.Cody Curl and his family donated $12,000 in remembrance of Francine Frost.
Frost went missing in 1981 from Tulsa and was found dead two years later south of Muskogee.Frost’s unidentified remains were buried in 1983 at Greenhill Cemetery.





Martin is said to have played a big role in locating Frost’s unmarked grave when she was exhumed in 2015 for further examination and identification.“That donation by the Curl family just shows how much Vernon was appreciated for his efforts in locating the grave of Francine Frost,” Assistant City Manager Mike Stewart said. “This bell tower is a tribute to that and how much he cared for this cemetery.”The bell tower will be a fitting tribute to Vernon Martin’s dedication to the cemetery and how much he cared for people such as Francine Frost.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
