Categories of Genetic Testing









Genetics is the science of heredity. 
The field of genetics studies how different traits are passed down in a family. These traits define how you look, the types of diseases you may be prone to, and what types of medications will work best for you. These traits are typically passed down through a family, which is why you tend to look more like your relatives than someone you aren’t related to. It’s also why some diseases, like type 2 diabetes, certain types of cancer, or heart disease tend to run in families.

Everything in genetics starts out with your deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA. DNA is a long string of four different molecules called nucleotides: adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine. Each of the four nucleotides is referred to as a single letter code: A, C, G, or T. The sequence, or order, of these nucleotides along the length of the DNA determines who you are – biologically speaking.

If you pick two people randomly from the population, the majority of their DNA sequence will be exactly the same. Two different people share around 99.9% of their DNA sequence. But, those differences that we have are important – they are what distinguish you from other people. They are what cause some of us to have brown eyes and others to have blue eyes, some to have curly hair, straight hair, or no hair at all (as we get older). Some of these differences can increase or decrease our risk for certain diseases. Others can affect how we respond to different medications. These differences in the sequence of our DNA from one person to another are called variants, and they are the basis of our genetic health and ancestry information.

How it Works

Your health care provider authorizes you for ActX.
You receive an email with a link that allows you to enroll in the Actionable Genetics Service.
After enrollment, you will receive a saliva sample collection kit at your home address. 
You will need to spit a small amount of saliva into a tube and then mail it to our CLIA-certified laboratory for your DNA to be analyzed. 
The service will be activated and you and your physician will be able to see your genetic profile. 
Your genetic profile is accessible 24/7 via the  IOS or Android mobile app, as well as the ActX patient portal

You acknowledge that use of the Service results in interstate data transmissions. 
19. Assignment; Change in Control

Health System benefits

Provide system wide precision medicine
Improve prescription efficacy and reduce adverse drug reactions
Individualize prevention
Major differentiator to attract new patients

ActX offers painless integration and is actionable for clinicians.

Painless Integration
Rapid Implementation:Our solution can be implemented system wide in weeks rather than years. 
Flexibility:The ActX software platform includes comprehensive content that can be customized to meet the needs of your institution.
Genetic Data:Easily import existing or new genetic data or optionally use ActX's inexpensive micro-array.
Minimal Computing Resources:Light technical footprint with no internal storage requirements and minimum processing requirements.
End to End Encryption:HIPAA compliant with sophisticated authentication and auditing.

Actionable for Clinicians
Workflow Friendly:Prescription orders are automatically checked against the patient’s genetics providing real time alerts about efficacy and adverse reactions. Serious non-medication actionable alerts go to the normal clinical inbox. The patient chart includes an easily accessible and up to date genomic profile.  
Up to Date Clinical Decisions:The ActX knowledge base is continually updated based on the latest published evidence and industry recommendations so your clinicians can provide individualized care without being an expert in genetics.  
 Actionable Genomic Decision Support:Our genomic decision support focuses only on actionable conditions based on published evidence.
Comprehensive Genomic Coverage:




Avoid the challenges of trying to internally develop a system
Some health systems consider integrating genomics into their EHR via an internally developed project. While internal projects can demonstrate the potential of genomic decision support, they face serious challenges at scale.  The reason is that there is typically no place to store large sets of genetic data in the EHR, and existing EHR decision support rule systems do not adapt well to the complexity of genomics.  These two factors lead to a very limited internal genomic decision support implementations that are difficult to maintain, even in organizations with substantial technical and genetic capabilities.  Examples of challenges include:

Writing, maintaining, and testing hundreds of logically complex alerts 
Storing and analyzing patient genetic data sets which can be as large as 6M variants per patient
Performance and computer resource issues
Human capital costs: An internal project requires many hours from team members and consultants including IT personnel, project managers, physicians, geneticists, pharmD’s, etc.
Scalability: New alerts or changes to existing alerts need to be developed continuously as our knowledge advances. Computer resources can be strained as the genetic data on file grows and complex algorithms execute. 
The ActX platform is a turnkey, highly scalable solution that can help your organization overcome these challenges and get genomic decision support to the bedside in a matter of weeks.

19:58 EDT 25th July 2017 | BioPortfolio











      Founded in 2012, ActX helps physicians make better decisions about 
      medical treatment, using a patientâs genetic information to guide 
      therapy. Integrated into a physicianâs normal software tools (the 
      electronic medical record) and workflow, ActX analyzes the patientâs 
      genetic information in real time and, for example, alerts the physician 
      if a medication is unlikely to be effective or will cause side effects. 
      ActX can also warn the physician about serious, actionable medical 
      risks. For more information about ActX and taking the next step towards 
      precision medicine, visit us at www.actx.com,

SEATTLE, Jan. 4, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- ActX has partnered with CompuGroup Medical US (CGM), global provider of healthcare software solutions. Based on this partnership, ActX will integrate real-time genomic decision support tools into CGM's Electronic Health Record (EHR) solutions — CGM webEHR™ and CGM CLINICAL™. The integration means that healthcare providers using CGM's EHR solutions will benefit from real-time genomics based checking of prescriptions for efficacy, adverse reactions and dosing. Providers will be alerted about actionable non-medication patient genetic risks. A full genomic profile will also be built in the patient's chart.


ActX's innovative solution makes the incorporation of genomic decision support into normal provider EHR workflow a reality for CGM's customers, ushering in a new era of precision medicine. Based on affordable patient DNA testing, as prescriptions are written, the ActX Service reviews each prescription for possible adverse reactions, dosing and efficacy issues using the patient's genetics, alerting the prescriber if there is a problem. The ActX Service also alerts providers when serious, actionable non-medication genomic risks are found, such as an actionable hereditary cancer risk. 
"We are excited to make precision medicine a reality for users of CGM's EHR solutions," says Andrew Ury M.D., ActX CEO. "CGM is a global market leader in EHR software and services, and we're proud to be offering genomic decision support to the company's physician customer base, within their normal workflow."
"CompuGroup Medical US prides itself on innovation and our comprehensive portfolio of solutions is designed to help our customers provide the best patient care. We are excited that our partnership with ActX places us in the position to support the delivery of precision medicine at the point of care," says Werner Rodorff, Chief Executive Officer, CGM US. 
About ActX:ActX helps physicians make better decisions about medical treatment, using a patient's genetic information to guide therapy. Integrated into a physician's EHR and workflow, ActX analyzes the patient's genetic information in real time. Learn more at www.ActX.com,. 
About CompuGroup Medical US:CompuGroup Medical US is the US division of CompuGroup Medical AG – one of the leading eHealth companies in the world.

Analysts Predict 10% Upside For The Holdings of ACTX

Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the Guru Activist Index ETF (Symbol: ACTX), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $16.82 per unit.      With ACTX trading at a recent price near $15.25 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.28% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of ACTX's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Herbalife Ltd. (Symbol: HLF), Nuance Communications Inc (Symbol: NUAN), and Agrium, Inc. (Symbol: AGU). Although HLF has traded at a recent price of $71.16/share, the average analyst target is 20.85% higher at $86.00/share. Similarly, NUAN has 16.22% upside from the recent share price of $18.50 if the average analyst target price of $21.50/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting AGU to reach a target price of $107.00/share, which is 14.56% above the recent price of $93.40. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of HLF, NUAN, and AGU:       Combined, HLF, NUAN, and AGU represent 6.27% of the Guru Activist Index ETF. Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:     Name Symbol Recent Price Avg. Analyst 12-Mo. Target % Upside to Target    Guru Activist Index ETF   ACTX   $15.25   $16.82   10.28%    Herbalife Ltd. HLF $71.16 $86.00 20.85%   Nuance Communications Inc NUAN $18.50 $21.50 16.22%   Agrium, Inc. AGU $93.40 $107.00 14.56%      Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.   10 ETFs With Most Upside To Analyst Targets »
