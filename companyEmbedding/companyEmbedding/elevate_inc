Introductions








Strong businesses are built on solid relationships. While there are many different ways that people go about building strong relationships, they all begin with the introduction. Who you meet is often considered the most important aspect of success, as far as business relationships are concerned, but it is also whether you are being introduced to the right communities and networks.

5 Marketing Ideas for Wedding Photographers

During a time when anyone with a camera (which is everyone) considers themselves a photographer, it can be hard to set yourself apart as a professional. Additionally, if you’re an independent event photographer, you have a lot of work to do besides the photography itself. One of the hardest things is learning how to market yourself so that you have a steady stream of good customers. Here are some ideas to keep your business booming:
   
1: Social Media Promotions
Now, it should be a given that any photographer looking to grow their business uses social media to showcase their work. This is especially true for social media networks that are visually-motivated, like Instagram and Pinterest. However, using social media effectively to grow is about more than having a profile and posting now and then. Here are some ideas: 
Make sure you have a google business page, since this is really important for organic search results. The best way to build this page is by getting reviews from your clients.
Offer a giveaway or a major discount to your followers, but be smart about it. Getting new clients who are only interested in the discount and would never hire you for full price isn’t actually worth your time. The best way to use this approach is to offer two-for-one deals to existing clients, or referral bonuses to motivate your current clients to talk to their friends.
   
2: Branded USB Drives
It’s common practice today to give a flash drive with all of the photos that you take at an event because we’re able to take a LOT of photos with our digital resources. Instead of just using a generic USB drive, next time think about using one that has your branding on it. This reminds them of the experience of hiring you as a photographer whenever they’re happily reminiscing with the fantastic photos that you captured! This kind of effect can increase return customers and referrals.
   
3: Invite Helpers
Whenever you’re doing a job at an event, invite others to help with small jobs (like holding the reflector) and give them small items of branded swag as a thank you. This helps people to watch the process up close, and get an idea of your expertise. It also gives them familiarity and a relationship that they’ll remember next time they need a photographer. This technique can be especially handy for weddings, when your best future clients are other wedding guests and people from the wedding party.
   
4: Feature Your Work on Local Publications
Most people think that magazine features happen when the reporter reaches out to a lucky photographer. But the truth is that often, the work that gets featured on publications is submitted by enterprising professionals. Your work can be featured on local publications if you do some outreach. Aim for niche interests and local businesses so that you’re more likely to stand out. And remember that a lot of these publications will be online, which is just as good (and even better, sometimes) as a magazine. 
Often, features won’t just be about your work, but about the event that you were hired for. So sometimes all you have to do is make sure that your best work is featured and that you have credit in the article. If the article is online, make sure there’s a link to your website.
   
5: Make Professional Connections
For professional photographers, business to business connections are essential. Just one valuable connection can open up so many possibilities for you. And often, the same vendors will travel in the circles that you want to. So, just knowing a few wedding planners, DJ’s and caterers can boost your referrals exponentially every year. That’s why you should always make the most of opportunities to network with other wedding professionals. Share your card, or other branded gear to help them remember your name and webpage so they can refer people quickly and effectively. Go to conventions. And make sure that you return the favor of referrals so that they understand the value of your relationship.

Elevate Credit, Inc. IPO: What Investors Need to Know 
Take two things investors are nervous about -- fintech and subprime lending, stick them together, and  boom! -- you get Elevate. But is the current skepticism an opportunity?











                Billy Duberstein
            

                (Dubs82)



            
            Apr 27, 2017 at 12:50PM
            
            





Elevate Credit, Inc. (NYSE:ELVT)  made its public market debut on April 6, the only "fintech" lender to go public since the 2014 debuts of Lending Club (NYSE:LC) and On Deck Capital (NYSE:ONDK). Why has it taken so long? Probably because the Lending Club and On Deck stock charts look like this: 

LC data by YCharts
Elevate was supposed to go public in January 2016 -- not exactly a good time in the markets -- so the offering was scrapped until this year. While the markets are certainly in better shape, Elevate priced well below its initial expectation at $6.50 per share, as opposed to the anticipated $12-$14 per share. 
Why all the hate? Well, take two risky businesses -- fintech and subprime loans— stick them together, and presto!-- investors get nervous. But is the current skepticism an opportunity?
What Elevate Credit is
Elevate was spun off from Think Finance, a lending software company, in 2014. Elevate offers unsecured loans to borrowers with less-than-prime credit in the US and UK in three products: Rise, Sunny, and Elastic. The company's target borrowers are individuals with credit scores less than 700. If that sounds like risky business, that's because it is. That's why Elevate's loans carry interest rates ranging from 36% to 299%.
While this sounds extreme, the company's competitors are payday loan operations, pawn shops, and other businesses that charge an average of 400%, according to the Consumer Protection Bureau.  In fact, management stated that the company has saved this demographic more than $1 billion since 2013. Elevate also decreases customers' interest rates if they consistently make timely payments over a certain period of time -- giving customers the opportunity to lift their credit scores. Many payday lenders don't even report to credit bureaus at all, which means reliable consumers wind up exactly where they started since their reliable payments are never added to their credit scores.
Assuming no moral objections, does Elevate make a good investment?

Positive characteristics
Elevate is a high-growth business operating in an area unappetizing to many others, which means it maybe somewhat insulated from competition. The company's IQ and DORA platforms use of Hadoop databases, which analyze a massive 40 terabytes and utilize 10 thousand different variables when assessing risk. Remarkably, machines decide the fate of 95% of loan applications, not humans. These tools have kept loan losses as a percentage of revenues stable at 42-52% over the past four years and principal charge-offs between 25-30%.  . This seems high, but when you consider the average APR is 146%, you can see how that is a scalable business. 
The company grew revenues at a 34% clip in 2016, but, like most other recent tech IPOs, wasn't profitable, posting losses of $22.9 million. Still, compared with its fintech peers, it looks good on several metrics:

These businesses have different models and target consumers, but as you can see, Elevate is the least expensive of the bunch, as well as the fastest-growing.
There are other attractive aspects to the subprime market. One, it is very big, comprising 170 million people in the U.S. and U.K. Two, the market can actually be counter-cyclical, which means charge-offs stay the same or improve in a recession. This is because traditional lenders tighten credit in a downturn, which throws many credit-worthy borrowers into the subprime pool. This finding was based on management's "own experience during the last financial crisis," according to the company's S-1. 





But there are risks
While Elevate may look enticing based on these factors, there are a number of risks. Two big ones stuck out to me:
1. Regulation: Subprime lenders could easily become the target of regulation, either in the U.S., U.K., individual states, or all of the above. While the Trump administration and Republican congress makes this less likely, there are still federal regulators such as the Consumer Protection Bureau on the case. For instance, regulators could restrict the company's use of the automated clearing house systems, or electronic payment transfers, from people's bank accounts. It is pretty easy to see how that could impede Elevate's ability to collect payments if this were to happen. 
2. Debt financing: One of the key differentiators among online lenders is how they fund themselves. Elevate primarily funds its loans through high-yield debt from just a single source: Victory Park Capital, a privately held alternative asset manager.  Victory upped its loan facility to $545 million last summer , and funds Elevate's Sunny and Rise products at a variable rate based on LIBOR plus a spread of anywhere between 9% and 18%. Moreover, Elevate earns fees to license its technology to Republic Bank, which originates the Elastic lines of credit. Republic then sells up to 90% of the loans to an entity owned by -- you guessed it --  Victory Park. Elevate also has to guarantee this entity against losses. 
Conclusion
I was ready to get on board with Elevate until I got to the debt financing risk. The combination of dependency on a single lender, high costs of capital, and having to guarantee loan losses to a third party doesn't sit well with me. If Elevate can diversify its funding sources, I might be more interested, but for now, I'm sitting on the sidelines until that happens.

Elevate Software develops, markets, and sells both database engine products (ElevateDB and DBISAM) and a web application development product (Elevate Web Builder).

Our first-generation database engine product, DBISAM, is a good fit for Delphi and C++Builder application developers wanting a fast and highly-customizable database engine that compiles directly into their applications, especially when replacing the BDE (Borland Database Engine) in existing applications.

Our newest database engine product, ElevateDB, is geared toward all database application developers, and is available for almost all development environments.

Our brand new product, Elevate Web Builder, is a development environment for building web applications that rival desktop applications in terms of performance and functionality. It is a very good fit for the desktop application developer that wants to rapidly develop applications for the web without the traditional long learning curve associated with web application development.
