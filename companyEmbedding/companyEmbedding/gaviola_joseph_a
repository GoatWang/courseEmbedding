Job Details
               Bob Weber, Inc. (BWI) is a leading supplier of reconditioned digital prepress equipment. We are currently celebrating our 30th year of serving the graphics industry. During these last 30 years, BWI has evolved from a one person "broker" operation to a diverse sales and marketing operation with 18 employees. We have grown from a brokerage business into an international business organization that markets digital prepress equipment worldwide. The type of equipment we sell has evolved, from exclusively film-based systems (imagesetters) to a mix of computer-to-film and computer-to-plate (platesetters). We have also expanded our sales to include new products such as software Workflow RIPs, film and plate processors, densitometers, Imposition software, and parts for all generations of prepress equipment. We serve a diverse group of customers and dealers around the world, with the majority of equipment shipping outside the United States. Our one room office in 1982 has grown to 40,000 square feet of facilities today. BWI maintains an inventory of prepress equipment with a cost in the range of $1.5 million dollars, all warehoused on-site. All equipment listed on our website is owned by BWI, and will be reconditioned by our in-house technicians and finishing department.
