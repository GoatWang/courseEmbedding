Early life[edit]
Pitt was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the son of Jane Etta (née Hillhouse), a school counselor, and William Alvin Pitt, who ran a trucking firm and is involved in real estate. He has a brother, actor Brad Pitt (three years older) and a sister, Julie (Pitt) Neal (two years younger). The Pitt siblings all engage in a variety of humanitarian activities in Africa.
Business[edit]
Pitt attended schools in Springfield, graduating from Kickapoo High School. He graduated from Missouri State University in 1990. In 1991, he founded ServiceWorld Computer Center. In November 2007, Pitt sold a 75% interest in ServiceWorld Computer Center to Miami Nations Enterprises, the Indian Tribe of Miami, Oklahoma. Pitt remained an owner and principal operational partner of ServiceWorld. ServiceWorld is a past recipient of the W. Curtis Strube Small Business of the Year and in 2010 was awarded the SBJ Philanthropic Business of the Year. In 2012, Pitt formed TSI Integrated Services in partnership with TSI Global, a St. Louis corporation. In May 2013, the Tribe of Miami purchased a controlling interest in TSI Global. Pitt and the Tribe merged ServiceWorld into TSI Global in July 2013 where Pitt remains an operational member. As part of the technology family, Pitt had formed Nexus Underground in 2012, which provides cloud based services. Nexus Underground was sold by Pitt to the Miami Tribe and merged into TSI Global in August 2013. As a tribal owned entity, MBS and the Miami tribe were recognized in August 2013 as the 8a Business of the Year.[2]
Outside of the technology industry, Pitt is a real estate investor and has interests in several real estate projects across the United States. In July 2013, Pitt launched an Innovation and Business Incubation Center in owned retail space in conjunction with the Ozark Chamber of Commerce in Ozark, Missouri.[2] Pitt joined the Board of Directors of Great Southern Bank [5] in January, 2015.[6]
Philanthropy[edit]
Pitt has served on many boards in Missouri starting with Big Brothers Big Sisters in 1995. Since then, some of the others include Make A Wish; Easter Seals; The Red Cross, and is a past Chairman of the Springfield Area Chamber of Commerce. He has also served on many community task forces including Co-Chairing the Homeless Task Force in 2010 and serving on the Ready To Learn child project in 2013.[7]
In 2013, Pitt was named to the Advisory Council of The ONE Organization of Missouri.
Care to Learn[edit]
In late 2007, Pitt heard sobering statistics on poverty in Southwest Missouri, including humiliating stories of what kids were suffering through. Pitt founded Care to Learn to provide emergent funding for child health, hunger and hygiene needs. The fund started in April 2008, and by early 2017, has grown to 32 Chapters and fulfilled over 750,000 individual child needs. Care to Learn is active in advocacy of children’s rights and works to redevelop child supportive programs.[8] The story that particularly bothered him most was one of a fifth-grade boy being teased mercilessly because he had to wear his mom’s jeans to school. “I think why it bothers me so much is because it’s so easy to fix,” he says. “And here I couldn’t find that kid. I didn’t know who he was.”[9] In 2017, Pitt stepped down as President of the Board of Directors, now operating as founder and President Emeritus.
Projects in Africa[edit]
Pitt first began his International service with Convoy of Hope, doing hunger missions in Budapest and Portugal. He teamed up with WorldServe International in 2005. Pitt is a current Board Member of WorldServe and helped the organization grow into one of the largest private drilling companies in East Africa, via MajiTech, a Tanzanian wholly owned company of WorldServe. Since Pitt’s involvement in 2005, WorldServe has provided clean water to over 2,000,000 Tanzanians. Pitt has worked tirelessly to bring the global challenge of clean water into focus, commenting, "Today 18,000 children will die from preventable diseases like pneumonia or diarrhea simply because they don’t have access to clean water."[10] In 2012, WorldServe brought two drilling rigs online in Kenya serving the refugee crises areas in Dadaab and eastern Kenya. In addition to water wells, WorldServe has also developed numerous medical dispensaries, sanitation buildings and schools.
In July 2010, Pitt was recognized by President of Tanzania, Jakaya Kikwete, in New York City at an event where he was named Tanzania’s first ever Goodwill Ambassador for the United Republic of Tanzania. His duties include working with the Ministry of Tourism, Ministry of Water, agriculture, education and wildlife. In 2014, Pitt has partnered with both private and government groups to address anti-poaching measures in Tanzania.[11]
In July 2013, Pitt hosted NFL future Hall of Famer Ray Lewis on his first trip to Tanzania, raising funds for clean water.[12]
In 2016, Waterboys.org[13] was formed. Featured in an NFL network commercial, hosted by Matthew McConaughey, the mission to bring life-sustaining well water to east African communities in need was introduced nationally, featuring NFL defensive end, Chris Long. Through the Chris Long Foundation,[14] Long and Pitt launched this initiative to utilize Long's NFL connections to join fellow football players, their fans and their locker rooms to raise money to fund Waterboys [15] in Africa.
Photography[edit]
Pitt has been a photographic enthusiast for over 20 years. He has done photo exhibits in galleries in New York, Pennsylvania, California, Minnesota and Missouri, with proceeds going to clean water. His photos have been featured in numerous domestic and international publications.
Virgin Mobile[edit]
Pitt became an ad spokesman for Virgin Mobile Australia, portraying The Second Most Famous Pitt, a parody of his comedic likeness as the brother of actor Brad Pitt.[16] The initial web video went viral and garnered over 1,200,000 YouTube hits in its first week.[17] This campaign became the most successful in history for Virgin Mobile becoming the top 5 viewed online ad in the world in its first month. The campaign won the Grand Prix for Effectiveness at Spikes, a Black Lion at Cannes for Effectiveness, Best of Show at AdFest, the Gold Prize at the 12th Annual Creative Business Idea Awards, two Gold AdFest Awards as well as a Gold & Silver Clio and countless Cannes Lions, AWARD, New York Festivals and many other awards. It was the thirteenth most awarded campaign in 2014. The popularity of the campaign got Pitt a spot on the Today Show with host Matt Lauer. A topic of conversation was his response to conservative comments his mother made about President Obama and gay marriage. He responded with “Moms and dads and kids agree to disagree all over the world, so why would our family be any different? There can be healthy discussion when people disagree with you, and I think there should be. The bad thing is when it turns into venom and negativity and we don’t have that in our family. It’s open discussion. We can learn from each other and, if anything, it solidifies your point or maybe you learn something.”[18]
Biking[edit]
Pitt is an avid road, mountain bike and urban bicyclist that supports numerous biking organizations. He also works to promote safe biking lanes; city and mountain bike trail systems; and bike health and safety. Pitt hosts biking fundraisers domestically and internationally.
In January 2011, Pitt became the first American on record to climb Mount Kilimanjaro and descend on a mountain bike. Biking is illegal on Kilimanjaro and permission was granted via the Tanzanian government. The ride was sponsored by Trek Bikes, Eddie Bauer/First Ascent and the Hershey Company. As a fundraiser, the event raised $750,000 for clean water projects in Tanzania. Pitt duplicated this effort in March 2013 hosting a mountain biking trip down Kilimanjaro that netted $250,000 for clean water. An additional $100,000 was raised with dual sponsors Trek Bikes, Otter Box, Pentair and Jimmy Johns as Pitt completed the 2012 Leadville 100 Mountain Bike race in Leadville, Colorado; and event he had to complete under the 12-hour deadline to collect the $100,000 for clean water; his time was 10 hours, 22 minutes.[19]

Early life[edit]
Pitt was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the son of Jane Etta (née Hillhouse), a school counselor, and William Alvin Pitt, who ran a trucking firm and is involved in real estate. He has a brother, actor Brad Pitt (three years older) and a sister, Julie (Pitt) Neal (two years younger). The Pitt siblings all engage in a variety of humanitarian activities in Africa.
Business[edit]
Pitt attended schools in Springfield, graduating from Kickapoo High School. He graduated from Missouri State University in 1990. In 1991, he founded ServiceWorld Computer Center. In November 2007, Pitt sold a 75% interest in ServiceWorld Computer Center to Miami Nations Enterprises, the Indian Tribe of Miami, Oklahoma. Pitt remained an owner and principal operational partner of ServiceWorld. ServiceWorld is a past recipient of the W. Curtis Strube Small Business of the Year and in 2010 was awarded the SBJ Philanthropic Business of the Year. In 2012, Pitt formed TSI Integrated Services in partnership with TSI Global, a St. Louis corporation. In May 2013, the Tribe of Miami purchased a controlling interest in TSI Global. Pitt and the Tribe merged ServiceWorld into TSI Global in July 2013 where Pitt remains an operational member. As part of the technology family, Pitt had formed Nexus Underground in 2012, which provides cloud based services. Nexus Underground was sold by Pitt to the Miami Tribe and merged into TSI Global in August 2013. As a tribal owned entity, MBS and the Miami tribe were recognized in August 2013 as the 8a Business of the Year.[2]
Outside of the technology industry, Pitt is a real estate investor and has interests in several real estate projects across the United States. In July 2013, Pitt launched an Innovation and Business Incubation Center in owned retail space in conjunction with the Ozark Chamber of Commerce in Ozark, Missouri.[2] Pitt joined the Board of Directors of Great Southern Bank [5] in January, 2015.[6]
Philanthropy[edit]
Pitt has served on many boards in Missouri starting with Big Brothers Big Sisters in 1995. Since then, some of the others include Make A Wish; Easter Seals; The Red Cross, and is a past Chairman of the Springfield Area Chamber of Commerce. He has also served on many community task forces including Co-Chairing the Homeless Task Force in 2010 and serving on the Ready To Learn child project in 2013.[7]
In 2013, Pitt was named to the Advisory Council of The ONE Organization of Missouri.
Care to Learn[edit]
In late 2007, Pitt heard sobering statistics on poverty in Southwest Missouri, including humiliating stories of what kids were suffering through. Pitt founded Care to Learn to provide emergent funding for child health, hunger and hygiene needs. The fund started in April 2008, and by early 2017, has grown to 32 Chapters and fulfilled over 750,000 individual child needs. Care to Learn is active in advocacy of children’s rights and works to redevelop child supportive programs.[8] The story that particularly bothered him most was one of a fifth-grade boy being teased mercilessly because he had to wear his mom’s jeans to school. “I think why it bothers me so much is because it’s so easy to fix,” he says. “And here I couldn’t find that kid. I didn’t know who he was.”[9] In 2017, Pitt stepped down as President of the Board of Directors, now operating as founder and President Emeritus.
Projects in Africa[edit]
Pitt first began his International service with Convoy of Hope, doing hunger missions in Budapest and Portugal. He teamed up with WorldServe International in 2005. Pitt is a current Board Member of WorldServe and helped the organization grow into one of the largest private drilling companies in East Africa, via MajiTech, a Tanzanian wholly owned company of WorldServe. Since Pitt’s involvement in 2005, WorldServe has provided clean water to over 2,000,000 Tanzanians. Pitt has worked tirelessly to bring the global challenge of clean water into focus, commenting, "Today 18,000 children will die from preventable diseases like pneumonia or diarrhea simply because they don’t have access to clean water."[10] In 2012, WorldServe brought two drilling rigs online in Kenya serving the refugee crises areas in Dadaab and eastern Kenya. In addition to water wells, WorldServe has also developed numerous medical dispensaries, sanitation buildings and schools.
In July 2010, Pitt was recognized by President of Tanzania, Jakaya Kikwete, in New York City at an event where he was named Tanzania’s first ever Goodwill Ambassador for the United Republic of Tanzania. His duties include working with the Ministry of Tourism, Ministry of Water, agriculture, education and wildlife. In 2014, Pitt has partnered with both private and government groups to address anti-poaching measures in Tanzania.[11]
In July 2013, Pitt hosted NFL future Hall of Famer Ray Lewis on his first trip to Tanzania, raising funds for clean water.[12]
In 2016, Waterboys.org[13] was formed. Featured in an NFL network commercial, hosted by Matthew McConaughey, the mission to bring life-sustaining well water to east African communities in need was introduced nationally, featuring NFL defensive end, Chris Long. Through the Chris Long Foundation,[14] Long and Pitt launched this initiative to utilize Long's NFL connections to join fellow football players, their fans and their locker rooms to raise money to fund Waterboys [15] in Africa.
Photography[edit]
Pitt has been a photographic enthusiast for over 20 years. He has done photo exhibits in galleries in New York, Pennsylvania, California, Minnesota and Missouri, with proceeds going to clean water. His photos have been featured in numerous domestic and international publications.
Virgin Mobile[edit]
Pitt became an ad spokesman for Virgin Mobile Australia, portraying The Second Most Famous Pitt, a parody of his comedic likeness as the brother of actor Brad Pitt.[16] The initial web video went viral and garnered over 1,200,000 YouTube hits in its first week.[17] This campaign became the most successful in history for Virgin Mobile becoming the top 5 viewed online ad in the world in its first month. The campaign won the Grand Prix for Effectiveness at Spikes, a Black Lion at Cannes for Effectiveness, Best of Show at AdFest, the Gold Prize at the 12th Annual Creative Business Idea Awards, two Gold AdFest Awards as well as a Gold & Silver Clio and countless Cannes Lions, AWARD, New York Festivals and many other awards. It was the thirteenth most awarded campaign in 2014. The popularity of the campaign got Pitt a spot on the Today Show with host Matt Lauer. A topic of conversation was his response to conservative comments his mother made about President Obama and gay marriage. He responded with “Moms and dads and kids agree to disagree all over the world, so why would our family be any different? There can be healthy discussion when people disagree with you, and I think there should be. The bad thing is when it turns into venom and negativity and we don’t have that in our family. It’s open discussion. We can learn from each other and, if anything, it solidifies your point or maybe you learn something.”[18]
Biking[edit]
Pitt is an avid road, mountain bike and urban bicyclist that supports numerous biking organizations. He also works to promote safe biking lanes; city and mountain bike trail systems; and bike health and safety. Pitt hosts biking fundraisers domestically and internationally.
In January 2011, Pitt became the first American on record to climb Mount Kilimanjaro and descend on a mountain bike. Biking is illegal on Kilimanjaro and permission was granted via the Tanzanian government. The ride was sponsored by Trek Bikes, Eddie Bauer/First Ascent and the Hershey Company. As a fundraiser, the event raised $750,000 for clean water projects in Tanzania. Pitt duplicated this effort in March 2013 hosting a mountain biking trip down Kilimanjaro that netted $250,000 for clean water. An additional $100,000 was raised with dual sponsors Trek Bikes, Otter Box, Pentair and Jimmy Johns as Pitt completed the 2012 Leadville 100 Mountain Bike race in Leadville, Colorado; and event he had to complete under the 12-hour deadline to collect the $100,000 for clean water; his time was 10 hours, 22 minutes.[19]

Early life[edit]
Pitt was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the son of Jane Etta (née Hillhouse), a school counselor, and William Alvin Pitt, who ran a trucking firm and is involved in real estate. He has a brother, actor Brad Pitt (three years older) and a sister, Julie (Pitt) Neal (two years younger). The Pitt siblings all engage in a variety of humanitarian activities in Africa.
Business[edit]
Pitt attended schools in Springfield, graduating from Kickapoo High School. He graduated from Missouri State University in 1990. In 1991, he founded ServiceWorld Computer Center. In November 2007, Pitt sold a 75% interest in ServiceWorld Computer Center to Miami Nations Enterprises, the Indian Tribe of Miami, Oklahoma. Pitt remained an owner and principal operational partner of ServiceWorld. ServiceWorld is a past recipient of the W. Curtis Strube Small Business of the Year and in 2010 was awarded the SBJ Philanthropic Business of the Year. In 2012, Pitt formed TSI Integrated Services in partnership with TSI Global, a St. Louis corporation. In May 2013, the Tribe of Miami purchased a controlling interest in TSI Global. Pitt and the Tribe merged ServiceWorld into TSI Global in July 2013 where Pitt remains an operational member. As part of the technology family, Pitt had formed Nexus Underground in 2012, which provides cloud based services. Nexus Underground was sold by Pitt to the Miami Tribe and merged into TSI Global in August 2013. As a tribal owned entity, MBS and the Miami tribe were recognized in August 2013 as the 8a Business of the Year.[2]
Outside of the technology industry, Pitt is a real estate investor and has interests in several real estate projects across the United States. In July 2013, Pitt launched an Innovation and Business Incubation Center in owned retail space in conjunction with the Ozark Chamber of Commerce in Ozark, Missouri.[2] Pitt joined the Board of Directors of Great Southern Bank [5] in January, 2015.[6]
Philanthropy[edit]
Pitt has served on many boards in Missouri starting with Big Brothers Big Sisters in 1995. Since then, some of the others include Make A Wish; Easter Seals; The Red Cross, and is a past Chairman of the Springfield Area Chamber of Commerce. He has also served on many community task forces including Co-Chairing the Homeless Task Force in 2010 and serving on the Ready To Learn child project in 2013.[7]
In 2013, Pitt was named to the Advisory Council of The ONE Organization of Missouri.
Care to Learn[edit]
In late 2007, Pitt heard sobering statistics on poverty in Southwest Missouri, including humiliating stories of what kids were suffering through. Pitt founded Care to Learn to provide emergent funding for child health, hunger and hygiene needs. The fund started in April 2008, and by early 2017, has grown to 32 Chapters and fulfilled over 750,000 individual child needs. Care to Learn is active in advocacy of children’s rights and works to redevelop child supportive programs.[8] The story that particularly bothered him most was one of a fifth-grade boy being teased mercilessly because he had to wear his mom’s jeans to school. “I think why it bothers me so much is because it’s so easy to fix,” he says. “And here I couldn’t find that kid. I didn’t know who he was.”[9] In 2017, Pitt stepped down as President of the Board of Directors, now operating as founder and President Emeritus.
Projects in Africa[edit]
Pitt first began his International service with Convoy of Hope, doing hunger missions in Budapest and Portugal. He teamed up with WorldServe International in 2005. Pitt is a current Board Member of WorldServe and helped the organization grow into one of the largest private drilling companies in East Africa, via MajiTech, a Tanzanian wholly owned company of WorldServe. Since Pitt’s involvement in 2005, WorldServe has provided clean water to over 2,000,000 Tanzanians. Pitt has worked tirelessly to bring the global challenge of clean water into focus, commenting, "Today 18,000 children will die from preventable diseases like pneumonia or diarrhea simply because they don’t have access to clean water."[10] In 2012, WorldServe brought two drilling rigs online in Kenya serving the refugee crises areas in Dadaab and eastern Kenya. In addition to water wells, WorldServe has also developed numerous medical dispensaries, sanitation buildings and schools.
In July 2010, Pitt was recognized by President of Tanzania, Jakaya Kikwete, in New York City at an event where he was named Tanzania’s first ever Goodwill Ambassador for the United Republic of Tanzania. His duties include working with the Ministry of Tourism, Ministry of Water, agriculture, education and wildlife. In 2014, Pitt has partnered with both private and government groups to address anti-poaching measures in Tanzania.[11]
In July 2013, Pitt hosted NFL future Hall of Famer Ray Lewis on his first trip to Tanzania, raising funds for clean water.[12]
In 2016, Waterboys.org[13] was formed. Featured in an NFL network commercial, hosted by Matthew McConaughey, the mission to bring life-sustaining well water to east African communities in need was introduced nationally, featuring NFL defensive end, Chris Long. Through the Chris Long Foundation,[14] Long and Pitt launched this initiative to utilize Long's NFL connections to join fellow football players, their fans and their locker rooms to raise money to fund Waterboys [15] in Africa.
Photography[edit]
Pitt has been a photographic enthusiast for over 20 years. He has done photo exhibits in galleries in New York, Pennsylvania, California, Minnesota and Missouri, with proceeds going to clean water. His photos have been featured in numerous domestic and international publications.
Virgin Mobile[edit]
Pitt became an ad spokesman for Virgin Mobile Australia, portraying The Second Most Famous Pitt, a parody of his comedic likeness as the brother of actor Brad Pitt.[16] The initial web video went viral and garnered over 1,200,000 YouTube hits in its first week.[17] This campaign became the most successful in history for Virgin Mobile becoming the top 5 viewed online ad in the world in its first month. The campaign won the Grand Prix for Effectiveness at Spikes, a Black Lion at Cannes for Effectiveness, Best of Show at AdFest, the Gold Prize at the 12th Annual Creative Business Idea Awards, two Gold AdFest Awards as well as a Gold & Silver Clio and countless Cannes Lions, AWARD, New York Festivals and many other awards. It was the thirteenth most awarded campaign in 2014. The popularity of the campaign got Pitt a spot on the Today Show with host Matt Lauer. A topic of conversation was his response to conservative comments his mother made about President Obama and gay marriage. He responded with “Moms and dads and kids agree to disagree all over the world, so why would our family be any different? There can be healthy discussion when people disagree with you, and I think there should be. The bad thing is when it turns into venom and negativity and we don’t have that in our family. It’s open discussion. We can learn from each other and, if anything, it solidifies your point or maybe you learn something.”[18]
Biking[edit]
Pitt is an avid road, mountain bike and urban bicyclist that supports numerous biking organizations. He also works to promote safe biking lanes; city and mountain bike trail systems; and bike health and safety. Pitt hosts biking fundraisers domestically and internationally.
In January 2011, Pitt became the first American on record to climb Mount Kilimanjaro and descend on a mountain bike. Biking is illegal on Kilimanjaro and permission was granted via the Tanzanian government. The ride was sponsored by Trek Bikes, Eddie Bauer/First Ascent and the Hershey Company. As a fundraiser, the event raised $750,000 for clean water projects in Tanzania. Pitt duplicated this effort in March 2013 hosting a mountain biking trip down Kilimanjaro that netted $250,000 for clean water. An additional $100,000 was raised with dual sponsors Trek Bikes, Otter Box, Pentair and Jimmy Johns as Pitt completed the 2012 Leadville 100 Mountain Bike race in Leadville, Colorado; and event he had to complete under the 12-hour deadline to collect the $100,000 for clean water; his time was 10 hours, 22 minutes.[19]

	Dr. White graduated summa cum laude from Dartmouth College in 1995 with a degree in English Literature. He received his MD from UCSF in 1999 and completed a residency in Internal Medicine and a fellowship in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at UCSF. While at UCSF, he also completed a Master’s degree in Epidemiology and Biostatistics and a fellowship in Bioethics under Bernard Lo. He joined the faculty at UCSF in 2005 as an Assistant Professor of Medicine and a Core Faculty of the Program on Medical Ethics. In 2009 he joined the faculty of the University of Pittsburgh in the Departments of Critical Care Medicine and Medicine as an Associate Professor. He was also appointed as a core faculty member in the Center for Bioethics and Health law at the University of Pittsburgh.

	Dr. White directs the University of Pittsburgh Program on Ethics and Decision Making in Critical Illness. His research program encompasses both empirical research on and normative ethical analysis of surrogate decision-making for patients with life-threatening illness. He has several ongoing NIH funded studies. He has published widely using both quantitative and qualitative methods to examine the process of surrogate decision making in intensive care units. In conducting this work, he collaborates with a multi-disciplinary group of investigators, which includes faculty with expertise in bioethics, law, philosophy, sociology, biostatistics, and health services research. His empirical research program has two central aims: 1) to identify factors that adversely affect surrogate decision-making for critically ill patients; and 2) to develop and test interventions to improve surrogate decision-making. His normative work focuses on ethical issues that arise in intensive care units, including the allocation of scarce resources, resolving futility disputes, responding to conscience-based treatment refusals by clinicians, and developing fair processes of decision making for incapacitated patients who lack surrogate decision makers.

A randominzed trial to improve surrogate decision-making for critically ill elders

	This Paul Beeson Career Development Award in Aging supports a randomized controlled trial of a multi-faceted intervention to improve surrogate decision-making and life support decisions for critically ill elders at high risk for death or functional impairment in intensive care units.

Validation of a Mortality Predicition Model for Prolonged Mechanical Ventilation

	A scoring system that can determine the risk of death for patients who become critically ill and require mechanical ventilation for weeks or months has been developed in a single hospital.  This study will determine if this scoring system is accurate in patients who require prolonged mechanical ventilation at other hospitals in the U.S.

ESCAPE (Enhancing Surge Capacity and Partnership Effort)
	The aim of this project is to develop procedures to ensure the ethical allocation of scarce medical resources during a public health emergency.  It involves partnerships between health care facilities, public health departments, and alternate care sites.

	Role: Consultant. I provide guidance on the ethical issues involved in fairly allocating scarce, life saving resources during a public health emergency.

NIH Career Development Award
	The goal of this award is to develop the skills to lead a multidisciplinary clinical and translational research program. This grant also supports Dr. White to lead a prospective cohort study using mixed methods to determine predictors of physician-family discordance about prognosis in critically ill patients at high risk of death.

UCSF Research Evaluation and Allocation Committee                     
	This grant supports a prospective cohort study to determine predictors of physician-family discordance about prognosis in critically ill patients at high risk of death.

Medical Decision Making in Incapacitated Critically Ill Patients Who Lack Surrogates.
	This foundation grant supported a prospective cohort study examining the incidence of incapacitated patients without surrogates in ICUs and the decision-making practices associated with treatment limitation in this population.

Multidisciplinary Research Training Program in Pulmonary Disease
	The major goal of Dr. White’s project is to develop a framework to evaluate how physicians communicate prognostic information to the surrogate decision maker of critically ill, incapacitated patients.

When used in documents filed or furnished by the Great Southern Bancorp, Inc. (the "Company") with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), in the Company's press releases or other public or stockholder communications, and in oral statements made with the approval of an authorized executive officer, the words or phrases "will likely result," "are expected to," "will continue," "is anticipated," "estimate," "project," "intends" or similar expressions are intended to identify "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including, among other things, (i) non-interest expense reductions from Great Southern's banking center consolidations might be less than anticipated and the costs of the consolidation and impairment of the value of the affected premises might be greater than expected; (ii) expected cost savings, synergies and other benefits from the Company's merger and acquisition activities, including but not limited to the recently completed Valley Bank FDIC-assisted transaction, might not be realized within the anticipated time frames or at all, and costs or difficulties relating to integration matters, including but not limited to customer and employee retention, might be greater than expected; (iii) changes in economic conditions, either nationally or in the Company's market areas; (iv) fluctuations in interest rates; (v) the risks of lending and investing activities, including changes in the level and direction of loan delinquencies and write-offs and changes in estimates of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses; (vi) the possibility of other-than-temporary impairments of securities held in the Company's securities portfolio; (vii) the Company's ability to access cost-effective funding; (viii) fluctuations in real estate values and both residential and commercial real estate market conditions; (ix) demand for loans and deposits in the Company's market areas; (x) legislative or regulatory changes that adversely affect the Company's business, including, without limitation, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and its implementing regulations, and the overdraft protection regulations and customers' responses thereto; (xi) monetary and fiscal policies of the Federal Reserve Board and the U.S. Government and other governmental initiatives affecting the financial services industry; (xii) results of examinations of the Company and Great Southern by their regulators, including the possibility that the regulators may, among other things, require the Company to increase its allowance for loan losses or to write-down assets; (xiii) the uncertainties arising from the Company's participation in the Small Business Lending Fund program, including uncertainties concerning the potential future redemption by us of the U.S. Treasury's preferred stock investment under the program, including the timing of, regulatory approvals for, and conditions placed upon, any such redemption; (xiv) costs and effects of litigation, including settlements and judgments; and (xv) competition. The Company wishes to advise readers that the factors listed above and other risks described from time to time in documents filed or furnished by the Company with the SEC could affect the Company's financial performance and could cause the Company's actual results for future periods to differ materially from any opinions or statements expressed with respect to future periods in any current statements.
The Company does not undertake-and specifically declines any obligation- to publicly release the result of any revisions which may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.
