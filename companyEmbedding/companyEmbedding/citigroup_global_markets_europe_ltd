Dividend Reinvestment and Direct Stock Purchase Plan (DRP)



Citigroup does not offer an initial direct stock purchase program. Once you are a stockholder of record, you can enroll in our Dividend Reinvestment and Direct Stock Purchase Plan (DRP) through the Plan administrator, Computershare.

                        					The Citi Dividend Reinvestment and Direct Stock Purchase Plan (DRP) allows current Citigroup stockholders to reinvest dividends or make optional cash payments in order to directly purchase additional Citigroup common stock. The optional cash payments must be at least $50 and can be up to an aggregate of $120,000 per calendar year.

                        					Registered stockholders and brokers on behalf of their clients are permitted to participate.

                        					The Plan Administrator is Computershare Trust Company, N.A.

                        					On their website, www.computershare.com/investor, you can find a summary of the Citigroup DRP, and download the plan prospectus. You can also download and submit an Enrollment Form, change your participation option or update your election online. You will need to register your account first if you have not previously. Once registered, select "Enroll in an Investment Plan."

                        					Or, to request a copy of the prospectus or the Enrollment Form be sent to you, you may contact Computershare by email at shareholder@computershare.com or call them at (888) 250-3985 or (781) 575-4555 (for outside of North America).

                        					If your shares of common stock are registered in a name other than your own (e.g., in the name of a broker or bank nominee) then you should: (1) make arrangements with your bank, broker or other nominee to participate on your behalf, or (2) have your shares re-registered in your own name(s) and then complete the Enrollment Form.

Travelers Information



Citicorp and Travelers Group Merger

                        					On October 8, 1998, Citicorp and Travelers Group merged to become Citigroup Inc. At the time of the merger, Citicorp stockholders received 2.5 Citigroup shares for every 1 share of Citicorp stock they previously owned. Travelers Group stockholders maintained their shares of Travelers Group stock under the Citigroup name.
Spin-off of Travelers Property Casualty Corp.
On August 20, 2002, a total of 219,050,000 shares of class A common stock and 450,050,000 shares of class B common stock of Travelers Property Casualty Corp. (Travelers) were distributed to Citigroup stockholders of record as of the record date:  August 9, 2002.
Citigroup distributed a combination of 0.0432043 of a share of Travelers class A common stock and 0.0887656 of a share of Travelers class B common stock for each outstanding share of Citigroup common stock.
Only whole shares of Travelers class A common stock and Travelers class B common stock were issued. Any Citigroup stockholder entitled to receive a fractional share received a cash payment in lieu of fractional shares.
Figuring the Cost Basis in Citigroup Shares From the Travelers Spin-Off
Generally, for U.S. taxpayers, the cost basis represents the purchase price of your stock. The cost basis in your Citigroup shares just prior to the distribution must be allocated to the Citigroup shares and the Travelers shares so that the total cost basis of your holdings (Citigroup and Travelers, including any fractional shares sold for cash) after the distribution is the same as your cost basis in the Citigroup shares just prior to the distribution.

Citigroup Global Markets Limited Key Developments

ETFS Hedged Commodity Securities Limited Announces Commodity Contract Counterparty Changes
Jul 3 17
ETFS Hedged Commodity Securities Limited (HCSL) announced that it has entered into a facility agreement appointing Citigroup Global Markets Limited (CGML) as a Commodity Contract Counterparty for its Currency-Hedged Commodity Securities. The Facility Agreement with CGML is on similar terms to the existing Facility Agreements with UBS AG (UBS) and Merrill Lynch International (MLI), save as set out under the headings 'Collateral Changes' and 'EU Benchmarks Regulation'. The obligations of CGML will be supported by collateral in a similar manner to that in which those of UBS and MLI are currently supported. The payment obligations of CGML will also be guaranteed by Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. HCSL announced that by a notice dated 30 June 2017 it has exercised its rights under the UBS Facility Agreement to give not less than three months' notice of a Compulsory Cancellation Date in respect of all classes of Commodity Contracts without redeeming the equivalent Commodity Securities. The date notified is 4 October 2017. Absent otherwise agreement with UBS, the UBS Facility Agreement will terminate on such date. It is the Issuer's intention that the date on which the UBS Facility Agreement is effectively terminated will be the same date as the Effective Date for the purposes of the CGML Facility Agreement. The Issuer has agreed with CGML arrangements under which the Commodity Contracts with UBS will be effectively replaced by equivalent Commodity Contracts with CGML. HCSL announced that it has entered into an agreement amending and restating the MLI Facility Agreement. The amended and restated MLI Facility Agreement is on similar terms to the existing MLI Facility Agreement and the new Facility Agreement with CGML, save as set out under the headings "Collateral Changes" and "EU Benchmarks Regulation" below. MLI will be the Calculation Agent under the amended and restated Facility Agreement with MLI and the new Facility Agreement with CGML. Upon the new Facility Agreements becoming effective both MLI and CGML will act as Commodity Contract Counterparties in similar manner to that in which UBS and MLI currently operate as Commodity Contract Counterparties, save that MLI rather than UBS will act as Calculation Agent. This means that the Commodity Securities will be backed by Commodity Contracts created with either MLI or CGML as determined by HCSL in accordance with arrangements agreed between HCSL, MLI and CGML. All Commodity Securities of any one class will continue to be fungible with all other Commodity Securities of that class.


Steinhoff International Plans Listing Of Its African Assets
May 17 17
Steinhoff International Holdings N.V. (JSE:SNH) plans to list its African assets separately. Steinhoff International Holdings said that it will seek to list businesses together including Pepkor Holdings (Proprietary) Limited, Unitrans Automotive, Steinbuild, Poco South Africa, Tekkie Town (Pty) Ltd. and JD Group Limited on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, about 18 months after moving its primary listing to Frankfurt from the South African commercial hub. Steinhoff said it will retain a controlling interest in the new company. The move will include a capital raising to achieve the appropriate level of public ownership, it said. The spun off value is estimated from ZAR 40 billion to ZAR 60 billion. Steinhoff appointed Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Investec Bank Limited, Morgan Stanley & Co International Plc and Rand Merchant Bank to advise on the proposed listing. PSG Capital (Pty) Ltd acted as sponsor and Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr Incorporated, Linklaters LLP and Girard Hayward Inc acted as legal advisors for Steinhoff International.


Citigroup Global Markets Wins GBP 18 Million Multiple Awardees Contract for Fuel Hedging Services
