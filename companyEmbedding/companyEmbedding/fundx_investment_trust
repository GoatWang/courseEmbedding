 FundX Investment Trust (Form: 497K, Received: 01/30/2015 13:39:36) 














	 








	Summary Prospectus




	FundX Upgrader Fund



	 



	January 30, 2015
















	Before you invest, you may want to review the Fund’s prospectus, which contains more information about the Fund and its risks.  You can find the Fund’s Prospectus, Statement of Additional Information and other information about the Fund online at http://www.upgraderfunds.com/how-invest.  You may also obtain this information at no cost by calling 1-866-455-FUND [3863] or by sending an e-mail to issue@fundx.com.  The Fund’s Prospectus and Statement of Additional Information, both dated January 30, 2015, are incorporated by reference into this Summary Prospectus.









	Investment Objective




	The FundX Upgrader Fund (“Upgrader Fund”) seeks to maximize capital appreciation over the long term without regard to income.










	Fees and Expenses of the Fund




	This table describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold shares of the Upgrader Fund.















	FundX Upgrader Fund*

	(fees paid directly from your investment)

	(expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment)

	-0.01%









	Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses After Expense Reduction/Reimbursement


	(3)







	1.98%







	 












	(1)








	FundX Investment Group (the “Advisor”) has contractually agreed to reduce its fees and/or pay the Upgrader Fund’s expenses (excluding Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, interest expense in connection with investment activities, taxes and extraordinary expenses) in order to limit Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses After Expense Reduction/Reimbursement for shares of the Upgrader Fund to 1.25% of the Fund’s average net assets (the “Expense Cap”).  The Expense Cap will remain in effect at least until January 31, 2016.  A reimbursement may be requested by the Advisor for fee reductions and/or expense payments made in the prior three fiscal years if the aggregate amount actually paid by the Fund toward operating expenses for such fiscal year (taking into account any reimbursement) does not exceed the Expense Cap.  To the extent that the Fund incurs expenses excluded from the Expense Cap, net operating expenses of the Fund may be higher than the Expense Cap.  The Expense Cap may be terminated at any time after January 31, 2016, by the Trust’s Board of Trustees upon 60-day notice to the Advisor, or by the Advisor with the consent of the Board.









	 




	 








	(2)






	The Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses for the Fund do not correlate to the Ratio of Expenses to Average Net Assets provided in the Financial Highlights section of the statutory prospectus, which reflects the operating expenses of the Fund and does not include Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses.






	 




	 







	(3)





	Add

	itionally, U.S. Bancorp Fund Services rebates a portion of fees from certain Underlying Funds for processing transactions.  If such amounts were reflected in this table, the Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses After Expense Reduction/Reimbursement would have been 1.95%.







	 




	 






	(*)




	The Fund is the successor to the FundX Upgrader Fund, a series of Professionally Managed Portfolios, which was reorganized into the Upgrader Fund on August 1, 2014.

	Example




	This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Upgrader Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds.  The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Upgrader Fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods.  The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Upgrader Fund’s operating expenses remain the same(taking into account the Expense Cap for the first year only).  Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions, your costs would be:



	 






	 





	1 Year






	3 Years






	5 Years






	10 Years








	FundX Upgrader Fund






	$201






	$623






	$1,072






	$2,316







	 



	Portfolio Turnover




	As a fund-of-funds, the Upgrader Fund does not typically pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio), except with respect to any purchases or sales of exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”).  If transaction costs are involved, a higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Upgrader Fund shares are held in a taxable account.  These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the Upgrader Fund’s performance.  During the most recent fiscal year, the Upgrader Fund’s portfolio turnover rate was

	164

	% of the average value of its portfolio.



	 





	Principal Investment Strategies




	The Upgrader Fund is a fund-of-funds and as such invests primarily in no-load and load-waived mutual funds, including ETFs (“Underlying Funds”).  The Underlying Funds, in turn, invest primarily in individual securities such as common stocks.



	 









	Because markets change, the Advisor actively manages the Fund’s portfolio using a proprietary investment strategy called Upgrading, which seeks to capture global market trends.  The Advisor invests in the Underlying Funds that it considers to be in synch with current market leadership.  The Advisor sells an Underlying Fund when it believes that the Underlying Fund is no longer performing in synch with current market leadership or if a new Underlying Fund is judged more attractive than a current holding.



	 




	Under normal market conditions, the Upgrader Fund will invest predominantly in Core Equity Underlying Funds, which generally invest in diversified portfolios of equity securities of well-established U.S. and foreign companies with a wide range of market capitalizations.  Core Equity Underlying Funds may also invest in fixed income securities.  Core Equity Underlying Funds allow the Fund to participate in broad market leadership trends, such as the rotation between growth and value stocks, large- and small-cap stocks, and international and domestic stocks.  The Upgrader Fund may purchase, without limit, shares of Underlying Funds that invest in domestic, international and global securities.






	 




	 






	Upgrading






	When a fund begins to lag its peers, the Advisor redeems the shares and directs the proceeds to a







	better performing alternative.  The Advisor classifies the pool of Underlying Funds into four risk/return categories:







	▪     Aggressive Equity Underlying Funds




	▪     Core Equity Underlying Funds




	▪     Total Return Underlying Funds




	▪     Bond Underlying Funds






	 







	 



	To a lesser extent the Upgrader Fund may also invest a portion of its assets in Aggressive Equity Underlying Funds, which may invest in more concentrated portfolios or in small-cap, mid-cap or less-seasoned companies, or may make significant use of complex investment techniques, such as leverage, short sales and margin.  They may also include the use of derivative securities such as options, futures and swap contracts for hedging and/or speculative purposes.  Aggressive Equity Underlying Funds may be riskier than Core Equity Underlying Funds, but may hold the potential for higher reward.  Aggressive Equity Funds allow the Fund to participate in more specialized stock market leadership trends, such as rotations between specific sectors or within emerging markets.  The Upgrader Fund may hold up to 50% of its assets in Underlying Funds that focus on emerging markets.




	 






	See “More about the Funds’ Investment Objectives, Strategies and Risks – The Advisor’s Process for Classifying the Underlying Funds” for more information on this system.






	 



	 





	 






	2










	 






	 





	Principal Risks




	An investment in the Upgrader Fund entails risk.  The Upgrader Fund cannot guarantee that it will meet its investment objective.  Since the price of the Underlying Funds that the Upgrader Fund holds may fluctuate, the value of your investment may fluctuate and you could lose all or a portion of your investment in the Upgrader Fund.  The following risks could affect the value of your investment:



	 







	·






	General Market Risk – General market risk is the risk that the value of a Fund’s shares will fluctuate based on the performance of the securities held by the Underlying Funds it owns.  These fluctuations may cause a security to be worth less than its cost when originally purchased or less than it was worth at an earlier time.












	·






	Management Risk – Management risk describes the Upgrader Fund’s ability to meet its investment objective based on the Advisor’s success or failure to implement investment strategies for the Upgrader Fund.












	·






	Foreign Securities Risk – The Underlying Funds held by the Upgrader Fund may have significant investments in foreign securities.  Foreign securities risk entails risk relating to political, social and economic developments abroad and differences between U.S. and foreign regulatory requirements and market practices.












	·






	Emerging Markets Risk – In addition to the foreign securities risks mentioned above, emerging markets are generally more volatile and less liquid.












	·






	Derivative Risk – Some Underlying Funds may use derivative instruments which derive their value from the value of an underlying asset, currency or index.  The value of derivatives may rise or fall more rapidly than other investments and it is possible to lose more than the initial amount invested.












	·






	Leverage Risk – Some Underlying Funds may borrow money for leveraging and will incur interest expense.  Leverage is investment exposure which exceeds the initial amount invested.  Leverage can cause the portfolio to lose more than the principal amount invested.  Leverage can magnify the portfolio’s gains and losses and therefore increase its volatility.












	·






	Short Sales Risk – The Underlying Funds may engage in short sales which could cause an Underlying Fund’s investment performance to suffer if it is required to close out a short position earlier than it had intended.












	·






	Small Company Risk – The Underlying Funds may invest in securities of small companies, which involves greater volatility than investing in larger and more established companies.












	·






	Sector Emphasis Risk – Some of the Underlying Funds may have particular emphasis in one or more sectors, subjecting that Underlying Fund to sector emphasis risk.  Sector emphasis risk is the possibility that a certain sector may underperform other sectors or the market as a whole.












	·






	ETF Trading Risk – Because the Upgrader Fund invests in ETFs, it is subject to additional risks that do not apply to conventional mutual funds, including the risks that the market price of an ETF’s shares may trade at a discount to its net asset value (“NAV”), an active secondary trading market may not develop or be maintained, or trading may be halted by the exchange in which the ETFs trade, which may impact a Fund’s ability to sell its shares of an ETF.












	·






	Portfolio Turnover Risk – To the extent the Upgrader Fund invests in ETFs, it may be subject to the risks of having a high portfolio turnover rate.  High portfolio turnover involves correspondingly greater expenses to a Fund, including brokerage commissions or dealer mark-ups and other transaction costs on the sale of securities and reinvestments in other securities.












	·






	Upgrading Strategy Risk – The Upgrader Fund employs an Upgrading strategy whereby it continually seeks to invest in the top-performing securities at a given time.  When investment decisions are based on near-term performance, however, the Upgrader Fund may be exposed to the risk of buying Underlying Funds immediately following a sudden, brief surge in performance that may be followed by a subsequent drop in market value.












	·






	Underlying Funds Risk – The risks associated with the Upgrader Fund include the risks related to each Underlying Fund in which the Upgrader Fund invests.  Although the Upgrader Fund seeks to reduce the risk of your investment by diversifying among mutual funds and ETFs that invest in stocks and, in some cases, bonds, there are inherent risks of investing in various asset classes.  The Fund must also pay its pro rata portion of an investment company’s fees and expenses.








	 





	Performance




	The following performance information provides some indication of the risks of investing in the Upgrader Fund.  The bar chart below illustrates how the

	 

	Upgrader Fund’s total returns have varied from year to year.  The table below illustrates how the Upgrader Fund’s average annual total returns for the 1-year, 5-year and 10-year periods compare with a domestic broad-based market index and secondary index provided to offer a broader market perspective.  The Upgrader Fund’s performance, before and after taxes is not necessarily an indication of how the Upgrader Fund will perform in the future.  Updated performance is available on the Upgrader Fund’s website at www.upgraderfunds.com.

	The “Return After Taxes on Distributions” shows the effect of taxable distributions (dividends and capital gains distributions), but assumes that you still hold Fund shares at the end of the period.  The “Return After Taxes on Distributions and Sale of Fund Shares” shows the effect of both taxable distributions and any taxable gain or loss that would be realized if a Fund’s shares were sold at the end of the specified period.  The after-tax returns are calculated using the highest individual federal marginal income tax rates in effect and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes.  Your actual after-tax returns depend on your tax situation and may differ from those shown.  The after-tax returns are not relevant if you hold your Fund shares through a tax-deferred account, such as a 401(k) plan or an individual retirement account (“IRA”).

Asset  Allocation 
One of our goals is to help our clients, subscribers and fund  shareholders make logical asset allocation decisions. We believe  effective asset allocation leads to investing in the combination of stocks,  bonds and cash that has the best chance of achieving your short-term and  long-term investment goals. 
Investors have limited choices: stocks, bonds and cash.  Most investors understand that they  can’t reach their investment goals by holding only cash, but are concerned  about the volatility of the stock market and the very low yields offered by  bonds. 
Asset Allocation Basics
Risk versus return is a perpetual trade-off, and only you  can determine what kind of potential return you may be willing to forego in  order to potentially lower your near-term risk of losses.
Understand the Risk of Different Investments
If  you invest in stocks, accept that there will be months, and even years that  your portfolio loses money; if you invest in bonds, accept that it will take  you longer to achieve your goals.
Don’t  put money into stock funds if you’ll need it in the next few years, and make  sure you are committed to following your strategy for at least that long,  regardless of market volatility or economic news.
Balance your  Equity/Fixed Income Allocation
  An  allocation to fixed income helps manage daily stock market volatility. Fixed  income provides a buffer against some of the more erratic periods in the stock  market. Because bonds don’t have the same growth potential as stocks, most  investors need a combination of both stocks for growth and bonds to manage  stability.
Cash Has a Place
  Cash  does have its place in your allocation. Prudent investors keep a minimum of the  next couple of year’s worth of living expenses out of the market. 
Your Allocation Will Change Over Time
  Whatever  allocation you use, however, make sure to align your portfolio with your goals,  time horizon, and your tolerance for risk. And  try not to get distracted by things beyond  your control.
Be  sure to revisit your allocation as time passes. Your portfolio mix should  change as you get closer to when you’ll be using the money you’ve invested.

Model Fixed Income Portfolio
Flexible Income Portfolio
The Monthly Flexible Income Portfolio (MFIP) on page 3 of the newsletter is a more conservative portfolio that may be used on its own or in conjunction with equity portfolios such as the MUP.
Flexible Income Portfolio At-A-Glance

Primary goal is reasonable total return with low volatility, rather than monthly income.
Less sensitivity to interest rates than a portfolio composed of only bond funds.

Flexible Income Strategy
We invest in the areas of fixed income that have the best relative performance and then we compare each fund against its peers. We also may use fixed-income alternatives, such as low volatility equity funds.

Overview

Prices & Dividends


The Upgrader Fund (FUNDX) received the prestigious 2016 Lipper Fund Award for best-in-class performance for the Mixed-Asset Target Allocation Aggressive Growth Funds category among 39 funds-of-funds for the three years ending November 30, 2015.
 
Lipper Fund Awards honor mutual funds that have excelled in delivering consistently stronger performance than their peers. Lipper’s Mixed-Asset Target Allocation Aggressive Growth category includes funds-of-funds that maintain at least 80% of assets in equity securities, with the remainder invested in bonds, cash, and cash equivalents.
 
FUNDX, our flagship fund, invests in a diversified portfolio of equity mutual funds and ETFs.
Following our most popular growth model, FUNDX targets 70% in core equity funds, with 30% in more aggressive underlying funds and ETFs.
The FundX Upgrader Fund is designed for investors who would like to participate in the long-term growth potential of an actively managed global stock portfolio. We believe FUNDX can serve as the foundation of a well-diversified portfolio.
Investors in FUNDX should have a time horizon of at least five years.

Disclosure

Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. The FundX Upgrader Funds (“Funds) are considered “funds of funds” and an investor will indirectly bear the principal risks and its share of the fees and expenses of the underlying funds. Shareholders will pay higher expenses than they would if they invested directly in the underlying funds. The Funds employ an “Upgrading” strategy whereby investment decisions are based on near-term performance, however, the Funds may be exposed to the risk of buying underlying funds immediately following a sudden, brief surge in performance that may be followed by a subsequent drop in market value. The Sustainable Impact Fund’s sustainable impact investment policy, which incorporates an analysis of environmental, social and corporate governance factors, may result in the Fund foregoing opportunities to buy certain Underlying Funds when it might otherwise be advantageous to do so, or selling its holdings in certain Underlying Funds for sustainable impact investment reasons when it might be otherwise disadvantageous for it to do so. The Funds invest in underlying funds and these underlying funds may invest in securities of small companies, which involve greater volatility than investing in larger, more established companies, or they may invest in foreign securities, which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods; these risks are greater for investments in emerging markets. The underlying funds may invest in debt securities, which typically decrease in value when interest rates rise; this risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities. Lower-rated and non-rated securities present a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher rated securities. While the Upgrader Funds are diversified, the underlying funds may invest in a limited number of issuers and therefore may be considered nondiversified. The underlying funds may engage in short sales; an underlying fund’s investment performance may suffer if it is required to close out a short position earlier than intended. Some underlying funds may borrow money for leveraging and will incur interest expense. Some underlying funds may use derivatives, which involve risks different from, and in certain cases, greater than the risks presented by more traditional investments. ETFs are subject to additional risks that do not apply to conventional mutual funds, including the risks that the market price of an ETF’s shares may trade at a discount to its net asset value, an active secondary trading market may not develop or be maintained, or trading may be halted by the exchange in which they trade, which may impact a Fund’s ability to sell its shares. The underlying funds may invest in asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities, which involve additional risks such as credit risk, prepayment risk, possible illiquidity and default, and increased susceptibility to adverse economic developments.
Past performance does not guarantee future results. While the Funds are no-load, management fees and other expenses will apply. The Fund is offered only to United States residents, and information on this site is intended only for such persons. Nothing on this web site should be considered a solicitation to buy or an offer to sell shares of the Fund in any jurisdiction where the offer or solicitation would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. Before you invest in the FundX Funds, please refer to the prospectus for important information about the investment company, including investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. You may also obtain a prospectus by calling 866-455-3863. The prospectus should be read carefully before you invest or send money.
The FundX Upgrader Funds are distributed by Quasar Distributors, LLC.

Disclosure

Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. The FundX Upgrader Funds (“Funds) are considered “funds of funds” and an investor will indirectly bear the principal risks and its share of the fees and expenses of the underlying funds. Shareholders will pay higher expenses than they would if they invested directly in the underlying funds. The Funds employ an “Upgrading” strategy whereby investment decisions are based on near-term performance, however, the Funds may be exposed to the risk of buying underlying funds immediately following a sudden, brief surge in performance that may be followed by a subsequent drop in market value. The Sustainable Impact Fund’s sustainable impact investment policy, which incorporates an analysis of environmental, social and corporate governance factors, may result in the Fund foregoing opportunities to buy certain Underlying Funds when it might otherwise be advantageous to do so, or selling its holdings in certain Underlying Funds for sustainable impact investment reasons when it might be otherwise disadvantageous for it to do so. The Funds invest in underlying funds and these underlying funds may invest in securities of small companies, which involve greater volatility than investing in larger, more established companies, or they may invest in foreign securities, which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods; these risks are greater for investments in emerging markets. The underlying funds may invest in debt securities, which typically decrease in value when interest rates rise; this risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities. Lower-rated and non-rated securities present a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher rated securities. While the Upgrader Funds are diversified, the underlying funds may invest in a limited number of issuers and therefore may be considered nondiversified. The underlying funds may engage in short sales; an underlying fund’s investment performance may suffer if it is required to close out a short position earlier than intended. Some underlying funds may borrow money for leveraging and will incur interest expense. Some underlying funds may use derivatives, which involve risks different from, and in certain cases, greater than the risks presented by more traditional investments. ETFs are subject to additional risks that do not apply to conventional mutual funds, including the risks that the market price of an ETF’s shares may trade at a discount to its net asset value, an active secondary trading market may not develop or be maintained, or trading may be halted by the exchange in which they trade, which may impact a Fund’s ability to sell its shares. The underlying funds may invest in asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities, which involve additional risks such as credit risk, prepayment risk, possible illiquidity and default, and increased susceptibility to adverse economic developments.
Past performance does not guarantee future results. While the Funds are no-load, management fees and other expenses will apply. The Fund is offered only to United States residents, and information on this site is intended only for such persons. Nothing on this web site should be considered a solicitation to buy or an offer to sell shares of the Fund in any jurisdiction where the offer or solicitation would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. Before you invest in the FundX Funds, please refer to the prospectus for important information about the investment company, including investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. You may also obtain a prospectus by calling 866-455-3863. The prospectus should be read carefully before you invest or send money.

Classes 1, 2, and 3 inception 6/30/1980.  Class 4 inception 12/31/1986.
                ** Results are computed by  The Hulbert Financial Digest and Hulbert Ratings, LLC..
Disclosures:
			NoLoad FundX is published by FundX Investment Group  and incorporates the firm's Upgrading strategy. The performance data above  shows model portfolio performance results.   Such results do not represent actual trading and may not reflect the  impact that material economic and market factors might have had on FundX's  decision-making if FundX were actually managing clients' money.
Funds and ETFs included in the newsletter are  segregated into four risk classes based on historical volatility. Class 1 is  invested primarily in sector and specialized stock funds; high risk and  volatility.  Class 2 is invested  primarily in stock funds seeking capital appreciation; above average risk and  volatility.  Class 3 is invested  primarily in stock funds seeking long term capital appreciation; average risk.
Monthly Upgrader Portfolio (MUP) is a core of Class  3 funds (typically 70%), and includes funds from Classes 1 and 2 (typically  30%).  With the exception of exchange  traded funds, MUP funds are held for at least 90 days.
Funds are reviewed periodically and may be moved to  a different risk class if it is determined that recent performance justifies a  change. Class 3 is our recommended risk category for building a core portfolio  of mutual funds for long-term growth. The universe of funds in the four risk  classes is not constant and includes both actively and passively managed funds.  FundX managed accounts may experience different results.
The average annual return reflected in the chart  (14.1%) is the average annual return for Class 3 funds only.
Hulbert Ratings, LLC and Hulbert Financial Digest are  independent data services that track the performance of investment newsletters.  Hulbert began tracking NoLoad FundX in mid-1980. 
The Hulbert Financial Digest was closed at the end  of January, 2016. Mark Hulbert formed Hulbert Ratings LLC in 2016. Hulbert  Ratings LLC calculates newsletter performance from the date The Hulbert  Financial Digest was closed, using The Hulbert Financial Digest pre-closing  calculations as the base, and calculating all followed newsletter performance  on its own since that time. 
For the performance of Classes 1, 2, 3, and 4,  Hulbert follows the Star Boxes. Initially, the Star Boxes mechanically updated  to the top five funds (excluding any funds with redemption fees longer than 30  days). In 2012, the Star Boxes became managed portfolios: starting then, each fund  was held a minimum of 90 days (ETFs may be held for shorter periods), and was  “sold” when its rank falls below our set sell threshold. Such changes to the  methodology over time may have had either a positive or negative effect on the  performance results.
Hulbert’s methodology involves subscribing  anonymously to each newsletter being tracked and executing recommended trades  at the prices prevailing when an anonymous subscriber would have first been  able to act on the recommendation. Specifically:

If the  recommendation is received before the opening of NYSE trading, the recommended  trade is executed at the average of the security’s high and low prices in that  day’s session.
If the  recommendation is received after the NYSE opens but before the close of  trading, the trade is executed at that day’s closing price.
If the  recommendation is received after the close of NYSE trading, the trade is  executed at the average of the security’s high and low prices in the subsequent  day’s session.

Regardless of whether a market order is executed at  the closing or the average price, however, Hulbert adjusts that price upwards  (when buying) or downwards (when selling) according to an estimate of that  security’s bid-offer spread on that day.
Hulbert debits a commission on all transactions,  the rate of which is based on average commissions at the nation’s largest  discount brokers on average-sized transactions. (This rate changes periodically  to reflect current conditions.) Taxes and any outside management fees are not  included. If applicable, these additional costs would have a negative impact on  one's actual returns.
Actual results fluctuate in value on a daily basis  and therefore intra-year results would be different (either better or worse)  than those shown. Some of the most volatile periods have historically occurred  and corrected themselves within a given year. In 2000, for example, the S&P  500 lost 9.1% for the calendar year but lost as much as 15% between 3/24 and  12/21. All of the indexes shown are for comparison purposes only. Both the  indexes and model portfolio assume reinvestment of dividends and capital gains.  They do not represent actual investments and are simply used as commonly seen  benchmarks to demonstrate the general market environment in each of the  calendar years shown. While the model portfolio invests in mutual funds that  have internal fees reflected in the reported performance, the benchmark indexes  do not include management fees.
The S&P 500 is a stock market index that tracks  the 500 most widely held large capitalization stocks on the New York Stock  Exchange or NASDAQ. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is a  price-weighted average of 30 large capitalization stocks traded on the New York  Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the NASDAQ, a global electronic marketplace for  buying and selling securities.
The NASDAQ Composite Index is the market  capitalization-weighted index of approximately 3,000 common equities listed on  the NASDAQ stock exchange, including American depositary receipts, common  stocks, real estate investment trusts (REITs) and tracking stocks, as well as  limited partnership interests. 
The MSCI ACWI (Morgan Stanley Capital International  All Country World Index) is comprised of stocks from both developed and  emerging markets. 
The indices assume the reinvestment of capital gains  and dividends, but do not reflect the deduction of management fees. 
As with all historical data, past performance is  not an indication of future results. Investments in equity mutual funds such as  those reflected in the performance figures above carry an inherent element of  risk including the potential for an actual loss of principal. Actual results  may vary.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

A Time-tested Approach to Fund Investing
Upgrading strategy is a logical, time-tested approach to  investing that’s been confirmed by decades of academic and industry research as  well as FundX’s real world track record.
 Funds that have done well recently tend to continue to do  well in the coming months and even years. Academics call this "persistence  of performance", and they’ve been studying it for decades. Morningstar  found evidence of it in its 2016 study, “Performance Persistence Among U.S. Mutual  Funds”.
 Upgrading is a disciplined, three-step process that’s designed  to capitalize on the persistence of performance of funds and ETFs.

 Step 1: Be selective.
We  carefully screen the fund universe to help you build diversified fund  portfolios and avoid unnecessary costs and risks. We focus on established  noload funds that are available to retail investors through most brokers, and  we seek out ETFs that trade well and have good liquidity.
 Step 2: Manage risk.
We  group funds by risk, separating the most aggressive funds from the most conservative,  so you’ll know upfront if a fund is a core diversified fund or a volatile  sector fund.
 Our risk classes mix growth and  value funds, international and domestic funds, and large- and small-cap funds so  that you can easily spot the funds are doing well now. 
  Step 3: Invest in funds with  strong recent returns.
We rank funds by recent returns and invest in  the funds at the top of the ranks. We sell funds that don’t continue to perform  well and reinvest in new top performers -- a process we call Upgrading. 

  Money Magazine called our Upgrading strategy “the Leapfrog  Approach to Fund Investing”.  It has helped thousands of investors use  mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to build wealth, navigate changing  markets, and meet lifelong investment goals since 1969.
