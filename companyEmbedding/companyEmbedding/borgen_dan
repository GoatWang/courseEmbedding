Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the USD Partners LP First Quarter 2017 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Ashley Means, Director of Finance and Investor Relations for opening remarks.
Please go ahead.
Ashley Means
Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Welcome to our first quarter 2017 earnings call. With me today are Dan Borgen our Chief Executive Officer; Adam Altsuler, our Chief Financial Officer; Brad Sanders, our Chief Commercial Officer; as well as several others members of our senior management team.
Yesterday evening, we issued a press release announcing results for the 3 months ended March 31, 2017. If you would like a copy of the press release, you can find one on our website at usdpartners.com.
Before Dan and Adam proceed with the prepared remarks, please note that the safe harbor disclosure statement regarding forward-looking statements and last night's press release applies to the statements of management on this call. Also please note that information presented on today's call speaks only as of today, May 4, 2017. Any time-sensitive information provided may no longer be accurate at the time of any webcast replay or reading of the transcript.
Finally, today's call will include discussion of non-GAAP financial measures. Please see last night's press release for reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dan Borgen.
Dan Borgen
Thank you, Ashley. Good morning, everybody, and as always, thanks for joining us. We're happy to be here today to report on results of the business and the progress we are making on various commercial fronts.
The macro continues to point in our favor, as you all have obviously read, and we're continuing to be very bullish about the prospects of our business. We're going to do things a little different today, I hope you don't mind and would love to hear your feedback on it. But Adam's going to start us off and go over the highlights of the quarter. Then I'd like to give a few comments and thoughts on recent industry developments and address a few of the commonly discussed topics and maybe questions that aren't asked. We'll try to ask them ourselves and try to have an effective way of communicating what we feel like the answers are to some of those, and responses. And we really appreciate you all letting us know how this works for you.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Adam and let him go over the last of the scripted remarks, so.
Adam Altsuler
Thank you, Dan. And thanks for joining us on the call this morning.
For the first quarter, we reported net cash provided by operating activities of $12.8 million, adjusted EBITDA of $15.4 million and distributable cash flow of $12.3 million. Our results reflect the stable and predictable nature of our cash flows from primarily investment grade customers, with approximately 95% of our adjusted EBITDA before corporate expenses generated from take-or-pay contracts.
For the first quarter of 2017 relative to the first quarter of 2016, net cash provided by operating activities increased by 39%, while adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow increased by 7% and 12%, respectively. These increases were primarily driven by a reduction in operating expenses due to one-time costs associated with the integration of the Casper terminal during the first quarter of '16 and were partially offset by higher interest expense associated with the Partnership’s revolving credit facility.

Distributable cash flow for the first quarter of 2017 also benefited from an approximate $1.1 million decrease in cash paid for income taxes, primarily due to the receipt of the remaining cash refund, which is approximately CAD 860,000, as well as lower Canadian income taxes paid during the quarter. Net income, which increased 142% relative to the first quarter of 2016, also benefited from additional Terminalling services revenue due to the recognition of greater amounts of previously deferred revenues in the current period as compared to the prior year. Additionally, the value of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar strengthened to a lesser extent during the quarter as compared to the first quarter of 2016, which resulted in smaller non-cash losses from changes in fair value of the Partnerships derivative instruments.
On April 27, the Partnership declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.335 per unit or $1.34 per unit on an annualized basis, which represents growth of 1.5% relative to the fourth quarter of 2016 and 8.9% relative to the first quarter of 2016. The distribution is payable on May 12, to unitholders of record as of the close of business on May 8. During the first quarter, the Partnership repaid all amounts previously outstanding on its Canadian term loan facility. As a result, the Partnerships revolving credit facility comprises the full $400 million of capacity under its credit agreement, subject to limits set forth therein.
As of March 31, the Partnership had total available liquidity of approximately 192 million, including 4.2 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and undrawn borrowed capacity of $188 million on its $400 million senior secured credit facility, subject to continued compliance with financial covenants. The Partnership is in compliance with its financial covenants and has no maturities under its senior secured credit facility until October 2019.
And with that, I will turn the call back over to Dan.
Dan Borgen
Thank you, Adam. Appreciate it. All right, now, we're going to go to more of an informal kind of Q&A here. And so what I'll do is I'm going to just through some of the topics. We'll try to answer -- you'll hear from as many of us as can comment on it, and then we'll finish up at the end with some Q&A. And I'll give a few closing comments as we close the meeting. So again, thanks for being here.
Let's talk about recent industry activity, so recent events in Western Canada, some announcements of consolidation. You've seen the announcements by Suncor, CNRL, Cenovus and others up there. So what does that mean? Is that good for the Partnership? Not good for the Partnership? What does that look like? Our view is, and in talking with -- many of these are our customers, so we have a good opportunity to talk with them.
We now have a situation where some of these were partnerships, Joint Ventures, we now have owned in strong hands, single ownership and investment grade hands, we're increasing their ownership in the oil sands in Western Canada. We think that this is very positive because now, this is their primary focus. They don't have Permian. They don't have other areas that they're looking at outside of Canada for the most part. They are strictly focused on developing this significant resource that they have and significant asset base. So we think that that's very positive.
We think that there will be more production than has been contemplated to date. They're not carrying along a partner that was distracted with other capital projects. They now have a very renewed focus. And quite frankly, a fresh spend that they need to return on. They're going to return on that, obviously, by synergistic benefits, lowering their cost in the field, as they've been able to prove and do and also, to be able to grow and add additional reserves by production. So I think that's exciting for us, and I think it just further proves the point that folks are doubling down up there in strong, strong hands.

The additional thing is syncrude fire. What's happened up there relative to in-plant fires and different things like that? So obviously, it's a supply, inventory, production type of model. So you get production, production goes into inventory, you sell out of inventory into the market. If you're down on the production side, you've got, what's going to happen? You're going to continue to sell produce out of inventory. So then when you start coming back online, you're going to fill inventory back. So that has a potential delay in an oversupplied market in that localized area. Not, it doesn't disappear. It's simply a short delay.
As you've seen announcements in the press recently, that has restarted and looks to be running in excess of 140,000 barrels a day today. And they look to ramp up to full production sometime early June to mid-June. So we're still very confident in the upcoming demand cycle that we've been talking about, and that's been more commonly reported now across the board, both in Canada and here in the U.S. by distinguished sources. So we continue to feel very bullish. I know we've been a bit alone on that coming out of the gate 2 years ago, talking about the demand story in Canada. But it's real. It's happening. We're seeing it. And it's being confirmed in the market.
Brad, do you have any other thoughts on that?
Brad Sanders
Yes. Thank you, Dan.
So what the upgrader fire represents are all the things that Dan shared with you; it was unplanned, was temporary in nature, so it's basically a blip on a macro story that we've been sharing with you all, and so that's, I think the key point is that the macro story's intact. There are unplanned events that will, in most cases, potentially delay when that materializes. For example, the 4 MAC fires of last summer materially impacted supply available in the market. Therefore, that supply impact and the eventual impact on the supply versus take away balances up in Western Canada were impacted this winter. It's well-known, well-documented that production was impacted by the extreme cold. We have new pipelines being built, we have new tanks being built. Those are one-time demand events that take oil off the market.
So the point of even talking about the upgraders is to remind folks that the path to the likelihood of moving to rail parity for a significant period of time can be impacted temporarily by events that we cannot predict or influence by any means. So we feel very, very strongly about the macro, and that is being validated by the quality of our discussions on recontracting, both at CCR and at Hardisty. We're in detailed discussions with both producers and refiners, and they are validating the macro story we're talking about, and very much validating the value story that we've shared with you in previous discussions, about the role of rail and their portfolio, and specifically, the role in rail when you're in an imbalance of supply versus demand.
Dan Borgen
Great. I like it. Great summary. All right. Let me move to re-contracting. We've addressed that point. I know it's probably towards the top of the list for you all in terms of, as it is with any midstream company, is the re-contracting risk and around that. And you've heard me say before, the ideal situation is to have those re-contracting periods come up during high demand so that there's proper leverage in the market to get the same price to higher price or extended term because of demand on cycle. We're fortunate that our contracts that are coming up are -- will be in that cycle. They -- all market trends point to that.
So how do we confirm that? How do we see that? Well, we have customers at the table now talking about renewals, extensions, offers, counteroffers. We also have industry knowledge from folks like the railcar providers, those kinds of folks, that some of our customers and new customers that are connected in and around our assets are seeking to expand and -- their need for additional railcars to support the growing demand story. So it's not just us saying it. It's -- we're seeing it in the market. You're hearing from leadership at the -- a lot of our customers and potential new customers that are saying, we didn't think we were going to need rail, use rail. But we're going to be using rail.

And one CEO, as recent as yesterday, made a public statement around, don't fear, rail is here. We're going to use that. I should have used that term, quite frankly. That sounds pretty good to me. But anyway, the rail is here and we -- rail's been around a long time. It's a proven delivery source. We've got competitive rates out there from railroads. We've got -- it's a good position to be in as it relates to being able to move product ratably, dependably, safely through the system.
And so customers, existing, are looking to fully utilize spots and grow that. We have new customers at the table that are looking to sign up for multiyear agreements that we look forward to announcing and talking about in the near future. And remember, the underlying value of rail is that, if you want to talk about it in a, I'll say a worse case, is a peaking facility, to be able to handle the overload, to be able to handle pipeline disruptions, and it's a low-cost alternative for that. We've seen that for 25 years. And so this is nothing new that I'm talking about. We -- you've heard me to say that we are not an opposer of pipelines. We think that pipeline's do a wonderful program.
They do -- if you want to go from point A to point B, it's great. If you have high-quality product and you put in a pipeline, unless it's really batched and moved in batches, you lose some of that value. So if you're a spec quality guy coming out, which a lot of the customers in Canada are, they want to preserve that quality. They feel like that they can best preserve that quality running it through rail alongside pipeline.
So there are different means. We think this is a strong portfolio contributor to the overall transportation message coming out of Canada.
Brad, thoughts?
Brad Sanders
Yes. One thing I would like to encourage people on the phone to do is to reference our investor deck. And on the investor deck, you'll see a lot of this information. You'll see the producer deck that shows the oil, the various producers, the locations of their production when it comes on, the quality of their production. And equally important, you'll see that most of that oil is headed towards Hardisty. And you'll also see that a lot of this new production is being produced by customers who are current and are comfortable with rail commitments and have seen the benefits of it. That's what's really important here.
We're in,\ the Canadian market is unique. We're talking about a 5-year investment, 5-or-longer year investment cycles from a production side and from a takeaway standpoint. That creates an enormous amount of uncertainty and an enormous amount of consequences, potential consequences if the production cycle and the takeaway cycle aren't aligned. Rail bridges that uncertainty. It has a sustainable demand for that single purpose.
As an example, when we were at 40 under 2 to 3 years ago and it drove incremental commitments and build outs of rail takeaway capacity, that was a tailwind, a benefit for prices going from 40 under to 15 to 10 under as they are today. So even though during that period, we had utilization rates lower than what was planned, the price benefit was enjoyed by the industry, primarily, the producers, who, quite frankly, are the ones who worry most, if not the singular people who worry most about takeaway. So the role of rail bridging this uncertainty, whether it's 110% utilized or low utilization, the benefits are real.
So that's a key story for rail, sustainability, why it fits in a portfolio and the ultimate benefits of value.
Dan Borgen
Well said.
The other thing we talk about, there's always a pipeline. When is Excel going to come on? Is it going to come on? There are different views of that from folks in Canada. We're a believer that it probably will come on. But when, that continues to be, probably, a debate. There continue to be barriers placed in front of some of those programs. So again, these production, new production volumes are completed, being brought on. You can't turn them off. These are production facilities, I guess, you could turn them off, but at the risk of billions of dollars sitting idle, which is not the intent of the customer. So they're going to bring them on, turn them on and run them and produce them.

So we don't know when the pipelines are going to be built. People ask us, "What do you think?" Some say 2020, some say 2022, some say not at all, some say they'll be tied up in court. That's not ours to pine. We're not going to pine on it and give a view, but all we know is we've got customers at the table that need what we have to offer, plan on using it, and we look forward to fulfilling that.
Let's talk about -- shifting gears, talk about our M&A process. Last call, we talked about purchasing a new destination terminal. And what I can update you on, and I was hopeful that we would be able to have an announcement of its closure. We are closer. We are -- it's a multi-agreement-type transaction, and so it's a bit more, as everyone is, complicated. But we're nearing the conclusion of that. We are highly confident of that. And what that will do is, I think it will continue to show the market the capability of rail, the customer commitment to rail, the ongoing use of it as a solution and the flexibility of rail.
And I'll talk a little bit more about that, hopefully, in the near future, as we can make additional announcements around that. Sometimes, we get asked about, what is the division of the Partnership in terms of diversity? Are you always going to solidly rail? Look, we think rail -- as we've said, rail for us, for 25 years -- over 25 years, has been a core component of the business. We think we know it as well as anyone. We think it drives the solutions that -- provide solutions that we've talked about previously.
But do we have plans to diversify into more conventional, I'll call it midstream-type assets? And yes, we do. We have -- we've been purchasing, as you've seen, more conventional tank -- shore pipeline positions. We're looking to diversify into that space even more. We're looking to -- as we develop out our TexasDeepwater facility, we're -- that's more of a conventional docks, tanks, pipeline connectivity, traditional solutions. But we do look for that. And remember that our rail terminals today and our products terminals today are both inbound and outbound. We've got -- we just -- we made a recent announcement on an NGL at the parent. It's a new product. It's underpinned by a five year deal. It's small today, we're growing it but totally inbound into the terminal.
And so as we have said before, we will continue to grow that, and once the commercial risk is out of it, then we'll look to drop it into the MLP, as appropriate. I think it also shows that we're working well and being creative with our customers and fitting the needs that they have of both outbound and inbound, whether that's Hardisty, Casper, any of the terminals that we have and looking to grow, we're looking for that -- continue to look to meet customer demand and create flexibility and optionality around that, that we're uniquely positioned to be able to provide. We also announced that we had increased our capacity at -- for a LACT unit at Casper, again, driven by customer activity; again, small-scale, growing, we've commercialized it, it's working, it's producing revenue, and we'd look forward to talking more about its growth in the near term.
I mentioned TexasDeepwater. And let me just remind you of how that strategically fits us. So whether you're a heavy crude barrel coming out of Canada, it needs, if you talk to our producing customers, what they will tell you that they need is they need access to deepwater, they need access to a strong refining market; they need access to blend components; they want to be able to barge it, ship it, blend it, pipeline it. And so we're not sitting here saying we've got the solutions to everybody. But with TexasDeepwater, we can, we are developing that exact facility with the traditional way that we've done it; with commercial agreements that are multiyear, primarily investment grade-backed; that we will get that program developed to meet the need of that heavy barrel coming out of Canada. Where does that barrel primarily want to go? If you ask our customers, it primarily wants to go to a heavy demand center; heavy, pun intended, both a large demand as well as a heavy crude oil demand. And that's what we have in the Houston Gulf Coast with over 74% of refineries burning intermediates to heavies.

Our refining customers, on the other hand, that's why they made commitments at Casper, which will be able to take low-cost feed coming out of Canada and creating a, reaching further up the supply chain to be able to deliver barrels into, by rail, into the Houston Gulf Coast.
Again, they have the need for inbound rail, destination rail facilities, and that's what we're developing at TexasDeepwater.
In addition to that, pipeline barrels coming out of the Permian, what do they want? What are they going to need? As we all know, we've got light sweet abundance here in the U.S. As the marginal producer, arguably here in the, globally, we have an overabundance and a growing potential overabundance of light sweet that is going to need to find export alternatives. Now, if you know you want to go export, there're markets that you can go, Corpus, other places that you can pipe into, load out and run ships. But if you want optimum flexibility, you'd like to come to the Houston Ship Channel. Come to the channel, be able to blend off with a heavy barrel, be able to make a refiner spec, have a barge capability, have a deepwater capability. Again, that's what we're trying to do.
Whether it be pipeline from West Texas, whether it be rail or pipeline coming out of Canada, they all need the same thing. That's what we're providing at TexasDeepwater. That's how it fits us strategically in terms of a large destination catcher's mitt in the Houston Gulf Coast.
So with that, let me turn it over to Josh, and he can talk a little bit more about the specifics around that, and what you'll be hearing more about us talking about with that project.
Joshua Ruple
Thanks, Dan. I think first, just a quick description of the asset. Size and scale matters in regards to these types of development activities; and TexasDeepwater is 1,000 acres in size. It's located right in the middle of all of the activity in regards to the movement of energy products within the Houston Ship Channel.
Pace also matters. We've worked really hard over the last year to position that asset, to be able to develop that asset quickly as the commercial opportunities materialize. We're in a position now at TexasDeepwater where our permitting activities are nearing completion in the next few months. We literally will be in position to start development very near term. That's a good thing for us from a competitive perspective. It's also a good thing for us as it relates to meeting our customers' needs because those needs are now and we're able to deliver a now solution.
Another thing that's important, I think, for us to know, in regards to TexasDeepwater is that it's an asset today that's producing revenue. We have railcar activities, both storage and working on some transloading revenue plays. We have a soon-to-be waterborne activity related to some barge movements on the Houston Ship channel. We have revenues generated by our dredge site, that is the largest and most competitive dredge spoil facility on the Houston Ship Channel, something we're extremely excited about.
And also, we control a large number of pipeline easements that are critical, not only to our own development activities but also to all the who's who in the Houston Ship Channel that are looking to connect to each other to serve customers, moving barrels to water. So ultimately, TexasDeepwater is a really important part of our diversification strategy. It allows us to move into new areas of business, to build new types of assets. And those assets are long-term in nature, come with them really strong customers. And also, come with them the type of contracts that fit very well into the MLP story.
Dan Borgen
Okay. Thanks, Josh. Appreciate the update there. All right. Let's -- I think we've tried to cover most of the hot topics, but would love to -- anything we didn't answer, we'd love to handle now. So if there's anybody who's got questions, we'll move to those and try to answer those.

Appreciate the new format, guys, and a lot of good color there. Just some small questions for me, I guess. Just around the anticipated CBR terminal that you talked about, Dan. I guess, is there any kind of nuances there to the extent that you can talk about it as far as kind of what you need to get that kind of where to go on?
Dan Borgen
You know me, Derek. I'd love to tell you everything I know, but I can't. So I'm looking across at Keith, our General Counsel and Compliance Officer and he's shaking his head. So I can -- I guess what I can...
Brad Sanders
I would say -- this is Brad, Derek. I would say time and not much [indiscernible] if that's encouraging at all.
Dan Borgen
We feel very bullish about that. I don't know what more -- how much more confidence I can lean in on that. But we're close. We're close. I think once we announce it, you'll be able to see maybe the moving parts and why it took a little bit longer in terms of just the parts on it. But like I said before, it's going to be a good thing for the Partnership. It's going to be a strategically important asset. It's going create some additional destination connectivity. Anyway, you've heard me say before that anything that we look at, whether we build it or we buy it, it has to have its own independent terminal value, plus a good network contribution to the overall network. And this asset will do exactly that.
Derek Walker
And then Dan, I think in your remarks, you mentioned the -- kind of the NGL service at Hardisty is rather small right now, but could eventually be a drop down to USDP. I guess how do you see that kind growing over time? And is that something you'd like to see over the near-term, or it's just more of a kind of a medium to long-term kind of thought process?
Joshua Ruple
Derek, this is Josh. I can just give you a quick comment on that. We're already working on plans to scale that facility up. We have work going on right now, both technically and from an operating perspective, to scale it up. As far as our vision in drop down, Adam, you're probably best to answer that.
Adam Altsuler
Sure. I mean, as you saw in the press release, it was a take-or-pay contract. As we said, it's relatively small. It's less than $1 million of EBITDA. So we're, as we scale it up and continue to grow it and derisk it and make it more of a mature asset, we would love to drop it down.
Dan Borgen
But Derek, on a follow-up to that, I think, what that shows is the optionality that rail has, both outbound, inbound, right? So inbound, truck out; inbound, pipeline out, those types of things. And so as we have rail capacity that is evolving, we're always looking for valleys, potential valleys in the operation that we can fill. We've done that for years, to be able to look at the seasonality, fit the seasonality with new inbound or outbound opportunities that are multi-product, multi-model, that, again, fit the needs of the customers. That's the business we're in, and rail is truly flexible to be able to do that.
Derek Walker
Got it. And then just switching over to Casper. I know you're trying to capture some spot volumes there. I guess, do you have a, I know that there's some variability, but do you have a sense on how the spot volumes may kind of evolve and how that may compare to the prior contract expiration in August?
Brad Sanders
Derek, Brad. Well, given the disruptions we've talked about earlier, starting with the [MAC] fires last summer, you can see that the differentials have continued to tighten. And given that they have, the incentives to do spot volumes or utilize the assets have been reduced as a function of just incentives. So that's where we are today. That's not where we're going to be in the future. And so when we return to where there is an incentive as a function of price, to leverage rail facilities, we think we'll be, this is our opinion, we think we'll be very active either commercializing on a term basis or on a spot basis, specifically at CCR as a function of 2 critical drivers: One is, the refiners have spent the money there. They are now in business to capture value. So if we return to levels that incents activity from producer to refiners, the most advantaged asset in that regard could be CCR. And so we feel really comfortable that the refiners will seek activity there first, given the history and the assets that they've built there. I would remind folks, as we've gone through a cycle that's been tough, that has been a very active facility for us. I would remind people that is a refiner-based facility, not a producer-based facility. So that starts to differentiate why we're excited about what's going to happen from a spot basis. The final thing I would say is we're working with Enbridge and want to make sure that we optimize completely their needs and our needs as it relates to Hardisty or Gen Express and all the things that matter. So we feel really good about it.

Adam Altsuler
And one minor point, Derek, this is Adam. Just wanted to mention that the customer we mentioned last quarter, continues to be the most active shipper at the terminal.
Operator
Our next question comes from Mike Gyure with Janney.
Mike Gyure
Probably the one topic that you might not have touched on and I'll ask about it is, I guess, the crude -- I'm sorry, the two ethanol terminals in San Antonio and West Colton. How does that kind of fit into the grand scheme of things, and maybe what you're seeing in the markets kind of at those facilities? I realize they're small, but kind of just understanding kind of what you're thinking longer-term with those terminals?
Adam Altsuler
Sure. With -- it's Adam. So with regard to the whole portfolio of cash flow, it's relatively small. It's less than, I think, 5% of the cash flows of the Partnership. But we do have particular expertise in that with the senior management team, so it's something that we're always looking at expanding. We do see opportunity there both at the parent and the MLP. And we've got a good relationship with this customer. So to the extent that we could grow it, and grow it in the same way that we think about our crude business and refined product business and things like that, whether it be take-or-pay contracts supported by high credit customers, I think it could be a growing part of the portfolio, but it's just going to be kind of opportunity-based.
Brad Sanders
Mike, this is Brad. So I would actually be more positive about the space. We think that it's a great space. We think the underlying macros supports growth. We think the existing asset-base out there is probably, through time and spontaneous order, or probably the right assets at the right location. So growth can happen two ways when you go beyond E10 to -- and I'm just using E15 as an example, then you're going to get more volume through that space, but you're -- or the existing assets, but you're also going to drive new development.
We think the opportunity to move beyond E10 is real as a function of just environmental demand and drivers. But we also think, just to remind folks, that -- and we talk about ethanol specifically, but it's truly just a gasoline blending component. And as a blending component, it's got some really good things like octane value. It's got some not-so-great things like RVP. But when you combine the two, it is the cheapest octane available in the market. So we're very bullish. We think the underpinning macro, even without regulation, is very strong, because of its component value in a gasoline world. So we'd like -- we're very purposed about identifying opportunities and trying to grow that space.
Dan Borgen
Well said. I really don't have anything to add. But when I think of ethanol, and when anyone else thinks about ethanol, you really just need to think of it as an octane. And it really is a -- that's its primary function. It -- and so within demand in every gallon of gasoline from an octane enhancer. So in markets, certainly in the markets we're in.
Brad Sanders
And globally. So it's TexasDeepwater as well.
Dan Borgen
That's right. That's exactly right. So as we think about that at TexasDeepwater -- and remember, TexasDeepwater is crude, refined products and blend components. So as a blend component, for a gasoline blend stock, ethanol is the most efficient for that, and so you will see that at a, TexasDeepwater development as a component to that. So both for local and for export. Does that help answer that?
Mike Gyure
That absolutely helps answer that. And then maybe completely unrelated follow-up on kind of the rail car, I guess, supply-demand equation that you see out there, maybe compared to where you were kind of a quarter ago, 6 months ago, versus, I guess, maybe expectations for the back half of year, if you believe that sort of the demand is picking up and kin of what you see in there?

Dan Borgen
Yes, sure. Matter of fact, I had senior folks in the office yesterday talking about just the shortage. They have no cars available today. They will have to manufacture all new cars, which is a change and a positive, again, additional demand on story. And you know, it runs in cycles. And
then there's a transition in the railcar space to move to a heavier picker line car which fortunately, the cars that we have, we saw that coming and got ahead of that curve. And have, as part of our portfolio, the availability of those cars. But we continue to see tightness in the market for the heavy demand cars, for cars needed to come out of Canada. Those are the ones that are preferred to, for transportation by the railroads, and there's price incentive to do that. So we, there's a tightening in that market, as I said earlier, and we're getting it first hand from the railcar providers.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] With no further questions coming into queue, I will hand the program back over to Dan Borgen for any additional remarks.
Dan Borgen
All right. So thanks again, and we appreciate the patience on this new format. Hopefully, it's been helpful and more interactive. That's our intent. We want it to be not a scripted message. I know some of this stuff has to be, but we want to be able to share openly with you what we've got and what, how we feel about the market and the demand that's coming. We're, I'll say, comforted. People ask me a lot of times, what keeps you up at night? What doesn't keep me up at night is the demand. The demand is coming. We've verified it with the customers, by customer.
And again, refer you to the investor deck, you can see the list of that. We don't give the customer, but, for proprietary reasons, but you can see the demand on that it is coming.
So I don't, I sleep well at night about that. Timing of that? Obviously, buyers disrupt that, different things. But we feel very, very bullish about that that is going to be the event. You can't buy a spot at Hardisty today. There are no sellers of spots. Therefore, further evidencing that the customers are going to be utilizing the full extent of their spots. The operational planning in terms of ramping up that volume, crew availability, locomotive availability, all of those kinds
of things are discussions on the way to ramp up to full value and full volume. So we feel good about that. There's, all we're trying to do is keep our head down, get this transaction closed that we've been talking about, get that done, continue to look for good opportunities that fit us from a corporate development standpoint, both organically as well as acquisitions, and we've got additional parties that we're talking to about additional opportunities in that. And we look forward to talking more about those opportunities in the future.
So with that said, thanks, again, for being on the call. Please, give your feedback, if there is something we could tweak a little differently to provide additional information. Ashley is the perfect person to feedback on that.
And we'll close with that. Thanks for spending the time with us today.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the USD Partners LP fourth quarter 2016 results conference call. At this time all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode. The poll will be open for you questions following the prepared remarks [Operator Instructions].
It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Ashley Means, Director of Finance and Investor Relations, for opening remarks. Please go ahead.
Ashley Means
Good morning. And thank you for, joining us. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2016 earnings call. With me today are Dan Borgen, our Chief Executive Officer; Adam Altsuler, our Chief Financial Officer; Brad Sanders, our Chief Commercial Officer, as well as several other members of our senior management team.
Yesterday evening, we issued a press release announcing results for the three and 12-months ended December 31, 2016. If you would like a copy of the press release, you can find one on our Web site at usdpartners.com.
Before Dan and Adam proceed with the prepared remarks, please note that the Safe Harbor disclosure statements regarding forward-looking statements in last night's press release applies to the statements of management on this call. Also, please note that information presented on today's call speaks only as of today, March 9, 2017. Any time-sensitive information provided may no longer be accurate at the time of any webcast replay or reading of the transcript.
Finally, today's call will include discussion of non-GAAP financial measures. Please see last night's press release for reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dan.
Dan Borgen
Thank you, Ashley. Good morning and thank you everyone for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter results. Adam will cover more of the financial details in a minute but overall the partnership had another great quarter as a result of our highly contracted cash flows with our quality of customers, as well as the successful performance of the Casper acquisition.
This enables us to announce seventh consecutive distribution increase with more than 2 times to distribution coverage for the quarter. In recent months, our thesis about the Western Canada crude oil market has began to play out; long-haul export pipelines are running near or full utilization; a portion meant has continued to trend higher and producers have announced several new projects to increase capacity at the oil sands facilities; some of which have been previously deferred.
We expect that this new production will require new takeaway capacity, and our terminals are very well positioned at the right locations to meet customer needs in a timely and capital efficient way. Both our Hardisty and Casper terminals have scalable designs, which should provide us with a competitive advantage relative to any newly propose projects for a variety of reasons. The catalyst for re-contracting with our customers will ultimately be the spread of discount that Western Canada crude receives relative to competing grades or crude oil, such as Maya in the Gulf Coast. 
As production begins to exceed pipeline capacity, producers of Western Canada crude will begin to offer lower prices in order to incentivize refiners to utilize alternative modes of transportation to access those barrels. Already, Canada reported 14 month high for crude by rail exports during the month of December. Remember, the Partnership owns the only unit train capable terminal serving the Hardisty Hub, and the only unit train capable terminal directly connected to the express pipeline.

So, we firmly believe that our terminals represent two of the best alternatives for the industry, and that the demand for our services will continue and increase. That being said, we do have renewal risk as online stream businesses do, including a near-term contracting opportunity, resulting from the scheduled expiration of a customer contract for our Casper terminal at the end of August.
While that customer did not exercise this option to extend for another three year term, they invested in real takeaway infrastructure and originally committed at the terminal to create advantaged access to discounted feedstock for their refineries. They've stated they continue -- will continue to use the facility, and are actively involved in negotiations with us to do so.
As a reminder, Casper has been one of our most active terminals and we believe, we expect strong utilization over the next cycle. As such, we're in active dialogue with that customer, as well as potential new customers to utilize the space going forward and remain confident in the timing and quality of our discussions with both producers and refiners. In addition to term contracts, we have the capacity to serve spot volumes to Casper, which could result in throughput rates above what would receive for committed volumes.
Lastly, we are in discussions with partners and customers create new and unique ways to utilize both our rail and storage assets at Casper. Based on customer demand, we recently invested in the asset to add additional flexibility to source and deliver crude oil, which we look forward to talking about more on future calls. On the destination side, our sponsors, Texas Deepwater development in the Houston Ship Channel stands to benefit not only from the growing volumes in Western Canada, which should displace other imports into the Gulf Coast but also from the tremendous growth expected out of the Permian Basin in West Texas.
We estimate that recent announcements of additional Permian pipeline capacity with delivery into the Houston area will translate into demand for over 15 million barrels of crude storage plus potentially more for the associated refined products. As such, we're busy at work with multiple potential partners and customers to assess how best to leverage our large deepwater position to serve crude, refined products and blending components, as well as build our connectivity within the Houston market which offers the most optionality.
While more likely a late 2018 early 2019 event, dropping these assets in through the MLP would substantially grow and diversify the Partnership’s cash flows and add more high quality integrated energy companies to our customer list. On the M&A front, we have capital to spend and look forward to executing on attractive opportunities, including assets and venture opportunities outside of those broadly marketed by the Street. We are currently in the final negotiations of purchase and sell agreement to do exactly that within an off market asset that fits our strategy well. And we look forward to giving more update on that.
In closing, I'm confident about the strategic positioning of our assets, about the positive macro signals emerging in the market and with continued market demand our ability to deliver another year of 5% to 10% distribution growth to our unit holders.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Adam.
Adam Altsuler
Thank you, Dan. And thank you for joining us on the call this morning. Please note that we issued our fourth quarter earnings release yesterday afternoon. In addition, we intend to file our full year 2016 10-K after market close today, to be accessible on the SEC's Web site at www.sec.gov.
For the fourth quarter, we reported net cash provided by operating activities of $16 million, adjusted EBITDA of $16.8 million and distributable cash flow of $16 million. Our results reflect the stable and predictable nature of our cash flows, from primarily investment grade customers, with approximately 96% of our adjusted EBITDA before corporate expenses, generated from take-or-pay contract. The Partnership achieved significant growth during the fourth quarter of 2016 relative to the fourth quarter of 2015. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by 61%, while adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow increased by 31% and 56%, respectively.

This growth is primarily attributable to the Partnership’s acquisition of the Casper terminal in November 2015, and was partially offset by higher interest expense on additional borrowings used to fund the acquisition, as well as additional operating costs associated with managing and operating the terminal.
Distributable cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2016 also benefited from a partial tax refund with respect to 2015 of approximately $2.3 million, related to the activities of its foreign subsidiaries. Additionally, the Partnership received the remaining outstanding tax refund of approximately CAD900,000 in February of 2017, which will show up in our Q1 2017 numbers. And we do not expect to receive any additional refunds with respect to our 2015 Canadian income taxes.
The Partnership expects to pay approximately CAD5.7 million in Canadian income taxes with respect to 2017. These estimates for income taxes are based on the Partnership's current operations, and are subject to fluctuations in the operating results of our foreign subsidiaries, and the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar, among other factors.
Net income for the fourth quarter decreased by 41% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, primarily as a result of a non-cash impairment charge of $3.5 million associated with our San Antonio Ethanol terminal. We are currently in discussions with an investment grade customer about providing an alternative industry solution, using a new advantage location servicing the San Antonio Ethanol market. We look forward to communicating more details about this opportunity as things continue to develop.
On February 1st, the Partnership declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.33 per unit, or $1.32 per unit on an annualized basis, which represents growth of 2.3% relative to the third quarter of 2016, and 10% relative to the fourth quarter of 2015. The distribution was paid on February 17th to unit-holders of record as of February 13th. As of December 31st, the Partnership had total available liquidity of approximately $189 million, including $11.7 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, and undrawn borrowing capacity of $177 million on its $400 million senior secured credit facility, subject to continued compliance with financial covenants.
The Partnership is in compliance with its financial covenants and has no maturities under our senior secured credit facility until July 2019. In summary, we are pleased with our strong liquidity position and strong distribution coverage for the quarter. And as Dan mentioned, we believe that our high-quality customer base and strategically located assets will continue to provide a solid foundation for future growth, will now will enable us to generate distribution growth of 5% to 10% in 2017.
And with that, I would like now to open up the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Gabe Moreen with Bank of America.
Derek Walker
This is Derek on for Gabe. Just a couple quick ones, you mentioned the ethanol opportunity at San Antonio. Is that something that would be taken on at the USD level or the USDP level?
Adam Altsuler
That would be taken out to the USDP level.
Derek Walker
Then as far as the re-contracting risk, you mentioned around Casper. I just want to get a little more color there. So, the customer there did not renew, and are they expected to use spot volumes around that. Is that how I heard that?
Dan Borgen
The best way to answer that is that contractually the customer had an extended period of time to renew discussions around the renewal. And so we've not -- it's in the affirmative, so we have to get a renewal declaration from them to do so. And so, we just wanted to advise the market that we have not received that at this time. However, a customer said they want to continue to use the facility. And obviously, for competitive and negotiation leverage, I’d probably do the same thing, if I were them. But we're at the table with them to discuss what they do plan on using the facility, and it could -- we're negotiating an additional term agreement or as we have other demand for the team loan as well and other customers at the table, new customers; we may choose to shift that to more of a spot volume deal with them perhaps, depending upon the negotiated rates.

Derek Walker
And just as far as with the existing contract. Do you have a sense on how much that contributes in annual EBITDA?
Adam Altsuler
So the customer we referenced for approximately $12 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2016. But when you think about the impact, going forward, it's hard to say the exact impact based on what Dan said and in our view that we think they’ll be material and significant spot volume relative to terminal going forward.
Dan Borgen
Derek additional color on that. This customer has converted several other refineries to handle the product that comes through this facility, and continues to be one of our strongest users of the facility today. And as I said, their plan is to continue to use facility, especially as we see a cheaper feedstock for them that was their whole intent to spend the capital that they did at the refineries, as well as investing with us in this terminal. So, we feel pretty bullish about where we are there. But obviously we're in a negotiation period with them as was intended by the contract. And so, we look forward to been able to get something done with them on -- that’s favorable to the Partnership, and we'll continue to utilize the terminal.
Derek Walker
I guess the last one from me, is just and I think previously mentioned some preliminary groundwork around Hardisty. And how do you see that evolving throughout 2018?
Dan Borgen
So, we have completed a phase through the winter months that we wanted to try to complete, and we brought that on just last week. So we feel very good about where we are there in terms of keeping up with our customer demand for future expansions. We have cut our timeframe down from one year to nine month completion by doing the work that we did. We look for a full third train loading capability -- sole loading capability at that facility. So we feel very good about that and that came in on budget on time. So, we're very proud of our project team for doing that.
Operator
Our next question comes from Poe Fratt with D.A. Davidson.
Poe Fratt
Just to drill down a little bit more on the contract renewal. When you will get the $12 million of EBITDA, relative to what actual volumes versus the contracted volumes, how well you utilized. Can you give us a flavor of how closely we're to fully utilizing that contracted volume?
Adam Altsuler
They're one of the more active shippers at the terminal. But as you probably known, we don’t give customer volumes, or really out of respect for our shippers. But I would say they are more and more active customers at the terminal.
Poe Fratt
Then if you look at your contracts in ’18 and ’19, can you give us an appreciation for, either on an EBITDA basis or percentage of EBITDA basis, what the contracts' expirations represent?
Adam Altsuler
So, all of our Hardisty contracts expire in 2019. And at the Casper terminal, they've been staggered. So, we have one, obviously in ‘17, one in ’18 and one in ‘19. But again, we don’t give specific EBITDA breakouts for the customer contracts.
Poe Fratt
Yes, I get that. And what I was trying to do is look at -- you have 80% of 2016 EBITDA expiring over the next two years. And just trying to get an appreciation for how that's weighted in ‘18 and ’19? And if I am hearing correctly, it sounds like it's more weighted towards ’19 than it is ’18.
Adam Altsuler
That's, right. The Hardisty terminal is, I think it's about 60% of our adjusted EBITDA, so more heavily weighted towards ‘19.
Dan Borgen
Let me just add some color, maybe to that. We're in a renewable business, right. And it happens all the time, what we like is that the renewal of these contracts, both in ’17 and ’18, are coming up in a high-demand period or high-demand cycle. We like that. That's the best time to have renewals come up. We have no signals from ’18 or ’19 customers, obviously that they would change their tone or tune. Remember, the build of the Casper asset was to take advantage of cheaper feedstocks coming out of Canada. That's why all of the customers at the terminal are refiners and integrated. So, they like that opportunity, that's the full intent of what the Casper facility was built for.

And so we look forward to this negotiation period, quite frankly, because we have an opportunity to perhaps increase. We've seen that before in demand cycles at other terminals where we've had contracts renew and we’ve been able to increase our unit price, I would call it, for the throughput. So, we look at it like the portfolio, but we look at do we take a shorter term higher price, should we take a longer-term, obviously the longer the term generally the better the price. But do like the period that we’re entering into there’s high-demand and like the market leverage that that provides all terminal operators.
Poe Fratt
Yes, understood. It's a little higher than I anticipated, as far as the percentage that was expiring in 2017. So, I was just trying to calibrate ‘18.
Dan Borgen
Sure.
Poe Fratt
When you look at the distribution growth range that you've given for ’17 of 5% to 10%, can you talk about the parameters that would make you look at the high end versus low end?
Adam Altsuler
I think we feel good about where we are with regard to distribution growth. If you look at -- we feel like we can end 2017 with the full-year 2017 average of distribution coverage of 1.2 or greater, just given our existing business. And obviously our assets are well positioned to benefit from the Western Canada production story. So as that continues to play out, we'll continue to give more color on that as we meet with our Board on a quarterly basis and report.
Dan Borgen
We continue to remain bullish about where we’re going from a distribution growth standpoint. But the 5% to 10% based on what we're seeing today, is very reasonable for us. And so we feel confident on that. But obviously, that's subject to market conditions and the way the wind flow.
Poe Fratt
And I know it's difficult to give any color on the asset that you're talking about, you’re in final negotiations. But can you -- would you be willing to offer size and multiple at this point in time, or is it just too early? And then also when you think this might get over the finish line, as far as whether it's first half of '17 event or whether it's potentially a second half? Any color would be helpful.
Dan Borgen
So, let me say this. We are close. We will be spending some additional dollars on the asset to retro it to handle to fit our specific need. Our perspective revenue start would come towards later in the year versus shorter in the year. But it is asset that fits us well that will -- that fits our strategy from, I'll call it, more of a destination versus an origination. And we look forward to trying to been able to talk more about that in the near term. This is again not a, I'll say, publicly competed but a discussion between ourselves and both a prior customer and a corporate entity that is sizeable. And so, we have exchanged documents back and forth and we're getting closer on that. That's probably as much color as I can give at it this time.
Poe Fratt
As far as sizing, Dan, any color on just how large this transaction might be?
Dan Borgen
Really now levered to say exact sizing, but I would say it'd be meaningful for the Partnership.
Poe Fratt
And then, Adam, do you just CapEx numbers for 2017 either total or maintenance and growth?
Adam Altsuler
We've got a small amount of maintenance CapEx budgeted for the full year. And it'd be in line with last year, I would say. Growth, we've got one identified project that Dan mentioned, at Casper, and that’s just investing in the asset to be more flexible with regard to sourcing and delivering the crude [multiple speakers]. That'd be growth capital. It's a relatively small deal but it's been -- we're doing that really in response to customer demand and the market opportunity we see. So, I'd call it less than $500,000, but we feel like it'd get adequate returns given the market opportunity we're seeing.

Poe Fratt
So, total CapEx shouldn't be -- should be under $5 million ex this acquisition opportunity?
Adam Altsuler
It would be much lower than that. The maintenance CapEx, call it around, $100,000 to $200,000 and the growth CapEx less than $500,000. And that’s just for the identified projects of course something else should up it would change that number, but just for what we referenced on the call today.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Mike Gyure with Janney.
Mike Gyure
Talk a little bit about the rail rate environment, and what's going on there. Now that you're seeing more drilling and more activity and more, I'd say, demand on the rail system from users like frac sand and places like that?
Dan Borgen
So we work very well with our rail road partners, and the railroads have been, I would say, aggressive to replace lost revenues from coal. And so it's a great time for us to be at the table growing rail revenues. I think that we are working with our customers and railroads to get some term volume and pricing on freight rates. We think the railroads have told us that they can handle both the increased frac sand demand, as well as growing demand for crude and related products on rail without a problem.
There is some ramp up from -- several of them have reduced crew counts. There is plenty of locomotive power, and it's approximately three to six-months, seven-months lead-up in terms of training crudes and that kind of thing to bring that back to work to handle growing volume. The volumes that we’re seeing and forecasting now are easily served by both of the servicing railroads that we currently use at several of our facilities.
So, long answer to say we've got bullish partners that want more revenue. They want to be aggressive and they want to grow the revenue. They've all pushed their operating ratios very well and continue to drive cost out of their business. And so, it's important for them to create additional revenue opportunities across the top.
Mike Gyure
And then maybe a follow-up on your Hardisty asset up there, expansion plans, I think originally, you were thinking later 2017. It sounds like maybe 2018 might be more of the time when the CapEx would start working on the expansion. Can you maybe kind of update…
Dan Borgen
We would like to drive through the summer months as hard as we could, in terms of expansion there. And as I said earlier, we've reduced our build time from one year to approximately nine months, maybe even little less than that. And so, we would like to see those dollars, those CapEx dollars, spent wherein sooner than 2018. Obviously, we have the months, nine months from today, if we started today that would put us pretty much revenue start into ’18.
But in terms of building and constructing and bringing that to the table, we're seeing some of our producing customers in Canada accelerating their production faster than they thought they could. Bring in the more production online. And these are existing customers that we have as well as new customers. So, our existing customers have asked us to remain vigilant with the growth that we have. And we're in good contact with them about our timing of that. Obviously, we would have like to -- they are coming out of a tough winner, where they had to throttle back some of their production to be able to, just because of the cold conditions.
And so there I think they're trying to ramp back up and catch up with some of that. We’re continuing to see inventory builds up there, and obviously pipeline allocations are in the high 30s-40s. So, it's all the drivers and all the signals with there that additional train capacity is going to be needed. We're already permitted. We're already ready to go from that standpoint, and we've -- as I said, we had a lot of work through this period of time and completed that. So that we could get be in place to meet the demand at the request of the customers.

Operator
Our next question comes from Robert Balsamo with FBR.
Robert Balsamo
You addressed the supply growth out of Canada, refiners’ preference for some of these crudes, the goal. I think that's something that we’ve heard from other operators in the midstream space with greater demand for heavier quality and coming as great imports and exports of the lighter volumes. Could you address maybe just -- as growth comes out of Canada, like what volumes might be displaced?
Dan Borgen
I think I'm going to ask Brad Sanders who is on the call as well to -- our Chief Marketing Officer, to speak about that. And then I can follow-up. Brad?
Brad Sanders
You did state correctly that U.S. continues to be an importer of heavy crude, heavy sour crude and an exporter of the lighter grades. The production from the shale formations, as an example as we get new production there on the margin, that production will have to find access to water. But from a heavy standpoint, the Canadian barrel headed towards the Gulf Coast, primarily the Houston region, which is importing, I would say the Gulf Coast region generally, somewhere between 1 million and 1.5 million a day of heavy oil, will displace production from the Middle East, heavy production from the Middle East; but primarily Venezuelan grades and grades from Mexico Maya in particular. So, it's what I would call regional grades and then on the margin grades from the Middle East.
Operator
And we have a follow-up from the line of Poe Fratt with D.A. Davidson.
Poe Fratt
On Hardisty, it sounds like you've done a lot of work in getting shortening the lead time there. Can you give us some idea of just cost of that potential project?
Dan Borgen
No, we don't disclose our capital costs, Poe. And on, that we're being efficient in our spend there. But we do not disclose our capital costs on project.
Poe Fratt
Dan just to clarify, would that be done at USDP -- at the Partnership or the GP?
Dan Borgen
It'll be upstairs. We do it up there to take the construction risk out and get all that out, and then drop it in as a performing asset.
Operator
We've a question from the line of Elliot Miller, a Private Investor.
Unidentified Analyst
I was curious about the impact of the border adjustment tax, if it passes. And how that would be affected by the displacements by Canadian crude or other foreign crudes?
Dan Borgen
I think that's a great question. Elliot, I think that we continue to monitor that. And I think that there -- I was at a senior level get-together recently that folks more and they now plugged in on that, gave it a less than 20% chance of passing in terms of a broader tax. I think, obviously, with the new administration there is some stable rambling about those types of things from a beer tax to a variety of things. But remember that Canada is one of -- let's just talk about Canada for a minute.
Canada is one of the, is the largest, importer of U.S. produced crude, primarily in the Eastern Canada. So to complete that game if they wanted to. They also are big importer of automobiles and other things. So, I think it's a -- I think it certainly something we need to keep our eye on. We're not overly concerned or worried about that. We think that the demand of the U.S. refiners and the heavier U.S. intermediate to heavy refiners will continue to demand the product that they need. We think that the light suite of Bakken, Permian, clearly as others have stated much better than I can, are looking to go export. The demand, the in-country demand U.S. demand for a intermediate to heavy crude, is something that I think will continue to drive crude being put into the U.S. refiners. And whether a broader tax is implemented, it will be absorbed through this system. But we think based on what we're seeing that's a lesser likelihood than 50% I'll say.

Also, remember that competing barrels are also imports. So, if the heavy [multiple speakers], that's right. So, if it's Venezuelan barrel or if it's a Mexico barrel, it's an imported and I think would be subject to more of broader tax than from a friendly country of adjacent neighbor to us in terms of coming from Canada a good trading partner of ours versus Venezuela, who arguably is not as friendly a trading partner with us.
Unidentified Analyst
The other question I want to raise is about competition from the Keystone. What are your thoughts on that?
Dan Borgen
It's great question. Pipelines are additional takeaway opportunities. And so anytime a pipeline is being built of nine points whatever billion, I think latest number from TransCanada on the XL program it could have an impact on crude takeaway. It fills the need. Now, our view is it still has some hurdles to get through, not just the matter of getting over the border but on state-by-state county-by-county fight getting through. I think there are still some challenges. I think the other side is we have had a production -- when all of those pipelines were originally contemplated, whether the Energy East, TMX, XL, any of those, production in Canada was estimated to be 2.7 million barrels; its south of 2 million barrels today. So the driver demand for long term high cost pipelines are something that could be debatable; so one, it's a high price alternative; two it takes some time to get in place; and the need and demand is now, and we are uniquely situated with 200 -- approximately 40,000 barrels a day of permitted capacity that can come out of and help deliver Canadian production to refining centers uniquely situated in the Gulf Coast, United States.
So, it is an alternative, don't misunderstand me. Clearly, it's an alternative. But it's out there a few years and it's expensive, and it's got some headwinds. We've had some producers that say regardless we are still, rail is still part of our portfolio and will continue to be, regardless of that. And because rail gives us things that a pipeline doesn’t give us, flexibility. Remember, rail does a few different things. It does not only a physical takeaway but it gives the opportunity to take the best markets. You put in a pipeline you basically go from point A to point B, at point B might be where you want to go but the quality of the product also that's put into rail can be segregated and maintained and kept, delivered to the market [multiple speakers].
Unidentified Analyst
No, I've seen all of that presentation, I'm familiar with it, believe me, honestly, I'm familiar with that. Is it safe to say that when Keystone XL does happen, and I understand that there are barriers that have to be met and crossed but it's -- when that happens, it will still not be priced competitive with USD's rail business?
Dan Borgen
I would say that we don't know what the pricing on a delivered Keystone XL program would be. But if you were running East Coast barrel today, it currently is not in the money to do that. It could be a physical takeaway, but it's not in the money today. And you'd prefer to run rail to the Gulf Coast, because it'd be more competitive. So, I can answer it that way. We and the railroads will continue to remain competitive, whether it'd be a pipeline barrel, for all the reasons we've previously discussed. So, we compete with pipelines every day and as they do with us, but we also think that they're just part of the takeaway portfolio.
Like I said, our customers have -- continued to remain committed to rail. As a part of it, they own railcars. They're in place with those. They like that optionality. So like any portfolio, they like that whether it'd be peaking for them, whether it'd be peaking asset or whether it'd be something that's moving every day. They like the optionality that rail provides to them. And I think they're looking at multi-year commitments on freights, on railroads, should be able to maintain a competitive cost component. Because remember the freight rate is, from the railroads, is the significant portion of the overall move, we're very-very small.

So, from a insurance standpoint, they can continue to hold place that our terminal had a relatively small cost; and as one side to me it's cheaper than the insurance that I pay on the pipeline. So, it's a good alternative to have that capability when it's needed.
Operator
And that does conclude our Q&A session for today. I will now hand over program back over to Dan Borgen for any additional or closing remarks.
Dan Borgen
Very good, thank you. Just I think we've covered a lot of ground today, and some great questions and great concerns. But with all of that said, we remain very bullish about our business, and we remain confident in the drivers, the macro and micro drivers that we’re seeing. We've been talking about this for a while. And certainly, we’ve come out of a valley that has been impactful to the entire industry. There is renewed momentum, both in Canada and in obviously at select areas here in United States, and so we remain bullish.
We see the drivers are supporting what we've been saying. I know you've read the stories in the announcements from a lot of our customers, in Canada, who continue to reduce their costs on a produced barrel to remain very competitive, south of $20 a barrel in some case south of $17 a barrel and other cases. So, they have gotten very efficient through this downturn as we all have. And so, we continue to have customers demanding rail takeaway solution.
And we've reduced our construction now to our next phase of expansion up there down to nine months and end to be able to meet that demand. I think that all signals are lining up that we should have some positive announcements around that in the future. The renewal options are coming at strong demand periods. And I'll just say this frankly. If you’re not comfortable with renewal risk in the mid-stream business, you probably shouldn’t be in it. Because the renewal risk is just part of the business that we have, but we were very much like the opportunity to have those renewals come in at strong demand periods.
And we’re entering those cycles. We've seen it before. We've been doing this for a long-time, cycles come and go, but strategic assets are important and needed. And we like the opportunity to be able to renegotiate pricing. Again, previous cycles that we've been through, we've seen, I will say, doubling and tripling of unit pricing to meet demand when demand is strongly on and there is more supply than takeaway, that's the market that we’re headed towards. And my committing that we’re going to see double and triple certainly not, but we've seen those markets before and we like the opportunity to have revive at the apple and renew. And we've got new customers at the table now talking to us, new potential customers, at the table. So we like that marketing and leverage that that gives us as well.
And rail as you see the numbers, and these are all fact points you can verify independently. But the rail -- crude on rail is growing and in Canada, and so it's proving the point that there is not enough pipeline takeaway that any new pipeline are few to several years away, if at all. And so demand is going to be on in the period that we are uniquely capable of solving for them.
So, with that, I'll say thank you. And appreciate the time today and we look forward to talk about other positive things concerning our partnership. Thanks so much.
