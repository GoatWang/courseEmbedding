Surname meaning for "Barlow"
English: habitational name from any of several places called
Barlow, especially those in Lancashire and West Yorkshire. The former
is named with Old English bere ‘barley’ + hlaw
‘hill’; the latter probably has as its first element the derived
adjective beren or the compound bere-ærn
‘barn’. There is also a place of this name in Derbyshire, named with
Old English bar ‘boar’ or bere ‘barley’ +
leah ‘woodland clearing’, and one in Shropshire, which is
from bere ‘barley’ + leah.

information? Does the lawyer seem interested in solving your problem?

the lawyer worked on other cases similar to yours? 
Cost - How are the lawyer's fees structured - hourly or flat
fee? Can the lawyer estimate the cost of your case? 
City - Is the lawyer's office conveniently located?
Not sure what questions to ask a lawyer?Here are a few to get you started:

How long have you been in practice?
How many cases like mine have you handled?
How often do you settle cases out of court?
What are your fees and costs?
What are the next steps?
