  	Our order was shipped still frozen to California. Tried to BBQ along with some fillets, but they looked anemic, so I fried them in some oil on the side burner and they turned out great.             First time to eat these walleye fingers              5 out of 5   Gary Mateja  Location: West Plains, Mo, USA  Date: July 21, 2015
  	They arrived quite frozen and unbroken.  Thawed some and deep fried them up after some fillets. To compare with the walleye fillets: These fingers were somewhat more dense than the fillets. Held their shape well and did not crumble. I really like them and will consider them for appetizer food prior to dinner.            7 Total Reviews       Newest Oldest Highest Rated Lowest Rated  GO

         Product Description ••••• Eleven pounds of the finest frozen Canadian Walleye fillets--skinless.  These fillets are between 4 and 6 ounces and we have removed the skin.  Around 30-40 fillets in each package. This is our most popular items particularly for those that prefer to have fillets ready for the deep fryer or pan.  These are from the same source (wild caught in Canada) and processor as the skin on fillets--we've just taken the skin off.As with our other products these are Individually Quality Frozen so you can grab just one or two fillets for dinner without defrosting the rest.

  	Great product for the second year in a row. My family hosts a fish fry for 80 people each summer, a family tradition of fish and spaghetti for 50 years. We bought our fish from Walleye Direct and have it shipped to our cabin in Wisconsin. It is fresh and fabulous and will order for years to come.    Verified Buyer  Recommended            walleye              4 out of 5   charles carlisle  Location: camden, tennessee, United States  Date: April 10, 2017
  	There were bones in the fillets, but maybe that is normal, since they are small.             navy              5 out of 5   DENNIS MCCALL  Location: YOUNGSTOWN, OH, United States  Date: March 9, 2017

  	A bit overwhelmed at the 11lbs, 36 large fillets, but very satisfied, would purchase again.             So happy to eat Walleye whenever we want it              5 out of 5   Claudia Lucas  Location: Burnsville, MN, United States  Date: January 29, 2017
  	Since we don't get a chance to go fishing, we are so glad that we have an abundance of walleye fillets from Walleye Direct.  They are delicious and it is so nice to have a supply in our freezer now.  So often I checked with our local groceries, and was not successful in being able to purchase walleye.  It's not only fresh tasting, but brings back a lot of good memories of the walleye my dad use to catch.             Fantastic              5 out of 5   Brian Orr  Location: Winchester , Indiana, United States  Date: January 26, 2017
  	I love fresh walleye and fried potatoes I use to go to lake Erie to fish walleye but I was told you can only eat 1 a week because of PCB's now I can eat all I want when ever I want I feel the price was great and came to my door frozen and very fresh and came on time.....I am very satisfied with my order I have given some to my friends they all have told me how much they liked the fish             GREAT FISH!!!              5 out of 5   Geri Rickard  Location: Tallahassee, FL, United States  Date: January 22, 2017
  	We are from North Dakota, grew up eating walleye and now living in the south we only get it when we visit up north. Not any more! I will have some of the best walleye in my freezer from walleyedirect.com. We had some for dinner tonight and it was outstanding! We are very happy with this purchase and will buy it again!!             Fabulous!              5 out of 5   Brian Remington  Location: Crystal Lake , IL, United States of America  Date: January 21, 2017
  	Absolutely fabulous! We purchased the skinless fillets and they are the best fish we've ever had! We'll definitely be ordering these again! I had trouble trying to order using a Groupon but the customer service was quick to respond and fix the issue!             Excellent fish! Excellent service!              5 out of 5   Lisa Guarino  Location: Davidson, NC, USA  Date: January 2, 2017

  	Excellent fish just like what I used to catch when I was kid only this comes already cleaned and ready for the fryer. Doesn't get any better or easier than this.             We are in Heaven              5 out of 5   Judy Edwards  Location: Snohomish, WA, USA  Date: December 17, 2016
  	Received our 11 lbs of Walleye and had our first meal 2 days after arrival.  Very delicious.  We will have many meals from this 11 lbs.  It's all packed up for separate meals that we will enjoy immensely.  Thank you.             Great Taste!              4 out of 5   Donald Franck  Location: Mountain View , Missouri, USA  Date: November 17, 2016
  	The walleye tastes great and I had some just tonight! The only reason you are not getting 5 Stars is the large number of bones. I know deboning fish without bones is hard, but you should check and see why some have alot still in them.             11# skinless walleye              5 out of 5   douglas bartosh  Location: eagan, mn, usa  Date: October 29, 2016
  	these were perfectly sized fillets around 6oz nice size for eating and size of fish             Absolutely fantastic fish              5 out of 5   Val  Location: Rosemount, MN, USA  Date: October 21, 2016
  	We had some walleye for the first time since our order arrived and it was delicious. I always rinse my fish very well before cooking and there was no fishy odor at all. We have so many recipes to try can't  wait.             Fresh Fish              5 out of 5   Glen & Marge Bach  Location: Mesa, Arizona, United States  Date: October 21, 2016
  	We lived on a lake in Wisconsin and now in AZ  your fish are like we had in Wisconsin can't get the good stuff here.  These are just like you caught them.             I have nothing bad to say!              5 out of 5   Tom Armstrong  Location: Mankato, MN, USA  Date: October 11, 2016
  	The fish arrived on time frozen rock hard.  Since the fillets are all in one package I vacuum sealed four fillets in individual bags.  That makes one meal per bag for my family of three.  The fillets taste great.  We have tried them fried and baked so far.  I will be ordering again as soon as I run out.             Purchase of walleye skinless              5 out of 5   Rich Trosper  Location: Westminster, Colorado, United States  Date: October 10, 2016
  	I ordered the walleye and was very pleased with the product.  Fresh big slabs!  I will be ordering more and we are enjoying the excellent quality of the product we received.  I have ordered from other outfits in the past and found your products to be the best.             Wonderful. Can't wait to order the Perch              5 out of 5   Jim Powell  Location: Port Townsend, Washington, United States  Date: October 4, 2016
  	The order got here flawlessly. I was worried that with two-day shipping it might not have stayed frozen, but it was absolutely frozen solid. BEAUTIFUL fillets, I was amazed at how much fish there actually was. I put a two fillets each in a vacuum bag and this will keep me in my favorite fish for a very long time. 

I'm going to get the Perch next time. This was great. Thanks! I should've counted the number of fillets -- it was a huge amount, I must have 20 vacuum bags with 2 good-sized fillets each in them.

It would be amazing if there were a way to get an assorted pack, so 10 pounds but half perch and half walleye, but I'm very happy and will order again soon!  I'm going through the Walleye faster than I thought.             Brian Johnston              5 out of 5   Brian Johnston  Location: Murfreesboro , Tn, USA  Date: September 25, 2016
