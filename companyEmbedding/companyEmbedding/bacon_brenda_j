Brenda Bacon Biography :


Brenda J. Bacon is the President and CEO of Brandywine Senior Living, a premier provider of senior housing in the Mid-Atlantic Region. Prior to that she was President and CEO of Brandywine Senior Care, Inc. the predecessor company she co-founded in 1996. In the initial years, Ms. Bacon was principally responsible for the development and operation of the Assisted Living Division, as well as the development of the company*s marketing and branding strategy. In late 2002, Ms. Bacon became more involved in the management of the company*s skilled nursing assets, as the challenges facing that business escalated. She became President and Chief Operating Officer in May 2003, and President and Chief Executive Officer in July 2004. Ms. Bacon revamped the business strategy, operations and management team, and guided the company to become the leading provider of nursing, rehabilitation and assisted living services in the company's markets. In June 2006, Brandywine closed on a set of transactions that resulted in the sale of the company's Skilled Nursing Division and a recapitalization of the stock of the remaining business for a combined price of $284 million. The recapitalization was through an investment by Warburg Pincus Fund IX, an $8 billion private equity fund. Having guided the company through its 15-month long sale/recapitalization process, Ms. Bacon is now focused on executing the company's new strategic growth plan of broadening its presence in the senior living industry through acquisition and development. Prior to founding Brandywine, Ms. Bacon was the co-owner of two skilled nursing facilities. From 1989 to 1993, Ms. Bacon served as Chief of Management and Planning, a cabinet-level position under New Jersey Governor James J. Florio, where she oversaw all health care and human services reform efforts and departments, and served as a senior advisor to the Governor. In addition, in 1993, Ms. Bacon spent several weeks in Washington on loan to the Presidential Transition Team for the transition of the Department of Health and Human Services where she participated in the confirmation preparation for Secretary Donna Shalala. From 1982 to 1989, Ms. Bacon developed and operated a successful health care consulting business, HealthTeam, Inc., providing consultant services to over one-third of the acute care hospitals in the state of New Jersey. Ms. Bacon also served as an elected official in Camden County (NJ) government (1982 to 1985) and as an Assistant Vice President at Pennsylvania Hospital (1980 to 1982). Ms. Bacon received her Masters of Business Administration degree from The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, majoring in Health Care Management, and received her undergraduate degree from Hampton University in Hampton, Virginia. Ms. Bacon is a member of the Board of FTI Consulting, Inc. (NYSE: FCN), a multi-disciplinary consulting firm with leading practices in the areas of corporate finance/restructuring, forensic, litigation, and economic consulting. She is also a member of the Board of the Boys and Girls Club of Camden County. "A management team must have a plan, a passion for that plan, and the perseverance to implement and adapt in the face of changing circumstances. We don�t just operate our company, we manage it, giving the best that we have to our residents, our team members, and our Board � everyday."

Everything is better with bacon
Consumer demand is high for bacon in many forms.

“Everything is better with bacon” is a statement that resonates with pork producers, culinary experts and consumers. Bacon is the term for the cured belly of a hog carcass. Most bacon sold in the United States is referred to as “streaky” bacon which is long, narrow slices cut crosswise from the hog belly that contain veins of meat within the fat. Several steps are involved in producing bacon. Each pork belly must be skinned and any ragged edges trimmed. The product is then cured which usually involves injection of a brine containing ingredients that make bacon taste like bacon and not just pork. The next step is thermal processing and usually includes traditional smoking. Bacon receives its smoke flavor either from natural smoke obtained by smoldering wood chips or by spraying with a liquid smoke extract. 
Despite consumer trends in healthier eating and more economical food selections, bacon is a prevalent meat choice and is also a popular accent to many other foods. Once primarily a breakfast staple, bacon has moved into other eating arenas. Bacon is frequently found in salads, soups, sandwiches and as a compliment to burgers and pizza. Novel use of bacon is also showing up in ice cream, cakes, cookies and even donuts. This trend is seen both in meals eaten at home and in meals eaten away from home.
Bacon has become a popular addition to fast-food menus. These incidental sales are referred to as a knock-on effect. Ron Plain, an agricultural economist at University of Missouri said, “Every time bacon is put on a fast-food sandwich, it is incremental growth in sales. A knock-on effect can follow. Most people find the taste of bacon on fast-food sandwiches to be appealing and that may influence their purchasing decisions at the grocery stores.” 
Mintel, a large, consumer market research firm, recently conducted surveys on consumer perceptions, purchasing practices and consumption of red meat. Mintel reported bacon has wide consumer acceptance and is the second most commonly purchased red meat with 69 percent of households reporting in the surveys they purchase bacon. Thirty eight percent of survey respondents reported consuming bacon one to three times per month, 20 percent reported once a week consumption and 19 percent reported eating bacon three or more times a week. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics bacon prices in the Midwest averaged $4.99 per pound in October which is an increase of 6.4 percent over a year ago.
As with many other products, consumers are looking for specialized bacon products. Lower sodium, less-fat and natural are attributes desired by consumers. To be labeled as natural, nitrites and nitrates may not be directly added to bacon as curing agents. Flavorings like mesquite, maple and pepper are also popular. Convenience is a high priority and more consumers and food service providers are selecting precooked bacon.
As the demand for bacon remains strong, opportunities exist in product development to cater to the diverse preferences of consumers. The Michigan State University Product Center can assist livestock producers or food processors with market research and product development. Innovation counselors are located in Michigan State University Extension offices across the state. Additional services such as business planning, product testing and accessing the supply chain are also available to Michigan residents.
