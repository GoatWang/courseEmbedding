	(2) 





	Vesting of RSUs granted to the Reporting Person on April 25, 2011.









	(3) 





	Exempt transaction pursuant to Section 16b-3(e) - payment of exercise price or tax liability by delivering or withholding securities incident to the receipt, exercise or vesting of a security issued in accordance with Rule 16b-3. All of the shares reported as disposed of in this Form 4 were relinquished by the Reporting Person and cancelled by the Issuer in exchange for the Issuer's agreement to pay federal and state tax withholding obligations of the Reporting Person resulting from the vesting of RSUs. The Reporting Person did not sell or otherwise dispose of any of the shares reported on this Form 4 for any reason other than to cover required taxes.









	(4) 





	Each RSU represents a contingent right to receive one share of the Issuer's common stock.









	(5) 





	Upon the resignation of the Reporting Person effective on December 31, 2012, the vesting of the RSUs was accelerated so that 100% of the unvested portion vested immediately.
