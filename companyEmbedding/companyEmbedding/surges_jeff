Overview



Director, screenwriter and comic genius, Preston Sturges has been an influence on filmmakers ranging from Orson Welles to the Coen brothers. The first person to win an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, he wrote and directed some of the most bizarre, controversial, and downright hilarious comedies of the 1940s, including Sullivan's Travels and Hail the Conquering Hero. He may be the most talented Hollywood filmmaker yet to receive the critical recognition he deserves. The Films of Preston Sturges is a pioneering collection of essays by world-famous scholars that chart Sturges' contributions to Hollywood cinema, revealing his pivotal status as an early writer-director, exploring his inimitable style, and making a bold case for his ongoing influence today. Reawakening interest in this filmmaker's life and works, this book will remind readers why Sturges' movies remain not only immensely enjoyable, but of great cultural significance as well.

“Jeff brings the right mix of health care information technology entrepreneurship, public company CEO experience and strong leadership qualities to our company, our customers and our employees,” the company's outgoing CEO, Doug Schneider, said in a press release.
Connecture said it wants to establish new leadership as it looks to advance to the next stage of growth to capture a larger market.
Surges will officially step into his role next week. During the coming months, Surges and Schneider will work closely to establish strategies that will plan for growth and better serve the company's customers, the company said.
Schneider will continue to serve as president and chief product officer and retain his seat on the company’s board of directors.
The company’s third-quarter results show total revenue at $22.7 million, an increase of 5.4 percent from the 2014 third quarter. Notable customers added in the quarter include USAA; Anthem; Towers; Meridian Health Plan, a physician owned and operated health plan in the Midwest; and additional new Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans.

Refocus: the Films of Preston Sturges
Jeff Jaeckle and Sarah Kozloff
Published by Edinburgh University Press
ReFocus



Description



Director, screenwriter and comic genius, Preston Sturges has been an influence on filmmakers ranging from Orson Welles to the Coen brothers. The first person to win an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, he wrote and directed some of the most bizarre, controversial, and downright hilarious comedies of the 1940s, including Sullivan's Travels and Hail the Conquering Hero. He may be the most talented Hollywood filmmaker yet to receive the critical recognition he deserves. The Films of Preston Sturges is a pioneering collection of essays by world-famous scholars that chart Sturges' contributions to Hollywood cinema, revealing his pivotal status as an early writer-director, exploring his inimitable style, and making a bold case for his ongoing influence today. Reawakening interest in this filmmaker's life and works, this book will remind readers why Sturges' movies remain not only immensely enjoyable, but of great cultural significance as well.

Amazon’s Jeff Bezos Surges Past Bill Gates as World’s Richest PersonJeff Bezos' net worth is $90.6 billion, making him the richest person alive.
By Laura Woods
July 27, 2017









Amazon Founder and CEO Jeff Bezos briefly surpassed Bill Gates to become the richest person in the world — for a day. Bezos’ net worth was $90.6 billion when the markets opened on July 27, compared to Gates’ $90 billion. Bezos’ fortune grew thanks to a $15 jump in Amazon share price, but by that evening Bezos had fallen back into the No. 2 spot.Bezos founded Amazon a little more than two decades ago after quitting his hedge fund job. Today, Amazon is one of the world’s largest retailers. Here’s a look at how the fabulously wealthy mogul spends his money.    Jeff Bezos Net Worth: $90.6 BillionFounding one of the most valuable brands in the world has elevated Jeff Bezos to a level of entrepreneur held only by an elite few. Started in July 1995, Amazon offers a slew of products and services to customers around the globe, which helped it become the fastest company ever to reach $100 billion in annual sales — a feat achieved in 2015.    Amazon issued an IPO in May 1997, but the man behind the online retail giant still retains 17 percent ownership in the company. After a bump in share price on July  26, 2017, Bezos’ net worth surged to $90.6 billion, making him the richest person alive by market open the next day — richer even than Bill Gates.While Amazon is Bezos’ main focus, the company is not his only business venture. In 2013, he purchased The Washington Post for $250 million. The billionaire entrepreneur also founded the rocket company Blue Origin, which is developing reusable rockets to shuttle passengers to and from space.In March 2017, Bezos purchased Dubai-based online retailer Souq.com. The final purchase price was not revealed; however, a bidding war broke out after Emaar Malls — a Dubai-headquartered mall operator — offered $800 million for the company.Check Out: 12 Sneaky Ways Amazon Gets You to Spend MoreJeff Bezos’ Real EstateBezos takes advantage of his ability to live large by buying multi-million dollar properties and other high-priced status symbols only the wealthiest people can enjoy.In October 2016, he spent $23 million to purchase the 27,000-square-foot former Textile Museum in Kalorama, a swanky Washington, D.C., neighborhood. The property consists of two historic mansions that are on the National Register of Historic Places. Bezos will transform the mansions into the city’s largest residence.Despite the major investment, the primary Bezos family residence will remain in Seattle. According to The Washington Post, Bezos and his family will use the property when visiting town.Related: 7 of Donald Trump’s Most Valuable PropertiesLocated in the suburb of Medina, Wash., the main Bezos residence is a 29,000-square-foot compound not far from Amazon’s headquarters. Originally a 13,000-square-foot home, Bezos’ 5.35-acre waterfront property underwent a $28 million renovation to transform it into a sprawling oasis, according to Forbes.Bezos has also owned a 10,000-square-foot New York City property since 1999. Purchased for just under $7.7 million, the property consists of three linked apartments in Manhattan’s chic Century Tower building. Bezos also purchased a nearly 12,000-square-foot home in Beverly Hills, Calif., in 2007 for $24.5 million.Along with his impressive real estate portfolio, Bezos has amassed a fleet of private jets — including a Gulfstream and a Dassault Falcon-900EX — for his personal travel needs. His limited liability company, Poplar Glen, paid $5.5 million for a hangar at Seattle’s Boeing Field to store his jets in 2015.Up Next: 10 Ways the Wealthiest Billionaires Stay Rich

Connecture replaces CEO with Jeff Surges

  By
  Bob Herman
         | November 13, 2015
      


Jeff Surges has left his role as president of Healthgrades to lead Connecture, a publicly traded company that builds the technology behind online health insurance exchanges.Surges, 48, will begin his new role as CEO of Connecture Nov. 17. He replaces Doug Schneider, who will stay with the company as president and chief product officer.The company said Schneider was changing roles to add more flexibility to the growing company. In a news release, Schneider said Surges is “the right person for Connecture and at a time where we are poised for enormous opportunity.”Connecture's revenue has been growing quickly, but the Brookfield, Wis.-based company is still reporting heavy losses. Connecture posted a $2.3 million loss in the third quarter and lost $11.7 million in the first nine months of this year. However, that's an improvement over 2014, when it lost $2.9 million in the third quarter and $14.9 million in the first nine months. The company's stock is down more than 52% since it went public last December.Despite the red ink, Surges said he is optimistic about Connecture's growth. “I don't think it's a turnaround at all,” he said when asked about the company's finances. “I think it's taking the base model here and positively growing on it.”Health insurers, states, employers and other groups sign agreements with Connecture, which then builds an online platform for consumers to shop and enroll in health coverage. Competitors in the business include large consulting firms that build out private exchanges, like Aon Hewitt and Mercer, as well as benefit software firms such as Benefitfocus and Zenefits.Connecture is the contractor for the federal Medicare.gov website and three state-based exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act: the District of Columbia, Maryland and Minnesota. The company also builds online exchange technology for many large insurers, including Aetna, Health Net and several state Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans. In April, Connecture won a contract from the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association to build a private exchange for Medicare enrollees.That blooming customer base drove revenue up 16% to $10 million in the third quarter. By the end of this year, Connecture expects to have almost $100 million in revenue. Surges believes more employers and insurers will continue to move toward a “consumer-centric” plan model, which presumes that everyone wants more health plan choices and the ability to make their own decisions. “Gone is the day where one broker went to one employer with one plan for everybody,” Surges said.Connecture approved a $450,000 salary for Surges as well as stock options. He's also eligible for up to $225,000 in annual bonuses. Surges previously oversaw day-to-day operations of Healthgrades, an organization that rates hospitals, doctors and other providers. He also was the CEO of Merge Healthcare, which has since been bought out by IBM, and is the former president of Allscripts Healthcare Solutions.
