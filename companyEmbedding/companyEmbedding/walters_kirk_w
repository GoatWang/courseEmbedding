Overview

Kirk is a partner whose broad practice encompasses areas within Walter Haverfield’s Corporate Transactions and Litigation Services Groups. He represents banks, equipment lessors, and other commercial lending institutions in connection with originations and workouts. His experience with credit originations includes construction lending, asset-based lending, and SBA lending. His experience with commercial workouts includes real-estate financing, C&I financing, floor-plan financing, and equipment leasing. 
Commercial loan workouts generally have two aspects - litigation and transactional - and Kirk is skilled in both. He can negotiate and draft documents necessary to implement a forbearance or restructuring, including forbearance agreements, loan modification agreements, loan sale agreements, and the ancillary promissory notes, guaranties, mortgages, security agreements, and related documents. He also can prepare pleadings and prosecute enforcement actions when workouts prove impracticable, including replevins, foreclosures, motions for relief from the bankruptcy stay, adversary proceedings, fraudulent conveyance claims, and other enforcement actions. He has successfully litigated cases for his creditor clients before various state and federal courts, including the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, the Ohio Supreme Court, the United States Bankruptcy Court and various Courts of Common Pleas. Kirk’s ability to both prepare restructuring documents and litigate enforcement actions provides continuity and efficiency to our clients by eliminating the need to move files among practice groups and bring additional attorneys up to speed.
Kirk’s experience representing commercial lenders also proves valuable to our business clients obtaining financing or seeking to restructure a problematic loan. He has assisted several small and medium-sized businesses with exiting troubled creditor relationships while avoiding bankruptcy or dissolution. He also represents receivers appointed to take control of either income-producing real-estate or operating businesses. He not only helps receivers comply with local rules and reporting requirements, but also assists them with selling receivership assets.
Kirk began his legal career in the real-estate practice group of a large international law firm representing clients in a wide array of real estate transactions, including acquisitions, dispositions, and leasing. Over the years, he has expanded his transactional practice to include a variety of corporate transactions, including entity formation and private offerings; corporate acquisitions, dispositions, and mergers; financing and financial restructuring; contract negotiation and drafting; business succession; and business governance. He has experience in transactions involving hotels, restaurants, publishing companies, radio stations, and various manufacturing businesses.

			Kirk W. Walters, age 61, joined People's United as an executive officer and member of the board of directors on March 16, 2011. He served as Chief Financial Officer through December 31, 2014 at which time he became a Senior Executive Vice President with responsibility for corporate development and strategic planning. Prior to joining People's United, Mr. Walters had most recently served as Senior Executive Vice President and a member of the board of directors of Santander Holdings USA, Inc., the parent company of Sovereign (now Santander) Bank. He joined Sovereign in February 2008 as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and served as interim President and Chief Executive Officer from October 2008 until Banco Santander acquired the bank in February 2009. 

Prior to joining Sovereign, Mr. Walters was Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chittenden Corporation from 1996 to 2008. From 1989 to 1995, he held a series of executive positions at Northeast Federal Corporation in Hartford, Connecticut, including Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. From 1984 to 1989, Mr. Walters worked for CalFed, Inc. in a variety of financial positions, including Senior Vice President and Controller. Before joining CalFed, he worked in the corporate finance group at Atlantic Richfield Corp. from 1981 to 1984. Mr. Walters is a member of the Enterprise Risk Committee and the Bank's Loan Review and Trust Committees. 

Mr. Walters, who holds an undergraduate degree in accounting from the University of Southern California, has worked in the banking industry for more than 30 years, much of it in the Northeast. This experience and his former position as our chief financial officer are significant factors in the board's evaluation of Mr. Walters' qualifications for service as a director.

No director or nominee is related by blood, marriage or adoption to any of our executive officers or any executive officer of our subsidiaries or other affiliates.

People's United Financial, Inc. Names Kirk W. Walters as Chief Financial Officer

		  Will Join People's United Financial and People's United Bank Boards of Directors

						 from   People's United Financial, Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


BRIDGEPORT, Conn., Feb. 23, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- People's United Financial, Inc. (Nasdaq:   PBCT), the holding company for People's United Bank, announced today that it has named Kirk W. Walters as Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Walters is expected to commence his duties shortly and will also be appointed to the Boards of Directors of People's United and the Bank. 
Walters, 55, was most recently Senior Executive Vice President and a member of the Board of Directors of Santander Holdings USA, Inc., the parent company of Sovereign Bank. He joined Sovereign in February 2008 as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and served as interim President and Chief Executive Officer from October 2008 until Banco Santander acquired the bank in February 2009. Prior to joining Sovereign, Walters was Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chittenden Corporation from 1996 to 2008, which People's United acquired in January 2008. 
"Kirk brings extraordinary competencies and a wealth of experience built over a finance career that spans more than 30 years," said Jack Barnes, President and Chief Executive Officer of People's United. "He has worked for 25 years in the banking sector, 22 of which were spent in the Northeast markets where People's United currently operates and intends to expand. As our strategic priorities are increasingly focused on growing and improving the profitability of our existing franchise, Kirk's addition is a unique opportunity to advance that effort at a faster pace. His experiences at Chittenden and Santander give him an outstanding perspective on the competitive landscape in which we operate. Kirk and I have an excellent history of working together, having served concurrently on the executive management team of Chittenden for many years. Finally, he knows our businesses and many of our managers well."
Walters replaces Paul D. Burner, who recently left the company. Jeffrey A. Hoyt, Senior Vice President and Controller, will serve as Chief Financial Officer on an interim basis.
People's United Bank is a subsidiary of People's United Financial, Inc., a diversified financial services company with $25 billion in assets. Peoples United Bank, founded in 1842, provides consumer, commercial and wealth management services through nearly 340 branches in Connecticut, Vermont, New York, New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. Through additional subsidiaries, People's United provides equipment financing, asset management, brokerage and financial advisory services, and insurance services.
