Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/29/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Description



For voice and piano or guitar This volume contains newly edited versions of all Walton's songs for voice and piano, together with Anon in Love for voice and guitar and songs from radio plays. It also includes the first publication of the scores of the orchestral versions of Anon in Love and A Song for the Lord Mayor's Table. Walton wrote songs throughout his life, the first, 'Tell me where is Fancy bred?', written when he was a chorister at Christ Church, Oxford, the last, A Song for the Lord Mayor's Table, a song-cycle for Elisabeth Schwarzkopf written in the early 1960s. They all reveal his ear for word-setting, an imaginative response to the text, and an ability to conjure striking musical images from his chosen material.

Composer Information

William Walton (1902-1983)

Edited by 
         Steuart Bedford




Sir William Walton was born in Oldham, Lancashire in 1902, the son of a choirmaster and a singing-teacher. He became a chorister at Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford, and then an undergraduate at the University. His first composition to attract attention was a piano quartet written at the age of sixteen. At Oxford he made the acquaintance of the Sitwells who gave him friendship, moral and financial support and in 1922 he collaborated with Edith in devising the entertainment Façade. Less than ten years later, Osbert prepared the text of another masterwork, Belshazzar's Feast. From 1922 to 1927 Walton began to spend an increasing amount of time abroad, notably in Switzerland and Italy. The war years were devoted mainly to writing film and ballet scores and he became established as amongst the greatest composers for the screen.
