J.Crew Aficionada: Diego Scotti New Marketing Head at J.Crew



























































































































































Tuesday, October 18, 2011








Diego Scotti New Marketing Head at J.Crew





"Thanks!" to Jessica who shared the following news from WWD (click here to read in its entirety):J.Crew Names Diego Scotti New Marketing HeadBy Jean E. PalmieriOctober 13, 2011J.Crew Group Inc. has turned to Vogue magazine for its new head of marketing.The New York-based specialty store has named Diego Scotti to the newly created post of senior vice president/chief marketing officer. He will report to chief executive officer Millard “Mickey” Drexler as well as creative director Jenna Lyons, and will oversee all retail and direct marketing initiatives for both the J.Crew and Madewell divisions. He takes over duties formerly performed by Margot Fooshee, senior vice president of marketing and public relations, who left the company in August. He will start in early November.Most recently, Scotti has been executive director of marketing for Vogue, where he was responsible for the overall strategic vision and the marketplace positioning of the magazine. Prior to that, he spent 15 years with American Express where he held several domestic and international positions, including head of global advertising and brand management.In an internal memo to the J.Crew staff on Thursday, Drexler said: “Diego’s business and fashion experience will be instrumental in building brand awareness, developing integrated marketing plans and making the customer experience seamless from social media to direct mail to the in-store experience.”Interesting news! It looks like J.Crew acquired an impressive talent from Vogue. I am looking forward to what Diego Scotti's marketing strategy will be. I am also curious what "customer experience seamless from social media to direct mail to the in-store experience" will be. Does it mean my catalog from J.Crew will arrive, and on-time? Because I will be happy to see that. ;)What are your thoughts on this news? What changes do you think Mr. Scotti will bring to J.Crew?

silver_liningOctober 18, 2011 at 6:50 AMMight I suggest actually conducting some marketing research (read: read JCA)?  He may find out that people want a)free shipping b)a CC with real benefits c)some consistency between B&M and web chnnels so customers don't feel like they're constantly getting screwed d)the ability to view the catalog online e)etc.  It's not good enough to just say "we're obsessed" or my new favorite "we want it in every color" (seriously, it's on the copy of so many pieces this season) - especially when there are less expensive versions of most of the items elsewhere. They've got a ways to go to improve the customer experience.ReplyDeletepathosOctober 18, 2011 at 7:09 AMWhat actually happened at Vogue?ReplyDeleteElaineOctober 18, 2011 at 8:28 AMWell it's about DAMN time they hired SOMEONE to be in charge of it!I'm dubious, though. I don't like the sound of his background. It's very rare for anyone in marketing to stay in one position for so long -- it doesnn't bode well for fresh, new ideas. and I have trouble believing that time spent at Vogue, of all places, prepares you well for retail, mass-market fashion marketing. Time will tell. I hope I'm wrong, but something tells me Dear Leader was more impressed with this guy's pedigree than with his actual accomplishments in strategic marketing.Now.....marketing can't fix customer service. Who's in charge there? Whoever it is should get the axe and be replaced by someone who actually wants to keep the customer J Crew has and oh, I don't know, get some new ones maybe?*huffs*ReplyDeletewellfedfredOctober 18, 2011 at 8:42 AMOr they could work on quality, consistency, fair pricing, and reliable inventory control, and the products would market themselves. Effortlessly.ReplyDeleteElaineOctober 18, 2011 at 8:46 AMOh Fred, go on with your crazy talk. :PReplyDeletesilver_liningOctober 18, 2011 at 8:48 AMExactly, Elaine and WFF!  I have a feeling we're in for more lipstick on a pig.  JC has been been coasting on being "darlings" of mass-market retail for a long time - but now the declining quality is starting to catch up with them.  Wonder what the spin is going to be this time...ReplyDeleterufflesOctober 18, 2011 at 10:54 AMI see this as more evidence of creating and marketing "celebrity" management (Mickey, Jenna, Marisa, et al) to move merch than focusing on product quality and the customer experience.ReplyDeleteCloset CrisisOctober 18, 2011 at 11:16 AMSo is this why I didn't receive my October catalog? Phhhht.ReplyDeleteJGerbsOctober 18, 2011 at 11:50 AMI am hoping that the "seamless experience" bit means that j.crew will finally get its pricing, promotions, cadence of merchandise flow, etc. in sync across all distribution channels (store, online, catalog, etc.)...!!!ReplyDeleteShariyuOctober 18, 2011 at 11:57 AMditto to all...I would like to see for online, the option to put a "wish list" so you can save items and a review section so people can see through the website directly. It also would be nice if JCREW did more for their regular customers (i.e. get names, etc) and let them in on specials that are not tied to "reward points" from CC use.  There are many of us who really are JCREW diehards.  They should learn to treat those customers a little better.ReplyDeleteRoseOctober 18, 2011 at 12:33 PMmaking the customer experience seamless from social media to direct mail to the in-store experience...Maybe we'll be able to order right off a link on a blog or our Facebook. ;)ReplyDeletewellfedfredOctober 18, 2011 at 3:21 PMfunny, I thought at DL's age he would have learned how to diagram a sentence.ReplyDeletepbergeronJanuary 11, 2012 at 9:59 AMI believe I can help JCrew increase sales and improve their online presence.  I have some very specific ideas that are relatively easy to implement.  I am a software developer with a background in psychology and a keen interest in marketing.  How would one go about presenting ideas to Diego/marketing/sales division?ReplyDeleteAdd commentLoad more...

In this role, Scotti oversees the global management of Verizon’s brand, including consumer insights, digital marketing, creative development and agency management, marketing effectiveness, social responsibility, sponsorships, media and employee communications. Given the demonstrated power of big data and digital marketing, Scotti also oversees the leveraging of Verizon’s current capabilities to help build its global brand.

Scotti Will Lead Global Management of Verizon’s Brand Across all Business Units











 








NEW YORK – Verizon Communications has named Diego Scotti its chief marketing officer, effective Oct. 6. Scotti will lead marketing efforts for all of Verizon’s wireless and wireline business units as the company continues to differentiate itself as the leader in a vibrantly competitive industry.
“Diego has a proven track record of delivering results by growing market share and brand loyalty throughout his career,” said Lowell McAdam, chairman and CEO, Verizon. “As I’ve said before, this is one of the most exciting and dynamic times we’ve ever seen in our industry. He brings the traditional and digital marketing expertise that’s required to expand our leadership position.”
Scotti has a wealth of experience creating and developing innovative marketing strategies and unique customer experiences. Diego most recently served as the CMO at J.Crew. Prior to J.Crew he oversaw marketing for several print and digital media brands at Conde Nast and was previously the head of global advertising and brand management at American Express.
“I am thrilled to be joining the industry leader, and I look forward to collaborating with the team to keep winning in the marketplace,” said Scotti.
In this newly created chief marketing officer role, Scotti will oversee all aspects of Verizon’s global brand management including advertising, consumer insights, digital marketing, creative development, marketing effectiveness, media and sponsorships, social responsibility, and employee communications. 
Scotti has been recognized one of the “Marketing Top 40 under 40” by Advertising Age (2007) and one of 21 marketers named “Internationalists” by International Magazine (2012). A native of Argentina, Scotti earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in advertising and marketing communications from the University of Management and Social Sciences in Buenos Aires.
