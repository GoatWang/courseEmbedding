What are some common reasons for changing your legal name? 

Personal Choice.  You may simply not like your name or may want a name that is more easily spelled or pronounced. With TotalLegal, you can change your last name, first name and/or middle name.
Change a Child's Name.  The absence of a parent in a child's life, changes in parental rights/custody, and paternity determinations are among the most common reasons to change a child's name.
Share a Last Name.  Couples may want to create a hyphenated or entirely new last name for themselves.
Divorce.  If you took your spouse's last name upon marriage, you may want to resume a former name if you separate or divorce. In most states, it is easy to include a name change in your Divorce Decree.


Fraud and Name Changes.  The court will not grant a name change that 
		is requested for a fraudulent or illegal purpose such as evading criminal 
		prosecution or a civil lawsuit, avoiding creditors, or identity theft. 
TotalLegal™ has helped over 1 million people nationwide make essential documents themselves.

Event-Driven Opportunity Funds



Firm Overview
Standard General is a New York-based investment firm that manages event-driven opportunity funds.
We focus on companies with complex capital structures that are undergoing dramatic change or are faced with material events. The key to our investment approach is familiarity with both credit markets and equity investing. Companies in our universe have investable equity and credit components. Our experienced investment professionals analyze how each part of a company's capital structure will act and interact with the whole.
We complement this analysis with an event-driven approach. We seek mispriced opportunities that we anticipate the market will correct, or where we ourselves have the opportunity to create value. We apply this framework in an even-handed manner that generates both long and short investment ideas. Combining a catalyst-dependent focus with our willingness to position ourselves flexibly allows us to target an all-weather stream of returns.  We believe this approach can generate a differentiated and uncorrelated return stream.
Standard General was founded in 2007 and has been a SEC-registered Investment Adviser since 2009. We primarily manage capital for public and private pension plans, endowments, foundations, and high net worth individuals.



Investment Process
Our cross-capital structure approach gives us a broader foundation from which to identify specific events and catalysts.
We seek very specific situations, but we seek them broadly across markets, asset classes, and industries. The strategy allows us to be nimble and to go where markets offer the most compelling risk/reward opportunities. Most investment strategies are compartmentalized by different constraints-limited to debt or equity, by loans or bonds, by credit rating, by market capitalization, or by time horizon. Unencumbered by these restrictions, our strategy is to deploy capital in all of the above areas.
We use our analysis of specific credit considerations such as liquidity, collateral, and covenants to help us evaluate potential investments across capital structures.  Over the years, we have found this especially relevant for public companies that also have a credit component.  We believe we have an advantage over more equity-centric investors when evaluating such companies, as those unaccustomed to evaluating credit may minimize its relevance when markets are uneventful, yet overreact when credit issues loom.  Our cross-capital structure approach gives us a broader foundation from which to identify specific events and catalysts.
The greatest impact of employing this approach, particularly without the constraints of silos or arbitrary limitations, is that we uncover an uncommon pool of situations, which we believe has little overlap with other managers.  We believe that our investors are specifically drawn to our differentiated approach and portfolios.  Over time, this has given us the added advantage of a committed investor base that has allowed us to see events through to their resolution.

– William G.

Common Questions

Does a Will need to be notarized?What makes a Will legal?Can married couples create one Will that covers both people?What is the TotalLegal plan?What is your free offer?





A Secure and Trusted Way to Protect Your Family

Provide for your family
Specify whom you would like to receive your property
State your funeral and burial instructions
Create a trust for minor children
Disinherit a person(s)
Name a guardian for minor children
