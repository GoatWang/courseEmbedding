Group faq
How often should I do a fundraiser?
 Fundraising burnout can happen, especially if you run more than  3-4 fundraisers a year. Running one per season is not a bad idea, but one every  month can be too much. If people feel like you are always asking for money they  are less likely to say yes. Not to mention the poor volunteers. So, pick  carefully and space them out to see the best results!
 I want to do a product fundraiser. How do I choose a product?
 There are so many choices! Pick something you think people will  purchase (more than once). Pick something that is priced well for your  community and most importantly, when you find something people like, make a  tradition out of it. A great reason to pick Fund Forward is that we offer high  quality and delicious items. We offer gluten-free and nut free products too.  The fact is that there is something for everyone! 
 What type of fundraiser should I do?
 There are auctions, bake sales, events  such as talent shows or walk-A-thons and hundreds of different product  fundraisers. However, there are pros and cons to each. Product fundraisers  are highly effective with much less work than event fundraisers. Anyone  that plans an event knows it takes months. However, a product fundraiser can be  put together in less than a month. 
How much profit does my organization earn?
The profit you make depends on your group – how you promote your fundraiser,  how motivated your sellers are, and how often your group runs fundraisers. You  will earn approximately 20% for every item sold.  Our fundraising experts  will share proven tips and techniques with you to help you have a successful  fundraiser.  
How long does it take to run a fundraiser?
 From your first contact with us through the delivery of your goods your fundraiser  in approximately 6 weeks.  Once you schedule your delivery date and time  with our representative, you’ll receive your order forms and sales  materials. We recommend your group sell for approximately 2  weeks.  You’ll then submit your order to us, and within about 3 weeks  we’ll deliver your order on your scheduled date and time.
 How long does it take to receive our order?
 We can get your products delivered to you  within 14-21 business days.  Please contact us for more details on  timelines and minimums for free shipping.  
How  does our order arrive?
 Your product comes delivered frozen and dropped off  at the location you specify.
Are  there any up front costs to my group?
 There’s no up front cost to your group and no hidden fees with a Fund Forward  Fundraiser.  Your sellers collect payment as they sell to customers.   Order forms and payment are collected and tallied by your group coordinator. Your  group coordinator meets with Fund Forward and signs off and pays for the order.  On delivery day, your group receives all your goods and proceeds to distribute  them to their customers. The team is also presented with their profit cheque.
 Can  anyone sample the products for sale? 
 Sample kits can be viewed simply by setting up a meeting time with Fund Forward  Coordinator. Sample kits can be purchased for kick off functions or other group  functions.

Greetings Fund Raising Groups
Thanks for showing interest in our Fund Forward Fundraiser! We would like to share with your group, this opportunity to raise funds. The product we offer is of the highest quality and is a great value! Previous groups have told us it is an easy sell and very well received! Products available include such items as: AAA Steaks, Premium Burgers, Chicken, Salmon, Sushi, Shrimp, cheese cake, cookies and much, much more. We have attached a copy of a sample order sheet, but items and prices are set per group to design your custom order form.
				
How it works

We meet with your group coordinator, go over the product list and answer any questions you may have. Sample product can be viewed or purchased. 
We set a time frame that your group would like to run this fundraiser and discuss pricing. 
We email you: an introductory letter, your personal webpage link, and an order sheet for your members to forward to potential purchasers. 
Your group coordinator will email you a tally sheet for your members, and one for you, to keep your group's totals. 
Your group coordinator will enter any remaining orders and payment that are not completed on-line. 
Reports are compiled and sent to the coordinator to forward to the group and then the coordinator and Fund Forward specialist will confirm closing date, delivery date and a pick-up location is set. 
 Orders MUST be placed and paid for within 30 days to receive quoted prices. (Late orders will be subject to next month's pricing.) 
Coordinator signs for order and distributes it to your members. 
Your members deliver their orders. 
 Your team enjoys the profit they have made!!!

FREE FUNDRAISING






YouCaring is dedicated to helping as many people as possible. This is why we will never charge anyone to raise money on our site.

Start your own fundraiser today.
It's free!
Create Fundraiser







Our Crowdfunding Platform Charges $0
Most crowdfunding sites charge 5% to 10% in fees just to use their platform. We never have and never will. This is because we believe that for people facing life’s challenges, every dollar counts. With more than $500 million in donations raised, our free fundraising platform has saved fundraisers more than $13 million in fees.

0% fee















5% – 10% fee









Donation Processor Costs

All online fundraising requires a third-party credit card processor such as PayPal, WePay or Stripe. These processors allow money to be safely collected and transferred online, but they do charge small fees for this service. Each donation processor charges 2.9% plus $0.30 per transaction.
This is not a YouCaring fee.

To learn more about our donation processors, read our blog post Which Donation Processor Is Right for Your Fundraiser. Rest assured, you can change donation processors at any time during your campaign. Simply contact us and we’ll be happy to guide you through the process.






Keep More of Your Money

When a donation is processed, the donation processor deducts their cost from the donation total. For example, if someone donates $100, the donation processor will take 2.9% plus $.30, resulting in a $3.20 fee. Other sites charge an additional 5% to 10% just to use their site.
YouCaring saves you money by charging no site fees.

How YouCaring Supports Itself

We rely on the generosity of our users to help us provide a free crowdfunding platform for those struggling with life’s challenges. At times, we do receive financial support from our amazing processors and other partners. People who give to fundraisers on YouCaring have the option of providing a voluntary contribution to support our operations and help keep fundraising free. We are incredibly grateful to those who have contributed and in doing so, chosen to participate in our mission to bring life-changing philanthropy to as many people as possible.

The Houston-based MLP Team is led by seasoned MLP portfolio managers Greg Reid and Ted Gardner, and director of research Parag Sanghani. Houston is the home for many MLPs. In fact, corporate headquarters for 65% of the total market capitalization of the midstream MLP universe is within minutes of our offices. Salient’s MLP strategies are designed to provide the opportunity to potentially capture attractive total returns driven by a combination of distribution yield plus prospective distribution growth. MLP returns have historically had a low correlation to the S&P 500, REITs, high yield, and bonds.

HOUSTON, Feb. 11, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Salient Partners L.P. ("Salient") announced today its proposal to acquire Forward Management, LLC ("Forward"), an independent, privately-held asset management firm based in San Francisco, California, and investment advisor to the Forward Funds. Upon completion of the transaction, the combined firm will manage and advise over $27 billion in assets. 
Salient and Forward expect the proposed transaction to close in the second quarter of 2015, pending approval by Forward Funds' shareholders and fulfillment of customary closing conditions. Once completed, the transaction will accelerate Salient's growth as an industry leader in innovative liquid alternatives strategies, with funds in a variety of nontraditional markets and asset classes, including master limited partnerships ("MLPs"), real estate investment trust ("REIT") securities, trend following, risk parity and hard-to-access equity and credit markets. The investment strategies will be managed and supported by the combined firm's more than 250 employees from offices in Houston, San Francisco and New York.
"We are thrilled to unite with Forward in this transformational partnership. Our goal is to help investors focus on what truly matters—cost-effective investment strategies that seek to provide diversification in uncertain times," said John Blaisdell, chairman and chief executive officer of Salient. "The combined platform will add scale, reach and depth to all areas of our business, helping us support institutional investors and financial advisors nationwide."
"Salient and Forward have a lot in common—we're both independently-owned businesses with a focus on innovation in asset management that offer risk-conscious investment tools to address challenges of modern-day markets," said Alan Reid, chief executive officer of Forward. "We have a mutual respect for the businesses we have built from the ground up, and together we will move to a new stage of development, while preserving the central tenets of what Forward has become." 
Salient's senior management team will lead the combined company, with John Blaisdell as chairman and chief executive officer and Lee Partridge as chief investment officer. Rob Naka, Forward's chief operating officer, will hold the same role at the newly combined company. 
Both Forward and Salient's portfolio management teams will report to Lee Partridge. Forward's investment approach and processes are anticipated to remain unchanged. Forward's team will continue to operate from its existing San Francisco office. 
"At Salient, we believe that focusing on what matters in investing means finding better answers than the conventional wisdom of Wall Street. This focus is even more important in a world of historically low interest rates and flagging global growth," said Lee Partridge, chief investment officer of Salient. "Finding outstanding portfolio management teams, like those at Forward, who share our values and these beliefs, is a rare opportunity."
Salient and Forward will combine their complementary mutual fund offerings to provide a diverse suite of innovative asset allocation and alternative strategies designed to allow investors the opportunity to create diversified portfolios or enhance their existing portfolios. Salient plans to add to its institutional product offerings with new private funds and separately managed accounts based on Forward's investment strategies.
The combined suite of funds will include:

Global asset allocation, including Salient's risk parity strategy; 
Real asset investments, including MLPs, REITs and global infrastructure strategies; 
Diversifying alternative investments, including tactical, long/short equity and trend-following strategies; 
Focused equity investments, including international, emerging market and dividend growth strategies; and 
Fixed income and credit investments, including emerging market corporate debt.
Salient and Forward's shared commitment to investor education and financial advisor support will be reflected in the combined thought leadership platform. Team members will continue to share their market views, insights and investment perspectives through both traditional and social media channels. Both the FWD Thinking blog and Salient's nationally-recognized Epsilon Theory newsletter will continue to provide insightful and differentiated commentary on pressing issues in the investment world.

RISKS
There are risks involved with investing, including loss of principal. Past performance does not guarantee future results, share prices will fluctuate and you may have a gain or loss when you redeem shares.
Alternative strategies typically are subject to increased risk and loss of principal. Consequently, investments such as mutual funds which focus on alternative strategies are not suitable for all investors.
Asset allocation and diversification do not assure profit or protect against risk.
Master limited partnerships (MLPs) are a type of limited partnership that is publically traded. MLPs have the potential to be highly volatile and MLPs are also subject to liquidity risk, potential conflicts of interest as a result of the MLP ownership structure and the risk of the specific sector in which the MLP is concentrated.
Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) invests in real estate directly either through properties or mortgages.
Risk parity is a portfolio allocation strategy based on targeting risk levels across various components of an investment portfolio.
Trend following is an investment strategy based on technical analysis of market prices.
The $27 billion pro forma assets under management and advisement noted above reflect the assets at Salient Partners, L.P. and Forward Management, LLC, as of December 31, 2014.
Alan Reid is a registered representative of Forward Securities, LLC.
Forward Funds are distributed by Forward Securities, LLC.

What is Crowdfunding?

noun
Crowdfunding is the practice of funding a project or cause by raising money from a large number of people, typically through the Internet. It is a form of peer-to-peer fundraising that harnesses the power of social networks to raise awareness and draw donations from around the world for online campaigns.








How is Compassionate Crowdfunding™ Different?

YouCaring is a free online fundraising platform that pioneered Compassionate Crowdfunding™—empowering people worldwide to rally support for personal and charitable causes without the fundraising fees associated with other sites. To date, the YouCaring community is 5.5 million strong and has raised more than $500 million for humanitarian causes.
Start Crowdfunding








The Rise of Crowdfunding


The flourishing sharing economy is changing the landscape of fundraising, and in recent years, crowdfunding has dominated the scene. According to research firm Massolution, donation-based crowdfunding alone grew more than 50 percent in 2015, raising nearly $3 billion. The overall crowdfunding market, including donation-based, lending-based, reward-based and equity-based funding, was expected to grow to $34.5 billion in 2015, more than double that of 2014.







Recent statistics contributing to crowdfunding’s popularity:

Annual out-of-pocket medical expenses in the U.S. have risen to $400 billion, or $1,254 per person.1
Average medical deductibles in the last eight years have increased 100 percent, from $584 to $1,217 for individuals, not including the price of co-pays, co-insurance, drugs and procedures not covered by health insurance plans.2
Forty seven percent of Americans can’t afford $2,000 in an emergency
Annual charitable giving in the U.S. has grown to $360 billion, with 72 percent coming from individuals.3
The sharing economy in 2015 is estimated to be $15 billion and projected to grow to $335 billion by 2035.4





How can you key into the trend and help yourself or someone you love overcome a hardship or challenge by launching a successful crowdfunding campaign?


How To Crowdfund













1. Create
YouCaring’s easy-to-use fundraiser template allows you to create an effective home page for your crowdfunding campaign. Show potential donors how they can help by telling a compelling story, uploading several pictures and videos, and posting updates.



2. Share
Activate your social network. With just a few clicks, spread the word of your fundraiser to friends, family and other potential donors through Facebook, Twitter, email and other channels. Each share is worth $37 on average.



3. Collect
Donations to your fundraiser can be transferred into your account as they’re received. YouCaring provides free fundraising, which means we don’t charge a thing. The donation processor does, however, take 2.9%, plus $.30 per transaction.








Best Crowdfunding Practices
The most important goal of crowdfunding is to build a community and a network that empathizes with your cause and donates.






Five Key Strategies:


Plan Ahead
Create a social presence by setting up Facebook and Twitter accounts if you haven’t already done so. Immediately start connecting with as many friends, family members, coworkers and acquaintances as possible. See our Using Social Media to Promote Your Fundraiser page. Also consider setting up a blog or website devoted to your cause to further boost your social presence. See our How to Start a Fundraising Website or Blog page.

Make It Compelling
From the title to the story to the visuals, your campaign should inspire potential donors to contribute to your cause. Take time to create a great name for your campaign and write an engaging story. Uploading several high-quality photos and one or more videos can exponentially increase donations to your campaign. For additional tips, see these YouCaring articles: Great Ideas for Naming Your Online Fundraiser, How Images Can Lead to Fundraising Success and Videos Are Powerful Fundraiser Tools.

Share and Update
Sharing your campaign often via social media channels and asking your friends, family and others to do the same is the best way to raise awareness and support for your cause. Every share can raise $37. Multiply those shares and your fundraiser may go viral. Meanwhile, well-written updates keep supporters and potential donors engaged. Fundraisers with five updates can raise 15 times more than those with one. Fundraisers with 20 or more updates on average meet their fundraising goal.

Organize Offline Events
Complementing your online campaign with an offline fundraiser can get your community personally involved and rally support from local businesses. Sports tournaments, dinners, auctions, dances and other events are great options. See our Fundraising Ideas page for other tips.

Reach Out to the Media
Getting your campaign covered by a local newspaper, T.V. station, radio station or even blogger and Facebook pages can propel your fundraiser to new heights. See our tips page, How to Get Local Media to Cover Your Fundraiser.

The Crowdfunding Platform You Choose Matters
It is vital to pick the crowdfunding platform that best suits your needs and your cause. The most important aspects include the fees charged to fundraise, the site’s customer service standards and reputation, the schedule for payment of donations, the caliber of online tools available to illustrate and share your campaign, and the quality of the site—from the visuals to the user experience.

Crowdfunding Campaign Success Stories






Help Save Matthew!





Goal: $800,000

Raised: $835,918



Matthew Schreindorfer and his wife, Katia Luciani, could not have imagined the journey they would face starting in August 2014. At age 24, Matthew was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. He had gone through every possible treatment in Canada, all of which failed to bring him into remission. According to his doctors, his only hope was to be admitted for a CART-19 clinical trial in the U.S. The couple started working with Sloan Kettering Cancer Institute in New York and started a YouCaring fundraiser with a goal of $800,000, the estimated cost for the treatment. With the help of family and friends in Canada, and newfound supporters in the U.S. and around the world, the couple was able to drum up plenty of support for the clinical trial in the U.S., which proved to be fruitful, putting Matthew in remission for more than six months.

And Luca Makes 5 – Mullen Family Adoption





Goal: $40,500

Raised: $41,259



In February 2016, the Mullen Family of Bethany, Okla., brought home their third adoptive child, Luca, a 3-year-old Eastern European boy with special needs. The joyous occasion came after nearly one year of fundraising, the majority of which included the YouCaring campaign, And Luca Makes 5: The Mullen Family Adoption. After 15 years of marriage, during which the couple was unable to have children, they embarked on an adoptive journey to grow their family, and brought Levi and Lia home in 2011. Their YouCaring fundraiser to adopt Luca raised more than $41,000. Successful strategies didn’t get any better than the Mullen’s over the course of their campaign, during which time they involved their children in many of the happy moments leading up to the last stretch to welcome little Luca.

Help Fatal Arson Survivor Safyre Terry and Family





Goal: $15,000

Raised: $432,249



The story of 7-year-old Safyre Terry stole the hearts of people around the world when a Facebook post in 2015 describing her wish to receive Christmas cards went viral. Safyre was a courageous young burn victim from Upstate New York who was the only survivor of a house fire that killed the rest of her family in 2013. At the time, Safyre was 5 years old, and through all of her medical treatments and ensuing challenges, has remained a bright, optimistic girl who loves life. Around the time of the Facebook post, a YouCaring fundraiser had also been started by friends for Safyre’s aunt and uncle, Mike and Liz Dolder, who are now raising her. The fundraiser was set up to help with the costs of medical treatments and other expenses. Nearly 10,000 people from around the world contributed to the campaign.

Bonsai: Half the Bulldog, Twice the Love





Goal: $1

Raised: $22,898



It’s hard to resist a cute black and white bulldog puppy. But when you see Bonsai, born with multiple rare medical conditions that left him with only half a spine and no pelvis playing with a big pink squeaky toy, still just as rambunctious and playful as any puppy with four legs, it truly tugs at your heartstrings. A group of individuals from Friends of Emma, a rescue organization, took to crowdfunding to give Bonsai a leg up in his treatment. The fundraiser has successfully raised nearly $23,000 to help pay for Bonsai’s medical treatments and a possible mobility device to give him an even happier and healthier life.

Keys to Success

Nearly 7,000 social media shares
More than 40 photos and 15 videos in the fundraiser gallery showing Bonsai’s daily progress and interaction with other dogs

                            MLPs and Energy                        


The Houston-based MLP Team is led by seasoned MLP portfolio managers Greg Reid and Ted Gardner, and director of research Parag Sanghani. Houston is the home for many MLPs. In fact, corporate headquarters for 65% of the total market capitalization of the midstream MLP universe is within minutes of our offices. Salient’s MLP strategies are designed to provide the opportunity to potentially capture attractive total returns driven by a combination of distribution yield plus prospective distribution growth. MLP returns have historically had a low correlation to the S&P 500, REITs, high yield, and bonds.

Testimonials
Calgary Northstar Hockey Association
I have participated in a Fund Forward Fundraiser with my son’s Lacrosse and Hockey teams for the last 4 years.  It is one of the best fundraisers ever!  The food is great and there is a large variety of items to choose from. We have family and friends that now wait for the invitation to order to keep their freezer stocked.  I really prefer asking them to buy these quality food items then….tickets on a wine basket!   The online ordering and paying by credit card make this a really easy fundraiser to manage.  Participants can go to the website and find all they need to know about the products. I no longer offer the order forms to anyone and keep it simple by having everyone order and pay online. The division of profit by player is appreciated by all and allows for team members to opt in or out without impacting everyone.  Thanks to Connie for the great job she does coordinating the orders and the pick-up,  all-in-all a fantastic experience!
Calgary Round Up Band
Music is deeply important in my 17 year old daughter's life, she has known she wants to be a music teacher since grade five! Fund Forward and Great Meals has been generously helping our family raise the needed money for band trips, lessons, and must-have instrument accessories for almost three years now.  We have had no issues what so ever finding people to buy these products, in fact we too have been asked when the next fundraiser is.  The food is varied and delicious (steaks, mmmmmm!) and the nice people running the company have been helpful and fast to get the deliveries to us. With it being so easy to order things on their website and though our family's experience with them, I would highly recommend them for your fund raising activities!
Babe Ruth Baseball
Big thanks to Fund Forward for making this fundraising initiative easy as 1-2-3!  Online ordering websites set up for each of our baseball clubs made it easy for our teams to share these amazing products with family and friends.  Corrie and her team went above and beyond in all stages handling any issues we encountered quickly and benefitting our families first!   Can’t wait for our next fundraising opportunity of these amazing products!
The Calgary Round Up Band Fundraising Team
I am here to tell you after years of dealing with fundraising companies it is one of the most refreshing experiences to have a company that makes a triple check system with your supporters as well as your organization.  They are efficient and ultimately one of the most user friendly companies I have dealt with.  I would and do recommend Fund Forward to anyone looking for quality and coordination to make it a pleasure to join the growth of your organization.

McKenzie United Soccer Club
MUSC Blues have placed two fundraising orders with fund Forward and have been extremely happy with the service provided. The products are of the highest quality and there is ample information about each and every item that can be purchased, the range of products available is awesome.  Some parents of the club made several repeat orders due to the high quality of the products.
Corrie was fantastic and answered any questions promptly, she was also very accommodating with the timescale for our orders.  The webpage was extremely easy to follow and the parents were very happy with online ordering. We were very happy with our profit and this allowed our team to enter and pay for Soccer tournaments.
St. Mary’s Cochrane Knights of Columbus
Because of the success of our fundraising program through Fund Forward, we managed to augment our donations to our parish and the local community with little effort, leaving time free for our other charity drives.  The addition of shopping on-line was convenient for our members and delivery/pick-up stress free and prompt. Food quality was excellent and service was awesome! We are returning customers and will return again!
Bishop O Byrne Social 30
We ran our program just prior to Christmas and many people were excited to stock their freezers. The on–line ordering system made it super easy for our customers to order and answered any questions they had about ingredients, nutritional values, and case sizes. It was convenient to have the orders and money get placed directly.
Bow Valley Bantam Hockey
You know it’s a good product when your friends call you up and ask when you are having your next fund raiser; “we are running low on product!”  I have been coordinating team fund raisers with Fund Forward for the past 3 years for a wide range of teams. This is an easy program to run. The reports provided at the end are helpful in tracking individual participation. Whenever a problem arises it is resolved in a professional and timely manner.
