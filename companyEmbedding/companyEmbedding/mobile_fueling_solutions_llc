Our gearboxes have some of the highest power density ratings in the industry.



With the latest design and manufacturing technology, our gearboxes offer the advantage of carburized, hardened and ground gearing in a wide range of sizes and features. Made of fabricated steel housings, they offer both strength and integrity.
Keystone series speed reducers
Brad Foote Gearing has a complete offering of catalog parallel helical and right-angle helical enclosed drive gearboxes. Our Keystone units are designed to maximize output, while at the same time minimizing space constraints. The result is some of the highest power density ratings in the industry.
Drop-in replacement gearboxes
Our design engineers specialize in drop-in replacements and can recreate an existing gear drive for a precise match.
Custom gearboxes
We feature in-house and third-party consultant gear design and engineering services along with specialized software. We can also design a new enclosed drive gearbox to fit your custom speciﬁcations, including:

Parallel shaft gearboxes
Right-hand gearboxes
Planetary gearboxes
Differential gearboxes

Gearbox Services
One of our customers shipped us a housing with scrap herringbone gearing. 



We refurbished their existing housing and re-engineered their antiquated components into a modern design with AGMA Q12 thru-hardened helical gearing, ISO dimensioned bearings and an enhanced service factor to provide years of trouble-free service and at substantially less cost than a new unit.
Brad Foote builds spare units for process lines that use obsolete gearbox designs. When spares or replacements are required the original equipment manufacturer may not be your best choice. If the product being ordered is no longer the manufacturer’s “current design,” you may find the price and lead-time to be excessive. We can custom build DROP-IN REPLACEMENT GEARBOXES that meet or exceed the capabilities of the original drives at prices less than the OEMs
Repair Center - Your One-Stop Shop for Gearboxes and Critical Spares
Brad Foote repairs and refurbishes gearboxes from most manufacturers and is equipped to meet all of your unique service requirements. Need a critical spare fast?  We can help!  Brad Foote is one of the largest precision gear and custom-engineered gearbox manufacturers in North America and is dedicated to superior quality to exceed your expectations.  Whether your need a critical spare to keep your equipment running, drop-in replacement, or a reverse-engineered part or gearbox, we've got your gearnng needs covered and are ready to help!
