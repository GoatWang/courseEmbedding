We always enjoyed visiting you at Willows when we were seeing my Dad Frank Armata the concern & love you showed for Frank his last few days before he passed on April 1st was very touching & helped us to get through. Although we only knew you for a short time it was always on our to do list to stop by and see you especially when we brought Darla (cocker spaniel) to Willows. We will miss you Phyllis & I will always cherish the bracelets you gave.

Phyllis (with 2 LL's--she used to make sure you spelled her name right)  You were one hell of a lady who made sure others were taken care of before yourself.  Thank you for the numerous lunches you would bring me to make sure I was eating right!  Although I haven't worked at the clinic for some time now, I never forgot your generosity and humility or your spit fire personality.  Rest in peace my friend and give em' heck up there!!  XOXOXO'S!!
