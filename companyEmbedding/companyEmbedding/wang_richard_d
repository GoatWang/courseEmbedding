For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia.

If a provider practices in a state where data is unavailable, please reach out to your local state legislature to help make this data publicly available.0 SanctionsWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?No sanctions history found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.Background CheckWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?A sanction, also known as a disciplinary action, is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct. Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0 Board ActionsWhat are board actions?No board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.Background CheckWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered.

He is very friendly and explains everything and his office staff are very helpful too.  55-John E Schappert in Hamilton, VA | Jan 19, 2017Dr Wang, by my experiences with him, is top notch. I have had an extraction and several implants and he has been excellent. He tells you what he is going to do and then performs the oral surgery making sure you are not in pain. He also has a good sense of humor and personality. No matter what questions I have asked he always gives me concise answers.
He spent much time with my regular dentist in consultation so they were both on the same page.
Thank you Dr Wang
45-Jess Smith in Woodbridge Va | Oct 19, 2016This practice was great. I called to move my appointment up and they called back to offer me a cancellation spot. Dr. Wang was very good, as well as the nurses. Definitely would recommend this practice to others.55-John in Fredericksburg, VA | Oct 12, 2016I was quite anxious about having a surgical extraction and the sleep meds because of my problems with HBP, Anxiety atttacks, and Sleep Apnea. Dr. Wang and his staff took excellent care of me and I truly appreciate all of their efforts to keep me comfortable throughout the process. I felt completely fine when I came too and was told there were no complications while I was under. This is a credit to their knowledge, expertise, and experience. Thanks again to everyone who got me through this.15-Ashwitha Shetty in Herndon, VA | Sep 07, 2016Got my Husband's wisdom tooth Extraction done here last month. Was satisfied with the doctor's work. He seemed sweet and understanding. Even the assistant was a very sweet lady. But the biggest turn off was the receptionist who was this older lady who reeked of arrogance. There were some clarifications to be done on the insurance, Instead of being helpful and trying and sorting the issue she made rude faces and kept rolling her eye. Had a terrible experience!! would nvr wnt to see her face again15reston, va | Jul 18, 2016I recently got my wisdom teeth out and immediately regretted it. Im 22 years old and only brought my dad so he could drive me home but they decided that instead of giving ME all of my needed paperwork and post op treatments, they gave it to him and didnt explain to me what to do and not to do after surgery so I ended up with insanely painful dry socket. The women at the front desk is beyond rude and was no help whatsoever. Overall, dont recommend anyone to go there. 35Washington, DC | Jan 05, 2016I've seen Dr. Wang on two occasions. I appreciate how they have made time for me both times. However, the main office woman is consistently rude without merit, and I'd honestly rather not go just to avoid her confrontational attitude.

Biography



Download Curriculum Vitae
Dr. Wang grew up in Houston and received his B.S. from Stanford University. He then enrolled in the Tri-Institutional M.D./Ph.D. Program in New York. He completed his graduate work with Titia de Lange at The Rockefeller University where he studied the role of telomeres in the growth of both normal and transformed cells.
After receiving his M.D. from Cornell in 2006, he returned to Texas to complete his internship in internal medicine and residency in dermatology at UT Southwestern. He received support from the UTSW Physician Scientist Training Program and the Dermatology Foundation to do a research fellowship with Beth Levine.
His research focuses on pathways central to both the development of normal skin and non-melanoma skin cancer tumorigenesis. Specific areas of interest include autophagy and glucose transport. Research in the laboratory is supported by a K08 grant from the NIH/NCI and a Career Award for Medical Scientists from the Burroughs Wellcome Fund.
Dr. Wang practices general dermatology and has an interest in immunosuppressed patients with skin cancers or viral infections, including emerging polyomaviruses.

Bio

Richard Wang is an Assistant Professor at Babson College where he teaches business strategy courses at the undergraduate and MBA levels.

Richard’s research specializes in competitive strategy, innovation management, and the interaction between business and government policy. Examples of his current research projects include competition in the Chinese satellite TV industry, digital book publishing on Amazon Kindle, and the impact of recreational marijuana laws on local businesses in Washington State. Richard also conducted field research in Beijing and Shanghai to develop case studies on Chinese technology and media companies. His article “Tournaments for Ideas” won the Accenture Award for best article in the California Management Review, and his paper “Competition-Driven Repositioning” won the best proposal award at the Strategic Management Society China Conference.

Richard earned his Ph.D. in Business & Public Policy from the University of California Berkeley, his S.M. in Engineering from MIT, his MBA from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and his B.S. in Aeronautics from the University of Washington in Seattle. Before joining Babson, Richard was on the faculty of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis where he taught entrepreneurship, industry analysis, and competitive strategy to undergraduates and evening MBA students.

Prior to entering academia, Richard began his career as an engineering and quality management consultant in Hong Kong and China. He served clients in a broad range of industries spanning from commercial aircraft maintenance to luxury goods manufacturing. After his MBA, Richard co-founded in Shenzhen China a software outsourcing house which was later acquired by a California-based IT company. Richard also spent a year volunteering full-time with an international non-profit organization to implement community development projects in Tianjin, Hebei, and Inner Mongolia regions of China.​
