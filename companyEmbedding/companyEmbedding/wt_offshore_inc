Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include Nobilis Health Corp  (NYSEMKT:  HLTH - Free Report   ), Extended Stay America Inc  (NYSE:  STAY - Free Report   ), SYNNEX Corporation  (NYSE:  SNX - Free Report   ), Citizens Financial Group Inc  (NYSE:  CFG - Free Report   ) and W&T Offshore, Inc  . (NYSE:  WTI - Free Report   ). Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free .   Here are highlights from Tuesday's Analyst Blog:    U.S. Job Market Roars Back to Life: Top 5 Gainers   U.S. stock indices closed the first week of July higher on robust jobs data, representing the second highest number of job addition in the year. The latest jobs data gave investors confidence in the strength of the economy. Almost every industry added jobs in June, with education and health services, leisure and hospitality, professional and business services, financial activities and energy companies remaining at the forefront, exceeding Wall Street's expectations. This is why adding stocks from these areas seem sensible at the moment.  Hiring Grows in Spring  The U.S. economy added 222,000 jobs in June as hiring picked up pace in the spring despite the growing shortage of skilled workers. The rise was the highest in the last four months and the second largest this year. The jump in payrolls followed a discouraging May that saw 152,000 new jobs. However, this figure was revised higher from an initially reported 138,000, while April's figures were also revised upward from 174,000 to 207,000. At the same time, unemployment rate ticked up to 4.4% in June from a 16-year low of 4.3% in May as more number of people entered the labor force. The labor-force participation rate edged higher to 62.8%. Since January, the jobless rate has declined by 0.4 percentage point. Hourly pay, in the meanwhile, rose 0.2% to $26.25 an hour in June. In the past 12 months, wages rose a modest 2.5%. Here are some of the reactions to the Labor Department's report on upbeat job creations last month: "June job gains bounced back and revisions pushed previous readings for April and May, which signals that the apparent weakness in past months was just a blip due in part to late data reporting" - Danielle Hale, managing director of housing research at the National Association of Realtors  . "Major slowdown in job growth was premature, while wage growth may resume accelerating later in the year." - Gad Levanon, chief economist, North America for The Conference Board  . "June has historically seen relatively strong employment gains, as recent college grads land their first jobs." - Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Zillow  .  Every Industry Added Jobs in June  Job gains were broad-based, with health care companies hiring 37,000 workers. Hospitals continue to add employees for years to enhance care for the ageing population and tackle the sweeping changes brought about by the Obamacare. Lest we forget, the Senate Republicans unveiled a new Bill that won't change the Obamacare as drastically as the House legislation passed in May (read more: Republicans Present Healthcare Bill: Top 5 Gainers  ). The bulk of job growth came from the much larger sectors of leisure and hospitality at 36,000. Professional and business services added 35,000 jobs, which turned out to be another area of strong employment growth. Restaurants beefed up staff by 29,000, while banks and insurance firms added payrolls by 29,000. Banks, especially, are benefitting from the positive annual "stress test" results, Fed's rate hikes and the Trump administration's initiative to push for lesser regulations (read more: Big Banks Pass Fed's "Stress Test": 3 Top Winners  ). Retailers have also found some respite from online sellers, adding workers for the first time in five months. Meanwhile, energy companies, involved in fracking - extracting oil and gas from rock formations - added jobs for eight straight months. For two years at a stretch, the industry had suffered heavy layoffs due to a slump in  oil prices  .  5 Solid Winners  With the U.S. job market making a strong comeback last month, there is enough evidence that the labor market is in the pink. Picking stocks from education and health services, leisure and hospitality, professional and business services, financial activities and energy companies involved in fracking seems to be a smart option at this point, since they continue to be leading in job addition. However, picking the winning stocks may be difficult. This is where our VGM score  comes in handy. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and VGM score.  Nobilis Health Corp  (NYSEMKT:  HLTH - Free Report   ) owns and manages healthcare facilities in the States of Texas and Arizona, consisting primarily of ambulatory surgery centers and acute-care and surgical hospitals. The company has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a VGM of 'A.' The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings soared 250% over the last 60 days. The company is likely to give a return of 27.3% this year, higher than the Medical - HMOs  industry's projected gain of 15.6%.  Extended Stay America Inc  (NYSE:  STAY - Free Report   ) is an integrated owner/operator of company-branded hotels in North America. The company operates in hotel operations segment. Extended Stay America has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a VGM of 'B.' The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings increased almost 3% over the last 60 days. The company is likely to yield a return of 5.3% this year, higher than the Hotels and Motels  industry's projected gain of 0.2%.  SYNNEX Corporation  (NYSE:  SNX - Free Report   ) is a business process services company. The company has a Zacks Rank #1 and a VGM of 'B.' The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings rose 5.9% over the last 60 days. The company is likely to give a return of 19.8% this year, more than the Business - Software Services  industry's estimated gain of 12.9%. You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here.    Citizens Financial Group Inc  (NYSE:  CFG - Free Report   ) is a retail bank holding company. The company has a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM of 'B.' The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings advanced 0.8% over the last 60 days. The company is likely to yield a return of 27.8% this year, better than the Financial - Savings and Loan  industry's projected gain of 10.5%.  W&T Offshore, Inc  . (NYSE:  WTI - Free Report   ) is an independent oil and natural gas producer involved in the fracking business. The company has a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM of 'A.' The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings surged 23.4% over the last 60 days. The company is likely to give a return of 165.3% this year, higher than the Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States  industry's expected gain of 28.2%.  Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric   Cars?  Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge. With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research. It's not the one you think.   See This Ticker Free >>    Strong Stocks that Should Be in the News  Many are little publicized and fly under the Wall Street radar. They're virtually unknown to the general public. Yet today's 220 Zacks Rank #1 "Strong Buys" were generated by the stock-picking system that has nearly tripled the market from 1988 through 2015. Its average gain has been a stellar +26% per year.

		5 Energy Stocks to Buy on a Q3 Turnaround	
The best energy stocks to buy include SDRL BCEI PES WTI and EMES

Jul 10, 2017, 9:11 am EDT  |  By , Zacks Investment Research
 


 
 

These 5 energy stocks are bargain investments now, as the hope of a crude oil recovery in Q3 makes them stocks to buy at great discounts.
Last year, energy stocks were the strongest S&P sector performer with a market-thumping 24% return. In particular, November’s historic OPEC-led production cut deal to alleviate a supple glut managed to buoy oil prices and stabilize them around the psychologically important $50 per barrel threshold. The commodity was on a stellar run on optimism surrounding the agreement, and the outlook for oil stocks was getting better.
The seemingly positive developments encouraged investors to bet on firming prices for 2017 with the oil industry finally hoping that ‘this would be the year.’ True to the strong sentiments, U.S. oil prices reached around $55 per barrel in late February, the highest level in 19 months.
However, the situation is drastically different now, with the commodity having floundered in recent weeks. By June 21, crude had cratered more than 20% from its February highs and officially plunged into bear territory. In fact, prices ended down 14.3% for the first half of the year – the worst performance since 1998.
Apparently, there was one small thing that the bullish speculators didn’t account for – the spectacular boom in U.S. shale production. Arguably, the biggest development in global oil markets over the last few years, the relentless increase in North American shale output has undermined efforts by OPEC and other major producers to ‘rebalance’ the market and prop up prices.
Apart from the much-discussed shale production issue, there are some other reasons as well why oil markets remain oversupplied.
At the crux of the matter is the rising flood of U.S. shale-driven production. Now at a financial equilibrium, the shale firms are putting more rigs and employees back to work. Throughout the downturn, producers worked tirelessly to cut costs down to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil from rock. And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques.
With these efforts, many upstream companies have repositioned themselves to adapt to the new $50 oil reality and even thrive at those prices. In other words, while OPEC’s moves to trim output and rebalance the demand-supply situation has stabilized the market to a large extent, in the process it has incentivized shale drillers to churn out more. As per EIA’s latest inventory release, crude production over the last 4 weeks averaged about 9.31 million barrels per day, up 7.2% from the same 4-week period last year.
The extension of supply curbs by top producers led by OPEC also disappointed markets. At a meeting in Vienna in May, the cartel (plus non-members led by Russia) decided to roll over their output cuts of 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) to reduce global oil inventories until Mar 2018. The move, though widely expected, spooked some oil market investors who hoped that the cuts would be deepened/lengthened further.
Meanwhile, the producer cartel pumped more oil last month than in May – the second successive monthly rise in 2017 – on increasing output from Nigeria and Libya, which are exempt from the deal. The production boost offset improved compliance by other members.
It’s quite clearly evident that the output-cap agreement spearheaded by OPEC has failed to achieve its stated goal of bringing global crude stockpiles down to five-year averages. Even the various energy-monitoring bodies – EIA, IEA, and OPEC – have of late projected that U.S. crude production will continue to ramp up through 2018, thereby leading to slower-than-expected market rebalancing.
To sum it up, oil’s future direction will depend on the battle between the OPEC-led output cuts and the increase in U.S. shale production. But as of now, it seems that the ‘lower for longer’ oil is there to stay well into next year.
A Rebound for Energy Stocks in the Cards?
Some analysts believe that oil prices have bottomed out following the recent selloff. While a significant rebound is out of question due to the lingering supply-demand imbalance, one could expect some short-term price gains.
Investors have pinned hopes of crude recovery over the latest U.S. Energy Department’s inventory release that showed a fall in domestic oil production and a reduction in the U.S. rig count (number of rigs searching for oil and gas in the country) for the first time in 6 months – both pointing to a slowdown in shale output.
Yes, production is still climbing but growth might have tempered. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), domestic crude volumes have declined thrice in the last 8 weeks. Per the most recent report, U.S. output decreased 100,000 barrels per day – the largest fall since July 2016. As a proof, crude inventories have tumbled over 26 million barrels during the past 3 months. And with it, the pace of new rig addition has slowed down as well.
Even as we cannot run down the chances of the market moving sideways and seeing high volatility, many analysts are not too bearish about oil in the remainder of 2017.
If investors are eager to lap up opportunities in this notoriously volatile market, a prudent move would be to buy the beaten-down stocks with encouraging fundamentals. Stressed valuations do not always indicate that the stock has lost all potential. In fact, some could actually make a great buy. But prospective investors need to do adequate research before betting one’s hard-earned money on such stocks.
To guide investors to the right picks, we highlight 5 stocks that carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
The stocks, which we shall cherry-pick, currently come at a bargain price after declining at least 15% in the first 6 months of the year (as compared to oil’s 14.3% fall), but have the potential to turn around in the third quarter.
