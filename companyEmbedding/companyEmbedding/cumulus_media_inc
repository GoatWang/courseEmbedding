No Comments






Cumulus Media has tabbed Steve McKay as Program Director of AC 102.7 WGNI and Classic Rock “94.5 The Hawk” WKXS Wilmington NC.
McKay, who has been mostly out of the radio industry for the past decade, joins Cumulus from Beasley Media Classic Hits 100.1 WJRZ Manahawkin NJ where he was hosting weekends. He is best known for his runs programming Entercom Hot AC “94.9 The Point” WPTE Norfolk from 2002-2006 and Greater Media Rhythmic Oldies “95.7 Jammin’ Gold” WEJM Philadelphia in 1999-2000. He has also programmed CHR’s 93.5 WSBG Stroudsburg and 97.1 WBHT Wilkes-Barre PA and worked in sales for Max Media Norfolk during his radio career.
McKay fills the position previously held by Jackie Jordan until her exit in May.
Cumulus Media announces that it has appointed Steve McKay as Program Director for Adult Contemporary station WGNI-FM (102.7 GNI) and Classic Rock station WKXS-FM (94.5 The Hawk) in Wilmington, NC.
For over two decades, Steve McKay’s visionary radio programming has resulted in top ratings and revenue performance from Norfolk to Philadelphia. McKay brings to Cumulus a track record of team building, personality and brand development, and unique live and local content on-air, creating audience loyalty and ratings successes.
As Program Director of WPTE Norfolk, McKay implemented and grew a new brand that achieved #1 ratings, and the second-highest revenue in the market. WPTE was one of the top-performing Modern AC’s nationally. As Program Director of WBHT, a Mainstream Top 40 in Scranton, PA, ratings doubled in less than a year. In Philadelphia, McKay crafted the sound and talent line-up at Jammin’ Gold, leading the station to top 3, Adult Women. He is also a seasoned radio personality and was most recently on-air at the Jersey Shore’s heritage station, WJRZ. McKay was also formerly an account executive for Max Media in Norfolk/Virginia Beach, utilizing his programming experience to create effective advertising campaigns for his clients.
Eric McCart, Vice President/Market Manager, Cumulus Media-Wilmington, said: “We searched for a leader who will take 102.7 GNI and 94.5 The Hawk to the next level, and most importantly, someone who will keep the music sounding the best, while creating a great listener experience and a deeper connection with our listeners, advertisers and community. I’m ecstatic to welcome Steve to our family and we’re excited to have him on board.”
Barry Fox, Operations Manager, Cumulus Media-Wilmington, said: “We are thrilled to have someone with Steve’s background join our team and look forward to achieving greatness on WGNI and WKXS under his direction”.
McKay said: “I’ve been watching, with keen interest, the evolution of Cumulus. This is a great company with incredible leadership. I look forward to working with our great team in Wilmington to help take 102.7 GNI and 94.5 The Hawk to new levels of success that bring value and entertainment to our clients and listeners. I thank Mike McVay, John Dimick, Emily Bolden, Eric McCart, and Barry Fox for this exceptional opportunity.”

Crowe Named PD at KNBR; Hammer Shifts To VP of PXP
Posted on July 20, 2017 by SportsRadioPD in Sports Radio News // 0 Comments







Tweet

 Jeremiah Crowe has been given the reigns to set the tone and vision for one of the most successful sports radio stations in the country. After serving as Program Director of KNBR 1050 (KTCT-AM) and as Assistant Program Director of KNBR 680, Cumulus Media have elevated Crowe to program KNBR 680, one of the company’s most powerful and successful sports radio properties.
KNBR has been built on a combination of strong local programming and play by play, and fortunately for Crowe he’ll have an experienced hand available to guide him along. Longtime PD Lee Hammer will remain involved and shift to a new position of Vice President of Sports Play by Play Programming. Hammer will become more involved in navigating the relationships and on-air opportunities with the San Francisco Giants, San Francisco 49ers, and other Bay Area sports partnerships.
VP/Market Manager Justin Wittmayer said, “Jeremiah Crowe and Lee Hammer are the ‘Dream Team’ for outstanding sports radio programming and together, will continue to drive the growth of these powerhouse sports stations. Jeremiah has done a remarkable job leading the re-launch of KNBR 1050 over the past year, while expanding our high-engagement social media platforms for Bay Area sports fans. In this new role as Program Director of both KNBR 680 and KNBR 1050, he will focus his considerable expertise and efforts into growing these stations and the KNBR brand as the Bay Area’s most powerful name in sports programming.”
Wittmayer continued, “As VP/Sports Play-by-Play Programming for Cumulus Media-San Francisco, Lee Hammer is a major asset to our senior leadership team. This appointment reflects our continued investment in KNBR, with an enhanced focus on our play-by-play partners, the Giants and the 49ers, and our commitment to bringing the very best play-by-play programming to Bay Area sports fans.”
Crowe joined KNBR after spending four years at crosstown rival 95.7 The Game. He added, “This is an opportunity to bring a fresh perspective to a strong KNBR brand that means so much to Bay Area sports fans. Our format is at a pivotal point in its evolution, and the KNBR staff is primed to pioneer a landscape where terrestrial radio and digital assets are converging. I want to thank Lee Hammer and Cumulus’ leadership for their support. I couldn’t be more excited to get started in my new role as Program Director.”
Hammer also chimed in by adding, “The relationships we have with our play-by-play partners, the Giants and the 49ers, are key components to the overall success of KNBR. This new role will allow me to devote more time to enhance and expand these key partnerships, resulting in increased value for our listeners and our clients.”

The company has promoted seasoned sports talk radio programmer and producer Jeremiah Crowe (left) to Program Director for both stations, rising from his previous role as Program Director of KNBR 1050 (KTCT) and Assistant Program Director of KNBR 680.

Crowe was previously at ESPN in Bristol, CT, and served as the producer of Mike and Mike in the Morning, The Herd with Colin Cowherd, SportsNation, NFL Countdown to Kickoff, College Gameday, RaceDay, and Fantasy Focus on ESPN Radio. Prior to joining Cumulus last year, he was the Assistant Program Director of KGMZ, 95.7 "The Game" in San Francisco.

He has also produced and engineered Stanford football and San Francisco Giants baseball, and produced Oakland Raiders football and San Francisco 49ers football.

Our format is at a pivotal point in its evolution, and the KNBR staff is primed to pioneer a landscape where terrestrial radio and digital assets are converging. I want to thank Lee Hammer and Cumulus leadership for their support. I couldn't be more excited to get started in my new role as Program Director."

Cumulus Leadership
A proven team focused on building the next generation media company.

 






Executives and Directors
Mary G. BernerPresident and Chief Executive Officer
Mary G. Berner was named President and Chief Executive Officer of Cumulus Media Inc., in October 2015. As the country’s second largest radio company, Cumulus delivers premium content choices to 245 million people each week, through its 447 owned-and-operated stations broadcasting in 90 US media markets (including eight of the top ten), and more than 8,200 broadcast radio stations affiliated with its Westwood One network, as well as numerous digital channels. In 2016, Berner was named one of the 100 most powerful women in entertainment by The Hollywood Reporter, the only radio executive on that list, having, within the first year of her tenure at Cumulus, been selected one of Radio Ink’s 40 Most Powerful People in Radio, and Most Influential Women in Radio.

For over three decades, Berner has led some of the world’s top media companies and brands, building and directing companies to deliver strong value, financial performance and growth.  Throughout her career, she has consistently distinguished herself as an innovative leader, who has broken records, setting new standards for revenue, profitability and launches, and successfully guided a global giant through restructuring. 

Before joining Cumulus, Berner served as President and CEO of MPA—The Association of Magazine Media, where she leveraged her deep understanding of media to aggressively champion and advocate for that industry, among advertisers, to Wall Street, with consumers, and in Washington, DC. Most notably, during her tenure at MPA, Berner created and introduced The Magazine Media 360° Brand Audience Report. A first-ever among all media, this groundbreaking measurement, considers and counts audience across platforms.  Magazine Media 360° affirmed the industry’s vitality and instantly became a game changer, embraced throughout the business and endorsed by advertisers. To wit, Magazine Media 360° took top honors from FIPP, at the worldwide magazine media association’s, “Insight Awards,” for becoming an “industry standard.” It is currently being adopted and implemented globally. In recognition of her work on behalf of the industry, in 2014, Berner was named one of the “Top Women in Media” by Folio magazine.

Berner also previously served as Chief Executive Officer of Reader’s Digest Association, where she developed and executed a successful turnaround strategy, oversaw the restructuring of the company’s acquisition-related debt and the subsequent doubling of the company’s stock price, and optimized its brands and assets, including through the development of new digital revenue streams. Under her direction, the $2 billion global media and direct marketing company launched 83 websites and 31 mobile apps, and built Allrecipes into the world’s largest food website. 

From November 1999 until January 2006, Berner led Fairchild Publications, Inc., first as President and CEO, then as President, and as an Officer of Condé Nast after Fairchild became a division of Condé Nast Publications. During her tenure at Fairchild, she was named Advertising Age’s “Publishing Executive of the Year” (2004) and inducted into the min (Media Industry Newsletter) Sales Executive Hall of Fame (2006). Berner joined Fairchild from Condé Nast’s Glamour where she served as Vice President and Publisher. She began her career selling advertising for a neighborhood newspaper in Boston, before being hired to oversee the advertising and marketing department of TV Guide, eventually rising to Publisher.

Berner serves on the boards of Success Academy Charter Schools in New York City (as the Lead Director), the Fuller Project for International Reporting, the Jesuit Volunteer Corps, and is a member of the advisory board of AAB Research LLC.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 04/29/1994
            

                BBB has determined that Cumulus Media Inc. meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB:

5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Company history[edit]
The Early Years[edit]
The company was started in August 1998 by radio consultant Lewis Dickey Jr. and media and technology entrepreneur Richard Weening. The Telecommunications Act of 1996, among other things removed restrictions on the number of radio stations a single owner could control in a market and overall. Dickey, then a nationally known radio programming consultant, was acting as a consultant to a small radio group in which Weening had a personal investment. Dickey and Weening joined forces around Dickey's idea to acquire and operate radio stations in mid-size markets where giant Clear Channel was not focusing. Dickey was the radio expert and Weening was the corporate finance and start-up CEO. Dickey was President of Stratford Research his radio consulting firm [5] and also president of his family company, Midwestern Broadcasting with two stations in Toledo, Ohio which would later be acquired by Cumulus. Weening had successful experience as a start-up CEO in book and magazine publishing, online services and enterprise software systems. He was then CEO of QUAESTUS & Co., Inc., a private equity firm specializing in media and technology start-ups. A student of classics, Weening came up with the name Cumulus [6] which means "accumulation" in Latin and best described Dickey and Weening's plan to acquire stations in 50 or more markets. QUAESTUS provided the seed capital to make the first station acquisitions as a model for the Cumulus strategy.[7]
The next significant milestone was a $50 million investment from closely watched and highly respected State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) [[[8]]] previously an investor in Weening's magazine publishing company. Full scale operations started on May 22, 1997. Weening assumed the role of Executive Chairman focusing on acquisitions deal structuring, corporate finance and internet from headquarters in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Dickey selected stations to buy and oversaw radio programming, operations and strategy as Executive Vice Chairman. Dickey brought in highly regarded radio operator William Bungeroth to serve as President of Cumulus broadcasting from new offices in Chicago's Hancock Center. Bungeroth had a reputation as an advertising sales leader. He would oversee market level tactical execution including the integration of newly acquired stations into market operating units. John Dickey, Lew's brother and himself an experienced programming consultant would oversee station content.[9][10]
SWIB's investment was soon followed by another $50 million from Wisconsin-based Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company and $25 million from NationsBank Capital Corporation. Financial backing secured, Dickey and Weening set out to acquire radio stations working hard to stay as much "under the radar" as possible not wishing to attract notice or competition. In the first 12 months Cumulus acquired over 100 stations in 31 markets.[7] Almost as soon as the acquisition spree started it was clear the Company would require more than a billion dollars for acquisitions in its sights and plans were laid for a public offering.
The Cumulus strategy as articulated in public filings was to acquire multiple stations in a city or market, consolidate them physically to share a common infrastructure to reduce operating expenses but enrich programming giving each stations a unique music format, live programming, brand and target audience. The central idea was to create a cluster of radio stations that could compete with newspapers by offering advertisers a range of target demographic choices comparable to the range of content sections in print. At the time, newspaper display and classified advertising claimed the largest share of local advertising dollars. By offering a range of audiences like newspapers. Cumulus could gain more share of the local advertising dollar than the individual stations could garner on their own. In addition, acquiring the top performer stations in the market as part of the operating cluster would get more national advertising. The market focus would be those deemed to offer substantial growth opportunities and the station focus was leader station in the market and stations well position for significant growth [11]
A Public Company - Accelerating Acquisition Pace[edit]
Cumulus became a public company on June 26, 1998 raising $400 million selling 7.6 million common shares at $14.00, $125 million in Preferred Stock and $160 million in Senior Subordinated Bonds. At that time Cumulus owned or was committed to buy 176 stations - 124 FM and 52 AM in 34 US markets.[12] In its first 17 months, Cumulus acquired 207 stations, creating the first mid size radio conglomerate.[12] Following the company's IPO, its stock fell from $14 to $8 on October 2, 1998 then began a climb to close 1999 at $50.75 Some radio executives familiar with small markets thought that Cumulus was overpaying to buy top stations in markets that did not have a great upside potential.
For 1998 Cumulus reported revenue of $98.8 million, with broadcast cash flow of $26.6 million. Its cash-flow margin reached 27 percent. For 1999 Cumulus reported $180 million in revenue and $46.7 million broadcast cash flow.
In November 19 the Company sold an additional 10 million shares at $24.93 raising $250 million.[11] Acquisitions continued at an accelerating pace. At this point the Company owned or operated pending closing 246 stations in 45 US markets. In 2 years and 6 months the Company became the 2nd largest US broadcasting group in terms of stations operated. In this period, the Company raised a staggering $1.3 billion considering sales of common and preferred stock shares, senior bank lines of credit and senior subordinated debt or junk bonds which when issued were rated CCC+.
The stock market acknowledged the remarkable growth with a remarkable share price that levitated to a high of $51.00 at December 31, 1999.
Challenges in 2000[edit]
There was no .com in the Cumulus name but it was a part-time participant in the euphoria of the dot-com bubble and impacted by the hysteria that followed its burst. The reasons included very rapid growth and skyrocketing share price which in the euphoria period fed on itself. The hysteria which followed was driven by the absence of earnings and rumours which suggested the rapid growth might be a fiction.
Here is what happened between January 10 and March 31. A perfect storm of events drove the Company's share price from $50 to $13 between January 1 and March 17 when over 30 million shares traded hands. Driving the decline was persistent rumours of possible accounting irregularities in the rapidly assembled radio group. On January 14 respected Wall Street analyst Frank Bodenchak advised institutional clients that Cumulus may miss his estimates for Q4 1999 and the year. A combination of the possible earnings miss and the rumours of accounting problems created a significant loss of investor confidence.
On March 17, Cumulus reported a loss of $0.20 per share vs $0.15 per share expectation.[13] Broadcast cash flow was $12.3 million vs estimates around $17 million. In addition the Company reported that company CFO Rick Bonick had left earlier in January. It was not officially announced a fact that CNN Money says "roiled the already active rumour mill about accounting irregularities. The Company also reported it would restate quarterly revenues in 1999 as some markets did not comply with Cumulus' revenue recognition policies and booked some advertising contracts for their full value rather than recognizing revenue as the ads aired. As a result, class-action lawsuits were filed against Cumulus charging the company with artificially inflating revenue and profit in 1999. PricewaterhouseCoopers, the company's auditors resigned in April citing material weaknesses in the Cumulus' financial controls[14] arising from the possible revenue restatements.
Meanwhile, Dickey had taken over day-to-day station operations from Bungeroth who resigned in mid January.
During this same period Weening got into a dispute with the SEC over his proposal to reverse some of his and Dickey's 1999 compensation to help offset the earnings miss. While the proposal was never implemented, the SEC maintained it would have amounted to earnings management and was therefore an infraction. Weening finally agreed to pay a fine of $75,000 without conceding wrongdoing to settle the matter in 2003.
As the dust began to settle in April 2000 the company issued revised annual 10K reports for 1998 and 1999 that showed minor variations in quarterly revenue and adjusted net loss for 1999 from $20.8 million to $13.6 million and net loss for 1998 was restated from $13.7 million to $8 million, after the company found a $4.9 million tax benefit that had been under-reported. The restatement as it turns out had no material impact on the financials but in the context of the dot-com bust hysteria rumours of accounting irregularities drove a significant decrease in share price which threatened the Company's ability to finance pending acquisitions.

The Internet Debate[edit]
Since November 1998 the Company had been developing an internet platform for classified employment advertising. The new system would operate in tandem with the radio station cluster in each market and offer employers the chance to post available positions on the web and promote their company and the position on the radio stations. At the time of the dot-com bust the system was in beta test in two markets. One of the short-lived but important impacts of the dot-com bubble burst was a loss of confidence that the promise of the internet would ever happen. Many professional radio people like Dickey were skeptical and believed the best course for Cumulus was to focus on the radio strategy and drop the internet projects.[15] Weening who had started a Silicon Valley e-commerce software company in the early 90's had conceived and was overseeing development of the employment platform.[16] Weening advocated for continuance of the project as a key potential source of revenue with a service that would be unique among radio companies. Ultimately, the board backed Dickey not Weening and the Internet project was scrapped.
Changing of the Guard[edit]
According interviews with two former members of the Cumulus board, Lew Dickey and his brother John convinced the board to let them run the Company. Dickey, whose family had just sold an Atlanta station for a reported $250 million, offered to invest in Cumulus if needed to close pending acquisitions. The board was concerned about the restatement of revenues and the shareholder lawsuits. This is consistent with reports in a radio industry newsletter [17] which reported that it was a widely held belief in the Radio industry was that the Dickey brothers orchestrated events that lead to the board's decision not to back the Internet project, placing Dickey at the helm of Cumulus, moving the Cumulus headquarters from Milwaukee to Atlanta and to Weening's ultimate resignation as an employee and director in January 2001.[18][19] According to public filings Weening, QUAESTUS management company and other Weening related interests sold their interests in Cumulus a year later in May 2002 at prices ranging from $17 to $21.50 per share not The $55 high but considerably higher than share prices after their sale.
The new CEO of Cumulus Media, as of September 2015 is Mary Berner.
In April 2016, Talk Radio Network filed a lawsuit against Cumulus Media and associated defendants, alleging "antitrust violations, unfair competition, breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty, among other claims", similar to a lawsuit launched in 2012 and dropped in 2014 by the same plaintiff.[20] In June 2016, Cumulus Media and Westwood One moved to have the new suit dismissed.[20]
In June 2016, Cumulus Media announced the resignation of its Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer, Joseph P. Hannan, to "pursue other interests" after six years with the company, to be replaced by John F. Abbot.[21]
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer[edit]
Lew Dickey took full charge. By May 2002 the share price recovered to above the IPO price to a short-lived high of $22 on May 31, 2002. Dickey garnered some strong partners in the form of Bain Capital and Crestview partners who helped finance a series of ambitious acquisitions and partnerships which were creative, made Cumulus a significantly larger company but these acquisitions and Cumulus itself have struggled in the face of slow to no radio ad growth. (another researcher is working on this section)
In 2006, Cumulus acquired control of Susquehanna Radio, with the backing of 3 venture capital firms (Bain Capital Partners LLC, The Blackstone Group and Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P.) for a price of $1.2 Billion. The 33 Susquehanna stations were privately held in a separate partnership called Cumulus Media Partners, LLC (commonly referred to as CMP on the company's quarterly earnings calls) that was the subject of an equity-for-debt swap in May 2009 in an attempt to avoid defaulting on the terms of the CMP lending agreement. While Cumulus operated the CMP stations, they initially held only a minor ownership interest in them.[22] On January 31, 2011, Cumulus announced a deal to acquire the remaining ownership of CMP from its equity partners in a stock transaction valued at approximately $740 million that is closed in August 2011.[23] As a result of the CMP acquisition, Cumulus now owns a limited-partnership interest in San Francisco Baseball Associates LP, the owner of the San Francisco Giants baseball club.[24]
In July 2010, Cumulus publicly announced formation of a similar venture with Crestview Partners to acquire up to $1 billion of additional radio assets.[25]
In July 2007, the company announced its intention to "go private",[26] however on May 11, 2008, the company announced it was unable to come to terms with the parties involved and the merger/acquisition agreement was terminated.[27]
Like most major American radio station owners, Cumulus has been forced to write down the value of its radio station licenses, resulting in large non-cash losses - $498.9 million in 2008, $230.6 million in 2007, and $63.4 million in 2006.
The company's stock, priced over $56 in 1999,[28] then over $22 in 2004, was as low as $0.45 per share toward the end of 2008.[29][30]
Acquisition of Citadel Broadcasting and Dial Global[edit]
Starting in June 2010, Cumulus made multiple unsuccessful offers to buy out Citadel Broadcasting after its emergence from bankruptcy.[31] In February 2011, Cumulus was again said to be in "exclusive negotiations" to acquire Citadel for $2.5 billion paid to Citadel shareholders, according to CNBC. Some Citadel shareholders were said to have been pushing the board to consider a sale.[32] On March 10, 2011, Citadel Broadcasting stations announced via email that Cumulus had purchased Citadel Broadcasting. Citadel was made up of 225 radio stations in over 50 markets, as well as Citadel Media, one of the largest radio networks in the United States. The deal was finalized on September 16, 2011, after acceptance by the FCC and Citadel's shareholders.[33] As part of the deal, Cumulus Media will have to place 14 stations into a separate trust to comply with ownership limits.[34] Following the acquisition, in an effort to focus on larger markets, Cumulus reached a deal with Townsquare Media to swap 65 radio stations in 13 markets, with the majority of the 65 stations being sold to Townsquare.[35]
On August 29, 2013, it was reported by The Wall Street Journal that Cumulus would purchase the syndicator Dial Global for $260 million. To fund the sale, Cumulus, sold 53 more stations to Townsquare Media for $238 million, in markets such as Danbury, CT, Rockford, IL, Cedar Rapids, IA, Quad Cities IA/IL, Waterloo, IA, Portland, ME, Battle Creek, MI, Kalamazoo, MI, Lansing, MI, Faribault, MN, Rochester, MN, and Portsmouth, NH. Additionally, Townsquare Media acquired Peak Broadcasting, and Cumulus swapped 15 more stations in Dubuque, IA and Poughkeepsie, NY in exchange for Peak Broadcasting’s Fresno cluster.[36][37] The sale to Cumulus was completed on November 14, 2013.[38]
Launch of Nash, CNN partnership, and Rdio/iHeartRadio partnerships[edit]
On January 11, 2013, after acquiring the station from Family Radio, Cumulus re-launched WFME in New York City as a country music station under its new Nash FM brand. Nash was designed to serve as an umbrella brand for all country music-related content across the company's properties, including radio, digital, and live events such as the "Nash Bash". All country stations owned by Cumulus would either be branded as Nash FM, or be strongly cross-promoted as part of the Nash family of properties.[39][40]
In July 2014, Cumulus announced that it would end its partnership with ABC News Radio, and enter into a new partnership with CNN to syndicate news content for its stations through Westwood One beginning in 2015. The network will provide its content on a white label basis, allowing individual stations to use their own brands for the content. In turn, ABC announced that it would take the syndication of its radio content in-house, with distribution handled by Skyview Networks.[41][42]
On September 15, 2013, Cumulus announced that it had entered into a partnership with music streaming service Rdio; Cumulus took a stake in Rdio, and provided the company with access to its advertising sales team for a freemium tier, the ability to offer Cumulus radio stations on the Rdio service, and $75 million in marketing on Cumulus stations over five years. The stations launched on Rdio in August 2015; prior to the deal, Cumulus partnered with the competing iHeartRadio service.[43][44] This only lasted a few months however, as Rdio entered bankruptcy in November 2015 and sold most of their assets to Pandora, with Rdio ending operations the next month. Cumulus maintains their stations on iHeartRadio to the present day.
FCC actions[edit]
On December 30, 2008, Cumulus Media was issued a $14,000 Notice of Apparent Liability by the Federal Communications Commission related to the stations in the Macon, Georgia, cluster. The FCC says Cumulus failed to comply with its record-keeping requirements and its Equal Employment Opportunity rules on information on recruitment sources. Cumulus, along with two other companies, had 30 days to pay or file a statement asking for reduction or cancellation of the forfeitures.[45]
Restatement[edit]
On March 17, 2000, the company was forced to restate revenue and broadcast cash flow for three quarters of 1999 after discovering that some of its sales force had prematurely booked revenue to meet sales goals.[46] On November 8, 2005, Company decided to amend and restate its results for the second quarter of 2005.[47]

Company history[edit]
The Early Years[edit]
The company was started in August 1998 by radio consultant Lewis Dickey Jr. and media and technology entrepreneur Richard Weening. The Telecommunications Act of 1996, among other things removed restrictions on the number of radio stations a single owner could control in a market and overall. Dickey, then a nationally known radio programming consultant, was acting as a consultant to a small radio group in which Weening had a personal investment. Dickey and Weening joined forces around Dickey's idea to acquire and operate radio stations in mid-size markets where giant Clear Channel was not focusing. Dickey was the radio expert and Weening was the corporate finance and start-up CEO. Dickey was President of Stratford Research his radio consulting firm [5] and also president of his family company, Midwestern Broadcasting with two stations in Toledo, Ohio which would later be acquired by Cumulus. Weening had successful experience as a start-up CEO in book and magazine publishing, online services and enterprise software systems. He was then CEO of QUAESTUS & Co., Inc., a private equity firm specializing in media and technology start-ups. A student of classics, Weening came up with the name Cumulus [6] which means "accumulation" in Latin and best described Dickey and Weening's plan to acquire stations in 50 or more markets. QUAESTUS provided the seed capital to make the first station acquisitions as a model for the Cumulus strategy.[7]
The next significant milestone was a $50 million investment from closely watched and highly respected State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) [[[8]]] previously an investor in Weening's magazine publishing company. Full scale operations started on May 22, 1997. Weening assumed the role of Executive Chairman focusing on acquisitions deal structuring, corporate finance and internet from headquarters in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Dickey selected stations to buy and oversaw radio programming, operations and strategy as Executive Vice Chairman. Dickey brought in highly regarded radio operator William Bungeroth to serve as President of Cumulus broadcasting from new offices in Chicago's Hancock Center. Bungeroth had a reputation as an advertising sales leader. He would oversee market level tactical execution including the integration of newly acquired stations into market operating units. John Dickey, Lew's brother and himself an experienced programming consultant would oversee station content.[9][10]
SWIB's investment was soon followed by another $50 million from Wisconsin-based Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company and $25 million from NationsBank Capital Corporation. Financial backing secured, Dickey and Weening set out to acquire radio stations working hard to stay as much "under the radar" as possible not wishing to attract notice or competition. In the first 12 months Cumulus acquired over 100 stations in 31 markets.[7] Almost as soon as the acquisition spree started it was clear the Company would require more than a billion dollars for acquisitions in its sights and plans were laid for a public offering.
The Cumulus strategy as articulated in public filings was to acquire multiple stations in a city or market, consolidate them physically to share a common infrastructure to reduce operating expenses but enrich programming giving each stations a unique music format, live programming, brand and target audience. The central idea was to create a cluster of radio stations that could compete with newspapers by offering advertisers a range of target demographic choices comparable to the range of content sections in print. At the time, newspaper display and classified advertising claimed the largest share of local advertising dollars. By offering a range of audiences like newspapers. Cumulus could gain more share of the local advertising dollar than the individual stations could garner on their own. In addition, acquiring the top performer stations in the market as part of the operating cluster would get more national advertising. The market focus would be those deemed to offer substantial growth opportunities and the station focus was leader station in the market and stations well position for significant growth [11]
A Public Company - Accelerating Acquisition Pace[edit]
Cumulus became a public company on June 26, 1998 raising $400 million selling 7.6 million common shares at $14.00, $125 million in Preferred Stock and $160 million in Senior Subordinated Bonds. At that time Cumulus owned or was committed to buy 176 stations - 124 FM and 52 AM in 34 US markets.[12] In its first 17 months, Cumulus acquired 207 stations, creating the first mid size radio conglomerate.[12] Following the company's IPO, its stock fell from $14 to $8 on October 2, 1998 then began a climb to close 1999 at $50.75 Some radio executives familiar with small markets thought that Cumulus was overpaying to buy top stations in markets that did not have a great upside potential.
For 1998 Cumulus reported revenue of $98.8 million, with broadcast cash flow of $26.6 million. Its cash-flow margin reached 27 percent. For 1999 Cumulus reported $180 million in revenue and $46.7 million broadcast cash flow.
In November 19 the Company sold an additional 10 million shares at $24.93 raising $250 million.[11] Acquisitions continued at an accelerating pace. At this point the Company owned or operated pending closing 246 stations in 45 US markets. In 2 years and 6 months the Company became the 2nd largest US broadcasting group in terms of stations operated. In this period, the Company raised a staggering $1.3 billion considering sales of common and preferred stock shares, senior bank lines of credit and senior subordinated debt or junk bonds which when issued were rated CCC+.
The stock market acknowledged the remarkable growth with a remarkable share price that levitated to a high of $51.00 at December 31, 1999.
Challenges in 2000[edit]
There was no .com in the Cumulus name but it was a part-time participant in the euphoria of the dot-com bubble and impacted by the hysteria that followed its burst. The reasons included very rapid growth and skyrocketing share price which in the euphoria period fed on itself. The hysteria which followed was driven by the absence of earnings and rumours which suggested the rapid growth might be a fiction.
Here is what happened between January 10 and March 31. A perfect storm of events drove the Company's share price from $50 to $13 between January 1 and March 17 when over 30 million shares traded hands. Driving the decline was persistent rumours of possible accounting irregularities in the rapidly assembled radio group. On January 14 respected Wall Street analyst Frank Bodenchak advised institutional clients that Cumulus may miss his estimates for Q4 1999 and the year. A combination of the possible earnings miss and the rumours of accounting problems created a significant loss of investor confidence.
On March 17, Cumulus reported a loss of $0.20 per share vs $0.15 per share expectation.[13] Broadcast cash flow was $12.3 million vs estimates around $17 million. In addition the Company reported that company CFO Rick Bonick had left earlier in January. It was not officially announced a fact that CNN Money says "roiled the already active rumour mill about accounting irregularities. The Company also reported it would restate quarterly revenues in 1999 as some markets did not comply with Cumulus' revenue recognition policies and booked some advertising contracts for their full value rather than recognizing revenue as the ads aired. As a result, class-action lawsuits were filed against Cumulus charging the company with artificially inflating revenue and profit in 1999. PricewaterhouseCoopers, the company's auditors resigned in April citing material weaknesses in the Cumulus' financial controls[14] arising from the possible revenue restatements.
Meanwhile, Dickey had taken over day-to-day station operations from Bungeroth who resigned in mid January.
During this same period Weening got into a dispute with the SEC over his proposal to reverse some of his and Dickey's 1999 compensation to help offset the earnings miss. While the proposal was never implemented, the SEC maintained it would have amounted to earnings management and was therefore an infraction. Weening finally agreed to pay a fine of $75,000 without conceding wrongdoing to settle the matter in 2003.
As the dust began to settle in April 2000 the company issued revised annual 10K reports for 1998 and 1999 that showed minor variations in quarterly revenue and adjusted net loss for 1999 from $20.8 million to $13.6 million and net loss for 1998 was restated from $13.7 million to $8 million, after the company found a $4.9 million tax benefit that had been under-reported. The restatement as it turns out had no material impact on the financials but in the context of the dot-com bust hysteria rumours of accounting irregularities drove a significant decrease in share price which threatened the Company's ability to finance pending acquisitions.

The Internet Debate[edit]
Since November 1998 the Company had been developing an internet platform for classified employment advertising. The new system would operate in tandem with the radio station cluster in each market and offer employers the chance to post available positions on the web and promote their company and the position on the radio stations. At the time of the dot-com bust the system was in beta test in two markets. One of the short-lived but important impacts of the dot-com bubble burst was a loss of confidence that the promise of the internet would ever happen. Many professional radio people like Dickey were skeptical and believed the best course for Cumulus was to focus on the radio strategy and drop the internet projects.[15] Weening who had started a Silicon Valley e-commerce software company in the early 90's had conceived and was overseeing development of the employment platform.[16] Weening advocated for continuance of the project as a key potential source of revenue with a service that would be unique among radio companies. Ultimately, the board backed Dickey not Weening and the Internet project was scrapped.
Changing of the Guard[edit]
According interviews with two former members of the Cumulus board, Lew Dickey and his brother John convinced the board to let them run the Company. Dickey, whose family had just sold an Atlanta station for a reported $250 million, offered to invest in Cumulus if needed to close pending acquisitions. The board was concerned about the restatement of revenues and the shareholder lawsuits. This is consistent with reports in a radio industry newsletter [17] which reported that it was a widely held belief in the Radio industry was that the Dickey brothers orchestrated events that lead to the board's decision not to back the Internet project, placing Dickey at the helm of Cumulus, moving the Cumulus headquarters from Milwaukee to Atlanta and to Weening's ultimate resignation as an employee and director in January 2001.[18][19] According to public filings Weening, QUAESTUS management company and other Weening related interests sold their interests in Cumulus a year later in May 2002 at prices ranging from $17 to $21.50 per share not The $55 high but considerably higher than share prices after their sale.
The new CEO of Cumulus Media, as of September 2015 is Mary Berner.
In April 2016, Talk Radio Network filed a lawsuit against Cumulus Media and associated defendants, alleging "antitrust violations, unfair competition, breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty, among other claims", similar to a lawsuit launched in 2012 and dropped in 2014 by the same plaintiff.[20] In June 2016, Cumulus Media and Westwood One moved to have the new suit dismissed.[20]
In June 2016, Cumulus Media announced the resignation of its Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer, Joseph P. Hannan, to "pursue other interests" after six years with the company, to be replaced by John F. Abbot.[21]
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer[edit]
Lew Dickey took full charge. By May 2002 the share price recovered to above the IPO price to a short-lived high of $22 on May 31, 2002. Dickey garnered some strong partners in the form of Bain Capital and Crestview partners who helped finance a series of ambitious acquisitions and partnerships which were creative, made Cumulus a significantly larger company but these acquisitions and Cumulus itself have struggled in the face of slow to no radio ad growth. (another researcher is working on this section)
In 2006, Cumulus acquired control of Susquehanna Radio, with the backing of 3 venture capital firms (Bain Capital Partners LLC, The Blackstone Group and Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P.) for a price of $1.2 Billion. The 33 Susquehanna stations were privately held in a separate partnership called Cumulus Media Partners, LLC (commonly referred to as CMP on the company's quarterly earnings calls) that was the subject of an equity-for-debt swap in May 2009 in an attempt to avoid defaulting on the terms of the CMP lending agreement. While Cumulus operated the CMP stations, they initially held only a minor ownership interest in them.[22] On January 31, 2011, Cumulus announced a deal to acquire the remaining ownership of CMP from its equity partners in a stock transaction valued at approximately $740 million that is closed in August 2011.[23] As a result of the CMP acquisition, Cumulus now owns a limited-partnership interest in San Francisco Baseball Associates LP, the owner of the San Francisco Giants baseball club.[24]
In July 2010, Cumulus publicly announced formation of a similar venture with Crestview Partners to acquire up to $1 billion of additional radio assets.[25]
In July 2007, the company announced its intention to "go private",[26] however on May 11, 2008, the company announced it was unable to come to terms with the parties involved and the merger/acquisition agreement was terminated.[27]
Like most major American radio station owners, Cumulus has been forced to write down the value of its radio station licenses, resulting in large non-cash losses - $498.9 million in 2008, $230.6 million in 2007, and $63.4 million in 2006.
The company's stock, priced over $56 in 1999,[28] then over $22 in 2004, was as low as $0.45 per share toward the end of 2008.[29][30]
Acquisition of Citadel Broadcasting and Dial Global[edit]
Starting in June 2010, Cumulus made multiple unsuccessful offers to buy out Citadel Broadcasting after its emergence from bankruptcy.[31] In February 2011, Cumulus was again said to be in "exclusive negotiations" to acquire Citadel for $2.5 billion paid to Citadel shareholders, according to CNBC. Some Citadel shareholders were said to have been pushing the board to consider a sale.[32] On March 10, 2011, Citadel Broadcasting stations announced via email that Cumulus had purchased Citadel Broadcasting. Citadel was made up of 225 radio stations in over 50 markets, as well as Citadel Media, one of the largest radio networks in the United States. The deal was finalized on September 16, 2011, after acceptance by the FCC and Citadel's shareholders.[33] As part of the deal, Cumulus Media will have to place 14 stations into a separate trust to comply with ownership limits.[34] Following the acquisition, in an effort to focus on larger markets, Cumulus reached a deal with Townsquare Media to swap 65 radio stations in 13 markets, with the majority of the 65 stations being sold to Townsquare.[35]
On August 29, 2013, it was reported by The Wall Street Journal that Cumulus would purchase the syndicator Dial Global for $260 million. To fund the sale, Cumulus, sold 53 more stations to Townsquare Media for $238 million, in markets such as Danbury, CT, Rockford, IL, Cedar Rapids, IA, Quad Cities IA/IL, Waterloo, IA, Portland, ME, Battle Creek, MI, Kalamazoo, MI, Lansing, MI, Faribault, MN, Rochester, MN, and Portsmouth, NH. Additionally, Townsquare Media acquired Peak Broadcasting, and Cumulus swapped 15 more stations in Dubuque, IA and Poughkeepsie, NY in exchange for Peak Broadcasting’s Fresno cluster.[36][37] The sale to Cumulus was completed on November 14, 2013.[38]
Launch of Nash, CNN partnership, and Rdio/iHeartRadio partnerships[edit]
On January 11, 2013, after acquiring the station from Family Radio, Cumulus re-launched WFME in New York City as a country music station under its new Nash FM brand. Nash was designed to serve as an umbrella brand for all country music-related content across the company's properties, including radio, digital, and live events such as the "Nash Bash". All country stations owned by Cumulus would either be branded as Nash FM, or be strongly cross-promoted as part of the Nash family of properties.[39][40]
In July 2014, Cumulus announced that it would end its partnership with ABC News Radio, and enter into a new partnership with CNN to syndicate news content for its stations through Westwood One beginning in 2015. The network will provide its content on a white label basis, allowing individual stations to use their own brands for the content. In turn, ABC announced that it would take the syndication of its radio content in-house, with distribution handled by Skyview Networks.[41][42]
On September 15, 2013, Cumulus announced that it had entered into a partnership with music streaming service Rdio; Cumulus took a stake in Rdio, and provided the company with access to its advertising sales team for a freemium tier, the ability to offer Cumulus radio stations on the Rdio service, and $75 million in marketing on Cumulus stations over five years. The stations launched on Rdio in August 2015; prior to the deal, Cumulus partnered with the competing iHeartRadio service.[43][44] This only lasted a few months however, as Rdio entered bankruptcy in November 2015 and sold most of their assets to Pandora, with Rdio ending operations the next month. Cumulus maintains their stations on iHeartRadio to the present day.
FCC actions[edit]
On December 30, 2008, Cumulus Media was issued a $14,000 Notice of Apparent Liability by the Federal Communications Commission related to the stations in the Macon, Georgia, cluster. The FCC says Cumulus failed to comply with its record-keeping requirements and its Equal Employment Opportunity rules on information on recruitment sources. Cumulus, along with two other companies, had 30 days to pay or file a statement asking for reduction or cancellation of the forfeitures.[45]
Restatement[edit]
On March 17, 2000, the company was forced to restate revenue and broadcast cash flow for three quarters of 1999 after discovering that some of its sales force had prematurely booked revenue to meet sales goals.[46] On November 8, 2005, Company decided to amend and restate its results for the second quarter of 2005.[47]

Company history[edit]
The Early Years[edit]
The company was started in August 1998 by radio consultant Lewis Dickey Jr. and media and technology entrepreneur Richard Weening. The Telecommunications Act of 1996, among other things removed restrictions on the number of radio stations a single owner could control in a market and overall. Dickey, then a nationally known radio programming consultant, was acting as a consultant to a small radio group in which Weening had a personal investment. Dickey and Weening joined forces around Dickey's idea to acquire and operate radio stations in mid-size markets where giant Clear Channel was not focusing. Dickey was the radio expert and Weening was the corporate finance and start-up CEO. Dickey was President of Stratford Research his radio consulting firm [5] and also president of his family company, Midwestern Broadcasting with two stations in Toledo, Ohio which would later be acquired by Cumulus. Weening had successful experience as a start-up CEO in book and magazine publishing, online services and enterprise software systems. He was then CEO of QUAESTUS & Co., Inc., a private equity firm specializing in media and technology start-ups. A student of classics, Weening came up with the name Cumulus [6] which means "accumulation" in Latin and best described Dickey and Weening's plan to acquire stations in 50 or more markets. QUAESTUS provided the seed capital to make the first station acquisitions as a model for the Cumulus strategy.[7]
The next significant milestone was a $50 million investment from closely watched and highly respected State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) [[[8]]] previously an investor in Weening's magazine publishing company. Full scale operations started on May 22, 1997. Weening assumed the role of Executive Chairman focusing on acquisitions deal structuring, corporate finance and internet from headquarters in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Dickey selected stations to buy and oversaw radio programming, operations and strategy as Executive Vice Chairman. Dickey brought in highly regarded radio operator William Bungeroth to serve as President of Cumulus broadcasting from new offices in Chicago's Hancock Center. Bungeroth had a reputation as an advertising sales leader. He would oversee market level tactical execution including the integration of newly acquired stations into market operating units. John Dickey, Lew's brother and himself an experienced programming consultant would oversee station content.[9][10]
SWIB's investment was soon followed by another $50 million from Wisconsin-based Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company and $25 million from NationsBank Capital Corporation. Financial backing secured, Dickey and Weening set out to acquire radio stations working hard to stay as much "under the radar" as possible not wishing to attract notice or competition. In the first 12 months Cumulus acquired over 100 stations in 31 markets.[7] Almost as soon as the acquisition spree started it was clear the Company would require more than a billion dollars for acquisitions in its sights and plans were laid for a public offering.
The Cumulus strategy as articulated in public filings was to acquire multiple stations in a city or market, consolidate them physically to share a common infrastructure to reduce operating expenses but enrich programming giving each stations a unique music format, live programming, brand and target audience. The central idea was to create a cluster of radio stations that could compete with newspapers by offering advertisers a range of target demographic choices comparable to the range of content sections in print. At the time, newspaper display and classified advertising claimed the largest share of local advertising dollars. By offering a range of audiences like newspapers. Cumulus could gain more share of the local advertising dollar than the individual stations could garner on their own. In addition, acquiring the top performer stations in the market as part of the operating cluster would get more national advertising. The market focus would be those deemed to offer substantial growth opportunities and the station focus was leader station in the market and stations well position for significant growth [11]
A Public Company - Accelerating Acquisition Pace[edit]
Cumulus became a public company on June 26, 1998 raising $400 million selling 7.6 million common shares at $14.00, $125 million in Preferred Stock and $160 million in Senior Subordinated Bonds. At that time Cumulus owned or was committed to buy 176 stations - 124 FM and 52 AM in 34 US markets.[12] In its first 17 months, Cumulus acquired 207 stations, creating the first mid size radio conglomerate.[12] Following the company's IPO, its stock fell from $14 to $8 on October 2, 1998 then began a climb to close 1999 at $50.75 Some radio executives familiar with small markets thought that Cumulus was overpaying to buy top stations in markets that did not have a great upside potential.
For 1998 Cumulus reported revenue of $98.8 million, with broadcast cash flow of $26.6 million. Its cash-flow margin reached 27 percent. For 1999 Cumulus reported $180 million in revenue and $46.7 million broadcast cash flow.
In November 19 the Company sold an additional 10 million shares at $24.93 raising $250 million.[11] Acquisitions continued at an accelerating pace. At this point the Company owned or operated pending closing 246 stations in 45 US markets. In 2 years and 6 months the Company became the 2nd largest US broadcasting group in terms of stations operated. In this period, the Company raised a staggering $1.3 billion considering sales of common and preferred stock shares, senior bank lines of credit and senior subordinated debt or junk bonds which when issued were rated CCC+.
The stock market acknowledged the remarkable growth with a remarkable share price that levitated to a high of $51.00 at December 31, 1999.
Challenges in 2000[edit]
There was no .com in the Cumulus name but it was a part-time participant in the euphoria of the dot-com bubble and impacted by the hysteria that followed its burst. The reasons included very rapid growth and skyrocketing share price which in the euphoria period fed on itself. The hysteria which followed was driven by the absence of earnings and rumours which suggested the rapid growth might be a fiction.
Here is what happened between January 10 and March 31. A perfect storm of events drove the Company's share price from $50 to $13 between January 1 and March 17 when over 30 million shares traded hands. Driving the decline was persistent rumours of possible accounting irregularities in the rapidly assembled radio group. On January 14 respected Wall Street analyst Frank Bodenchak advised institutional clients that Cumulus may miss his estimates for Q4 1999 and the year. A combination of the possible earnings miss and the rumours of accounting problems created a significant loss of investor confidence.
On March 17, Cumulus reported a loss of $0.20 per share vs $0.15 per share expectation.[13] Broadcast cash flow was $12.3 million vs estimates around $17 million. In addition the Company reported that company CFO Rick Bonick had left earlier in January. It was not officially announced a fact that CNN Money says "roiled the already active rumour mill about accounting irregularities. The Company also reported it would restate quarterly revenues in 1999 as some markets did not comply with Cumulus' revenue recognition policies and booked some advertising contracts for their full value rather than recognizing revenue as the ads aired. As a result, class-action lawsuits were filed against Cumulus charging the company with artificially inflating revenue and profit in 1999. PricewaterhouseCoopers, the company's auditors resigned in April citing material weaknesses in the Cumulus' financial controls[14] arising from the possible revenue restatements.
Meanwhile, Dickey had taken over day-to-day station operations from Bungeroth who resigned in mid January.
During this same period Weening got into a dispute with the SEC over his proposal to reverse some of his and Dickey's 1999 compensation to help offset the earnings miss. While the proposal was never implemented, the SEC maintained it would have amounted to earnings management and was therefore an infraction. Weening finally agreed to pay a fine of $75,000 without conceding wrongdoing to settle the matter in 2003.
As the dust began to settle in April 2000 the company issued revised annual 10K reports for 1998 and 1999 that showed minor variations in quarterly revenue and adjusted net loss for 1999 from $20.8 million to $13.6 million and net loss for 1998 was restated from $13.7 million to $8 million, after the company found a $4.9 million tax benefit that had been under-reported. The restatement as it turns out had no material impact on the financials but in the context of the dot-com bust hysteria rumours of accounting irregularities drove a significant decrease in share price which threatened the Company's ability to finance pending acquisitions.

The Internet Debate[edit]
Since November 1998 the Company had been developing an internet platform for classified employment advertising. The new system would operate in tandem with the radio station cluster in each market and offer employers the chance to post available positions on the web and promote their company and the position on the radio stations. At the time of the dot-com bust the system was in beta test in two markets. One of the short-lived but important impacts of the dot-com bubble burst was a loss of confidence that the promise of the internet would ever happen. Many professional radio people like Dickey were skeptical and believed the best course for Cumulus was to focus on the radio strategy and drop the internet projects.[15] Weening who had started a Silicon Valley e-commerce software company in the early 90's had conceived and was overseeing development of the employment platform.[16] Weening advocated for continuance of the project as a key potential source of revenue with a service that would be unique among radio companies. Ultimately, the board backed Dickey not Weening and the Internet project was scrapped.
Changing of the Guard[edit]
According interviews with two former members of the Cumulus board, Lew Dickey and his brother John convinced the board to let them run the Company. Dickey, whose family had just sold an Atlanta station for a reported $250 million, offered to invest in Cumulus if needed to close pending acquisitions. The board was concerned about the restatement of revenues and the shareholder lawsuits. This is consistent with reports in a radio industry newsletter [17] which reported that it was a widely held belief in the Radio industry was that the Dickey brothers orchestrated events that lead to the board's decision not to back the Internet project, placing Dickey at the helm of Cumulus, moving the Cumulus headquarters from Milwaukee to Atlanta and to Weening's ultimate resignation as an employee and director in January 2001.[18][19] According to public filings Weening, QUAESTUS management company and other Weening related interests sold their interests in Cumulus a year later in May 2002 at prices ranging from $17 to $21.50 per share not The $55 high but considerably higher than share prices after their sale.
The new CEO of Cumulus Media, as of September 2015 is Mary Berner.
In April 2016, Talk Radio Network filed a lawsuit against Cumulus Media and associated defendants, alleging "antitrust violations, unfair competition, breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty, among other claims", similar to a lawsuit launched in 2012 and dropped in 2014 by the same plaintiff.[20] In June 2016, Cumulus Media and Westwood One moved to have the new suit dismissed.[20]
In June 2016, Cumulus Media announced the resignation of its Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer, Joseph P. Hannan, to "pursue other interests" after six years with the company, to be replaced by John F. Abbot.[21]
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer[edit]
Lew Dickey took full charge. By May 2002 the share price recovered to above the IPO price to a short-lived high of $22 on May 31, 2002. Dickey garnered some strong partners in the form of Bain Capital and Crestview partners who helped finance a series of ambitious acquisitions and partnerships which were creative, made Cumulus a significantly larger company but these acquisitions and Cumulus itself have struggled in the face of slow to no radio ad growth. (another researcher is working on this section)
In 2006, Cumulus acquired control of Susquehanna Radio, with the backing of 3 venture capital firms (Bain Capital Partners LLC, The Blackstone Group and Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P.) for a price of $1.2 Billion. The 33 Susquehanna stations were privately held in a separate partnership called Cumulus Media Partners, LLC (commonly referred to as CMP on the company's quarterly earnings calls) that was the subject of an equity-for-debt swap in May 2009 in an attempt to avoid defaulting on the terms of the CMP lending agreement. While Cumulus operated the CMP stations, they initially held only a minor ownership interest in them.[22] On January 31, 2011, Cumulus announced a deal to acquire the remaining ownership of CMP from its equity partners in a stock transaction valued at approximately $740 million that is closed in August 2011.[23] As a result of the CMP acquisition, Cumulus now owns a limited-partnership interest in San Francisco Baseball Associates LP, the owner of the San Francisco Giants baseball club.[24]
In July 2010, Cumulus publicly announced formation of a similar venture with Crestview Partners to acquire up to $1 billion of additional radio assets.[25]
In July 2007, the company announced its intention to "go private",[26] however on May 11, 2008, the company announced it was unable to come to terms with the parties involved and the merger/acquisition agreement was terminated.[27]
Like most major American radio station owners, Cumulus has been forced to write down the value of its radio station licenses, resulting in large non-cash losses - $498.9 million in 2008, $230.6 million in 2007, and $63.4 million in 2006.
The company's stock, priced over $56 in 1999,[28] then over $22 in 2004, was as low as $0.45 per share toward the end of 2008.[29][30]
Acquisition of Citadel Broadcasting and Dial Global[edit]
Starting in June 2010, Cumulus made multiple unsuccessful offers to buy out Citadel Broadcasting after its emergence from bankruptcy.[31] In February 2011, Cumulus was again said to be in "exclusive negotiations" to acquire Citadel for $2.5 billion paid to Citadel shareholders, according to CNBC. Some Citadel shareholders were said to have been pushing the board to consider a sale.[32] On March 10, 2011, Citadel Broadcasting stations announced via email that Cumulus had purchased Citadel Broadcasting. Citadel was made up of 225 radio stations in over 50 markets, as well as Citadel Media, one of the largest radio networks in the United States. The deal was finalized on September 16, 2011, after acceptance by the FCC and Citadel's shareholders.[33] As part of the deal, Cumulus Media will have to place 14 stations into a separate trust to comply with ownership limits.[34] Following the acquisition, in an effort to focus on larger markets, Cumulus reached a deal with Townsquare Media to swap 65 radio stations in 13 markets, with the majority of the 65 stations being sold to Townsquare.[35]
On August 29, 2013, it was reported by The Wall Street Journal that Cumulus would purchase the syndicator Dial Global for $260 million. To fund the sale, Cumulus, sold 53 more stations to Townsquare Media for $238 million, in markets such as Danbury, CT, Rockford, IL, Cedar Rapids, IA, Quad Cities IA/IL, Waterloo, IA, Portland, ME, Battle Creek, MI, Kalamazoo, MI, Lansing, MI, Faribault, MN, Rochester, MN, and Portsmouth, NH. Additionally, Townsquare Media acquired Peak Broadcasting, and Cumulus swapped 15 more stations in Dubuque, IA and Poughkeepsie, NY in exchange for Peak Broadcasting’s Fresno cluster.[36][37] The sale to Cumulus was completed on November 14, 2013.[38]
Launch of Nash, CNN partnership, and Rdio/iHeartRadio partnerships[edit]
On January 11, 2013, after acquiring the station from Family Radio, Cumulus re-launched WFME in New York City as a country music station under its new Nash FM brand. Nash was designed to serve as an umbrella brand for all country music-related content across the company's properties, including radio, digital, and live events such as the "Nash Bash". All country stations owned by Cumulus would either be branded as Nash FM, or be strongly cross-promoted as part of the Nash family of properties.[39][40]
In July 2014, Cumulus announced that it would end its partnership with ABC News Radio, and enter into a new partnership with CNN to syndicate news content for its stations through Westwood One beginning in 2015. The network will provide its content on a white label basis, allowing individual stations to use their own brands for the content. In turn, ABC announced that it would take the syndication of its radio content in-house, with distribution handled by Skyview Networks.[41][42]
On September 15, 2013, Cumulus announced that it had entered into a partnership with music streaming service Rdio; Cumulus took a stake in Rdio, and provided the company with access to its advertising sales team for a freemium tier, the ability to offer Cumulus radio stations on the Rdio service, and $75 million in marketing on Cumulus stations over five years. The stations launched on Rdio in August 2015; prior to the deal, Cumulus partnered with the competing iHeartRadio service.[43][44] This only lasted a few months however, as Rdio entered bankruptcy in November 2015 and sold most of their assets to Pandora, with Rdio ending operations the next month. Cumulus maintains their stations on iHeartRadio to the present day.
FCC actions[edit]
On December 30, 2008, Cumulus Media was issued a $14,000 Notice of Apparent Liability by the Federal Communications Commission related to the stations in the Macon, Georgia, cluster. The FCC says Cumulus failed to comply with its record-keeping requirements and its Equal Employment Opportunity rules on information on recruitment sources. Cumulus, along with two other companies, had 30 days to pay or file a statement asking for reduction or cancellation of the forfeitures.[45]
Restatement[edit]
On March 17, 2000, the company was forced to restate revenue and broadcast cash flow for three quarters of 1999 after discovering that some of its sales force had prematurely booked revenue to meet sales goals.[46] On November 8, 2005, Company decided to amend and restate its results for the second quarter of 2005.[47]

Company history[edit]
The Early Years[edit]
The company was started in August 1998 by radio consultant Lewis Dickey Jr. and media and technology entrepreneur Richard Weening. The Telecommunications Act of 1996, among other things removed restrictions on the number of radio stations a single owner could control in a market and overall. Dickey, then a nationally known radio programming consultant, was acting as a consultant to a small radio group in which Weening had a personal investment. Dickey and Weening joined forces around Dickey's idea to acquire and operate radio stations in mid-size markets where giant Clear Channel was not focusing. Dickey was the radio expert and Weening was the corporate finance and start-up CEO. Dickey was President of Stratford Research his radio consulting firm [5] and also president of his family company, Midwestern Broadcasting with two stations in Toledo, Ohio which would later be acquired by Cumulus. Weening had successful experience as a start-up CEO in book and magazine publishing, online services and enterprise software systems. He was then CEO of QUAESTUS & Co., Inc., a private equity firm specializing in media and technology start-ups. A student of classics, Weening came up with the name Cumulus [6] which means "accumulation" in Latin and best described Dickey and Weening's plan to acquire stations in 50 or more markets. QUAESTUS provided the seed capital to make the first station acquisitions as a model for the Cumulus strategy.[7]
The next significant milestone was a $50 million investment from closely watched and highly respected State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) [[[8]]] previously an investor in Weening's magazine publishing company. Full scale operations started on May 22, 1997. Weening assumed the role of Executive Chairman focusing on acquisitions deal structuring, corporate finance and internet from headquarters in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Dickey selected stations to buy and oversaw radio programming, operations and strategy as Executive Vice Chairman. Dickey brought in highly regarded radio operator William Bungeroth to serve as President of Cumulus broadcasting from new offices in Chicago's Hancock Center. Bungeroth had a reputation as an advertising sales leader. He would oversee market level tactical execution including the integration of newly acquired stations into market operating units. John Dickey, Lew's brother and himself an experienced programming consultant would oversee station content.[9][10]
SWIB's investment was soon followed by another $50 million from Wisconsin-based Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company and $25 million from NationsBank Capital Corporation. Financial backing secured, Dickey and Weening set out to acquire radio stations working hard to stay as much "under the radar" as possible not wishing to attract notice or competition. In the first 12 months Cumulus acquired over 100 stations in 31 markets.[7] Almost as soon as the acquisition spree started it was clear the Company would require more than a billion dollars for acquisitions in its sights and plans were laid for a public offering.
The Cumulus strategy as articulated in public filings was to acquire multiple stations in a city or market, consolidate them physically to share a common infrastructure to reduce operating expenses but enrich programming giving each stations a unique music format, live programming, brand and target audience. The central idea was to create a cluster of radio stations that could compete with newspapers by offering advertisers a range of target demographic choices comparable to the range of content sections in print. At the time, newspaper display and classified advertising claimed the largest share of local advertising dollars. By offering a range of audiences like newspapers. Cumulus could gain more share of the local advertising dollar than the individual stations could garner on their own. In addition, acquiring the top performer stations in the market as part of the operating cluster would get more national advertising. The market focus would be those deemed to offer substantial growth opportunities and the station focus was leader station in the market and stations well position for significant growth [11]
A Public Company - Accelerating Acquisition Pace[edit]
Cumulus became a public company on June 26, 1998 raising $400 million selling 7.6 million common shares at $14.00, $125 million in Preferred Stock and $160 million in Senior Subordinated Bonds. At that time Cumulus owned or was committed to buy 176 stations - 124 FM and 52 AM in 34 US markets.[12] In its first 17 months, Cumulus acquired 207 stations, creating the first mid size radio conglomerate.[12] Following the company's IPO, its stock fell from $14 to $8 on October 2, 1998 then began a climb to close 1999 at $50.75 Some radio executives familiar with small markets thought that Cumulus was overpaying to buy top stations in markets that did not have a great upside potential.
For 1998 Cumulus reported revenue of $98.8 million, with broadcast cash flow of $26.6 million. Its cash-flow margin reached 27 percent. For 1999 Cumulus reported $180 million in revenue and $46.7 million broadcast cash flow.
In November 19 the Company sold an additional 10 million shares at $24.93 raising $250 million.[11] Acquisitions continued at an accelerating pace. At this point the Company owned or operated pending closing 246 stations in 45 US markets. In 2 years and 6 months the Company became the 2nd largest US broadcasting group in terms of stations operated. In this period, the Company raised a staggering $1.3 billion considering sales of common and preferred stock shares, senior bank lines of credit and senior subordinated debt or junk bonds which when issued were rated CCC+.
The stock market acknowledged the remarkable growth with a remarkable share price that levitated to a high of $51.00 at December 31, 1999.
Challenges in 2000[edit]
There was no .com in the Cumulus name but it was a part-time participant in the euphoria of the dot-com bubble and impacted by the hysteria that followed its burst. The reasons included very rapid growth and skyrocketing share price which in the euphoria period fed on itself. The hysteria which followed was driven by the absence of earnings and rumours which suggested the rapid growth might be a fiction.
Here is what happened between January 10 and March 31. A perfect storm of events drove the Company's share price from $50 to $13 between January 1 and March 17 when over 30 million shares traded hands. Driving the decline was persistent rumours of possible accounting irregularities in the rapidly assembled radio group. On January 14 respected Wall Street analyst Frank Bodenchak advised institutional clients that Cumulus may miss his estimates for Q4 1999 and the year. A combination of the possible earnings miss and the rumours of accounting problems created a significant loss of investor confidence.
On March 17, Cumulus reported a loss of $0.20 per share vs $0.15 per share expectation.[13] Broadcast cash flow was $12.3 million vs estimates around $17 million. In addition the Company reported that company CFO Rick Bonick had left earlier in January. It was not officially announced a fact that CNN Money says "roiled the already active rumour mill about accounting irregularities. The Company also reported it would restate quarterly revenues in 1999 as some markets did not comply with Cumulus' revenue recognition policies and booked some advertising contracts for their full value rather than recognizing revenue as the ads aired. As a result, class-action lawsuits were filed against Cumulus charging the company with artificially inflating revenue and profit in 1999. PricewaterhouseCoopers, the company's auditors resigned in April citing material weaknesses in the Cumulus' financial controls[14] arising from the possible revenue restatements.
Meanwhile, Dickey had taken over day-to-day station operations from Bungeroth who resigned in mid January.
During this same period Weening got into a dispute with the SEC over his proposal to reverse some of his and Dickey's 1999 compensation to help offset the earnings miss. While the proposal was never implemented, the SEC maintained it would have amounted to earnings management and was therefore an infraction. Weening finally agreed to pay a fine of $75,000 without conceding wrongdoing to settle the matter in 2003.
As the dust began to settle in April 2000 the company issued revised annual 10K reports for 1998 and 1999 that showed minor variations in quarterly revenue and adjusted net loss for 1999 from $20.8 million to $13.6 million and net loss for 1998 was restated from $13.7 million to $8 million, after the company found a $4.9 million tax benefit that had been under-reported. The restatement as it turns out had no material impact on the financials but in the context of the dot-com bust hysteria rumours of accounting irregularities drove a significant decrease in share price which threatened the Company's ability to finance pending acquisitions.

The Internet Debate[edit]
Since November 1998 the Company had been developing an internet platform for classified employment advertising. The new system would operate in tandem with the radio station cluster in each market and offer employers the chance to post available positions on the web and promote their company and the position on the radio stations. At the time of the dot-com bust the system was in beta test in two markets. One of the short-lived but important impacts of the dot-com bubble burst was a loss of confidence that the promise of the internet would ever happen. Many professional radio people like Dickey were skeptical and believed the best course for Cumulus was to focus on the radio strategy and drop the internet projects.[15] Weening who had started a Silicon Valley e-commerce software company in the early 90's had conceived and was overseeing development of the employment platform.[16] Weening advocated for continuance of the project as a key potential source of revenue with a service that would be unique among radio companies. Ultimately, the board backed Dickey not Weening and the Internet project was scrapped.
Changing of the Guard[edit]
According interviews with two former members of the Cumulus board, Lew Dickey and his brother John convinced the board to let them run the Company. Dickey, whose family had just sold an Atlanta station for a reported $250 million, offered to invest in Cumulus if needed to close pending acquisitions. The board was concerned about the restatement of revenues and the shareholder lawsuits. This is consistent with reports in a radio industry newsletter [17] which reported that it was a widely held belief in the Radio industry was that the Dickey brothers orchestrated events that lead to the board's decision not to back the Internet project, placing Dickey at the helm of Cumulus, moving the Cumulus headquarters from Milwaukee to Atlanta and to Weening's ultimate resignation as an employee and director in January 2001.[18][19] According to public filings Weening, QUAESTUS management company and other Weening related interests sold their interests in Cumulus a year later in May 2002 at prices ranging from $17 to $21.50 per share not The $55 high but considerably higher than share prices after their sale.
The new CEO of Cumulus Media, as of September 2015 is Mary Berner.
In April 2016, Talk Radio Network filed a lawsuit against Cumulus Media and associated defendants, alleging "antitrust violations, unfair competition, breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty, among other claims", similar to a lawsuit launched in 2012 and dropped in 2014 by the same plaintiff.[20] In June 2016, Cumulus Media and Westwood One moved to have the new suit dismissed.[20]
In June 2016, Cumulus Media announced the resignation of its Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer, Joseph P. Hannan, to "pursue other interests" after six years with the company, to be replaced by John F. Abbot.[21]
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer[edit]
Lew Dickey took full charge. By May 2002 the share price recovered to above the IPO price to a short-lived high of $22 on May 31, 2002. Dickey garnered some strong partners in the form of Bain Capital and Crestview partners who helped finance a series of ambitious acquisitions and partnerships which were creative, made Cumulus a significantly larger company but these acquisitions and Cumulus itself have struggled in the face of slow to no radio ad growth. (another researcher is working on this section)
In 2006, Cumulus acquired control of Susquehanna Radio, with the backing of 3 venture capital firms (Bain Capital Partners LLC, The Blackstone Group and Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P.) for a price of $1.2 Billion. The 33 Susquehanna stations were privately held in a separate partnership called Cumulus Media Partners, LLC (commonly referred to as CMP on the company's quarterly earnings calls) that was the subject of an equity-for-debt swap in May 2009 in an attempt to avoid defaulting on the terms of the CMP lending agreement. While Cumulus operated the CMP stations, they initially held only a minor ownership interest in them.[22] On January 31, 2011, Cumulus announced a deal to acquire the remaining ownership of CMP from its equity partners in a stock transaction valued at approximately $740 million that is closed in August 2011.[23] As a result of the CMP acquisition, Cumulus now owns a limited-partnership interest in San Francisco Baseball Associates LP, the owner of the San Francisco Giants baseball club.[24]
In July 2010, Cumulus publicly announced formation of a similar venture with Crestview Partners to acquire up to $1 billion of additional radio assets.[25]
In July 2007, the company announced its intention to "go private",[26] however on May 11, 2008, the company announced it was unable to come to terms with the parties involved and the merger/acquisition agreement was terminated.[27]
Like most major American radio station owners, Cumulus has been forced to write down the value of its radio station licenses, resulting in large non-cash losses - $498.9 million in 2008, $230.6 million in 2007, and $63.4 million in 2006.
The company's stock, priced over $56 in 1999,[28] then over $22 in 2004, was as low as $0.45 per share toward the end of 2008.[29][30]
Acquisition of Citadel Broadcasting and Dial Global[edit]
Starting in June 2010, Cumulus made multiple unsuccessful offers to buy out Citadel Broadcasting after its emergence from bankruptcy.[31] In February 2011, Cumulus was again said to be in "exclusive negotiations" to acquire Citadel for $2.5 billion paid to Citadel shareholders, according to CNBC. Some Citadel shareholders were said to have been pushing the board to consider a sale.[32] On March 10, 2011, Citadel Broadcasting stations announced via email that Cumulus had purchased Citadel Broadcasting. Citadel was made up of 225 radio stations in over 50 markets, as well as Citadel Media, one of the largest radio networks in the United States. The deal was finalized on September 16, 2011, after acceptance by the FCC and Citadel's shareholders.[33] As part of the deal, Cumulus Media will have to place 14 stations into a separate trust to comply with ownership limits.[34] Following the acquisition, in an effort to focus on larger markets, Cumulus reached a deal with Townsquare Media to swap 65 radio stations in 13 markets, with the majority of the 65 stations being sold to Townsquare.[35]
On August 29, 2013, it was reported by The Wall Street Journal that Cumulus would purchase the syndicator Dial Global for $260 million. To fund the sale, Cumulus, sold 53 more stations to Townsquare Media for $238 million, in markets such as Danbury, CT, Rockford, IL, Cedar Rapids, IA, Quad Cities IA/IL, Waterloo, IA, Portland, ME, Battle Creek, MI, Kalamazoo, MI, Lansing, MI, Faribault, MN, Rochester, MN, and Portsmouth, NH. Additionally, Townsquare Media acquired Peak Broadcasting, and Cumulus swapped 15 more stations in Dubuque, IA and Poughkeepsie, NY in exchange for Peak Broadcasting’s Fresno cluster.[36][37] The sale to Cumulus was completed on November 14, 2013.[38]
Launch of Nash, CNN partnership, and Rdio/iHeartRadio partnerships[edit]
On January 11, 2013, after acquiring the station from Family Radio, Cumulus re-launched WFME in New York City as a country music station under its new Nash FM brand. Nash was designed to serve as an umbrella brand for all country music-related content across the company's properties, including radio, digital, and live events such as the "Nash Bash". All country stations owned by Cumulus would either be branded as Nash FM, or be strongly cross-promoted as part of the Nash family of properties.[39][40]
In July 2014, Cumulus announced that it would end its partnership with ABC News Radio, and enter into a new partnership with CNN to syndicate news content for its stations through Westwood One beginning in 2015. The network will provide its content on a white label basis, allowing individual stations to use their own brands for the content. In turn, ABC announced that it would take the syndication of its radio content in-house, with distribution handled by Skyview Networks.[41][42]
On September 15, 2013, Cumulus announced that it had entered into a partnership with music streaming service Rdio; Cumulus took a stake in Rdio, and provided the company with access to its advertising sales team for a freemium tier, the ability to offer Cumulus radio stations on the Rdio service, and $75 million in marketing on Cumulus stations over five years. The stations launched on Rdio in August 2015; prior to the deal, Cumulus partnered with the competing iHeartRadio service.[43][44] This only lasted a few months however, as Rdio entered bankruptcy in November 2015 and sold most of their assets to Pandora, with Rdio ending operations the next month. Cumulus maintains their stations on iHeartRadio to the present day.
FCC actions[edit]
On December 30, 2008, Cumulus Media was issued a $14,000 Notice of Apparent Liability by the Federal Communications Commission related to the stations in the Macon, Georgia, cluster. The FCC says Cumulus failed to comply with its record-keeping requirements and its Equal Employment Opportunity rules on information on recruitment sources. Cumulus, along with two other companies, had 30 days to pay or file a statement asking for reduction or cancellation of the forfeitures.[45]
Restatement[edit]
On March 17, 2000, the company was forced to restate revenue and broadcast cash flow for three quarters of 1999 after discovering that some of its sales force had prematurely booked revenue to meet sales goals.[46] On November 8, 2005, Company decided to amend and restate its results for the second quarter of 2005.[47]

Company history[edit]
The Early Years[edit]
The company was started in August 1998 by radio consultant Lewis Dickey Jr. and media and technology entrepreneur Richard Weening. The Telecommunications Act of 1996, among other things removed restrictions on the number of radio stations a single owner could control in a market and overall. Dickey, then a nationally known radio programming consultant, was acting as a consultant to a small radio group in which Weening had a personal investment. Dickey and Weening joined forces around Dickey's idea to acquire and operate radio stations in mid-size markets where giant Clear Channel was not focusing. Dickey was the radio expert and Weening was the corporate finance and start-up CEO. Dickey was President of Stratford Research his radio consulting firm [5] and also president of his family company, Midwestern Broadcasting with two stations in Toledo, Ohio which would later be acquired by Cumulus. Weening had successful experience as a start-up CEO in book and magazine publishing, online services and enterprise software systems. He was then CEO of QUAESTUS & Co., Inc., a private equity firm specializing in media and technology start-ups. A student of classics, Weening came up with the name Cumulus [6] which means "accumulation" in Latin and best described Dickey and Weening's plan to acquire stations in 50 or more markets. QUAESTUS provided the seed capital to make the first station acquisitions as a model for the Cumulus strategy.[7]
The next significant milestone was a $50 million investment from closely watched and highly respected State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) [[[8]]] previously an investor in Weening's magazine publishing company. Full scale operations started on May 22, 1997. Weening assumed the role of Executive Chairman focusing on acquisitions deal structuring, corporate finance and internet from headquarters in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Dickey selected stations to buy and oversaw radio programming, operations and strategy as Executive Vice Chairman. Dickey brought in highly regarded radio operator William Bungeroth to serve as President of Cumulus broadcasting from new offices in Chicago's Hancock Center. Bungeroth had a reputation as an advertising sales leader. He would oversee market level tactical execution including the integration of newly acquired stations into market operating units. John Dickey, Lew's brother and himself an experienced programming consultant would oversee station content.[9][10]
SWIB's investment was soon followed by another $50 million from Wisconsin-based Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company and $25 million from NationsBank Capital Corporation. Financial backing secured, Dickey and Weening set out to acquire radio stations working hard to stay as much "under the radar" as possible not wishing to attract notice or competition. In the first 12 months Cumulus acquired over 100 stations in 31 markets.[7] Almost as soon as the acquisition spree started it was clear the Company would require more than a billion dollars for acquisitions in its sights and plans were laid for a public offering.
The Cumulus strategy as articulated in public filings was to acquire multiple stations in a city or market, consolidate them physically to share a common infrastructure to reduce operating expenses but enrich programming giving each stations a unique music format, live programming, brand and target audience. The central idea was to create a cluster of radio stations that could compete with newspapers by offering advertisers a range of target demographic choices comparable to the range of content sections in print. At the time, newspaper display and classified advertising claimed the largest share of local advertising dollars. By offering a range of audiences like newspapers. Cumulus could gain more share of the local advertising dollar than the individual stations could garner on their own. In addition, acquiring the top performer stations in the market as part of the operating cluster would get more national advertising. The market focus would be those deemed to offer substantial growth opportunities and the station focus was leader station in the market and stations well position for significant growth [11]
A Public Company - Accelerating Acquisition Pace[edit]
Cumulus became a public company on June 26, 1998 raising $400 million selling 7.6 million common shares at $14.00, $125 million in Preferred Stock and $160 million in Senior Subordinated Bonds. At that time Cumulus owned or was committed to buy 176 stations - 124 FM and 52 AM in 34 US markets.[12] In its first 17 months, Cumulus acquired 207 stations, creating the first mid size radio conglomerate.[12] Following the company's IPO, its stock fell from $14 to $8 on October 2, 1998 then began a climb to close 1999 at $50.75 Some radio executives familiar with small markets thought that Cumulus was overpaying to buy top stations in markets that did not have a great upside potential.
For 1998 Cumulus reported revenue of $98.8 million, with broadcast cash flow of $26.6 million. Its cash-flow margin reached 27 percent. For 1999 Cumulus reported $180 million in revenue and $46.7 million broadcast cash flow.
In November 19 the Company sold an additional 10 million shares at $24.93 raising $250 million.[11] Acquisitions continued at an accelerating pace. At this point the Company owned or operated pending closing 246 stations in 45 US markets. In 2 years and 6 months the Company became the 2nd largest US broadcasting group in terms of stations operated. In this period, the Company raised a staggering $1.3 billion considering sales of common and preferred stock shares, senior bank lines of credit and senior subordinated debt or junk bonds which when issued were rated CCC+.
The stock market acknowledged the remarkable growth with a remarkable share price that levitated to a high of $51.00 at December 31, 1999.
Challenges in 2000[edit]
There was no .com in the Cumulus name but it was a part-time participant in the euphoria of the dot-com bubble and impacted by the hysteria that followed its burst. The reasons included very rapid growth and skyrocketing share price which in the euphoria period fed on itself. The hysteria which followed was driven by the absence of earnings and rumours which suggested the rapid growth might be a fiction.
Here is what happened between January 10 and March 31. A perfect storm of events drove the Company's share price from $50 to $13 between January 1 and March 17 when over 30 million shares traded hands. Driving the decline was persistent rumours of possible accounting irregularities in the rapidly assembled radio group. On January 14 respected Wall Street analyst Frank Bodenchak advised institutional clients that Cumulus may miss his estimates for Q4 1999 and the year. A combination of the possible earnings miss and the rumours of accounting problems created a significant loss of investor confidence.
On March 17, Cumulus reported a loss of $0.20 per share vs $0.15 per share expectation.[13] Broadcast cash flow was $12.3 million vs estimates around $17 million. In addition the Company reported that company CFO Rick Bonick had left earlier in January. It was not officially announced a fact that CNN Money says "roiled the already active rumour mill about accounting irregularities. The Company also reported it would restate quarterly revenues in 1999 as some markets did not comply with Cumulus' revenue recognition policies and booked some advertising contracts for their full value rather than recognizing revenue as the ads aired. As a result, class-action lawsuits were filed against Cumulus charging the company with artificially inflating revenue and profit in 1999. PricewaterhouseCoopers, the company's auditors resigned in April citing material weaknesses in the Cumulus' financial controls[14] arising from the possible revenue restatements.
Meanwhile, Dickey had taken over day-to-day station operations from Bungeroth who resigned in mid January.
During this same period Weening got into a dispute with the SEC over his proposal to reverse some of his and Dickey's 1999 compensation to help offset the earnings miss. While the proposal was never implemented, the SEC maintained it would have amounted to earnings management and was therefore an infraction. Weening finally agreed to pay a fine of $75,000 without conceding wrongdoing to settle the matter in 2003.
As the dust began to settle in April 2000 the company issued revised annual 10K reports for 1998 and 1999 that showed minor variations in quarterly revenue and adjusted net loss for 1999 from $20.8 million to $13.6 million and net loss for 1998 was restated from $13.7 million to $8 million, after the company found a $4.9 million tax benefit that had been under-reported. The restatement as it turns out had no material impact on the financials but in the context of the dot-com bust hysteria rumours of accounting irregularities drove a significant decrease in share price which threatened the Company's ability to finance pending acquisitions.

The Internet Debate[edit]
Since November 1998 the Company had been developing an internet platform for classified employment advertising. The new system would operate in tandem with the radio station cluster in each market and offer employers the chance to post available positions on the web and promote their company and the position on the radio stations. At the time of the dot-com bust the system was in beta test in two markets. One of the short-lived but important impacts of the dot-com bubble burst was a loss of confidence that the promise of the internet would ever happen. Many professional radio people like Dickey were skeptical and believed the best course for Cumulus was to focus on the radio strategy and drop the internet projects.[15] Weening who had started a Silicon Valley e-commerce software company in the early 90's had conceived and was overseeing development of the employment platform.[16] Weening advocated for continuance of the project as a key potential source of revenue with a service that would be unique among radio companies. Ultimately, the board backed Dickey not Weening and the Internet project was scrapped.
Changing of the Guard[edit]
According interviews with two former members of the Cumulus board, Lew Dickey and his brother John convinced the board to let them run the Company. Dickey, whose family had just sold an Atlanta station for a reported $250 million, offered to invest in Cumulus if needed to close pending acquisitions. The board was concerned about the restatement of revenues and the shareholder lawsuits. This is consistent with reports in a radio industry newsletter [17] which reported that it was a widely held belief in the Radio industry was that the Dickey brothers orchestrated events that lead to the board's decision not to back the Internet project, placing Dickey at the helm of Cumulus, moving the Cumulus headquarters from Milwaukee to Atlanta and to Weening's ultimate resignation as an employee and director in January 2001.[18][19] According to public filings Weening, QUAESTUS management company and other Weening related interests sold their interests in Cumulus a year later in May 2002 at prices ranging from $17 to $21.50 per share not The $55 high but considerably higher than share prices after their sale.
The new CEO of Cumulus Media, as of September 2015 is Mary Berner.
In April 2016, Talk Radio Network filed a lawsuit against Cumulus Media and associated defendants, alleging "antitrust violations, unfair competition, breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty, among other claims", similar to a lawsuit launched in 2012 and dropped in 2014 by the same plaintiff.[20] In June 2016, Cumulus Media and Westwood One moved to have the new suit dismissed.[20]
In June 2016, Cumulus Media announced the resignation of its Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer, Joseph P. Hannan, to "pursue other interests" after six years with the company, to be replaced by John F. Abbot.[21]
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer[edit]
Lew Dickey took full charge. By May 2002 the share price recovered to above the IPO price to a short-lived high of $22 on May 31, 2002. Dickey garnered some strong partners in the form of Bain Capital and Crestview partners who helped finance a series of ambitious acquisitions and partnerships which were creative, made Cumulus a significantly larger company but these acquisitions and Cumulus itself have struggled in the face of slow to no radio ad growth. (another researcher is working on this section)
In 2006, Cumulus acquired control of Susquehanna Radio, with the backing of 3 venture capital firms (Bain Capital Partners LLC, The Blackstone Group and Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P.) for a price of $1.2 Billion. The 33 Susquehanna stations were privately held in a separate partnership called Cumulus Media Partners, LLC (commonly referred to as CMP on the company's quarterly earnings calls) that was the subject of an equity-for-debt swap in May 2009 in an attempt to avoid defaulting on the terms of the CMP lending agreement. While Cumulus operated the CMP stations, they initially held only a minor ownership interest in them.[22] On January 31, 2011, Cumulus announced a deal to acquire the remaining ownership of CMP from its equity partners in a stock transaction valued at approximately $740 million that is closed in August 2011.[23] As a result of the CMP acquisition, Cumulus now owns a limited-partnership interest in San Francisco Baseball Associates LP, the owner of the San Francisco Giants baseball club.[24]
In July 2010, Cumulus publicly announced formation of a similar venture with Crestview Partners to acquire up to $1 billion of additional radio assets.[25]
In July 2007, the company announced its intention to "go private",[26] however on May 11, 2008, the company announced it was unable to come to terms with the parties involved and the merger/acquisition agreement was terminated.[27]
Like most major American radio station owners, Cumulus has been forced to write down the value of its radio station licenses, resulting in large non-cash losses - $498.9 million in 2008, $230.6 million in 2007, and $63.4 million in 2006.
The company's stock, priced over $56 in 1999,[28] then over $22 in 2004, was as low as $0.45 per share toward the end of 2008.[29][30]
Acquisition of Citadel Broadcasting and Dial Global[edit]
Starting in June 2010, Cumulus made multiple unsuccessful offers to buy out Citadel Broadcasting after its emergence from bankruptcy.[31] In February 2011, Cumulus was again said to be in "exclusive negotiations" to acquire Citadel for $2.5 billion paid to Citadel shareholders, according to CNBC. Some Citadel shareholders were said to have been pushing the board to consider a sale.[32] On March 10, 2011, Citadel Broadcasting stations announced via email that Cumulus had purchased Citadel Broadcasting. Citadel was made up of 225 radio stations in over 50 markets, as well as Citadel Media, one of the largest radio networks in the United States. The deal was finalized on September 16, 2011, after acceptance by the FCC and Citadel's shareholders.[33] As part of the deal, Cumulus Media will have to place 14 stations into a separate trust to comply with ownership limits.[34] Following the acquisition, in an effort to focus on larger markets, Cumulus reached a deal with Townsquare Media to swap 65 radio stations in 13 markets, with the majority of the 65 stations being sold to Townsquare.[35]
On August 29, 2013, it was reported by The Wall Street Journal that Cumulus would purchase the syndicator Dial Global for $260 million. To fund the sale, Cumulus, sold 53 more stations to Townsquare Media for $238 million, in markets such as Danbury, CT, Rockford, IL, Cedar Rapids, IA, Quad Cities IA/IL, Waterloo, IA, Portland, ME, Battle Creek, MI, Kalamazoo, MI, Lansing, MI, Faribault, MN, Rochester, MN, and Portsmouth, NH. Additionally, Townsquare Media acquired Peak Broadcasting, and Cumulus swapped 15 more stations in Dubuque, IA and Poughkeepsie, NY in exchange for Peak Broadcasting’s Fresno cluster.[36][37] The sale to Cumulus was completed on November 14, 2013.[38]
Launch of Nash, CNN partnership, and Rdio/iHeartRadio partnerships[edit]
On January 11, 2013, after acquiring the station from Family Radio, Cumulus re-launched WFME in New York City as a country music station under its new Nash FM brand. Nash was designed to serve as an umbrella brand for all country music-related content across the company's properties, including radio, digital, and live events such as the "Nash Bash". All country stations owned by Cumulus would either be branded as Nash FM, or be strongly cross-promoted as part of the Nash family of properties.[39][40]
In July 2014, Cumulus announced that it would end its partnership with ABC News Radio, and enter into a new partnership with CNN to syndicate news content for its stations through Westwood One beginning in 2015. The network will provide its content on a white label basis, allowing individual stations to use their own brands for the content. In turn, ABC announced that it would take the syndication of its radio content in-house, with distribution handled by Skyview Networks.[41][42]
On September 15, 2013, Cumulus announced that it had entered into a partnership with music streaming service Rdio; Cumulus took a stake in Rdio, and provided the company with access to its advertising sales team for a freemium tier, the ability to offer Cumulus radio stations on the Rdio service, and $75 million in marketing on Cumulus stations over five years. The stations launched on Rdio in August 2015; prior to the deal, Cumulus partnered with the competing iHeartRadio service.[43][44] This only lasted a few months however, as Rdio entered bankruptcy in November 2015 and sold most of their assets to Pandora, with Rdio ending operations the next month. Cumulus maintains their stations on iHeartRadio to the present day.
FCC actions[edit]
On December 30, 2008, Cumulus Media was issued a $14,000 Notice of Apparent Liability by the Federal Communications Commission related to the stations in the Macon, Georgia, cluster. The FCC says Cumulus failed to comply with its record-keeping requirements and its Equal Employment Opportunity rules on information on recruitment sources. Cumulus, along with two other companies, had 30 days to pay or file a statement asking for reduction or cancellation of the forfeitures.[45]
Restatement[edit]
On March 17, 2000, the company was forced to restate revenue and broadcast cash flow for three quarters of 1999 after discovering that some of its sales force had prematurely booked revenue to meet sales goals.[46] On November 8, 2005, Company decided to amend and restate its results for the second quarter of 2005.[47]

Company history[edit]
The Early Years[edit]
The company was started in August 1998 by radio consultant Lewis Dickey Jr. and media and technology entrepreneur Richard Weening. The Telecommunications Act of 1996, among other things removed restrictions on the number of radio stations a single owner could control in a market and overall. Dickey, then a nationally known radio programming consultant, was acting as a consultant to a small radio group in which Weening had a personal investment. Dickey and Weening joined forces around Dickey's idea to acquire and operate radio stations in mid-size markets where giant Clear Channel was not focusing. Dickey was the radio expert and Weening was the corporate finance and start-up CEO. Dickey was President of Stratford Research his radio consulting firm [5] and also president of his family company, Midwestern Broadcasting with two stations in Toledo, Ohio which would later be acquired by Cumulus. Weening had successful experience as a start-up CEO in book and magazine publishing, online services and enterprise software systems. He was then CEO of QUAESTUS & Co., Inc., a private equity firm specializing in media and technology start-ups. A student of classics, Weening came up with the name Cumulus [6] which means "accumulation" in Latin and best described Dickey and Weening's plan to acquire stations in 50 or more markets. QUAESTUS provided the seed capital to make the first station acquisitions as a model for the Cumulus strategy.[7]
The next significant milestone was a $50 million investment from closely watched and highly respected State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) [[[8]]] previously an investor in Weening's magazine publishing company. Full scale operations started on May 22, 1997. Weening assumed the role of Executive Chairman focusing on acquisitions deal structuring, corporate finance and internet from headquarters in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Dickey selected stations to buy and oversaw radio programming, operations and strategy as Executive Vice Chairman. Dickey brought in highly regarded radio operator William Bungeroth to serve as President of Cumulus broadcasting from new offices in Chicago's Hancock Center. Bungeroth had a reputation as an advertising sales leader. He would oversee market level tactical execution including the integration of newly acquired stations into market operating units. John Dickey, Lew's brother and himself an experienced programming consultant would oversee station content.[9][10]
SWIB's investment was soon followed by another $50 million from Wisconsin-based Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company and $25 million from NationsBank Capital Corporation. Financial backing secured, Dickey and Weening set out to acquire radio stations working hard to stay as much "under the radar" as possible not wishing to attract notice or competition. In the first 12 months Cumulus acquired over 100 stations in 31 markets.[7] Almost as soon as the acquisition spree started it was clear the Company would require more than a billion dollars for acquisitions in its sights and plans were laid for a public offering.
The Cumulus strategy as articulated in public filings was to acquire multiple stations in a city or market, consolidate them physically to share a common infrastructure to reduce operating expenses but enrich programming giving each stations a unique music format, live programming, brand and target audience. The central idea was to create a cluster of radio stations that could compete with newspapers by offering advertisers a range of target demographic choices comparable to the range of content sections in print. At the time, newspaper display and classified advertising claimed the largest share of local advertising dollars. By offering a range of audiences like newspapers. Cumulus could gain more share of the local advertising dollar than the individual stations could garner on their own. In addition, acquiring the top performer stations in the market as part of the operating cluster would get more national advertising. The market focus would be those deemed to offer substantial growth opportunities and the station focus was leader station in the market and stations well position for significant growth [11]
A Public Company - Accelerating Acquisition Pace[edit]
Cumulus became a public company on June 26, 1998 raising $400 million selling 7.6 million common shares at $14.00, $125 million in Preferred Stock and $160 million in Senior Subordinated Bonds. At that time Cumulus owned or was committed to buy 176 stations - 124 FM and 52 AM in 34 US markets.[12] In its first 17 months, Cumulus acquired 207 stations, creating the first mid size radio conglomerate.[12] Following the company's IPO, its stock fell from $14 to $8 on October 2, 1998 then began a climb to close 1999 at $50.75 Some radio executives familiar with small markets thought that Cumulus was overpaying to buy top stations in markets that did not have a great upside potential.
For 1998 Cumulus reported revenue of $98.8 million, with broadcast cash flow of $26.6 million. Its cash-flow margin reached 27 percent. For 1999 Cumulus reported $180 million in revenue and $46.7 million broadcast cash flow.
In November 19 the Company sold an additional 10 million shares at $24.93 raising $250 million.[11] Acquisitions continued at an accelerating pace. At this point the Company owned or operated pending closing 246 stations in 45 US markets. In 2 years and 6 months the Company became the 2nd largest US broadcasting group in terms of stations operated. In this period, the Company raised a staggering $1.3 billion considering sales of common and preferred stock shares, senior bank lines of credit and senior subordinated debt or junk bonds which when issued were rated CCC+.
The stock market acknowledged the remarkable growth with a remarkable share price that levitated to a high of $51.00 at December 31, 1999.
Challenges in 2000[edit]
There was no .com in the Cumulus name but it was a part-time participant in the euphoria of the dot-com bubble and impacted by the hysteria that followed its burst. The reasons included very rapid growth and skyrocketing share price which in the euphoria period fed on itself. The hysteria which followed was driven by the absence of earnings and rumours which suggested the rapid growth might be a fiction.
Here is what happened between January 10 and March 31. A perfect storm of events drove the Company's share price from $50 to $13 between January 1 and March 17 when over 30 million shares traded hands. Driving the decline was persistent rumours of possible accounting irregularities in the rapidly assembled radio group. On January 14 respected Wall Street analyst Frank Bodenchak advised institutional clients that Cumulus may miss his estimates for Q4 1999 and the year. A combination of the possible earnings miss and the rumours of accounting problems created a significant loss of investor confidence.
On March 17, Cumulus reported a loss of $0.20 per share vs $0.15 per share expectation.[13] Broadcast cash flow was $12.3 million vs estimates around $17 million. In addition the Company reported that company CFO Rick Bonick had left earlier in January. It was not officially announced a fact that CNN Money says "roiled the already active rumour mill about accounting irregularities. The Company also reported it would restate quarterly revenues in 1999 as some markets did not comply with Cumulus' revenue recognition policies and booked some advertising contracts for their full value rather than recognizing revenue as the ads aired. As a result, class-action lawsuits were filed against Cumulus charging the company with artificially inflating revenue and profit in 1999. PricewaterhouseCoopers, the company's auditors resigned in April citing material weaknesses in the Cumulus' financial controls[14] arising from the possible revenue restatements.
Meanwhile, Dickey had taken over day-to-day station operations from Bungeroth who resigned in mid January.
During this same period Weening got into a dispute with the SEC over his proposal to reverse some of his and Dickey's 1999 compensation to help offset the earnings miss. While the proposal was never implemented, the SEC maintained it would have amounted to earnings management and was therefore an infraction. Weening finally agreed to pay a fine of $75,000 without conceding wrongdoing to settle the matter in 2003.
As the dust began to settle in April 2000 the company issued revised annual 10K reports for 1998 and 1999 that showed minor variations in quarterly revenue and adjusted net loss for 1999 from $20.8 million to $13.6 million and net loss for 1998 was restated from $13.7 million to $8 million, after the company found a $4.9 million tax benefit that had been under-reported. The restatement as it turns out had no material impact on the financials but in the context of the dot-com bust hysteria rumours of accounting irregularities drove a significant decrease in share price which threatened the Company's ability to finance pending acquisitions.

The Internet Debate[edit]
Since November 1998 the Company had been developing an internet platform for classified employment advertising. The new system would operate in tandem with the radio station cluster in each market and offer employers the chance to post available positions on the web and promote their company and the position on the radio stations. At the time of the dot-com bust the system was in beta test in two markets. One of the short-lived but important impacts of the dot-com bubble burst was a loss of confidence that the promise of the internet would ever happen. Many professional radio people like Dickey were skeptical and believed the best course for Cumulus was to focus on the radio strategy and drop the internet projects.[15] Weening who had started a Silicon Valley e-commerce software company in the early 90's had conceived and was overseeing development of the employment platform.[16] Weening advocated for continuance of the project as a key potential source of revenue with a service that would be unique among radio companies. Ultimately, the board backed Dickey not Weening and the Internet project was scrapped.
Changing of the Guard[edit]
According interviews with two former members of the Cumulus board, Lew Dickey and his brother John convinced the board to let them run the Company. Dickey, whose family had just sold an Atlanta station for a reported $250 million, offered to invest in Cumulus if needed to close pending acquisitions. The board was concerned about the restatement of revenues and the shareholder lawsuits. This is consistent with reports in a radio industry newsletter [17] which reported that it was a widely held belief in the Radio industry was that the Dickey brothers orchestrated events that lead to the board's decision not to back the Internet project, placing Dickey at the helm of Cumulus, moving the Cumulus headquarters from Milwaukee to Atlanta and to Weening's ultimate resignation as an employee and director in January 2001.[18][19] According to public filings Weening, QUAESTUS management company and other Weening related interests sold their interests in Cumulus a year later in May 2002 at prices ranging from $17 to $21.50 per share not The $55 high but considerably higher than share prices after their sale.
The new CEO of Cumulus Media, as of September 2015 is Mary Berner.
In April 2016, Talk Radio Network filed a lawsuit against Cumulus Media and associated defendants, alleging "antitrust violations, unfair competition, breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty, among other claims", similar to a lawsuit launched in 2012 and dropped in 2014 by the same plaintiff.[20] In June 2016, Cumulus Media and Westwood One moved to have the new suit dismissed.[20]
In June 2016, Cumulus Media announced the resignation of its Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer, Joseph P. Hannan, to "pursue other interests" after six years with the company, to be replaced by John F. Abbot.[21]
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer[edit]
Lew Dickey took full charge. By May 2002 the share price recovered to above the IPO price to a short-lived high of $22 on May 31, 2002. Dickey garnered some strong partners in the form of Bain Capital and Crestview partners who helped finance a series of ambitious acquisitions and partnerships which were creative, made Cumulus a significantly larger company but these acquisitions and Cumulus itself have struggled in the face of slow to no radio ad growth. (another researcher is working on this section)
In 2006, Cumulus acquired control of Susquehanna Radio, with the backing of 3 venture capital firms (Bain Capital Partners LLC, The Blackstone Group and Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P.) for a price of $1.2 Billion. The 33 Susquehanna stations were privately held in a separate partnership called Cumulus Media Partners, LLC (commonly referred to as CMP on the company's quarterly earnings calls) that was the subject of an equity-for-debt swap in May 2009 in an attempt to avoid defaulting on the terms of the CMP lending agreement. While Cumulus operated the CMP stations, they initially held only a minor ownership interest in them.[22] On January 31, 2011, Cumulus announced a deal to acquire the remaining ownership of CMP from its equity partners in a stock transaction valued at approximately $740 million that is closed in August 2011.[23] As a result of the CMP acquisition, Cumulus now owns a limited-partnership interest in San Francisco Baseball Associates LP, the owner of the San Francisco Giants baseball club.[24]
In July 2010, Cumulus publicly announced formation of a similar venture with Crestview Partners to acquire up to $1 billion of additional radio assets.[25]
In July 2007, the company announced its intention to "go private",[26] however on May 11, 2008, the company announced it was unable to come to terms with the parties involved and the merger/acquisition agreement was terminated.[27]
Like most major American radio station owners, Cumulus has been forced to write down the value of its radio station licenses, resulting in large non-cash losses - $498.9 million in 2008, $230.6 million in 2007, and $63.4 million in 2006.
The company's stock, priced over $56 in 1999,[28] then over $22 in 2004, was as low as $0.45 per share toward the end of 2008.[29][30]
Acquisition of Citadel Broadcasting and Dial Global[edit]
Starting in June 2010, Cumulus made multiple unsuccessful offers to buy out Citadel Broadcasting after its emergence from bankruptcy.[31] In February 2011, Cumulus was again said to be in "exclusive negotiations" to acquire Citadel for $2.5 billion paid to Citadel shareholders, according to CNBC. Some Citadel shareholders were said to have been pushing the board to consider a sale.[32] On March 10, 2011, Citadel Broadcasting stations announced via email that Cumulus had purchased Citadel Broadcasting. Citadel was made up of 225 radio stations in over 50 markets, as well as Citadel Media, one of the largest radio networks in the United States. The deal was finalized on September 16, 2011, after acceptance by the FCC and Citadel's shareholders.[33] As part of the deal, Cumulus Media will have to place 14 stations into a separate trust to comply with ownership limits.[34] Following the acquisition, in an effort to focus on larger markets, Cumulus reached a deal with Townsquare Media to swap 65 radio stations in 13 markets, with the majority of the 65 stations being sold to Townsquare.[35]
On August 29, 2013, it was reported by The Wall Street Journal that Cumulus would purchase the syndicator Dial Global for $260 million. To fund the sale, Cumulus, sold 53 more stations to Townsquare Media for $238 million, in markets such as Danbury, CT, Rockford, IL, Cedar Rapids, IA, Quad Cities IA/IL, Waterloo, IA, Portland, ME, Battle Creek, MI, Kalamazoo, MI, Lansing, MI, Faribault, MN, Rochester, MN, and Portsmouth, NH. Additionally, Townsquare Media acquired Peak Broadcasting, and Cumulus swapped 15 more stations in Dubuque, IA and Poughkeepsie, NY in exchange for Peak Broadcasting’s Fresno cluster.[36][37] The sale to Cumulus was completed on November 14, 2013.[38]
Launch of Nash, CNN partnership, and Rdio/iHeartRadio partnerships[edit]
On January 11, 2013, after acquiring the station from Family Radio, Cumulus re-launched WFME in New York City as a country music station under its new Nash FM brand. Nash was designed to serve as an umbrella brand for all country music-related content across the company's properties, including radio, digital, and live events such as the "Nash Bash". All country stations owned by Cumulus would either be branded as Nash FM, or be strongly cross-promoted as part of the Nash family of properties.[39][40]
In July 2014, Cumulus announced that it would end its partnership with ABC News Radio, and enter into a new partnership with CNN to syndicate news content for its stations through Westwood One beginning in 2015. The network will provide its content on a white label basis, allowing individual stations to use their own brands for the content. In turn, ABC announced that it would take the syndication of its radio content in-house, with distribution handled by Skyview Networks.[41][42]
On September 15, 2013, Cumulus announced that it had entered into a partnership with music streaming service Rdio; Cumulus took a stake in Rdio, and provided the company with access to its advertising sales team for a freemium tier, the ability to offer Cumulus radio stations on the Rdio service, and $75 million in marketing on Cumulus stations over five years. The stations launched on Rdio in August 2015; prior to the deal, Cumulus partnered with the competing iHeartRadio service.[43][44] This only lasted a few months however, as Rdio entered bankruptcy in November 2015 and sold most of their assets to Pandora, with Rdio ending operations the next month. Cumulus maintains their stations on iHeartRadio to the present day.
FCC actions[edit]
On December 30, 2008, Cumulus Media was issued a $14,000 Notice of Apparent Liability by the Federal Communications Commission related to the stations in the Macon, Georgia, cluster. The FCC says Cumulus failed to comply with its record-keeping requirements and its Equal Employment Opportunity rules on information on recruitment sources. Cumulus, along with two other companies, had 30 days to pay or file a statement asking for reduction or cancellation of the forfeitures.[45]
Restatement[edit]
On March 17, 2000, the company was forced to restate revenue and broadcast cash flow for three quarters of 1999 after discovering that some of its sales force had prematurely booked revenue to meet sales goals.[46] On November 8, 2005, Company decided to amend and restate its results for the second quarter of 2005.[47]

Company history[edit]
The Early Years[edit]
The company was started in August 1998 by radio consultant Lewis Dickey Jr. and media and technology entrepreneur Richard Weening. The Telecommunications Act of 1996, among other things removed restrictions on the number of radio stations a single owner could control in a market and overall. Dickey, then a nationally known radio programming consultant, was acting as a consultant to a small radio group in which Weening had a personal investment. Dickey and Weening joined forces around Dickey's idea to acquire and operate radio stations in mid-size markets where giant Clear Channel was not focusing. Dickey was the radio expert and Weening was the corporate finance and start-up CEO. Dickey was President of Stratford Research his radio consulting firm [5] and also president of his family company, Midwestern Broadcasting with two stations in Toledo, Ohio which would later be acquired by Cumulus. Weening had successful experience as a start-up CEO in book and magazine publishing, online services and enterprise software systems. He was then CEO of QUAESTUS & Co., Inc., a private equity firm specializing in media and technology start-ups. A student of classics, Weening came up with the name Cumulus [6] which means "accumulation" in Latin and best described Dickey and Weening's plan to acquire stations in 50 or more markets. QUAESTUS provided the seed capital to make the first station acquisitions as a model for the Cumulus strategy.[7]
The next significant milestone was a $50 million investment from closely watched and highly respected State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) [[[8]]] previously an investor in Weening's magazine publishing company. Full scale operations started on May 22, 1997. Weening assumed the role of Executive Chairman focusing on acquisitions deal structuring, corporate finance and internet from headquarters in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Dickey selected stations to buy and oversaw radio programming, operations and strategy as Executive Vice Chairman. Dickey brought in highly regarded radio operator William Bungeroth to serve as President of Cumulus broadcasting from new offices in Chicago's Hancock Center. Bungeroth had a reputation as an advertising sales leader. He would oversee market level tactical execution including the integration of newly acquired stations into market operating units. John Dickey, Lew's brother and himself an experienced programming consultant would oversee station content.[9][10]
SWIB's investment was soon followed by another $50 million from Wisconsin-based Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company and $25 million from NationsBank Capital Corporation. Financial backing secured, Dickey and Weening set out to acquire radio stations working hard to stay as much "under the radar" as possible not wishing to attract notice or competition. In the first 12 months Cumulus acquired over 100 stations in 31 markets.[7] Almost as soon as the acquisition spree started it was clear the Company would require more than a billion dollars for acquisitions in its sights and plans were laid for a public offering.
The Cumulus strategy as articulated in public filings was to acquire multiple stations in a city or market, consolidate them physically to share a common infrastructure to reduce operating expenses but enrich programming giving each stations a unique music format, live programming, brand and target audience. The central idea was to create a cluster of radio stations that could compete with newspapers by offering advertisers a range of target demographic choices comparable to the range of content sections in print. At the time, newspaper display and classified advertising claimed the largest share of local advertising dollars. By offering a range of audiences like newspapers. Cumulus could gain more share of the local advertising dollar than the individual stations could garner on their own. In addition, acquiring the top performer stations in the market as part of the operating cluster would get more national advertising. The market focus would be those deemed to offer substantial growth opportunities and the station focus was leader station in the market and stations well position for significant growth [11]
A Public Company - Accelerating Acquisition Pace[edit]
Cumulus became a public company on June 26, 1998 raising $400 million selling 7.6 million common shares at $14.00, $125 million in Preferred Stock and $160 million in Senior Subordinated Bonds. At that time Cumulus owned or was committed to buy 176 stations - 124 FM and 52 AM in 34 US markets.[12] In its first 17 months, Cumulus acquired 207 stations, creating the first mid size radio conglomerate.[12] Following the company's IPO, its stock fell from $14 to $8 on October 2, 1998 then began a climb to close 1999 at $50.75 Some radio executives familiar with small markets thought that Cumulus was overpaying to buy top stations in markets that did not have a great upside potential.
For 1998 Cumulus reported revenue of $98.8 million, with broadcast cash flow of $26.6 million. Its cash-flow margin reached 27 percent. For 1999 Cumulus reported $180 million in revenue and $46.7 million broadcast cash flow.
In November 19 the Company sold an additional 10 million shares at $24.93 raising $250 million.[11] Acquisitions continued at an accelerating pace. At this point the Company owned or operated pending closing 246 stations in 45 US markets. In 2 years and 6 months the Company became the 2nd largest US broadcasting group in terms of stations operated. In this period, the Company raised a staggering $1.3 billion considering sales of common and preferred stock shares, senior bank lines of credit and senior subordinated debt or junk bonds which when issued were rated CCC+.
The stock market acknowledged the remarkable growth with a remarkable share price that levitated to a high of $51.00 at December 31, 1999.
Challenges in 2000[edit]
There was no .com in the Cumulus name but it was a part-time participant in the euphoria of the dot-com bubble and impacted by the hysteria that followed its burst. The reasons included very rapid growth and skyrocketing share price which in the euphoria period fed on itself. The hysteria which followed was driven by the absence of earnings and rumours which suggested the rapid growth might be a fiction.
Here is what happened between January 10 and March 31. A perfect storm of events drove the Company's share price from $50 to $13 between January 1 and March 17 when over 30 million shares traded hands. Driving the decline was persistent rumours of possible accounting irregularities in the rapidly assembled radio group. On January 14 respected Wall Street analyst Frank Bodenchak advised institutional clients that Cumulus may miss his estimates for Q4 1999 and the year. A combination of the possible earnings miss and the rumours of accounting problems created a significant loss of investor confidence.
On March 17, Cumulus reported a loss of $0.20 per share vs $0.15 per share expectation.[13] Broadcast cash flow was $12.3 million vs estimates around $17 million. In addition the Company reported that company CFO Rick Bonick had left earlier in January. It was not officially announced a fact that CNN Money says "roiled the already active rumour mill about accounting irregularities. The Company also reported it would restate quarterly revenues in 1999 as some markets did not comply with Cumulus' revenue recognition policies and booked some advertising contracts for their full value rather than recognizing revenue as the ads aired. As a result, class-action lawsuits were filed against Cumulus charging the company with artificially inflating revenue and profit in 1999. PricewaterhouseCoopers, the company's auditors resigned in April citing material weaknesses in the Cumulus' financial controls[14] arising from the possible revenue restatements.
Meanwhile, Dickey had taken over day-to-day station operations from Bungeroth who resigned in mid January.
During this same period Weening got into a dispute with the SEC over his proposal to reverse some of his and Dickey's 1999 compensation to help offset the earnings miss. While the proposal was never implemented, the SEC maintained it would have amounted to earnings management and was therefore an infraction. Weening finally agreed to pay a fine of $75,000 without conceding wrongdoing to settle the matter in 2003.
As the dust began to settle in April 2000 the company issued revised annual 10K reports for 1998 and 1999 that showed minor variations in quarterly revenue and adjusted net loss for 1999 from $20.8 million to $13.6 million and net loss for 1998 was restated from $13.7 million to $8 million, after the company found a $4.9 million tax benefit that had been under-reported. The restatement as it turns out had no material impact on the financials but in the context of the dot-com bust hysteria rumours of accounting irregularities drove a significant decrease in share price which threatened the Company's ability to finance pending acquisitions.

The Internet Debate[edit]
Since November 1998 the Company had been developing an internet platform for classified employment advertising. The new system would operate in tandem with the radio station cluster in each market and offer employers the chance to post available positions on the web and promote their company and the position on the radio stations. At the time of the dot-com bust the system was in beta test in two markets. One of the short-lived but important impacts of the dot-com bubble burst was a loss of confidence that the promise of the internet would ever happen. Many professional radio people like Dickey were skeptical and believed the best course for Cumulus was to focus on the radio strategy and drop the internet projects.[15] Weening who had started a Silicon Valley e-commerce software company in the early 90's had conceived and was overseeing development of the employment platform.[16] Weening advocated for continuance of the project as a key potential source of revenue with a service that would be unique among radio companies. Ultimately, the board backed Dickey not Weening and the Internet project was scrapped.
Changing of the Guard[edit]
According interviews with two former members of the Cumulus board, Lew Dickey and his brother John convinced the board to let them run the Company. Dickey, whose family had just sold an Atlanta station for a reported $250 million, offered to invest in Cumulus if needed to close pending acquisitions. The board was concerned about the restatement of revenues and the shareholder lawsuits. This is consistent with reports in a radio industry newsletter [17] which reported that it was a widely held belief in the Radio industry was that the Dickey brothers orchestrated events that lead to the board's decision not to back the Internet project, placing Dickey at the helm of Cumulus, moving the Cumulus headquarters from Milwaukee to Atlanta and to Weening's ultimate resignation as an employee and director in January 2001.[18][19] According to public filings Weening, QUAESTUS management company and other Weening related interests sold their interests in Cumulus a year later in May 2002 at prices ranging from $17 to $21.50 per share not The $55 high but considerably higher than share prices after their sale.
The new CEO of Cumulus Media, as of September 2015 is Mary Berner.
In April 2016, Talk Radio Network filed a lawsuit against Cumulus Media and associated defendants, alleging "antitrust violations, unfair competition, breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty, among other claims", similar to a lawsuit launched in 2012 and dropped in 2014 by the same plaintiff.[20] In June 2016, Cumulus Media and Westwood One moved to have the new suit dismissed.[20]
In June 2016, Cumulus Media announced the resignation of its Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer, Joseph P. Hannan, to "pursue other interests" after six years with the company, to be replaced by John F. Abbot.[21]
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer[edit]
Lew Dickey took full charge. By May 2002 the share price recovered to above the IPO price to a short-lived high of $22 on May 31, 2002. Dickey garnered some strong partners in the form of Bain Capital and Crestview partners who helped finance a series of ambitious acquisitions and partnerships which were creative, made Cumulus a significantly larger company but these acquisitions and Cumulus itself have struggled in the face of slow to no radio ad growth. (another researcher is working on this section)
In 2006, Cumulus acquired control of Susquehanna Radio, with the backing of 3 venture capital firms (Bain Capital Partners LLC, The Blackstone Group and Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P.) for a price of $1.2 Billion. The 33 Susquehanna stations were privately held in a separate partnership called Cumulus Media Partners, LLC (commonly referred to as CMP on the company's quarterly earnings calls) that was the subject of an equity-for-debt swap in May 2009 in an attempt to avoid defaulting on the terms of the CMP lending agreement. While Cumulus operated the CMP stations, they initially held only a minor ownership interest in them.[22] On January 31, 2011, Cumulus announced a deal to acquire the remaining ownership of CMP from its equity partners in a stock transaction valued at approximately $740 million that is closed in August 2011.[23] As a result of the CMP acquisition, Cumulus now owns a limited-partnership interest in San Francisco Baseball Associates LP, the owner of the San Francisco Giants baseball club.[24]
In July 2010, Cumulus publicly announced formation of a similar venture with Crestview Partners to acquire up to $1 billion of additional radio assets.[25]
In July 2007, the company announced its intention to "go private",[26] however on May 11, 2008, the company announced it was unable to come to terms with the parties involved and the merger/acquisition agreement was terminated.[27]
Like most major American radio station owners, Cumulus has been forced to write down the value of its radio station licenses, resulting in large non-cash losses - $498.9 million in 2008, $230.6 million in 2007, and $63.4 million in 2006.
The company's stock, priced over $56 in 1999,[28] then over $22 in 2004, was as low as $0.45 per share toward the end of 2008.[29][30]
Acquisition of Citadel Broadcasting and Dial Global[edit]
Starting in June 2010, Cumulus made multiple unsuccessful offers to buy out Citadel Broadcasting after its emergence from bankruptcy.[31] In February 2011, Cumulus was again said to be in "exclusive negotiations" to acquire Citadel for $2.5 billion paid to Citadel shareholders, according to CNBC. Some Citadel shareholders were said to have been pushing the board to consider a sale.[32] On March 10, 2011, Citadel Broadcasting stations announced via email that Cumulus had purchased Citadel Broadcasting. Citadel was made up of 225 radio stations in over 50 markets, as well as Citadel Media, one of the largest radio networks in the United States. The deal was finalized on September 16, 2011, after acceptance by the FCC and Citadel's shareholders.[33] As part of the deal, Cumulus Media will have to place 14 stations into a separate trust to comply with ownership limits.[34] Following the acquisition, in an effort to focus on larger markets, Cumulus reached a deal with Townsquare Media to swap 65 radio stations in 13 markets, with the majority of the 65 stations being sold to Townsquare.[35]
On August 29, 2013, it was reported by The Wall Street Journal that Cumulus would purchase the syndicator Dial Global for $260 million. To fund the sale, Cumulus, sold 53 more stations to Townsquare Media for $238 million, in markets such as Danbury, CT, Rockford, IL, Cedar Rapids, IA, Quad Cities IA/IL, Waterloo, IA, Portland, ME, Battle Creek, MI, Kalamazoo, MI, Lansing, MI, Faribault, MN, Rochester, MN, and Portsmouth, NH. Additionally, Townsquare Media acquired Peak Broadcasting, and Cumulus swapped 15 more stations in Dubuque, IA and Poughkeepsie, NY in exchange for Peak Broadcasting’s Fresno cluster.[36][37] The sale to Cumulus was completed on November 14, 2013.[38]
Launch of Nash, CNN partnership, and Rdio/iHeartRadio partnerships[edit]
On January 11, 2013, after acquiring the station from Family Radio, Cumulus re-launched WFME in New York City as a country music station under its new Nash FM brand. Nash was designed to serve as an umbrella brand for all country music-related content across the company's properties, including radio, digital, and live events such as the "Nash Bash". All country stations owned by Cumulus would either be branded as Nash FM, or be strongly cross-promoted as part of the Nash family of properties.[39][40]
In July 2014, Cumulus announced that it would end its partnership with ABC News Radio, and enter into a new partnership with CNN to syndicate news content for its stations through Westwood One beginning in 2015. The network will provide its content on a white label basis, allowing individual stations to use their own brands for the content. In turn, ABC announced that it would take the syndication of its radio content in-house, with distribution handled by Skyview Networks.[41][42]
On September 15, 2013, Cumulus announced that it had entered into a partnership with music streaming service Rdio; Cumulus took a stake in Rdio, and provided the company with access to its advertising sales team for a freemium tier, the ability to offer Cumulus radio stations on the Rdio service, and $75 million in marketing on Cumulus stations over five years. The stations launched on Rdio in August 2015; prior to the deal, Cumulus partnered with the competing iHeartRadio service.[43][44] This only lasted a few months however, as Rdio entered bankruptcy in November 2015 and sold most of their assets to Pandora, with Rdio ending operations the next month. Cumulus maintains their stations on iHeartRadio to the present day.
FCC actions[edit]
On December 30, 2008, Cumulus Media was issued a $14,000 Notice of Apparent Liability by the Federal Communications Commission related to the stations in the Macon, Georgia, cluster. The FCC says Cumulus failed to comply with its record-keeping requirements and its Equal Employment Opportunity rules on information on recruitment sources. Cumulus, along with two other companies, had 30 days to pay or file a statement asking for reduction or cancellation of the forfeitures.[45]
Restatement[edit]
On March 17, 2000, the company was forced to restate revenue and broadcast cash flow for three quarters of 1999 after discovering that some of its sales force had prematurely booked revenue to meet sales goals.[46] On November 8, 2005, Company decided to amend and restate its results for the second quarter of 2005.[47]

Company history[edit]
The Early Years[edit]
The company was started in August 1998 by radio consultant Lewis Dickey Jr. and media and technology entrepreneur Richard Weening. The Telecommunications Act of 1996, among other things removed restrictions on the number of radio stations a single owner could control in a market and overall. Dickey, then a nationally known radio programming consultant, was acting as a consultant to a small radio group in which Weening had a personal investment. Dickey and Weening joined forces around Dickey's idea to acquire and operate radio stations in mid-size markets where giant Clear Channel was not focusing. Dickey was the radio expert and Weening was the corporate finance and start-up CEO. Dickey was President of Stratford Research his radio consulting firm [5] and also president of his family company, Midwestern Broadcasting with two stations in Toledo, Ohio which would later be acquired by Cumulus. Weening had successful experience as a start-up CEO in book and magazine publishing, online services and enterprise software systems. He was then CEO of QUAESTUS & Co., Inc., a private equity firm specializing in media and technology start-ups. A student of classics, Weening came up with the name Cumulus [6] which means "accumulation" in Latin and best described Dickey and Weening's plan to acquire stations in 50 or more markets. QUAESTUS provided the seed capital to make the first station acquisitions as a model for the Cumulus strategy.[7]
The next significant milestone was a $50 million investment from closely watched and highly respected State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) [[[8]]] previously an investor in Weening's magazine publishing company. Full scale operations started on May 22, 1997. Weening assumed the role of Executive Chairman focusing on acquisitions deal structuring, corporate finance and internet from headquarters in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Dickey selected stations to buy and oversaw radio programming, operations and strategy as Executive Vice Chairman. Dickey brought in highly regarded radio operator William Bungeroth to serve as President of Cumulus broadcasting from new offices in Chicago's Hancock Center. Bungeroth had a reputation as an advertising sales leader. He would oversee market level tactical execution including the integration of newly acquired stations into market operating units. John Dickey, Lew's brother and himself an experienced programming consultant would oversee station content.[9][10]
SWIB's investment was soon followed by another $50 million from Wisconsin-based Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company and $25 million from NationsBank Capital Corporation. Financial backing secured, Dickey and Weening set out to acquire radio stations working hard to stay as much "under the radar" as possible not wishing to attract notice or competition. In the first 12 months Cumulus acquired over 100 stations in 31 markets.[7] Almost as soon as the acquisition spree started it was clear the Company would require more than a billion dollars for acquisitions in its sights and plans were laid for a public offering.
The Cumulus strategy as articulated in public filings was to acquire multiple stations in a city or market, consolidate them physically to share a common infrastructure to reduce operating expenses but enrich programming giving each stations a unique music format, live programming, brand and target audience. The central idea was to create a cluster of radio stations that could compete with newspapers by offering advertisers a range of target demographic choices comparable to the range of content sections in print. At the time, newspaper display and classified advertising claimed the largest share of local advertising dollars. By offering a range of audiences like newspapers. Cumulus could gain more share of the local advertising dollar than the individual stations could garner on their own. In addition, acquiring the top performer stations in the market as part of the operating cluster would get more national advertising. The market focus would be those deemed to offer substantial growth opportunities and the station focus was leader station in the market and stations well position for significant growth [11]
A Public Company - Accelerating Acquisition Pace[edit]
Cumulus became a public company on June 26, 1998 raising $400 million selling 7.6 million common shares at $14.00, $125 million in Preferred Stock and $160 million in Senior Subordinated Bonds. At that time Cumulus owned or was committed to buy 176 stations - 124 FM and 52 AM in 34 US markets.[12] In its first 17 months, Cumulus acquired 207 stations, creating the first mid size radio conglomerate.[12] Following the company's IPO, its stock fell from $14 to $8 on October 2, 1998 then began a climb to close 1999 at $50.75 Some radio executives familiar with small markets thought that Cumulus was overpaying to buy top stations in markets that did not have a great upside potential.
For 1998 Cumulus reported revenue of $98.8 million, with broadcast cash flow of $26.6 million. Its cash-flow margin reached 27 percent. For 1999 Cumulus reported $180 million in revenue and $46.7 million broadcast cash flow.
In November 19 the Company sold an additional 10 million shares at $24.93 raising $250 million.[11] Acquisitions continued at an accelerating pace. At this point the Company owned or operated pending closing 246 stations in 45 US markets. In 2 years and 6 months the Company became the 2nd largest US broadcasting group in terms of stations operated. In this period, the Company raised a staggering $1.3 billion considering sales of common and preferred stock shares, senior bank lines of credit and senior subordinated debt or junk bonds which when issued were rated CCC+.
The stock market acknowledged the remarkable growth with a remarkable share price that levitated to a high of $51.00 at December 31, 1999.
Challenges in 2000[edit]
There was no .com in the Cumulus name but it was a part-time participant in the euphoria of the dot-com bubble and impacted by the hysteria that followed its burst. The reasons included very rapid growth and skyrocketing share price which in the euphoria period fed on itself. The hysteria which followed was driven by the absence of earnings and rumours which suggested the rapid growth might be a fiction.
Here is what happened between January 10 and March 31. A perfect storm of events drove the Company's share price from $50 to $13 between January 1 and March 17 when over 30 million shares traded hands. Driving the decline was persistent rumours of possible accounting irregularities in the rapidly assembled radio group. On January 14 respected Wall Street analyst Frank Bodenchak advised institutional clients that Cumulus may miss his estimates for Q4 1999 and the year. A combination of the possible earnings miss and the rumours of accounting problems created a significant loss of investor confidence.
On March 17, Cumulus reported a loss of $0.20 per share vs $0.15 per share expectation.[13] Broadcast cash flow was $12.3 million vs estimates around $17 million. In addition the Company reported that company CFO Rick Bonick had left earlier in January. It was not officially announced a fact that CNN Money says "roiled the already active rumour mill about accounting irregularities. The Company also reported it would restate quarterly revenues in 1999 as some markets did not comply with Cumulus' revenue recognition policies and booked some advertising contracts for their full value rather than recognizing revenue as the ads aired. As a result, class-action lawsuits were filed against Cumulus charging the company with artificially inflating revenue and profit in 1999. PricewaterhouseCoopers, the company's auditors resigned in April citing material weaknesses in the Cumulus' financial controls[14] arising from the possible revenue restatements.
Meanwhile, Dickey had taken over day-to-day station operations from Bungeroth who resigned in mid January.
During this same period Weening got into a dispute with the SEC over his proposal to reverse some of his and Dickey's 1999 compensation to help offset the earnings miss. While the proposal was never implemented, the SEC maintained it would have amounted to earnings management and was therefore an infraction. Weening finally agreed to pay a fine of $75,000 without conceding wrongdoing to settle the matter in 2003.
As the dust began to settle in April 2000 the company issued revised annual 10K reports for 1998 and 1999 that showed minor variations in quarterly revenue and adjusted net loss for 1999 from $20.8 million to $13.6 million and net loss for 1998 was restated from $13.7 million to $8 million, after the company found a $4.9 million tax benefit that had been under-reported. The restatement as it turns out had no material impact on the financials but in the context of the dot-com bust hysteria rumours of accounting irregularities drove a significant decrease in share price which threatened the Company's ability to finance pending acquisitions.

The Internet Debate[edit]
Since November 1998 the Company had been developing an internet platform for classified employment advertising. The new system would operate in tandem with the radio station cluster in each market and offer employers the chance to post available positions on the web and promote their company and the position on the radio stations. At the time of the dot-com bust the system was in beta test in two markets. One of the short-lived but important impacts of the dot-com bubble burst was a loss of confidence that the promise of the internet would ever happen. Many professional radio people like Dickey were skeptical and believed the best course for Cumulus was to focus on the radio strategy and drop the internet projects.[15] Weening who had started a Silicon Valley e-commerce software company in the early 90's had conceived and was overseeing development of the employment platform.[16] Weening advocated for continuance of the project as a key potential source of revenue with a service that would be unique among radio companies. Ultimately, the board backed Dickey not Weening and the Internet project was scrapped.
Changing of the Guard[edit]
According interviews with two former members of the Cumulus board, Lew Dickey and his brother John convinced the board to let them run the Company. Dickey, whose family had just sold an Atlanta station for a reported $250 million, offered to invest in Cumulus if needed to close pending acquisitions. The board was concerned about the restatement of revenues and the shareholder lawsuits. This is consistent with reports in a radio industry newsletter [17] which reported that it was a widely held belief in the Radio industry was that the Dickey brothers orchestrated events that lead to the board's decision not to back the Internet project, placing Dickey at the helm of Cumulus, moving the Cumulus headquarters from Milwaukee to Atlanta and to Weening's ultimate resignation as an employee and director in January 2001.[18][19] According to public filings Weening, QUAESTUS management company and other Weening related interests sold their interests in Cumulus a year later in May 2002 at prices ranging from $17 to $21.50 per share not The $55 high but considerably higher than share prices after their sale.
The new CEO of Cumulus Media, as of September 2015 is Mary Berner.
In April 2016, Talk Radio Network filed a lawsuit against Cumulus Media and associated defendants, alleging "antitrust violations, unfair competition, breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty, among other claims", similar to a lawsuit launched in 2012 and dropped in 2014 by the same plaintiff.[20] In June 2016, Cumulus Media and Westwood One moved to have the new suit dismissed.[20]
In June 2016, Cumulus Media announced the resignation of its Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer, Joseph P. Hannan, to "pursue other interests" after six years with the company, to be replaced by John F. Abbot.[21]
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer[edit]
Lew Dickey took full charge. By May 2002 the share price recovered to above the IPO price to a short-lived high of $22 on May 31, 2002. Dickey garnered some strong partners in the form of Bain Capital and Crestview partners who helped finance a series of ambitious acquisitions and partnerships which were creative, made Cumulus a significantly larger company but these acquisitions and Cumulus itself have struggled in the face of slow to no radio ad growth. (another researcher is working on this section)
In 2006, Cumulus acquired control of Susquehanna Radio, with the backing of 3 venture capital firms (Bain Capital Partners LLC, The Blackstone Group and Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P.) for a price of $1.2 Billion. The 33 Susquehanna stations were privately held in a separate partnership called Cumulus Media Partners, LLC (commonly referred to as CMP on the company's quarterly earnings calls) that was the subject of an equity-for-debt swap in May 2009 in an attempt to avoid defaulting on the terms of the CMP lending agreement. While Cumulus operated the CMP stations, they initially held only a minor ownership interest in them.[22] On January 31, 2011, Cumulus announced a deal to acquire the remaining ownership of CMP from its equity partners in a stock transaction valued at approximately $740 million that is closed in August 2011.[23] As a result of the CMP acquisition, Cumulus now owns a limited-partnership interest in San Francisco Baseball Associates LP, the owner of the San Francisco Giants baseball club.[24]
In July 2010, Cumulus publicly announced formation of a similar venture with Crestview Partners to acquire up to $1 billion of additional radio assets.[25]
In July 2007, the company announced its intention to "go private",[26] however on May 11, 2008, the company announced it was unable to come to terms with the parties involved and the merger/acquisition agreement was terminated.[27]
Like most major American radio station owners, Cumulus has been forced to write down the value of its radio station licenses, resulting in large non-cash losses - $498.9 million in 2008, $230.6 million in 2007, and $63.4 million in 2006.
The company's stock, priced over $56 in 1999,[28] then over $22 in 2004, was as low as $0.45 per share toward the end of 2008.[29][30]
Acquisition of Citadel Broadcasting and Dial Global[edit]
Starting in June 2010, Cumulus made multiple unsuccessful offers to buy out Citadel Broadcasting after its emergence from bankruptcy.[31] In February 2011, Cumulus was again said to be in "exclusive negotiations" to acquire Citadel for $2.5 billion paid to Citadel shareholders, according to CNBC. Some Citadel shareholders were said to have been pushing the board to consider a sale.[32] On March 10, 2011, Citadel Broadcasting stations announced via email that Cumulus had purchased Citadel Broadcasting. Citadel was made up of 225 radio stations in over 50 markets, as well as Citadel Media, one of the largest radio networks in the United States. The deal was finalized on September 16, 2011, after acceptance by the FCC and Citadel's shareholders.[33] As part of the deal, Cumulus Media will have to place 14 stations into a separate trust to comply with ownership limits.[34] Following the acquisition, in an effort to focus on larger markets, Cumulus reached a deal with Townsquare Media to swap 65 radio stations in 13 markets, with the majority of the 65 stations being sold to Townsquare.[35]
On August 29, 2013, it was reported by The Wall Street Journal that Cumulus would purchase the syndicator Dial Global for $260 million. To fund the sale, Cumulus, sold 53 more stations to Townsquare Media for $238 million, in markets such as Danbury, CT, Rockford, IL, Cedar Rapids, IA, Quad Cities IA/IL, Waterloo, IA, Portland, ME, Battle Creek, MI, Kalamazoo, MI, Lansing, MI, Faribault, MN, Rochester, MN, and Portsmouth, NH. Additionally, Townsquare Media acquired Peak Broadcasting, and Cumulus swapped 15 more stations in Dubuque, IA and Poughkeepsie, NY in exchange for Peak Broadcasting’s Fresno cluster.[36][37] The sale to Cumulus was completed on November 14, 2013.[38]
Launch of Nash, CNN partnership, and Rdio/iHeartRadio partnerships[edit]
On January 11, 2013, after acquiring the station from Family Radio, Cumulus re-launched WFME in New York City as a country music station under its new Nash FM brand. Nash was designed to serve as an umbrella brand for all country music-related content across the company's properties, including radio, digital, and live events such as the "Nash Bash". All country stations owned by Cumulus would either be branded as Nash FM, or be strongly cross-promoted as part of the Nash family of properties.[39][40]
In July 2014, Cumulus announced that it would end its partnership with ABC News Radio, and enter into a new partnership with CNN to syndicate news content for its stations through Westwood One beginning in 2015. The network will provide its content on a white label basis, allowing individual stations to use their own brands for the content. In turn, ABC announced that it would take the syndication of its radio content in-house, with distribution handled by Skyview Networks.[41][42]
On September 15, 2013, Cumulus announced that it had entered into a partnership with music streaming service Rdio; Cumulus took a stake in Rdio, and provided the company with access to its advertising sales team for a freemium tier, the ability to offer Cumulus radio stations on the Rdio service, and $75 million in marketing on Cumulus stations over five years. The stations launched on Rdio in August 2015; prior to the deal, Cumulus partnered with the competing iHeartRadio service.[43][44] This only lasted a few months however, as Rdio entered bankruptcy in November 2015 and sold most of their assets to Pandora, with Rdio ending operations the next month. Cumulus maintains their stations on iHeartRadio to the present day.
FCC actions[edit]
On December 30, 2008, Cumulus Media was issued a $14,000 Notice of Apparent Liability by the Federal Communications Commission related to the stations in the Macon, Georgia, cluster. The FCC says Cumulus failed to comply with its record-keeping requirements and its Equal Employment Opportunity rules on information on recruitment sources. Cumulus, along with two other companies, had 30 days to pay or file a statement asking for reduction or cancellation of the forfeitures.[45]
Restatement[edit]
On March 17, 2000, the company was forced to restate revenue and broadcast cash flow for three quarters of 1999 after discovering that some of its sales force had prematurely booked revenue to meet sales goals.[46] On November 8, 2005, Company decided to amend and restate its results for the second quarter of 2005.[47]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
