Testimonials“My son had a car accident almost 20 years ago and Health Care Associates has been there for us the entire time. I couldn’t imagine going through this without their help. Thank you HCA for the support, care, and love you have shown us through these years.” – Randell T.
 

“My parents were in need of transportation for doctors appointments and after a few harrowing incidents with other providers, we were told about HCAT and decided to give them a try. The difference was heartwarming. The drivers took such good care of my parents, as if they were taking care of their own parents.” – Katie M.
 
“Community Care Givers provided services for my family member diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. Their psych. nurse was fantastic in getting us information and helping us deal with the doctor to try reduce the progression. They were such a huge help to us!” – Jamie S.
 

“Every one who answers the phone, to the people around the office, to the caregivers who come to our home and care for our son are 100% committed to giving the best care and service… always with a smile and kind words, and always professional. They are a joy to work with.” – Betty J.
