What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.              
              
            

1:42 p.m. July 19, 2017






Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar turns lower for the week following GDP report

				1. Please see your applicable Wells Fargo account agreement and card terms and conditions for information on liability for unauthorized transactions. 2. 10 or more purchases/payments with your Wells Fargo Debit Card each fee period required to avoid the $10 Everyday Checking account monthly service fee. - Included: Debit card purchases include PIN, signature, online and phone purchases that post during the fee period. Debit card payments include one-time and recurring payments of bills made with your debit card that post during the fee period. - Not Included: Any transaction at an ATM (Wells Fargo or non-Wells Fargo) and ACH (Automated Clearing House) transactions. Debit card purchases and debit card payments must post during the fee period to be counted toward the total of 10 or more. The dates of your fee period are located in the “Monthly service fee summary” section of your statement. Transactions received after the applicable cut-off time or on a non-business day (Saturday, Sunday and federal holidays) are posted on the next business day. 3. A qualifying direct deposit is a direct deposit of your salary, pension, Social Security, or other regular monthly income electronically deposited to this checking account by your employer or an outside agency. Transfers from one account to another, or deposits made at a banking location or ATM, do not qualify as a direct deposit. 4. If the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program is terminated, the bonus interest rate on all eligible savings accounts, and discounts or fee waivers on other products and services will discontinue and revert to the Bank's then- current applicable rate or fee.  For bonus interest rates on time accounts, this change will occur upon renewal. If the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program is terminated, the remaining unlinked Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking or Wells Fargo Prime Checking account will be converted to another checking product or closed. 5.  Subject to credit qualification. To qualify for a customer relationship discount, you may be required to maintain a qualifying Wells Fargo consumer checking account and make automatic payments from a Wells Fargo deposit account—if automatic payments are required but not selected, or are canceled for any reason at any time after account opening, the interest rate and the corresponding monthly payment may increase. To learn which accounts qualify for the discount, please consult a Wells Fargo banker. 6. The Portfolio by Wells Fargo program has a $30 monthly service fee, which can be avoided when you have one of the following Portfolio by Wells Fargo qualifying balances: $25,000 or more in qualifying linked bank deposits (checking, savings, time accounts (CDs), FDIC insured IRAs), OR $50,000 or more in qualifying linked bank, brokerage (available through our brokerage affiliate Wells Fargo Advisors®) and credit balances (including 10% of mortgage balances, certain mortgages not eligible). 7. Subject to applicable transfer or advance fees. 8. Benefits apply only to the primary Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking account within the Portfolio by Wells Fargo. 9. Surcharge fees imposed by non-Wells Fargo ATM owners or operators may apply. For the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program, Wells Fargo will waive its own ATM access fee (U.S. and international) when you withdraw cash from a non-Wells Fargo ATM from your primary checking account within the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program. Where Portfolio by Wells Fargo qualifying balances are $250,000 or more, you will be reimbursed for all surcharge fees on non-Wells Fargo ATM withdrawals located in the U.S., and receive reimbursement for up to 5 surcharge fees imposed by non-Wells Fargo ATM owners or operators per monthly fee period if you use a non-Wells Fargo ATM to make a cash withdrawal at an ATM located outside of the U.S. 10. No fee for Wells Fargo personal checks — except desk checks or home office style (3-on-a-page). Check discounts apply only to the primary Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking account.
