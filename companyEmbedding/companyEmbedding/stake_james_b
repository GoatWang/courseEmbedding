De YoungWND Digital Edition also available here.Product DescriptionMillions have bought into the theology of Paul Young, whose book, "The Shack," portrays God as a loving black woman. Similar changes in appearance were given to Jesus and the Holy Spirit. The story of pain and redemption then resonated with the public.But is Young's worldview important? Is his theology that big a deal?James De Young thinks so. In fact, it's so important that he's written a compelling book challenge to "The Shack." In "Burning Down 'The Shack,'" De Young manages to shed important light on the implications of Young's pluralistic faith and provides readers with a gripping counterbalance to the popular little volume that's spent many weeks on the bestseller lists. Exploring the nature and character of God from Scripture, De Young concludes that it is necessary to proceed carefully with "The Shack," lest important truths be skewed and even jettisoned. Without being confrontational, De Young makes the case that dangers can lurk under the foundation.About the AuthorJames B. De Young is professor of New Testament Language and Literature at Western Seminary, Portland, Ore., where he has taught for 34 years seeking to extend Christian values to the community of Portland. He has served as chairman of the Hermeneutics section within the Evangelical Theological Society and he's published several books.Product DetailsPaperback: 288 pages Publisher: WND Books (June 2010) Language: English ISBN: 9781935071846 Product Dimensions: 5 x 7.75 Reviews  (0) No Reviews yetBack Ratings & ReviewsNo reviews availableBe the first to Write a Review You may also like  "O" God: A Dialogue on Truth and Oprah's Spirituality (Paperback)  $7.50    Nothing Created Everything (Hardcover)  $23.36    Burning Down The Shack: How the 'Christian' Bestseller is Deceiving Millions (e-book)  $9.99    Customers who bought this item also bought  From Crayons to Condoms: The Ugly Truth About America's Public Schools (Hardcover)  $0.99    A Question of Eligibility: Is Obama's Presidency Constitutionally Legitimate?
