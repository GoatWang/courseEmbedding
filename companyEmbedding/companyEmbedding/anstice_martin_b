This Martin V-belt drive sheave with an A/B belt section is made of 30 gray cast iron and comes with one groove. It is a classical V-belt sheave that fits a variety of widely available, classical profile V-belts suitable for use in many existing power transmission drives.

Typically made of cast iron, the pulleys and the V-belts that loop around them match in form – wide (classical) or narrow, single or multi-grooved. V-belt pulleys are found in drive designs in the agriculture, textile, printing, mining, and office equipment industries.Martin Sprocket & Gear manufactures power transmission and conveying products.
