Construction Site Procedures - Greater Bay Area Environmental


















































HomeOur ServicesSWPPPConstruction Site ProceduresContact UsSWPPP Reports






















Construction Site Procedures for Contractors
COMMON ACTIVITIES OF CONCERN: Equipment Cleaning Equipment must be cleaned in a manner that does not create any discharge of cleaning agents, paints, oil or other pollutants to a storm sewer or waterway. Soaps and detergents must never be discharged to the ground or off-site. When rinsing painting equipment outside, rinse water must be contained in a bucket or other container. Water based or latex paint rinse water may be discharged to the sanitary sewer. Oil-based paint wastes, including solvents and thinners, must not be disposed of in the sanitary sewer; they must be collected and disposed of through the contractor's disposal company in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Cement handling equipment must be rinsed in a contained concrete washout area installed in an area of minimal slope and there must be no drainage off-site. Pressure Washing Discharges from pressure washing must not be allowed to enter a storm sewer or waterway. Consider vacuuming up the water or berming the process water and allowing it to evaporate. If the rinsate only contains water and dirt/sediment it may be discharged to a vegetated area with prior permission from Greater Bay Area Environmental and provided the area is large enough to accept the discharge and not enter a storm sewer or waterway. Depending on the content of the material it may also be possible to discharge to a sanitary sewer with prior permission from Greater Bay Area Environmental (Permission to discharge to sanitary sewer may take up to seven working days.) Waste Disposal Any trash or debris must be contained on site and disposed of in a recycling bin or waste receptacle in accordance with applicable laws and regulations to prevent wind or rain from carrying it off-site into a storm drain or waterway. Petroleum wastes, such as waste oil and used oil filters, must be containerized for recycling or disposal by the contractor. Non-hazardous solid wastes, such as general construction debris may be recycled or disposed of in the trash container. Never dispose of liquid wastes of any kind in dumpsters.Sediment Proper erosion and sedimentation controls must be in place prior to any construction activity to prevent sediment or silt run-off. Sediment (including cement) should never be rinsed off the site; instead it must be cleaned up using dry cleanup methods or in a manner that does not allow any material to reach a storm drain or waterway. Equipment tires should be rinsed before leaving the site if necessary to avoid tracking sediment into the roadway or off the site. All erosion and sediment controls are to be maintained throughout the duration of the construction and maintained until all areas are stabilized. Site Dewatering, Tank, & Pipe Testing Discharges from dewatering, water or fire line testing, hydrostatic tank testing or pipe pressure testing must be free from sediment, chemicals, and any other pollutants. Greater Bay Area Environmental shall be notified prior to dewatering and/or discharging. Petroleum Spills of hydraulic fluid, oil and other petroleum products must always be immediately cleaned up to prevent discharge of these fluids with stormwater run-off. Petroleum contaminated soil must be cleaned up and disposed of properly in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Storage containers must be kept closed, clean and free of oily residue. Containers over 250 gallons (including mobile tanks) must be stored inside secondary containment. Temporary Storage Tanks SEMI-PERMANENT INSTALLATION - tanks must either be 2-hour fire rated (will carry a designation of UL-2085 & are double walled) or be internal to a liquid tight concrete vault. TEMPORARY/CONSTRUCTION SITE USE – Must be located in a bermed containment area. In this case, the tank must be installed/located as follows: ·         The berm should be about 3 feet out in all directions from tanks. ·         The height of the berm must contain the maximum contents of the largest tank + 8 inches –this almost always equates to about a 10 inch tall berm. ·         First lay down 2 inches of sand, then water tight barrier (should be minimum 6 mil plastic or rubber), buildup 10-inch berm height with dirt or whatever, lap barrier over berm and weight down with more dirt, put 2 inches of sand in bottom over barrier. ·         Storage tanks must be 50 feet from nearest building and property lines. ·         It is best to use tanks on skids with pumps (pumps must be UL rated for fuels). ·         If using the "tower" or gravity feed type setup, the containment must be wide enough that if either tank falls to the side it will entirely land inside of containment. There must also be a fusible link at the valve that will shut off flow to hose in the event of a fire.   SPILL PREVENTION, CLEAN-UP, AND DISPOSAL Be prepared to contain spills to prevent spreading. Small areas are easier to clean than large ones. Spill kits are recommended to be kept on hand by anyone working on exterior projects. Spill cleanup materials recommended to be kept on hand may include; sorbent materials such as clay (kitty litter), polypropylene booms and pads, rags and sawdust to contain spills immediately. Clean-Up Sorbent materials can be used to effectively clean-up various materials spilled on pavement, water and soil. Soil or other media which has been contaminated with petroleum or other pollutants must be excavated or remediated in accordance with applicable laws and regulations to prevent contaminated discharges to a storm drain or waterway. Excavated contaminated materials must be stored in containers or on plastic and covered so as to ensure that the contamination is not flushed back onto the ground during a rainstorm. Contaminated Material Disposal Proper disposal of waste materials depends partly on the type of contaminant. Hazardous wastes (such as flammable petroleum products and solvents, thinners) and materials contaminated with hazardous wastes are considered regulated wastes, and should be containerized for transport and disposal by a permitted company in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Disposal also depends on the amount of contaminant. Contact Greater Bay Area Environmental for assistance in the disposal required. CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES Contractors are solely responsible for cleaning up and properly disposing of all spilled pollutants brought to the site as part of the contractor's work, including oil, paint, fuels, antifreeze, solvents, etc. in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Contractor must keep accurate records (such as receipts, copies of analytical results, etc.) indicating proper disposal of spilled materials in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Furthermore, Contractor is responsible for ensuring that all discharges from the site are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. No substance may be dumped or leaked onto the ground or allowed to run-off of a construction site that might cause pollution. Be aware that the contractor is responsible for preventing pollutant contaminated run-off and proper disposal of all waste materials generated as a result of the contractor's activities. NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS AND PROCEDURES Greater Bay Area Environmental should be notified immediately in the event of: ·         Any spill that threatens to enter a storm sewer or watercourse. ·         All petroleum spills e.g. hydraulic fluid, transmission fluid, diesel, gasoline, etc. ·         Any hazardous or unknown material spill, e.g. many solvents, cleaners, etc. ·         Any discharge from your site which you suspect may be in violation of City Code, state regulations, or other applicable laws and regulations, e.g. discharges which are cloudy, foul smelling, colored, contain ·         chemicals or heavy sediment loads.

SWPPP - Greater Bay Area Environmental


















































HomeOur ServicesSWPPPConstruction Site ProceduresContact UsSWPPP Reports






















What is an SWPPP (Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan) and why is it needed?
What is an SWPPP and why is it needed?A SWPPP is a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan. In most States, it must be developed prior to any ground breaking activity and is required for both development and residential construction stages. SWPPPs are often required for permitting and the NOI (notice of intent). Many organizations have applied for permits without a SWPPP under the notion that the few paragraphs under the "Erosion Plan" on the construction plans will suffice. When signing the Notice of Intent (NOI), one is acknowledging creation of a SWPPP in States that require one. SWPPPs contains information on, among other items, vegetation, hazardous materials, endangered species, Best Management Practices (BMP), historical data, intended sequence of events, spill prevention program and wetlands. The SWPPP shall be amended whenever there is change in design, construction, operation or maintenance which has a significant effect on the potential for discharge of pollutants to surface waters of the state or a MS4 (Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System).The SWPPPs are kept on the job site to be referenced and amended as needed by the storm water professional inspector associated with weekly inspections, classification changes, and rain events.
What is CESSWI?CESSWI (Certified Erosion, Sediment and Storm Water Inspector) is a recognized specialist in soil erosion and sediment control. CESSWIs have educational training, demonstrated expertise, experience in controlling erosion and sedimentation, and meet certification standards.
What is an NOI/NOT?A few preventative and proactive steps go a long way in protecting our water and our clients. A NOI is a Notice of Intent and is basically the permit application required for NPDES.Generally, a NOI will suffice for the life of the project if for example, a builder both develops land and also constructs homes. It may be advisable for a builder/developer to create separate NOIs or Co-Permittee Agreements if, for example, they are only developing property or only constructing homes. Recall that the NOI usually requires that a SWPPP be created, a permit be filed and compliance with the permit be enacted (this includes inspections and use of BMPs). Alpha EMC prepares packets for our clients for NOIs and NOTs to assist in filing.
The NOT is the Notice of Termination signifying that the construction activity is completed. It illustrates the permittee has achieved final stabilization on all portions of responsible work. A NOT is also advisable when a new operator has assumed control on all areas of the site. An example, as mentioned earlier, would include the development of property that is sold to another group that will perform home construction only. The new operator would then apply for their own NOI.
What are the risks involved with non-compliance?Several entities are involved with compliance and enforcement. They include the EPA, State Regulators and Water Management Districts.Failure to comply may bring about warnings, reminders and penalties. In fact, the EPA may apply penalties up to $37,500 per violation per day with potential for retroactive application.Most penalties will not be that significant, however, that does not diminish the reality of non-compliance. Increasingly, companies are working through non-compliance issues that not only include the encumbrance of penalties but the cost of time and effort of internal and third parties.Non-compliance may come in several forms. (i.e. failure to apply for permit, failure to comply with permit instructions, failure to conduct weekly inspections with reports, lack of BMPs, and improper use of BMP's, etc.)It is not uncommon for Alpha Environmental Management Corporation to speak to parties whom "feel no risk" or may be indifferent only to receive a call weeks later hearing of a non-compliance issue.
What is NPDES?National Pollutant Discharge Elimination SystemPolluted stormwater runoff is a leading cause of impairment to the nearly 40 percent of surveyed U.S. water bodies which do not meet water quality standards. Over land or via storm sewer systems, polluted runoff is discharged, often untreated, directly into local water bodies. When left uncontrolled, this water pollution can result in the destruction of fish, wildlife, and aquatic life habitats; a loss in aesthetic value; and threats to public health due to contaminated food, drinking water supplies, and recreational waterways.Mandated by Congress under the Clean Water Act, the NPDES Storm Water Program is a comprehensive two-phased national program for addressing the non-agricultural sources of storm water discharges which adversely affect the quality of our nation's waters. The Program uses the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitting mechanism to require the implementation of controls designed to prevent harmful pollutants from being washed by storm water runoff into local water bodies.
Are Inspections Required?Depending on your state, inspections are usually required once every seven days and within twenty four hours of a rainfall greater than 0.5 inches in a twenty four hour period (blue sky to blue sky).The inspection requires several points to be monitored, recorded and logged as well as attached to the SWPPP (where required).A common error in inspections is leaving the work to non-certified or non-specialized entities that are not completely fulfilling all aspect of the inspections. This includes frequency, process, reporting and necessary follow-up.With well over several dozen items that must be evaluated, inspections are a critical component to the builder, which places a greater need for the appropriate personnel to support such measures.
What are BMPs?BMPs are Best Management Practices. They include schedule of activities, prohibition of practices, maintenance procedures and other management practices to prevent or reduce the discharge of pollutants to US waters. BMPs also include treatment requirements, operating procedures and practice to control plant site runoff, spillage, or leaks, sludge or waste disposal, or drainage from raw material storage.BMPs are required to be identified in the SWPPP when your state requires a SWPPP. Examples include: Silt Fencing, Vegetative Strips, Hydro-seeding, Mulching, etc.Where do we go from here?The days of indifference and lack of enforcement have come to an end. Most companies realize this when they find themselves in non-compliance. Others have "heard the news" and are actively working to create programs.When considering the scope of the situation, we believe there is an opportunity to maximize effectiveness with minimal strain. The facets of the process include NOIs, SWPPPs, inspections, NOTs, BMPs, compliance, agency interaction, education, program audits, consultation and proper reporting just to name a few.This is where Greater Bay Area Environmental brings value to our clients. As a single point of contact for the aforementioned issues, we become your partner in Erosion Control and Stormwater Management. 



Who needs a SWPPP (Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan)?
Any construction or demolition activity, including, but not limited to, clearing, grading, grubbing, or excavation, or any other activity that results in a land disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre.Construction activity that results in land surface disturbances of less than one acre if the construction activity is part of a larger common plan of development or the sale of one or more acres of disturbed land surface.Construction activity related to residential, commercial, or industrial development on lands currently used for agriculture including.
Sampling, Monitoring, Reporting and Record-Keeping
Visual monitoring of storm water and non-storm water discharges is required for all sites subject to this Construction General Permit.Records of all visual monitoring inspections are required to remain on-site during the construction period and for a minimum of three years.If run-on is caused by a forest fire or any other natural disaster, then receiving water monitoring triggers do not apply.For Risk Level 3 sites larger than 30 acres and with direct discharges to receiving waters, the Construction General Permit requires bioassessment sampling before and after site completion to determine if significant degradation to the receiving water’s biota has occurred. Bioassessment sampling guidelines are contained in this Construction General Permit.A summary and evaluation of the sampling and analysis results will be submitted in the Annual Reports.The Construction General Permit contains sampling, analysis and monitoring requirements for non-visible pollutants at all sites subject to this Construction General Permit.The Construction General Permit requires that all dischargers maintain a paper or electronic copy of all required records for three years from the date generated or date submitted, whichever is last.  These records must be available at the construction site until construction is completed.

SWPPP - Greater Bay Area Environmental


















































HomeOur ServicesSWPPPConstruction Site ProceduresContact UsSWPPP Reports






















What is an SWPPP (Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan) and why is it needed?
What is an SWPPP and why is it needed?A SWPPP is a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan. In most States, it must be developed prior to any ground breaking activity and is required for both development and residential construction stages. SWPPPs are often required for permitting and the NOI (notice of intent). Many organizations have applied for permits without a SWPPP under the notion that the few paragraphs under the "Erosion Plan" on the construction plans will suffice. When signing the Notice of Intent (NOI), one is acknowledging creation of a SWPPP in States that require one. SWPPPs contains information on, among other items, vegetation, hazardous materials, endangered species, Best Management Practices (BMP), historical data, intended sequence of events, spill prevention program and wetlands. The SWPPP shall be amended whenever there is change in design, construction, operation or maintenance which has a significant effect on the potential for discharge of pollutants to surface waters of the state or a MS4 (Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System).The SWPPPs are kept on the job site to be referenced and amended as needed by the storm water professional inspector associated with weekly inspections, classification changes, and rain events.
What is CESSWI?CESSWI (Certified Erosion, Sediment and Storm Water Inspector) is a recognized specialist in soil erosion and sediment control. CESSWIs have educational training, demonstrated expertise, experience in controlling erosion and sedimentation, and meet certification standards.
What is an NOI/NOT?A few preventative and proactive steps go a long way in protecting our water and our clients. A NOI is a Notice of Intent and is basically the permit application required for NPDES.Generally, a NOI will suffice for the life of the project if for example, a builder both develops land and also constructs homes. It may be advisable for a builder/developer to create separate NOIs or Co-Permittee Agreements if, for example, they are only developing property or only constructing homes. Recall that the NOI usually requires that a SWPPP be created, a permit be filed and compliance with the permit be enacted (this includes inspections and use of BMPs). Alpha EMC prepares packets for our clients for NOIs and NOTs to assist in filing.
The NOT is the Notice of Termination signifying that the construction activity is completed. It illustrates the permittee has achieved final stabilization on all portions of responsible work. A NOT is also advisable when a new operator has assumed control on all areas of the site. An example, as mentioned earlier, would include the development of property that is sold to another group that will perform home construction only. The new operator would then apply for their own NOI.
What are the risks involved with non-compliance?Several entities are involved with compliance and enforcement. They include the EPA, State Regulators and Water Management Districts.Failure to comply may bring about warnings, reminders and penalties. In fact, the EPA may apply penalties up to $37,500 per violation per day with potential for retroactive application.Most penalties will not be that significant, however, that does not diminish the reality of non-compliance. Increasingly, companies are working through non-compliance issues that not only include the encumbrance of penalties but the cost of time and effort of internal and third parties.Non-compliance may come in several forms. (i.e. failure to apply for permit, failure to comply with permit instructions, failure to conduct weekly inspections with reports, lack of BMPs, and improper use of BMP's, etc.)It is not uncommon for Alpha Environmental Management Corporation to speak to parties whom "feel no risk" or may be indifferent only to receive a call weeks later hearing of a non-compliance issue.
What is NPDES?National Pollutant Discharge Elimination SystemPolluted stormwater runoff is a leading cause of impairment to the nearly 40 percent of surveyed U.S. water bodies which do not meet water quality standards. Over land or via storm sewer systems, polluted runoff is discharged, often untreated, directly into local water bodies. When left uncontrolled, this water pollution can result in the destruction of fish, wildlife, and aquatic life habitats; a loss in aesthetic value; and threats to public health due to contaminated food, drinking water supplies, and recreational waterways.Mandated by Congress under the Clean Water Act, the NPDES Storm Water Program is a comprehensive two-phased national program for addressing the non-agricultural sources of storm water discharges which adversely affect the quality of our nation's waters. The Program uses the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitting mechanism to require the implementation of controls designed to prevent harmful pollutants from being washed by storm water runoff into local water bodies.
Are Inspections Required?Depending on your state, inspections are usually required once every seven days and within twenty four hours of a rainfall greater than 0.5 inches in a twenty four hour period (blue sky to blue sky).The inspection requires several points to be monitored, recorded and logged as well as attached to the SWPPP (where required).A common error in inspections is leaving the work to non-certified or non-specialized entities that are not completely fulfilling all aspect of the inspections. This includes frequency, process, reporting and necessary follow-up.With well over several dozen items that must be evaluated, inspections are a critical component to the builder, which places a greater need for the appropriate personnel to support such measures.
What are BMPs?BMPs are Best Management Practices. They include schedule of activities, prohibition of practices, maintenance procedures and other management practices to prevent or reduce the discharge of pollutants to US waters. BMPs also include treatment requirements, operating procedures and practice to control plant site runoff, spillage, or leaks, sludge or waste disposal, or drainage from raw material storage.BMPs are required to be identified in the SWPPP when your state requires a SWPPP. Examples include: Silt Fencing, Vegetative Strips, Hydro-seeding, Mulching, etc.Where do we go from here?The days of indifference and lack of enforcement have come to an end. Most companies realize this when they find themselves in non-compliance. Others have "heard the news" and are actively working to create programs.When considering the scope of the situation, we believe there is an opportunity to maximize effectiveness with minimal strain. The facets of the process include NOIs, SWPPPs, inspections, NOTs, BMPs, compliance, agency interaction, education, program audits, consultation and proper reporting just to name a few.This is where Greater Bay Area Environmental brings value to our clients. As a single point of contact for the aforementioned issues, we become your partner in Erosion Control and Stormwater Management. 



Who needs a SWPPP (Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan)?
Any construction or demolition activity, including, but not limited to, clearing, grading, grubbing, or excavation, or any other activity that results in a land disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre.Construction activity that results in land surface disturbances of less than one acre if the construction activity is part of a larger common plan of development or the sale of one or more acres of disturbed land surface.Construction activity related to residential, commercial, or industrial development on lands currently used for agriculture including.
Sampling, Monitoring, Reporting and Record-Keeping
Visual monitoring of storm water and non-storm water discharges is required for all sites subject to this Construction General Permit.Records of all visual monitoring inspections are required to remain on-site during the construction period and for a minimum of three years.If run-on is caused by a forest fire or any other natural disaster, then receiving water monitoring triggers do not apply.For Risk Level 3 sites larger than 30 acres and with direct discharges to receiving waters, the Construction General Permit requires bioassessment sampling before and after site completion to determine if significant degradation to the receiving water’s biota has occurred.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Construction Site Procedures - Greater Bay Area Environmental


















































HomeOur ServicesSWPPPConstruction Site ProceduresContact UsSWPPP Reports






















Construction Site Procedures for Contractors
COMMON ACTIVITIES OF CONCERN: Equipment Cleaning Equipment must be cleaned in a manner that does not create any discharge of cleaning agents, paints, oil or other pollutants to a storm sewer or waterway. Soaps and detergents must never be discharged to the ground or off-site. When rinsing painting equipment outside, rinse water must be contained in a bucket or other container. Water based or latex paint rinse water may be discharged to the sanitary sewer. Oil-based paint wastes, including solvents and thinners, must not be disposed of in the sanitary sewer; they must be collected and disposed of through the contractor's disposal company in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Cement handling equipment must be rinsed in a contained concrete washout area installed in an area of minimal slope and there must be no drainage off-site. Pressure Washing Discharges from pressure washing must not be allowed to enter a storm sewer or waterway. Consider vacuuming up the water or berming the process water and allowing it to evaporate. If the rinsate only contains water and dirt/sediment it may be discharged to a vegetated area with prior permission from Greater Bay Area Environmental and provided the area is large enough to accept the discharge and not enter a storm sewer or waterway. Depending on the content of the material it may also be possible to discharge to a sanitary sewer with prior permission from Greater Bay Area Environmental (Permission to discharge to sanitary sewer may take up to seven working days.) Waste Disposal Any trash or debris must be contained on site and disposed of in a recycling bin or waste receptacle in accordance with applicable laws and regulations to prevent wind or rain from carrying it off-site into a storm drain or waterway. Petroleum wastes, such as waste oil and used oil filters, must be containerized for recycling or disposal by the contractor. Non-hazardous solid wastes, such as general construction debris may be recycled or disposed of in the trash container. Never dispose of liquid wastes of any kind in dumpsters.Sediment Proper erosion and sedimentation controls must be in place prior to any construction activity to prevent sediment or silt run-off. Sediment (including cement) should never be rinsed off the site; instead it must be cleaned up using dry cleanup methods or in a manner that does not allow any material to reach a storm drain or waterway. Equipment tires should be rinsed before leaving the site if necessary to avoid tracking sediment into the roadway or off the site. All erosion and sediment controls are to be maintained throughout the duration of the construction and maintained until all areas are stabilized. Site Dewatering, Tank, & Pipe Testing Discharges from dewatering, water or fire line testing, hydrostatic tank testing or pipe pressure testing must be free from sediment, chemicals, and any other pollutants. Greater Bay Area Environmental shall be notified prior to dewatering and/or discharging. Petroleum Spills of hydraulic fluid, oil and other petroleum products must always be immediately cleaned up to prevent discharge of these fluids with stormwater run-off. Petroleum contaminated soil must be cleaned up and disposed of properly in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Storage containers must be kept closed, clean and free of oily residue. Containers over 250 gallons (including mobile tanks) must be stored inside secondary containment. Temporary Storage Tanks SEMI-PERMANENT INSTALLATION - tanks must either be 2-hour fire rated (will carry a designation of UL-2085 & are double walled) or be internal to a liquid tight concrete vault. TEMPORARY/CONSTRUCTION SITE USE – Must be located in a bermed containment area. In this case, the tank must be installed/located as follows: ·         The berm should be about 3 feet out in all directions from tanks. ·         The height of the berm must contain the maximum contents of the largest tank + 8 inches –this almost always equates to about a 10 inch tall berm. ·         First lay down 2 inches of sand, then water tight barrier (should be minimum 6 mil plastic or rubber), buildup 10-inch berm height with dirt or whatever, lap barrier over berm and weight down with more dirt, put 2 inches of sand in bottom over barrier. ·         Storage tanks must be 50 feet from nearest building and property lines. ·         It is best to use tanks on skids with pumps (pumps must be UL rated for fuels). ·         If using the "tower" or gravity feed type setup, the containment must be wide enough that if either tank falls to the side it will entirely land inside of containment. There must also be a fusible link at the valve that will shut off flow to hose in the event of a fire.   SPILL PREVENTION, CLEAN-UP, AND DISPOSAL Be prepared to contain spills to prevent spreading. Small areas are easier to clean than large ones. Spill kits are recommended to be kept on hand by anyone working on exterior projects. Spill cleanup materials recommended to be kept on hand may include; sorbent materials such as clay (kitty litter), polypropylene booms and pads, rags and sawdust to contain spills immediately. Clean-Up Sorbent materials can be used to effectively clean-up various materials spilled on pavement, water and soil. Soil or other media which has been contaminated with petroleum or other pollutants must be excavated or remediated in accordance with applicable laws and regulations to prevent contaminated discharges to a storm drain or waterway. Excavated contaminated materials must be stored in containers or on plastic and covered so as to ensure that the contamination is not flushed back onto the ground during a rainstorm. Contaminated Material Disposal Proper disposal of waste materials depends partly on the type of contaminant. Hazardous wastes (such as flammable petroleum products and solvents, thinners) and materials contaminated with hazardous wastes are considered regulated wastes, and should be containerized for transport and disposal by a permitted company in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Disposal also depends on the amount of contaminant. Contact Greater Bay Area Environmental for assistance in the disposal required. CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES Contractors are solely responsible for cleaning up and properly disposing of all spilled pollutants brought to the site as part of the contractor's work, including oil, paint, fuels, antifreeze, solvents, etc. in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Contractor must keep accurate records (such as receipts, copies of analytical results, etc.) indicating proper disposal of spilled materials in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Furthermore, Contractor is responsible for ensuring that all discharges from the site are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. No substance may be dumped or leaked onto the ground or allowed to run-off of a construction site that might cause pollution. Be aware that the contractor is responsible for preventing pollutant contaminated run-off and proper disposal of all waste materials generated as a result of the contractor's activities. NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS AND PROCEDURES Greater Bay Area Environmental should be notified immediately in the event of: ·         Any spill that threatens to enter a storm sewer or watercourse. ·         All petroleum spills e.g. hydraulic fluid, transmission fluid, diesel, gasoline, etc. ·         Any hazardous or unknown material spill, e.g. many solvents, cleaners, etc. ·         Any discharge from your site which you suspect may be in violation of City Code, state regulations, or other applicable laws and regulations, e.g. discharges which are cloudy, foul smelling, colored, contain ·         chemicals or heavy sediment loads.
