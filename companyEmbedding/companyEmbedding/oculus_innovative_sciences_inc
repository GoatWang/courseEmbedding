Oculus Innovative Sciences Receives FDA Clearance for Novel Atopic Dermatitis Dermatology Product



PETALUMA, Calif., June 8, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Oculus Innovative Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq:OCLS), a specialty pharmaceutical company that develops and markets solutions for the treatment of dermatological conditions and advanced tissue care, today announced that it has received a new 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the company's new Alevicyn SG Antipruritic Spray Gel with both prescription and over-the-counter indications. Produced using the patented Microcyn® Technology, The Alevicyn SG prescription product, under the supervision of a healthcare professional, is indicated to manage and relieve the burning, itching and pain experienced with various types of dermatoses, including radiation 
dermatitis and atopic dermatitis. It may also be used to relieve the pain of first- and second-degree burns and helps to relieve dry waxy skin by maintaining a moist wound and skin environment, which is beneficial to the healing process.


 In the United States, Alevicyn SG will launch in July 2015, via Oculus' direct dermatology sales force. Outside the United States, Oculus is working with its international distributors and partners to bring this novel technology to dermatology patients around the world.


 In tandem with the prescription clearance, the Alevicyn SG Antipruritic Spray Gel has also been cleared for over-the-counter use in the United States. In this use, it is intended to relieve the burning and itching associated with many common types of skin irritation, lacerations, abrasions, and minor burns and is also indicated for the management of irritation and pain from minor burns, including sunburn. For more information, visit www.intraderm.com.

About Atopic Dermatitis


 In a 2009 GlobalData study, it was estimated the global atopic dermatitis therapeutics market delivered revenues of $643 million in 2009. It is expected to grow to $810 million at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 3.4% by 2016. Globally, the United States remains the largest market for atopic dermatitis therapeutics, and generated revenue of $402 million in 2009. It is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 3.8% over the next seven years to reach $582 million by 2016.


 Symptoms of atopic dermatitis are characterized by itchy skin, which can lead to rash, redness, swelling, crusting and scaling. The disease affects up to 20 percent of infants and young children, who continue to have symptoms as adults with significant impact on their quality of life. The exact cause is unknown, but genetics are considered a key factor.

Topical corticosteroids (such as hydrocortisone, betamethasone, and fluticasone) are the most common treatment for atopic dermatitis. As eczema tends to be persistent, most people will have to use topical steroids on and off for many years. If used continuously, topical steroids may 
lose their effectiveness after a few weeks. This is known as tachyphylaxis.

Oculus Innovative Sciences Reports Financial Results for the First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2016





U.S. dermatology and Latin American sales drive 37% product revenue growth 

FDA 510k clearance for treatment of atopic dermatitis with a unique "no touch" spray gel 

Cash as of June 30, 2015 of $8.8 million and debt free 


Conference call begins at 4:30 p.m. EDT today

PETALUMA, Calif., July 30, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Oculus Innovative Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:OCLS) (tradable warrants OCLSW) today announced financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, which ended on June 30, 2015. Total revenue was $3.7 million for the first quarter, up 8%, when compared to $3.4 million for the same period in fiscal year 2015. Product revenues were up 37% from the same period last year, led by increases in the United States and Mexico.


 "In late 2014, after making a strategic decision to enter the dermatology market directly, we deployed a direct U.S. sales force and launched four prescription dermatology products. We are pleased to see that the benefits of expanding our presence in the dermatology market, with its strong pricing reimbursement and quick sales ramps, has resulted in significant sales growth in the United States over the last six months," said Oculus' CEO Jim Schutz. "We believe the growth in dermatology sales will continue as we launch new products, grow our existing product lines and hire additional sales people."

Results for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2015


 Product revenues in the United States were $787,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2015, as compared to $355,000 in the quarter ended June 30, 2014. Product revenues were up $432,000, or 122%, from the same period last year due to higher sales in dermatology and acute care products. In the quarter ending December 2014, Oculus deployed a direct sales force focused on dermatology, which has launched four new dermatology products for the treatment of atopic dermatitis, scars and surgical procedures.


 Product revenue in Mexico of $1.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015, increased by $465,000, or 43%, when compared to the same period in the prior year. On a local currency basis, product revenue growth was 68% compared to the same period last year. This growth in sales is primarily due to the much larger sales force and distribution network of our new partner, Laboratorios Sanfer, which acquired our former Latin American partner, More Pharma, in January 2015.


 Product revenue in Europe and the Rest of the World for the quarter ended June 30, 2015, decreased by $102,000, or 15%, to $571,000 as compared to the same period in the prior year, with decreases in Europe, Middle East, Singapore and India. The decrease in Europe is the result of the 23% decline in the euro with a local currency growth of 16% for the quarter. Sales to the Middle East tend to be inconsistent.


 For the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, product licensing fees and royalties revenues were $447,000 and $1,049,000, respectively. The decrease is primarily related to the termination of Oculus' agreement with its former animal health care partner.


 Oculus reported gross profit related to the company's products of $1.9 million, or 55%, of product related revenues, during the three months ended June 30, 2015, compared to a gross profit of $1.9 million, or 58%, of total product related revenues, for the same period in the prior year. Product licensing fees and royalties revenues are included in the calculation of gross profit for the quarters ended June 30, 2015 and 2014.


 Total operating expenses of $4.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015, increased by $764,000, or 22%, as compared to the same period in the prior year. Operating expenses minus non-cash expenses during the first quarter of fiscal year 2015 were $3.7 million, up $687,000, as compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in operating expenses, minus non-cash expenses, was due to higher sales and marketing expenses in the United States with 1) additional salaries for the direct sales force in dermatology, 2) higher new product development expenses for dermatology of $125,000, and 3) a banker fee of $165,000 for the sale of Ruthigen shares. These increases were partly offset by slightly lower expenses in 
Mexico and Europe.


 Net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2015, was $2.3 million, compared to net loss of $70,000 for the same period in the prior year. The higher net loss was due to a $1.5 million gain due to a change in the fair value of derivative liabilities recognized for the three months ended June 30, 2014, and an increase in sales and marketing costs in the United States for the three months ended June 30, 2015, as compared to the same period in the prior year.


 As of June 30, 2015, Oculus had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $8.8 million, as compared with $6.1 million as of March 31, 2015. The company has no material debt outstanding.

Oculus Innovative Sciences Reports Financial
Results for Fiscal Year 2016 and Fourth Quarter Ending March 31, 2016
 
Product Revenue for Fiscal
Year 2016 Grew 31% Led by Growth in U.S. Dermatology
 
Conference Call Begins at 4:30pm
EDT Today
 
 
PETALUMA, Calif.—(June 16, 2016)—Oculus Innovative
Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ: OCLS, warrants OCLSW), a specialty pharmaceutical company that develops and markets unique and effective
solutions for the treatment of dermatological conditions and advanced tissue care, today announced financial results for the fourth
quarter and fiscal year 2016 ended March 31, 2016.
 
Total revenues of $15.1 million increased by $1.2 million, or
9%, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, as compared to $13.9 million for the twelve months ended March 31, 2015. Product
revenue of $13.0 million increased $3.1 million, or 31%, when compared to the same period in 2015. This increase was the result
of strong product revenue growth in the United States of $2.4 million, or 121%, and Europe and rest of world of $798,000, or 27%,
partially offset by a 2% decrease in Latin America due in large part to the decline in the value of the peso against the U.S. dollar.
 
“In late 2014, we announced our strategic decision to
focus on the U.S. dermatology market with our own dedicated, direct sales force. Starting from a zero base line, we have built
a strong foundation in the dermatology market including hiring an experienced direct dermatology sales team of over 20 people and
launching seven new products with a cumulative 33,100 prescriptions filled.  With this foundation, we are more confident than
ever that our plan is bearing fruit and will result in continued and sustainable growth in the dermatology market,” said
Oculus CEO Jim Schutz.  “Regarding the rest of world, revenue growth in Latin America this past quarter fell from normal
ranges due to a decline of the Mexican peso and our partner’s consolidation of their warehouses, causing a quarterly reduction
in units sold.”


Results for the Twelve Months Ended March 31, 2016
Oculus reported gross profit of $7.2 million,
or 48% of revenue, for the twelve months ended March 31, 2016, compared to a gross profit of $7.3 million, or 53% of revenue, for
the same period in the prior year. The decrease in overall gross profit was caused by a decline in license and royalty revenues,
which had higher margins than the product revenue. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2016, Oculus reported product gross profit
of $6.0 million, or 46%, compared to product gross profit of $4.0 million, or 41%, for the same period in the prior year. The increase
in product gross profit was primarily related to improved margins in the United States as a result of the launch of higher margin
dermatology products.
 
Total operating expenses less non-cash expenses increased $3.0
million, or 24%, for the twelve months compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher costs for the dermatology
sales force. Operating loss less non-cash expenses (EBITDAS) for the twelve months ended March 31, 2016, was $7.9 million, compared
to $4.6 million for the same period last year. The net loss for the twelve months ended March 31, 2015, includes non-cash impairment
losses related to an investment in Ruthigen of $4.7 million, partly offset by a non-cash gain of $3.2 million related to a reduction
in Oculus’ derivative liability relating to certain warrants reported in the same period.
 
Results for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2016
Total revenue was $3.5 million for the fourth quarter, a decrease
of 11%, when compared to $4.0 million for the same period in 2015, due mostly to a decline in royalty and licensing fees. Product
revenues were flat when compared to the same period last year, with an increase in U.S. revenue due to strong growth in dermatology
sales, offset by a decrease in revenue from Latin America due to the decline in the peso, a very robust sales quarter last year
in Mexico and a warehouse consolidation by our distributor.
 
Product revenue in the United States was $1.4 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2016, as compared to $623,000 in the quarter ended March 31, 2015. Product revenues increased $765,000
or 123%. Sales increased primarily due to continued growth in six existing products for the treatment of atopic
dermatitis, scar management, surgical procedures, an oral anti-infective for severe acne and the launch of Ceramax, which utilizes
a “state of the art” skin repair technology. In addition, sales to a new farm and ranch animal health partner increased
during the quarter compared to last year.

Product revenue in Europe and the rest
of the world for the quarter ended March 31, 2016, of $981,000, increased by $49,000, or 5%, as compared to the same period in
the prior year, with increases in Asia and Europe, mostly offset by a decline in the Middle East.
 
Product revenue in Latin America for the quarter ended March
31, 2016, was $880,000, a decrease of $833,000, or 49%, when compared to the same period in the prior year. This decrease was caused
by a 22% decline in the value of the peso from the same period in prior year along with very robust sales in the March quarter
of 2015. The fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 also included stocking by Oculus’ new Latin American partner Sanfer to fill
their expansive pharmacy store network. In addition, there was a decline in local currency sales in the quarter ended March 31,
2016, as a result of warehouse consolidations. During the quarter, ended March 31, 2016, Sanfer closed a number of the former More
Pharma warehouses, reducing the need for new product units. 
 
For the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, product
licensing fees and royalty revenues were $75,000 and $455,000, respectively. The decrease is primarily related to the lower amortization
of upfront payments from the company’s partner, Sanfer, in Latin America.
 
Oculus reported gross profit of $1.7 million, or 49% of revenue,
during the three months ended March 31, 2016, compared to a gross profit of $2.0 million, or 50% of revenue when compared to the
same period in the prior year. The gross profit was down slightly compared to last year due to the reduction in higher margined
products, license fees and royalties revenue of $380,000, related mostly to our agreement with Sanfer.
 
Total operating expenses of $4.6 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2016, increased by $940,000, or 26%, as compared to the same period in the prior year. Operating expenses minus
non-cash expenses during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 were $4.1 million, up $850,000, as compared to the same period
in the prior year. The increase in operating expenses, minus non-cash expenses, was due to mostly higher sales and marketing expenses
in the United States related to the costs of Oculus’ direct sales force in dermatology.
 
Net loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2016, was $2.9 million,
an increase of $1.4 million, as compared to net loss of $1.5 million for the same period in the prior year.
  
As of March 31, 2016, Oculus had unrestricted cash and cash
equivalents of $7.5 million, as compared with $6.1 million as of March 31, 2015. The company has no debt outstanding.

(1)Loss from operations minus non-cash expenses (EBITDAS) is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company
defines operating loss minus non-cash expenses as GAAP reported operating loss minus operating depreciation and amortization, and
operating stock-based compensation. The Company uses this measure for the purpose of modifying the operating loss to reflect direct
cash related transactions during the measurement period.

(2)Net loss minus non-cash expenses is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company defines net loss
minus non-cash expenses as GAAP reported net loss minus depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, a change in fair
value of common stock, a change in the fair value of derivative instruments, loss on impairment of investment, and non-cash interest
expense. The Company uses this measure for the purpose of modifying the net loss to reflect only those expenses to reflect direct
cash transactions during the measurement period.

(3)Operating expenses minus non-cash expenses is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company defines
operating expenses minus non-cash expenses as GAAP reported operating expenses minus operating depreciation and amortization, and
operating stock-based compensation. The Company uses this measure for the purpose of identifying total operating expenses involving
cash transactions during the measurement period.
