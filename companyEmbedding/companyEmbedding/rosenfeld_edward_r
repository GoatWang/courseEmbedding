Good day, and welcome to the Steve Madden Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.
At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jean Fontana of ICR. You may begin.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Ed Rosenfeld, Chairman and CEO of Steve Madden.
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Steven Madden Ltd.
Thanks, Jean. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review Steve Madden's fourth quarter and full-year 2016 results. With me to discuss the business is Derek Browe, the company's Director of Finance and Investor Relations.
We ended the year on a good note, delivering fourth-quarter EPS at the high end of our guidance range. While consolidated sales for the quarter declined modestly from last year's fourth quarter, due primarily from softness in our private label footwear and cold-weather accessories businesses. We had another quarter of outstanding growth in our Steve Madden Women's wholesale footwear division.
We also achieved strong gross margin improvement as our on-trend product assortments and robust sell-through at retail enabled us to reduce closeouts and minimize markdown allowances. Overall, our financial performance for the full-year 2016 was solid, particularly in light of the challenging retail environment we faced throughout the year and the struggles of many of our key wholesale customers.
Sales for the year were approximately flat at $1.4 billion, and diluted EPS was $2.03, a 10% increase compared to 2015. We also made progress on a number of key initiatives that position us for growth going forward. Let me briefly touch on the highlights.
First and foremost, we had outstanding performance in our core Steve Madden Women's wholesale footwear business. Steve and his design team created exceptional products across a range of categories that kept us ahead of our competition. The trend-right merchandise drove strong sell-through performance on the floors and websites of our wholesale customers, which in turn resulted in increased orders from those customers. For the year, our Steve Madden Women's wholesale footwear division had a net sales increase of 13%, an impressive feat given the soft overall performance and de-stocking initiatives of many of our largest wholesale customers.

In addition, we increased initial markups and reduced closeouts and markdown allowances in Steve Madden Women's, resulting in significant gross margin improvement, which was the primary driver of the 170 basis point consolidated gross margin improvement we recorded in 2016. As we head into 2017, we continue to have strong momentum in this business, with sell-through performance that's outpacing the competition and great feedback from our wholesale customers on our new styles.
Strong Steve Madden Women's product also benefited our retail segment in 2016, where we delivered a solid 4% comparable store sales increase on top of a robust 11% same store increase in the prior year. In addition to the comp increase, we expanded the store base from 169 stores at the end of 2015 to 189 stores at the end of 2016, driven primarily by new store openings in the outlet channel, as well as openings in international markets. In 2017, we expect to open seven new stores to eight new stores and to close one location.
Another highlight in 2016 was the outstanding performance of our newer brands, Dolce Vita and Blondo. Dolce Vita net sales increased approximately 29% for the year, crossing the $100 million mark, and operating margin reached the mid-teens. Continuing to drive wholesale growth in Dolce Vita will be a priority in 2017, as will the re-launch of dolcevita.com with a new mobile-first design.
Blondo was also a bright spot. Since our acquisition of this brand in early 2015, we have evolved the product line to include more fashionable styling combined with the waterproof technology that Blondo has always been known for. We call this waterproofing the trends, and the response from wholesale customers and consumers has been outstanding. In 2016, Blondo's U.S. business experienced rapid growth, particularly with its largest customer Nordstrom, leading to overall sales growth for the brand of 14%. Margins were also up dramatically, and profitability for the year more than doubled from 2015.
Based on the feedback that we've received from our partners and customers, we believe that there is an appetite for Blondo footwear outside of the boot category, and in 2017, we are testing expansion of the brand into new categories, most notably sneakers. We delivered our first sneakers last month, and the early read looked very good.
Another area of focus for the company is expanding our digital presence, both in wholesale and retail. In wholesale, we continue to grow with both the pure-play e-com players like Amazon and Zappos, as well as the eCommerce businesses of the traditional bricks-and-mortar retailers like nordstrom.com and macys.com. The aforementioned businesses represent our four biggest eCommerce accounts, and our sales to them were up a combined 19% in 2016. And in our own retail segment, we continue to invest in our four branded websites. In 2016, we launched a new mobile app for Steve Madden, and as I mentioned earlier, we will be re-launching dolcevita.com in 2017. Our own eCommerce properties grew 13% on a combined basis in 2016.
Another important strategic step we took in 2016 was the formation of SM Europe, joint venture with SPM Shoetrade that manages the Steve Madden footwear and handbag business in much of Europe, including Germany, France, England, Switzerland, the Benelux region, Scandinavia, Central Europe, and the Baltic States. Consumer demand for the Steve Madden brand in Europe has increased dramatically over the past few years, and we decided that the time was right to transition from a distributor model to a joint venture model in these territories.
By operating the business directly with our joint venture partner rather than through a distributor, we're able to better control the merchandising and overall brand positioning in the market. And by cutting out the middle man, we're able to offer a more compelling price value proposition to the consumer. We are thrilled with the results so far, and building our business in this region will be a major area of focus for us in the years to come.

At the tail end of the year, we also wound down our relationship with our distributor in Asia in preparation for transitioning to a new business model in that territory. We are currently working towards forming a new joint venture for China and potentially other parts of Asia, and are targeting a re-launch in the region in the back half of 2017. We believe there is tremendous opportunity in China and the rest of Asia for Steve Madden, and we look forward to providing you updates throughout the year on our progress on this endeavor.
Finally, we continue to use our strong balance sheet and healthy free cash flow to generate returns for shareholders. In 2016, we repurchased over 2.4 million shares, or approximately 4% of the company, including open market repurchases and shares acquired through the net settlement of employee stock awards. And on January 30 of this year, we acquired Schwartz & Benjamin, which specializes in the design, sourcing and sale of licensed and private label footwear, and is known for its outstanding capability in the designer and accessible luxury space.
Schwartz & Benjamin had 2016 net sales of approximately $88 million, and its current brand partners include Kate Spade, Rebecca Minkoff, Alice and Olivia and Avec Les Filles. We see significant opportunity to expand the business and enhance its profitability by combining Schwartz & Benjamin's strengths, which include premier execution in the design and sourcing of high-quality footwear, as well as a strong portfolio of brand partners, with our proven business model and infrastructure. Transaction was completed for approximately $15.8 million in cash at closing, plus an earn-out based on financial performance through January 31, 2023. We expect the deal to be approximately neutral to EPS in 2017, excluding one-time transaction integration costs, and to be accretive thereafter.
In summary, while we faced a tough retail environment over the last year, we delivered solid financial performance and made progress on a number of key strategic initiatives. As we enter 2017, we have strong momentum in our core business, and we are confident that we are well positioned to drive sales and earnings growth and create shareholder value over the long-term.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Derek to review our financial performance in more detail and provide our outlook for 2017.
Derek Browe - Steven Madden Ltd.
Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. As Ed mentioned, we were pleased with our financial results for the fourth quarter, considering the challenging retail environment.
Our fourth quarter consolidated net sales modestly declined 2.3% to $336.4 million compared to the prior-year net sales of $344.3 million, as sales growth in our retail business was offset by decrease in our wholesale segment. As we look at the wholesale segment, wholesale footwear net sales decreased 5.3% to $189.4 million compared to $200 million in the prior year, driven by continued softness in our private label business and a decline in our international distributor business.
We were pleased, however, to see another quarter of double-digit growth in our core Steven Madden's Women's wholesale business, which benefited from a strong product assortment. Additionally, other footwear brands such as Dolce Vita, Blondo, Betsey Johnson and Superga all performed well.
In wholesale accessories, net sales were $62.2 million in Q4 compared to $65 million in the prior-year period. We were pleased to see growth in our handbag business. However, softness in our cold-weather accessories more than offset the growth in handbags. Retail net sales increased 7.1% to $84.9 million and same-store sales increased 1.1% on top of a 6.1% gain in last year's fourth quarter. Strong performance in sneakers offset softness in boots and booties.

During the fourth quarter, we opened two full price stores, one in Mexico and one in South Africa. Additionally, we added a new outlet location. We ended the quarter with 189 company-operated retail stores, including 52 outlets and 4 eCommerce sites.
Turning to other income, our commission and licensing income, net of expenses, was $1.5 million in the quarter versus $3 million in last year's fourth quarter, while first cost commission income and licensing royalty income were down versus the prior year.
During the quarter, we were pleased that our consolidated gross margins expanded 260 basis points to 38.7% compared to 36.1% in the prior year. This expansion was driven by an increase in our wholesale gross margin. Wholesale footwear gross margin increased to 30.9% for the quarter compared to 27.5% in the prior-year quarter. The improvement was driven by our on-trend product assortments, which led to higher initial markups and lower markdown allowances and closeouts. Additionally, we benefited due to sales mix.
Wholesale accessories gross margin rose to 32.7% compared to 30.7% last year, due to higher margins in cold-weather accessories, which despite lower sales had better sell through. Retail gross margins were 60.5% compared to 62.3% last year. The decrease in our retail gross margin was primarily the result of our decision to proactively clear through slower moving product, mostly casual boots and booties. While this negatively impacted the fourth quarter margin, it enabled our stores to showcase newer trends and left us in much cleaner inventory position heading into the first quarter.
In addition, retail gross margin was also negatively impacted by FX at our foreign retail locations; continue to see margin contraction due to the strength of the U.S. dollar, since the vast majority of their inventory purchases are in U.S. dollars.
Operating expenses for the quarter increased to $92.1 million or 27.4% of net sales compared to operating expenses of $88.5 million or 25.7% of net sales in the same period last year. Operating income for the quarter totaled $39.6 million or 11.8% of net sales compared to last year's fourth quarter operating income of $38.7 million or 11.2% of net sales.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 28.5% compared to 34.1% in the same period last year. Lower rate reflects the benefit of investing in our international business, as well as the benefit from exercising and investing of stock-based awards provided as compensation.
And finally, net income for the quarter was $28.7 million or $0.49 per share diluted compared to $25.7 million or $0.43 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2016.
With that, I'd like to briefly touch on full-year results. Consolidated net sales for 2016 decreased 0.4% to $1.4 billion from $1.41 billion in the prior year. Net income was $120.9 million or $2.03 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to net income of $112.9 million or $1.85 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net income in 2015 included an after-tax net benefit of $2 million related to early lease termination of the company's 5th Avenue store location, as well as an after-tax loss of $2 million related to the partial impairment of the company's Wild Pair trademark.
Moving to the balance sheet, which we are pleased remained strong. As of December 31, 2016, we had $236.2 million of cash and marketable securities and no debt. Inventory increased 17.4% to $119.8 million compared to $102.1 million in the prior year. Our on-hand inventory was flat to the prior year, but in-transit inventory was higher due to the earlier Chinese New Year, as well as forecasted sales increases in Q1. We are comfortable with both the amount and the content of our inventory position.

Our consolidated inventory turn for the last 12 months ended December 31 was 8.2 times, and our CapEx in the quarter was $3 million, bringing our full-year CapEx to $15.9 million. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 516,000 shares for approximately $19.6 million, and for the full year we repurchased over 2.4 million shares for approximately $86 million. This includes shares acquired through the net settlement of employee stock awards.
Now to our guidance. For the full-year 2017, we expect that net sales growth will be 8% to 10% and expect that diluted EPS will be in the range of $2.12 to $2.18. The EPS guidance assumes a tax rate of approximately 31%, up from 29.1% last year. Forecasted increase in the tax rate impacts 2017 EPS negatively by approximately $0.06.
Now, I'd like to turn it over to the operator for questions.

Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.
Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.
Great. Thanks. Good morning. Ed, I was hoping you could unpack a little bit how you're thinking about the major sales drivers for 2017. I guess, if you were to back out the acquisition, it seems like the organic growth underpinning that is about 3% to 5%, so maybe just help us rank kind of the biggest drivers to get there both from a footwear as well as an accessory perspective.
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Steven Madden Ltd.
Sure. So if you look at footwear, we are at low double-digits, including the acquisition in wholesale footwear, but you're right that if you back out – I think that Schwartz & Benjamin is going to add about 9% to the wholesale footwear growth rate. So we're probably looking at sort of 2% to 3% wholesale footwear growth for the year and – excluding Schwartz & Benjamin. And that's really sort of up 10% in branded, down 10% in private label. So much stronger growth in the branded piece, and we've talked about where we have nice momentum there, and most notably Steve Madden Women's.
In terms of accessories, I think you should think about that as kind of a mid-single-digit grower, and same for retail. And I think that'll get you to the annual numbers.
Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.
Okay. That's helpful. And then just the private label, can you just talk about how you are thinking about Payless within that down 10%? Is that the majority of the shortfall there?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Steven Madden Ltd.
No. I can't – we wouldn't address our forecast for a specific customer, but I think that all we can provide is that we're looking at down 10% for the overall private label footwear.
Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.
Okay. Fair enough. And then just on the EPS, I'm a little surprised there wasn't more flow through just given the strength of the top line, so if you could just walk through what you're seeing from an SG&A perspective and are there any one-time costs from the acquisition in the guidance?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Steven Madden Ltd.
Sure. I mean, so just to highlight what we're looking at there, you're right that the sales growth is 8% to 10% but keep in mind there's $80 million in there from Schwartz & Benjamin, which we've said is not going to contribute or is going to be neutral from an earnings standpoint. So the sales growth is sort of 2%, 2.5% on the low end to 4%, 4.5% on the high end of the guidance excluding Schwartz & Benjamin, and I think the earnings growth we're looking at is high single-digits, if you back out the tax impact. So I think it's a reasonable relationship of earnings growth to sales growth.
Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.
Yes. Got it. Okay. And then just on gross margin, you've seen some good kind of IMU improvement over the last year. Can you talk about kind of your outlook for gross margin in 2017 and just help us think about maybe first half versus second half what's your visibility there?

Edward R. Rosenfeld - Steven Madden Ltd.
Sure. I think when you put it altogether; gross margin could potentially be up very modestly. I mean maybe 10 basis points for the year because you've got some puts and takes in terms of mix there. On the wholesale footwear side, we've got – excluding Schwartz & Benjamin, we've got branded growing faster than private label so that's a mix benefit. However, Schwartz & Benjamin is a mix negative and that really offsets the other impact, so that's why you're looking at flat or up very modestly for the year. I think the opportunity is a little bit better in the first half as opposed to the back half in terms of year-over-year comparisons.

We'll take our next question from Camilo Lyon with Canaccord Genuity.
Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Thank you. Good morning, guys. How are you?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Steven Madden Ltd.
Good morning.
Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
So just going back to the commentary on private label, Ed, if you could just maybe talk about how you're viewing – what's embedded in the guidance from a protective stance given some of the headlines that we've seen around some of your private label customers and any sort of offsets that you have also that can serve to mitigate any one particular customer's shrinking of sales?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Steven Madden Ltd.
Really other than what we've already provided, which is that we're planning the private label footwear business down about 10% I can't – there's not much more I can comment on there. Certainly wouldn't comment on any specific customers as I said. We've got a lot of potential offsets to that, and that's why the sales growth that we've embedded in the guidance or the guidance includes positive sales growth, because we've got great momentum in Steve Madden Women's. We've got strong momentum in another of our – a number of our other brands, whether it's Dolce Vita, Blondo, Betsey Johnson, Superga, et cetera. We've got the new program called Madden NYC at Kohl's, which will be a benefit this year. So we've got a lot of positive things happening in the business.
Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
And is it right to assume that those positives and mainly the incremental initiatives, like Madden NYC at Kohl's, is there a gross margin benefit that's greater than some of your private label gross margin businesses that would actually yield to a significant greater gross profit dollar improvement?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Steven Madden Ltd.
Well, you're absolutely right that these branded businesses that we were just talking about, including Madden NYC at Kohl's, carry a higher gross margin than the private label footwear business. I'm not going to speculate on exactly where the gross profit dollars are going to come out on individual businesses, but you've got the overall guidance, which incorporates all of our assumptions there.
Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Got it. And then – and just to be clear that there's no incremental expectation of risk associated with some of these private label customers relative to where you've guided? Do you feel like you've appropriately guided to manage that downside risk?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Steven Madden Ltd.
Yes. We've tried to take a pretty conservative look at that.
Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Great. And then as it relates to Schwartz & Benjamin, if we go back to Blondo and even Dolce Vita when bought those brands, understanding there's a greater licensing component to Schwartz & Benjamin versus wholesale for the prior two. If I remember correctly, I think your profitability improvement, particularly on Dolce Vita was pretty fast. It sounds like you're not expecting any profitability improvement, so it remains a breakeven business for Schwartz & Benjamin this year. Is there an opportunity to fast forward the profitability realization in the back half?

Edward R. Rosenfeld - Steven Madden Ltd.
Yes. I think that there is potential to start seeing some earnings contribution in the back half. We still think for the full year the right way to look at it and the prudent way to look at it is basically breakeven in terms of EPS. But we do expect to start to – we're fast at work on integrating the business and finding some cost savings where we can. And so we would expect to start to see some improvement in the back half, and then start to see earnings accretion in 2018.
Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Got it. And then just lastly, I think you've increased the amount of SKUs that are on auto-replenishment by 2.5 times over last year. If you could just help us understand what that means to your business and how much flexibility that gives to in-season reorders because that was kind of an issue last year despite what were very good sell-through rates?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Steven Madden Ltd.
Yes. We're really pleased with what we're seeing out of our replenishment business. As you point out, we have more styles on replenishment now than we ever have before in our Steve Madden Women's business. I think we're up to 13 styles on replenishment in Steve Madden Women's. As a point of comparison, historically, in many seasons that was only one or two styles that we would have on replenishment. So that means we've got a lot of styles that are core styles where we're getting weekly orders, and it generates sales with high margins and limited markdown liability. So we like that quite a bit.
And we have one department store customer or one big retailer that I'm thinking of, in particular, I think is doing about a third of their business right now on replenishment. And so that's something that's really driving a lot of business for us and high-margin business for us, so we're pleased about that.
Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Sounds great. Good luck in the year. Thanks, Ed.
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Steven Madden Ltd.
Thanks, Camilo.

We'll take our next question from Jay Sole with Morgan Stanley.
Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you. Ed, I just wanted to ask you about inventory. On the balance sheet, it looks like the inventory is up about 17% year-over-year, but your commentary suggests the inventory is in line. Can you explain the inventory situation right now and why it looks higher a little bit on the balance sheet than maybe the commentary suggests?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Steven Madden Ltd.
Yes. It's a good question. As Derek mentioned briefly when he touched on it in the formal remarks, we were actually flat on hand. So the inventory that we actually had on hand in our warehouses and our stores, et cetera was flat, but we were up significantly in in-transit inventory. And a very big piece of that was the timing of Chinese New Year this year. Chinese New Year was almost two weeks earlier. I think it was 11 days or 12 days earlier, so we had to have more products on the boat at year-end or in transit. That was a big piece of it.
We also do have a sales forecast increase in Q1 for 2017, and so needed some more in-transit inventory to support the sales. And then the last thing I'll just mention is, we have to think about the composition of sales, because we have different businesses that have different – require more or less inventory. So the private label business that we are projecting to be down, that has no inventory. The branded business that we're projecting to be up does require inventory, and so there's a mix issue that's part of the equation there as well.
Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. And then you touched on the challenging retail environment. Is that something where – is that different from what we've seen over the last few quarters or is that really a factor of the tax refund delays? Can you just talk about what you're seeing in the environment now that kind of led to that comment?

Edward R. Rosenfeld - Steven Madden Ltd.
No, I was really talking more broadly about what we've been seeing over the last 18 months in the industry. And the challenges that many of our big wholesale customers have faced, as we all know, many of them have been comping negatively. A lot of them have been seeing very weak store traffic trends, and so that's really what we were referring to.
Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And then maybe one last one for me. Can you just talk about how Schwartz & Benjamin fits into the overall portfolio? Is it addressing maybe a gap where there was a business opportunity that your brands really weren't touching on? Or how does the deal fit in overall?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Steven Madden Ltd.
Yes, I think what we like about it is that it's a complementary capability because it really adds a capability in that higher-end segment of the market and an expertise in designing and sourcing really high-quality footwear at higher price points, and also they have very strong customer relationships at places like Neimans and Saks, where we historically have not done a lot of business. So we just think it really rounds out the offering.
I think that we felt very good about our capability if you think about sort of Steve Madden or even Dolce Vita price points and down, we felt like we would match up our capability against anybody's. But when it got into that accessible luxury space or designer space, it was not where we really had a lot of expertise, and that's what Schwartz & Benjamin brings.
Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Thanks so much.
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Steven Madden Ltd.

We'll take our next question from Corinna Van der Ghinst from Citi Research.
Corinna Gayle Van der Ghinst - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thank you. Hi. Good morning, guys. I think you had said previously that the backlogs are down again going into this year similar to the kind of ordering behavior that you guys saw from sale last year. But could you talk about how your reorders are trending, or how you expect them to trend into this spring season? And does your top-line guidance today assume a higher level of reorders than last year?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Steven Madden Ltd.
So, reorder activity has been very strong for us for the last few quarters, and it continues to be very strong. Yes, I believe reorder activity, particularly in the first half, is up in the guidance. To be honest with you, we really don't look at it that way, but yes, it is trending higher, and I expect it will be higher, particularly in the first half.
Corinna Gayle Van der Ghinst - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Okay. Great. And then maybe you could talk a little bit about your momentum in Europe right now? It sounds like it's been going pretty well so far. Where exactly is that growth coming from in terms of markets? And where do you see the biggest near-term opportunities for the brand as you're looking out into this year?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Steven Madden Ltd.
Yes. We're off to a really good start there. I think we're seeing strength in a number of markets, Germany, Holland, the UK, even Poland where we've got a few franchise retail stores open that are exceeding plan. So we feel very good about what we're seeing really across a number of different countries. I think the highlight is really what we're seeing with the online accounts. So Zalando, ASOS, Amazon, the business is really flying with them. And we're exceeding expectations there, and we've got some pretty healthy growth plans from those customers. So we're going to really look to focus on that.
Corinna Gayle Van der Ghinst - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
And are those trends that you guys are seeing out there, are those similar in terms of like the styles that are working? Is that something that's a similar read-through from what you're seeing in the U.S.?

Edward R. Rosenfeld - Steven Madden Ltd.
Yes. Very similar.
Corinna Gayle Van der Ghinst - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Okay. Great. And then lastly, you did mention Amazon in Europe, but could you just touch on how that Amazon business is proceeding? And also if there is any tax refund impact on your consumer? Thanks.
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Steven Madden Ltd.
Sure. Yes. Amazon continues to be a very important growth account for us, and only getting more important. You guys, as you know, it's something that we've started putting a lot more focus on, maybe 18 months to 24 months ago, and we're really pleased with the dividends that we're seeing there from that increased investment in time and resources. The business is just growing very dramatically and they've given us a very aggressive growth plan over the next four or five years. And so we're going to continue to focus on it.
In terms of tax refunds, I think that there is some impact to us. We don't know exactly what that looks like, but it's really a timing impact, and it's not something we spend a lot of time worrying about.
Corinna Gayle Van der Ghinst - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Okay. Great. Thanks so much.
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Steven Madden Ltd.

We'll take our next question from Scott Krasik with Buckingham Research Group.
Scott D. Krasik - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
Hey, Ed and Derek. How are you doing?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Steven Madden Ltd.
Good morning.
Scott D. Krasik - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
So, I guess without giving quarterly guidance, is there any progression to the year that we should think about either in terms of sales growth or EPS growth that you'd want to call out?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Steven Madden Ltd.
The only thing I would call out is that despite the fact that we have a tax headwind in Q1, we actually think that the EPS growth year-over-year will be strongest in Q1, and there's really a couple of things driving that. The biggest one is that we just have this really strong momentum in our branded wholesale footwear business right now, and we're seeing some really strong performance in Q1 there, and that's our most profitable business. So that's a big driver.
And then secondarily, in wholesale accessories, we do have an easier compare in Q1 as opposed to the remaining three quarters, and so we're looking for better performance year-over-year there as well in Q1.
Scott D. Krasik - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
Interesting. Okay. And then in terms of SM Asia, you mentioned you were looking at a joint venture there. Is any of that contemplated in the guidance? And what would that entail either from an investment standpoint, an expense standpoint and then potentially revenues?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Steven Madden Ltd.
Yes, we don't have that in the guidance right now, but – and I think it's too early to speculate about what exactly that will look like. But what I will say is that I would expect the financial impact this year, certainly from a profitability standpoint, to be very modest. I would say pretty immaterial. Certainly, we can't expect it to be a profit contributor right off the bat, but also we're not talking about a plan that requires a ton of investment and requires us to incur significant losses at the outset either. So, I don't think it's something that you really need to build into your models.
Scott D. Krasik - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
Okay. Thanks. And then on Schwartz & Benjamin, $88 million in sales in 2016, sounded like you were planning for $80 million in 2017. Just wondering what portion of that is Kate Spade? And then as the noise heats up that Kate Spade is a potential acquisition target, how would that impact those sales in the change of control?

Edward R. Rosenfeld - Steven Madden Ltd.
Sure. So just one point of clarification. Yes, you're right, we did say $80 million. Just keep in mind that's for the 11 months that we're going to own it. So, it's not necessarily that we're expecting that the business declines by 10% this year, it's just that we're not owning it for the full year.
Can't disclose the sales by brand for Schwartz & Benjamin, Kate Spade is a meaningful brand for them. It's one we hope we have for a very long time. We do have a license agreement that runs through the end of 2020. And so we expect to have the brand or we will have the brand through the end of 2020, no matter what happens with respect to the Kate Spade review of strategic alternatives. But certainly we would hope that we'd be able to keep the brand in a renewal period beyond 2020 as well.
Scott D. Krasik - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
Okay. All right. Well thanks and good luck.
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Steven Madden Ltd.

We'll take our next question from Tom Nikic with Wells Fargo.
Tom Nikic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning, guys. I was wondering on the wholesale footwear side, I was kind of wondering about the margin difference between the branded and the private label? And if there's any sort of help you could give us on that end? And then I was also wondering on the tax rate, I know it was really lumpy quarter-by-quarter last year. I think Q1 was really low after you adopted the new accounting standard for stock compensation. And I was kind of wondering if it should sort of follow a similar pattern this year? Thanks, guys.
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Steven Madden Ltd.
With respect to the gross margin branded versus private label, keep in mind, private label is significantly lower. Private label is in the teens and the branded gross margin, it really varies by brand, but it's in the high 30%s, low 40%s for many of our brands. Derek, do you want to address the tax?
Derek Browe - Steven Madden Ltd.
Sure. Yes, Tom, I mean you did see a little bit of unusual activity throughout this year, but as we look at 2017, and as we mentioned in our remarks that it's kind of baked in the 31%-ish tax rate for the year. And as we kind of look at this year, we're looking at it more consistently through the first three quarters, with maybe a little bit lower in the fourth quarter. I think that's the way we should think about it.
Tom Nikic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
All right. Sounds good. Best of luck this year.
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Steven Madden Ltd.

We'll take our next question from Jeff Van Sinderen with B. Riley & Company.
Jeff Van Sinderen - B. Riley & Co. LLC
Good morning. I know it's really early, but just wondering if there's any color on reads on some of the spring product, maybe in some of the warmer weather markets, just wondering if there's anything there to relay? Maybe we can start there?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Steven Madden Ltd.
Yes. We feel really good about what we're seeing in terms of consumer reaction to our spring product. In terms of category, the first thing we have to call out is sneakers. Our sneakers are just flying, and that continues to become a more and more important category for us in Steve Madden Women's. In our Steve Madden Women's wholesale business, sneakers for Q1, we expect to be in the low-20s as a percentage of the total, which is the first time we've ever been up that high. So that's something that we're excited about.
In terms of other categories, footbeds are also performing very, very well for us. Mules are performing very, very well. The next thing I would call out is novelty is performing great. So whether its patchwork, pearls, floral prints, fur, there's a lot going on in terms of novelty that we're having a lot of success with, and that creates a lot of excitement on the shoe floor. And it's a nice complement to what we talked about earlier, which is also at the same time having a lot of core replenishment product, particularly in the sneaker and dress shoe categories.

Jeff Van Sinderen - B. Riley & Co. LLC
Okay. Good to hear. And then just wondering if there's any more you can give us on how we should think about growth in Dolce Vita? And then also in Brian Atwood, especially I was wondering if the Schwartz & Benjamin acquisition will have an impact on Brian Atwood this year?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Steven Madden Ltd.
Yes. In terms of Dolce Vita, obviously that's been a tremendous success story for us. We talked about the brand being up nearly 30% in sales last year, should see growth in 2017. Certainly, we're not expecting it to be to the same level, but we still feel good about what we're seeing in that brand. And then I think you made a good call on Brian Atwood. Obviously, having Schwartz & Benjamin under our umbrella makes a – we think it makes a lot of sense to have them work on B Brian Atwood and potentially even Brian Atwood. And so, that's what we're working on the plan with them and with Brian for that, and we hope to have something to talk about maybe even on the next call.
Jeff Van Sinderen - B. Riley & Co. LLC
Okay. Good to hear. Continued success. Thanks.

We'll take our next question from Steven Marotta with C.L. King & Associates.
Steven L. Marotta - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.
Good morning, guys. Can you talk a little bit about the weighting of Schwartz & Benjamin throughout the year? With the exclusion, of course, the month of January, which you didn't own it, are there any material differentials from quarter-to-quarter?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Steven Madden Ltd.
Third quarter is the biggest, followed by fourth, followed by second, followed by first, because we only owned it for two months.
Steven L. Marotta - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.
Okay.
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Steven Madden Ltd.
We don't have the percentages of total for each, but that would be directionally the weighted.
Steven L. Marotta - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.
That's fine. And as it pertains to the current revenue penetration run rate for pure-play eCommerce, what is it roughly? And what would you expect that to grow at in 2017?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Steven Madden Ltd.
I'm sorry. Can you say that again? The penetration of eCommerce?
Steven L. Marotta - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.
Pure-play eCommerce as a percent to total sales more or less again on a run rate basis? And what you would expect that growth to be in 2017?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Steven Madden Ltd.
I don't have that number off the top of my head. If I had to – I mean it's in the single-digits, maybe mid-singles, something like that and growing much faster than the overall.
Steven L. Marotta - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.
Right.
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Steven Madden Ltd.
But I wouldn't put a number on it.

We'll take our next question from Sam Poser with Susquehanna.
Sam Poser - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. A few things, can you talk about how you're viewing – what the opportunities are with the Madden NYC line at Kohl's and then the impact that you've built into your guidance from Payless liquidation?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Steven Madden Ltd.
On Madden NYC, that's something that we're pretty excited about. That's a new brand that we're offering them so far on an exclusive basis. It's in about 450 doors, and we've got a range of product categories in there, not only the shoes and accessories that we do, but we've got some licensed categories that are important there, like activewear and outerwear. And so far we're very pleased with the early sell-throughs just hit stores over the last month or so and so we're optimistic about the future there.

In terms of Payless, as I mentioned earlier, we're not going to comment on our forecasts for any specific customer.
Sam Poser - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
All right. And then can you also talk – there's been a lot of conversation about how the shrinking pie, you've got a lot of your – a lot of retailers are closing doors or being cautious. Can you talk about the kind of share gain that you're seeing? And how you view that? How you look at all that?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Steven Madden Ltd.
Yes. Clearly we're seeing, particularly in Steve Madden Women's brand, very nice share gains in all of our key retailers. And many of them are seeing their overall businesses either flat or even declining, but our business is growing nicely with them because we're taking share. Just over the last couple of days we heard about another of our big retailers who said they're cutting their plans for everybody except for Steve Madden going forward. So we're very pleased that we're taking share and that we're an outperformer right now, but also we would prefer if the overall environment was healthier and the customers were doing better overall, because of course a rising tide lifts all boats.
Sam Poser - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
Thanks. And then two other things, one, can you talk about how – sort of how these various brands that you've acquired over the last few years are interacting and how your plan for them to interact? For instance, with the Banana Republic business being done through Schwartz & Benjamin, is that something that Steve Madden sourcing mechanism may be able to do better, while as you mentioned, Brian Atwood it may be better within the Schwartz & Benjamin sourcing mechanism? Are you going to utilize any waterproofing type technologies that currently exist in Blondo and other brands? I mean and how is all of this starting to gel? I mean you've got a lot of benefit from top line a few years ago. How do you see how all of this sort of works together, including Dolce's sourcing mechanism?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Steven Madden Ltd.
There's a lot there. Look, we're always looking for ways to get synergy out of the various brands and businesses that we own. That being said, we're also very careful to make sure that the various brands that we have in our portfolio retain their own identity, and that always means a dedicated design team. That also means a dedicated sales team. And in many cases, that means dedicated sourcing. So we do look for ways to get cost savings and synergies where appropriate, but we also want to make sure that we don't start to make everything look the same. So, happy to address any of those specifics with you offline. I think there's probably too much for me to cover on this call.
Sam Poser - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP

We'll take our next question from Camilo Lyon with Canaccord Genuity.
Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Hey, Ed. Just a follow-up on a comment you made earlier regarding Q1 sales being the strongest. Given the strength that Steve Madden Women's is experiencing, and the comment around you getting an incremental amount of open-buy orders, and your net share gaining benefit that you're seeing at retail, why would that strength decelerate as the year progresses in wholesale footwear as you face easier comparisons? So just want to make sure I have the cadence right, or understand exactly what's embedded in the guidance?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Steven Madden Ltd.
I think we're just telling you what we see today, and so we have obviously very good visibility into Q1. I think we have to be – recognize that Steve Madden Women's is a big business, and it's primarily distributed into channels that are not growing themselves. And so I don't think it's sustainable for a long period of time to look at very, very robust sales growth, or at least it wouldn't be prudent to forecast it that way. So I certainly hope that we can continue to see the type of sales growth that we're seeing in Q1 going forward, but it's not something that we would put into our plans.

And then the other thing I'll just comment on is, at least with respect to Steve Madden Women's, the comparisons do get tougher as the year goes on. We were single-digit last year, a single-digit grower in Steve Madden Women's in first half last year, and a strong double-digit grower in the back half.
Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Okay. There's nothing that suggest that that momentum can't continue, though, despite the SM comparisons, given that there's just fewer players that are executing at your level?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Steven Madden Ltd.
We're going to do our best to continue the momentum, for sure.
Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Great. And then just rounding out my questions, Mexico, do you have -can you just address any sort of puts and takes around your exposure there? I know that there's a lot of volatility around policy decisions, but how you're planning your business around Mexico? And what are the risks and benefits that we can understand a little bit better around that at this point?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Steven Madden Ltd.
In terms of our sourcing from Mexico, that's been on the decline having nothing to do with any trade policy out of Washington, but simply because the types of looks that we source out of Mexico has been declining. So that hasn't been the trend. So whereas, years ago, when we were doing the true-up out of Mexico, it was something like 10% of our overall sourcing. Now it's down to about 4% out of Mexico, and headed south. So, we do think that mitigates the impact of any potential change in trade policy, including renegotiation of NAFTA.
In terms of our business in Mexico, because we also have an operation in Mexico, we're performing well there on the top line, but we have seen a profitability impact due to the strength of the dollar against the peso, because obviously we've seen a very dramatic strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the peso and because our Mexican subsidiaries is primarily buying in U.S. dollars and then selling in pesos there is a margin impact there, in addition to just the impact of the translation back to U.S. dollars for our reported financials.

Thanks, Megan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review Steve Madden's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015 results. With me to discuss the business is Derek Browe, the company's Director of Finance and Investor Relations.
We delivered solid financial performance in 2015, bouncing back after a tough 2014, successfully capitalized on some new fashion footwear trends, recorded strong growth in both sales and earnings in our retail and e-commerce business, made significant progress in building our newly-acquired Dolce Vita and Blondo brands, and further expanded our international presence.
As expected, our earnings performance improved as the year progressed, and we finished 2015 with both net sales and EPS up about 5% for the year. The year ended on a good note in the fourth quarter despite an overall tough retail environment. We delivered EPS growth of 27% in Q4 on the strength of margin improvement in both wholesale and retail. We achieved this growth during one of the warmest seasons on record, which pressured seasonal products like boots and cold weather accessories and contributed to a heavily promotional retail environment.
Before I turn the call over to Derek to walk you through the financials, let me spend a few minutes recapping the year in a little more detail.
First, Steve and his design team did a great job in 2015 of creating fashion forward products that resonate with our consumers. Our dress and fashion sneaker offerings were particularly outstanding. The on-trend merchandise assortment led to a dramatic improvement in our retail segment performance.

Retail comparable store sales were up 11.1% for the year and operating margin for our retail business expanded 260 basis points. We remain pleased with the momentum in our retail business and expect continued improvement in 2016 as we work toward our goal of a 10% operating margin in this segment.
While the strong product assortment also resulted in improved sell-through performance in the wholesale channel, our overall wholesale footwear financial results were negatively impacted by a number of factors during the year, including the lingering effects of a challenging 2014, the West Coast port slowdown in the first half, and the extremely unfavorable weather in the back half.
As we entered 2016, we have better momentum with our key wholesale partners than we did a year ago and are confident that we can show sales and earnings improvement versus 2015 in this segment. That being said, the overall tone among most of our largest wholesale customers is one of caution. We are planning our business accordingly.
Within the wholesale footwear segment, the biggest highlight in 2015 was the progress we made with our newest brand acquisitions. In Dolce Vita, our strategy of focusing our efforts on the flagship Dolce Vita brand paid dividends. Dolce Vita was a clear outperformer at retail in tough fall season. And as we head into 2016, the brand's positioning with both retailers and consumers is stronger than it's ever been.
We also executed on a number of operational initiatives, and the result was a business that went from losing money in 2014 to a 7% operating margin in 2015. For spring 2016, we have relaunched the diffusion brand, DV, as exclusive brand to Target in footwear and handbags. And for fall 2017, we are launching Dolce Vita apparel under licensing agreement with Amerex Group. Overall, we couldn't be happier with the direction we're headed in Dolce Vita.
We are also really pleased with what we're seeing in Blondo, the waterproof boot brand we acquired in early 2015. Blondo sales in the U.S. were up approximately 50% in our first year of ownership of the brand. Overall, sell-through performance was good, particularly in light of the unfavorable weather, and we expect another year of strong growth in 2016.
Turning to wholesale accessories, we had a solid year in 2015 with net sales up approximately 5% compared to 2014. Our handbag business performed well; both branded and private label had strong gains for the year. But we did see pressure on this business in Q4, which we expect to continue into Q1 2016 due to overall weakness in the handbag market and excess inventory in the channel. Our cold weather accessories business was, of course, challenged in 2015 by the historically warm weather in the back half, and we see opportunity for improvement in that division in 2016. Overall, we're expecting our wholesale accessories business to be approximately flat in 2016 compared to last year.
Finally, we continue to make significant progress on our most important long-term growth initiative, which is growing our business internationally. Overall international sales were up 33% in 2015. Our net sales to international distributors were up 23% compared to the prior year with particularly strong gains in Asia and the Middle East. In our SM Mexico, which we acquired in late December 2014, had an outstanding first year under our ownership with retail comps in excess of 20% and wholesale sales up over 50% in local currency.
In sum, we had a good year in 2015, stabilizing our core business after a challenging 2014 and taking significant steps forward on our key initiatives. We entered 2016 with positive momentum. Our brands are outperforming the competition and we are confident in the strength of our current product assortments.

That said, we are cognizant that many of our wholesale customers are taking a cautious approach to initial orders in the wake of a tough fall season. And therefore, we are planning our business conservatively in the near term. As we look out farther, however, we remain as optimistic as ever about our company's long-term growth prospects, given the underlying strength of our brands and our business model, as well as the significant opportunities we have available to us.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Derek to review our financial performance in more detail and provide our outlook for 2016.
Derek Browe - Director of Finance and Investor Relations
Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Turning to our financial results for the fourth quarter, consolidated net sales grew 0.5% to $344.3 million compared to prior year net sales of $342.6 million. During the quarter, sales growth in both our wholesale footwear and retail businesses was mostly offset by a decline in our wholesale accessory business.
Our wholesale net sales in the quarter decreased 1.8% to $265 million. Wholesale footwear net sales increased 3.3% to $202.4 million. Excluding sales from acquisitions, the wholesale footwear segment was down 2.4%. Overall, the boot category was soft, particularly tall-shaft boots, though we did have strong success with over-the-knee boots and some of our ankle booties. Additionally, our dress and sneaker offerings were strong during the quarter, as they have been throughout 2015.
In wholesale accessories, net sales declined 15.2% to $62.6 million in Q4 compared to $73.8 million in the prior-year period. The decline was partially driven by the unseasonably warm weather, which had a strong negative impact on our cold weather accessories business. The decline was also attributable to a shift of handbag sales from Q4 into Q3 and lower sales from our off-price channel.
In our retail division, net sales increased 8.9% to $79.3 million. Our comps were once again strong at 6.1%, an impressive result given we had a comp decline in the boot and bootie category, which accounts for more than half of our retail mix in the fourth quarter.
During the quarter, we opened one full-price store in Mexico and three outlet locations in the U.S. We ended the quarter with 169 company-operated retail stores, including 40 outlets and four e-commerce stores.
Turning to other income, our commission and licensing income net of expenses was $3 million in the quarter versus $2.3 million in last year's fourth quarter. Despite the headwinds from a very promotional environment, we increased our consolidated gross margin by 180 basis points to 36.1% compared to 34.3% in the prior year, with increases in both wholesale and retail.
Wholesale gross margin increased to 28.2% from 26.9% last year due to improvements in both the wholesale footwear and accessories segments. Gross margins in the retail division increased to 62.3% compared to 61.6%, as strong product performance resulted in higher full-price selling and lower promotional activity as compared to the prior year.
Operating expenses for the quarter were $88.5 million or 25.7% of net sales, which was consistent with the same period last year when operating expenses were at $87.8 million or 25.6% of net sales. Operating income for the quarter totaled $38.7 million or 11.2% of net sales compared to last year's fourth quarter operating income of $32 million, or 9.3% of net sales.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 34.1% compared to 35% in the same period last year and net income for the quarter was $25.7 million or $0.43 per share diluted compared to $21 million or $0.34 per share diluted in the fourth quarter of 2014.
Now, I'd like to briefly touch on full-year results. Consolidated net sales for the year increased 5.3% to $1.4 billion, compared to $1.3 billion in 2014. Operating income for the year totaled $171.7 million or 12.2% of net sales, compared to 2014 operating income of $167.6 million or 12.6% of net sales.

Operating income for 2015 included a net benefit of $3 million related to an early release termination of our Fifth Avenue store location, as well as a $3 million loss related to the partial impairment of our Wild Pair trademark, both in the first quarter of this year.
Our net income for 2015 was $112.9 million or $1.85 per diluted share. This compared to net income of $111.9 million or $1.76 per diluted share in 2014.
Our balance sheet remained strong. As of December 31, 2015, we had $193.3 million of cash and marketable securities and no debt. Inventory increased 10.1% to $102.1 million compared to $92.7 million in the prior year.
Our consolidated inventory turns for the last 12 months ended December 31 was 8.7 times, and our CapEx in the quarter was $5.9 million bringing our full year CapEx to $19.4 million. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1 million shares for approximately $31 million. And for the full year, we repurchased over 3.7 million shares for approximately $136 million.
Now, turning to guidance. For fiscal year 2016, we expect that net sales will increase 2% to 4% over net sales in 2015. Diluted EPS for fiscal year 2016 is expected to be in the range of $1.93 to $2.03.
Now, I'd like to turn it over to the operator for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. We'll take our first from Camilo Lyon with Canaccord Genuity.
Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning, guys. How are you?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, Camilo.
Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
If we could just start off, Ed, and just – could you talk about how the different channels are performing with regard to your wholesale footwear business? Where are there incremental pockets of weakness or caution as you're seeing the first of the year start to flow through? And if we think about the good product that you're bringing to market compared to the overall cautionary stance by your wholesale partners, where is there an opportunity for kind of a re-order scenario to occur should demand trends normalize after we get out of this kind of lingering Q4, holiday, cold weather scenario?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Sure. Well, in terms of the first part of your question, which was about the difference in performance by channel, I actually think that we're not seeing as much variation by channel currently. So, whereas that was something that we were calling out for a good chunk of 2015. Right now, I don't think we're seeing a big difference between what we're seeing – seen in, say, department stores off-price or as private label accounts, et cetera. I think that what we're seeing is that, overall, on the whole, wholesale customers across the spectrum are pretty cautious. A lot of holiday, fall holiday sales overall were not great. A lot of folks missed their sales plan; a lot of folks had elevated inventory levels and they've moved to try to get those in line and they've also turned a little bit more cautious with their order patterns going forward.
The good news is, for us, that we believe we've been an outperformer with the vast majority of our big wholesale customers in terms of sell-through. We clearly have momentum with the brand and with our product, which you can see with our own retail comps. And so, we believe that we're going to do better than our peers, and that, in fact, our big wholesale customers are planning our business better than our peers. But clearly, it's overall a cautious environment.
I think the second part of your question was where are there – where is there ability to – for upside here, is that right?
Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Yeah. It just seems – well, just going to the top-line guidance of 2% to 4%, it just seems that we strip out some of the acquisition benefit that you're kind of looking for kind of flattish to maybe up 1%-or-so growth in the front half, and it seems like that's sort of running through the year. First is, is that a correct read? And second, it sounds like – it looks like you're taking the conservatism that's being placed in your Q1 business and running that through. Is that in fact what you're doing and really not anticipating any material improvement in the business?

Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I mean, first of all, I want to just clarify. I know you understand this Camilo, but just for everybody listening that we have anniversaried all of the acquisitions. So, there isn't any inorganic growth here. I think what you are referring to is that some of the more recent acquisitions have the potential for stronger growth in the near term, but it is. It's not growth through acquisition per se, I guess. I want to just clarify that.
Yeah. I mean, we have – the guidance does assume that there – it does not assume I should say any dramatic improvement in the overall environment. If inventories get cleaner, and the wholesale customers see good sell-throughs and start to get more aggressive with order patterns, that would certainly be an opportunity for upside, and I think we'd be very well positioned to benefit from that and to chase into that demand should it develop.
Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
And still on that topic of inventory, it's come down from last quarter, still a little bit elevated, I think probably more than you'd like it to be. Can you just talk about the composition of that inventory? And if there were an increase in demand when would we likely be – when would we see that materialize? It's probably not in Q1, but when would that – when could there be a matching of inventory that you have on hand versus incremental demand from your wholesale partners?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
You're asking about our inventory on our balance sheet not in the channel, correct?
Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Correct.
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I feel actually pretty good about the inventory level for us. If you strip out the acquired businesses, SM Mexico and Blondo, we're up by 5% at year-end. And I think, more importantly, I feel good about the composition of inventory and the inventory content there. In fact, I think particularly in our retail segment, the composition of that inventory is a little bit healthier than it was a year ago.
So, I think you'll continue to see inventory levels converge towards sales. That's something that's been happening recently. Keep in mind I don't think they should be exactly in line with sales growth on a consolidated basis because our retail business is growing faster than our wholesale. And as you know, our wholesale business turns three to four times faster than our retail business. So, on a consolidated basis, when retail is growing faster, you're always going to see inventory growing faster than sales.
Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Okay. And then just the last one I had on – you mentioned the strength in retail despite some of the cautionary stance at the wholesale channel. You've had really good comps pretty much throughout the year. You're coming up against some very difficult comparisons in 2016. Is there any – can you help us understand how we should think about some of the progression around your retail comps given the incremental product you're bringing to market that's been received well and some of the positive trends that you're seeing in the business today?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So, we do. We are going up against double-digit comps for each of the next few quarters. But I don't continue to feel good about the momentum that we have in our retail business. And I think that we do have an opportunity to comp positively against the double-digit comps. We have cautioned people that, clearly, Q2 in particular is a very tough comparison. We're up 18.5% comp in last year's 2Q. But, overall, we continue to feel good about what we're seeing in our retail business.

Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Well, thanks a lot, Ed. I'll jump back in the queue. Good luck.
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Camilo.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.
Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
Great. Thanks. Good morning. I guess, just circling back on one of Camilo's question just at on the sales guidance for the year of 2% to 4% decelerating from the 5% last year. I mean, is that just more of a nod to the overall environment decelerating? Or is there something else fundamentally that we should be aware of just that step function change? I just – I guess I would've thought that the organic growth would've come back a little bit stronger and I know there's some caution around kind of replenishment or just stuff that's not fully in there. But just any help you can give us on just the magnitude of the deceleration would be very helpful?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I mean, I don't – I guess, I would just – I wouldn't characterize it as deceleration because, in fact, if you strip out acquisitions, we were actually down, I think it was 0.5% last year. So, we are expecting an improvement from that to the 2% to 4% because there is no acquisition growth again in 2016.
As to why it's not faster than that, yeah, I think that's really a function of the overall environment. But we're still over 80% wholesale, and most of our wholesale customers are quite cautious right now. The other thing is we did call out some near-term headwinds in the hand bag category and so we're looking at our wholesale accessories business to be about flat this year.
And then, I guess the last thing I would touch on is that we do have some negative FX impact in our international businesses, particularly Canada and Mexico, which have created a little bit of a drag.
Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
Okay. That's helpful. And, I guess, if you were to then think about now that the acquisition – I guess, acquisition growth is now organic and in the base – could you just maybe (22:45) for us how you're thinking about the biggest drivers of growth within like the DV, Blondo, and I guess SM Mexico as well as we go into 2016? Where are you expecting to see the most growth out of, I guess, newly-acquired businesses?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I think that you had them in the right order. I would say Dolce Vita is first.
Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
Okay.
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Blondo would be second, and SM Mexico would be third. Part of that is the function of the size of those businesses though. Dolce Vita is just a significantly bigger business than the other two. On a percentage basis, we're going to see quite – we expect to see quite strong growth in Blondo.
And in SM Mexico, again, on a constant currency basis, we're looking for strong growth. But, unfortunately at this moment, when we translate that back to U.S. dollars, that FX impact is chewing up a lot of that growth.
Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
Okay. Got it. And then, I guess, in terms of some of the newness that you're seeing in footwear and now that we're cycled through kind of the winter season, can you just talk about what you're seeing in terms of dress, sneakers or any other categories that are really standing out to you guys right now?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Clearly, fashion sneakers is a category that we're just really excited about. What we're seeing there really exceeded our expectations, and we've really just developed a really strong presence in that category. We went from having one real Hall of Fame style to now having a full collection in the category, and with high tops, low tops, flip-ons, lace-ups, all performing. And I think that, particularly, if you look at really fashion footwear players at our price point, we've really developed a market leadership position in this category. So, we're really excited about that.

Dress shoes, you mentioned, and you hit the nail on the head there, because that's also been a really strong category for us, particularly, the opened up dress shoes, the dress sandals, we're really excited about, particularly some of the things that we're doing out of Brazil. We're having an opportunity to do more products out of Brazil because of the strength of the U.S. dollar against the real. And we think we've got some great product coming out of there with a real strong price value proposition, and the customer is really responding to it.
So, those are a couple of categories that we're probably the most excited about. I guess I'd also call out heavy heels as something that's really important right now. Anything with the leg wrap continues to do well. So, we've got a good amount of trends to sink our teeth into which we're pleased about.
Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
Okay. And then, I guess, just longer-term, I mean, you guys have talked about an operating margin in the mid-teens. How comfortable are you with that target at this point and kind of how are you thinking about the path or the timeframe to get there? Thanks.
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I think that there is – we continue to think that that's the right long-term target. I don't think there's anything structurally that's going to lead us to believe that we can't get there. However, we're looking this year to be essentially flat, the guidance implies essentially flat op margins. And so, I think that we have to – it's going to be a couple of years before we can get to that mid-teen target.
Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
Got it. And then, sorry. Just one more clarification. The buyback is not included in your EPS guidance for the year, is that correct?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Correct.
Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
Okay. Thank you, guys.
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer

We'll take our next question from Jay Sole with Morgan Stanley.
Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning.
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, Jay.
Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Just wondering if we can dig into the guidance a little bit. Just on gross margin and SG&A, how are you thinking about those two line items; and then as well as the cadence for earnings growth as we go through the four quarters of the year?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Sure. Yeah, so I mentioned the flat op margin. I think that we think there's some opportunity for modest gross margin improvement. But at this sales growth rate, we would give a little bit of that back in terms of higher SG&A as a percentage of sales, and that's how we get to the flat operating margin for the year.
In terms of the earnings throughout the year with a quarterly breakdown, I don't think there's a heck of a lot to call out in terms of seasonality that's different from what you've seen previously other than that in some respect, I think Q1 is our toughest quarter at least in comparison to the prior year. I think that we're looking for little to no EPS growth in Q1, and the reason for that in addition to just what we've already laid out, which is wholesale customers taking a cautious approach coming off this tough fall holiday season. But, in Q1, it's really where we're seeing the pressure on the handbag business.
And we've seen, particularly in the off-price channel, we've seen a pullback in that handbag category. We felt that in Q4. We're feeling that again in Q1 as those off-price retailers have elected to, or because there's so much excess inventory out there, they've elected to buy close-outs as opposed to upfront buys from us. So, that's creating some pressure on Q1. The good news is that we see that coming back for Q2 and our order file supports that. So I think that pressure will ease as we go forward, but that's definitely a little bit of a headwind in Q1.

Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Got it. And then if I can just ask one fashion question. Can you touch on men's? How is that business been developing? What's your expectation for the year in men's?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So, men's was another business that came under pressure in Q4. And as business slowed down, as boots did not perform well and we saw retailers start to pull back because they were seeing their inventories get a little out of whack, we actually felt that pretty acutely in men's even more so than in women's in Q4. So, we had a decline in the men's business in Q4. We're still – again, that's another one that we've got some pressure on Q1 as retailers continue to try to get their inventory in line. But again, here, we see this business picking back up for Q2 based on the order file that we have in hand and the conversations that we had with our retailers at the PLATFORM Show in Las Vegas last week. So that business, again, a little bit of pressure in Q1, but we see that coming back in for Q2.
And you asked about the fashion. The thing that's helping us, I think, in Q2 and going forward is that the dress category, specifically the fashion dress category is coming back. And that's a category that we have a very nice position in.
Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Got it. Thanks so much.
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Jay.

We'll take our next question from Corinna Van der Ghinst with Citi.
Corinna Gayle Van der Ghinst - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Hi. Good morning, Ed, Derek. Could you maybe talk about or give us a sense of percentage-wise maybe of how much of your second tier business is moving towards an in-line model as opposed to purchasing SMUs upfront? And are you concerned about the change in visibility that that creates and just in terms of potential cannibalization from your more traditional in-line wholesale accounts like Macy's?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
No. We're definitely not concerned about it. In fact, I think that it's a positive development for some of these retailers to do more of that business and really have the most fashion forward product that we have. And it's also helping them to raise their AURs to some degree. In terms of a percentage, it's still a relatively small percentage of that overall pie that you're talking about. I don't have the number, but it's a small percentage, still.
Corinna Gayle Van der Ghinst - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Okay. Great. And then, I was wondering how e-commerce performed versus your expectations this quarter? Did you guys see a greater shift within your direct-to-consumer channel this holiday? And can you maybe talk about some of the initiatives that you have on the docket this year as you lap the replatforming from last year?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, e-commerce did outperform bricks-and-mortar for us in Q4 as it did for most. We were up about 13% comp in our e-comm business. That does not include the growth which was much stronger than that in Canada because we launched the new stevemadden.ca last year. But that will come into the comp, I believe, in Q2 of this year.
But we're continuing to see real strong performance out of our e-commerce business. We're very pleased with what we're seeing from that channel, and there's a lot of things we continue to work on just to strengthen it. As you know, we're still in the process of bringing some of our brands on to the new platform, and the next one is going to be Dolce Vita, which we hope to get up on our new platform sometime in June-July.
Corinna Gayle Van der Ghinst - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)

Okay. Great. And then just lastly kind of a bigger picture question on supply chain. You guys have clearly had a competitive advantage in terms of your speed-to-market. Just as the broader industry also kind of shifts from initial open-to-buys to more at-once orders, are you guys seeing more of your competitors move to a faster model or model that's closer to home? Or can you give us your thoughts on where you guys stand versus the competition?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I think that everybody's trying to get faster, and that just creates pressure on us to continue to try to get faster as well. At this moment, I still think we have a speed-to-market advantage over our key competitors and it's going to be a strategic imperative for us to continue with that.
Corinna Gayle Van der Ghinst - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Great. Thank you.
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer

We'll take our next question from Taposh Bari with Goldman Sachs.
Taposh Bari - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Hey, guys. Good morning. Ed, question for you. So, a lot of your retailers are struggling, has been an ongoing theme for a while, not sure when it ends. But, I guess, the question for you is do you feel like your fate is dependent on their success at a high level? Maybe ask this a different way: you have things like acquisitions, international DTC opportunities, I'm curious to see if those are areas that you are looking to accelerate in light of the environment that you are managing through in the U.S.
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I think that that's a – it's a good point you're raising. And certainly, we do have to look for some alternative places to grow when some of our key wholesale customers are not showing a lot of growth. So, international is clearly a big priority here. You saw the strong performance we had in 2015 and we're very focused on continuing to grow that business.
You are seeing us grow our direct-to-consumer business faster than the wholesale business. We're adding particularly new stores on the outlet side as well as growing our e-commerce business and, in fact, the growth from the new brands. So, all that is important.
That being said, the U.S. wholesale footwear, in particular, market is still very, very important to us. And we need to find out how to grow there. And we're working pretty hard with our wholesale partners to do that. We're also looking at some of the channels that are showing faster growth. So, whether that's some of the pure play e-commerce guys or some of the off-price retailers, we're looking at ways to grow with them.
Taposh Bari - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. And then just a quick follow-up on the category, call it, fashion footwear for teen, women, that you obviously are concentrated in. About a year ago, it feels like that's when your tone improved for the first time in a while. Do you feel like – are you still feeling equally as optimistic on the fashion cycle for the product that you are operating in? And if not, what's changed?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I do. I feel quite good about where we are in the fashion cycle and the opportunities that we have available to us in terms of fashion trends to capitalize on. So that part I'm not worried about.
Taposh Bari - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Okay. Thanks, guys.
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer

And we'll take our next question from Jessica Schmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jessica L. Schmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, just given some of the heavier inventories in the channel, can you talk about what you are seeing in terms of pre-buys with the off-price channel? I know you mentioned fewer upfront orders in handbags, but what are you seeing in footwear?

Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I think that if you look at at least our numbers compared to last year, it looks a little bit better in footwear. But keep in mind, we had a pullback in 2015 for that very reason that some of the off-pricers were electing to buy fewer upfront goods, and focusing more on closeouts. So I think that business has now stabilized and we can grow off that slightly smaller base. But we have not really – I just also want to say we haven't seen the pendulum swing back either to where it was pre-2015. So we're looking for a kind of modest growth in that channel in footwear and, again, some pressure in that channel in handbags.
Jessica L. Schmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Great. Thanks. And just quickly on the handbag market, so it seems like that's gotten more challenging. You mentioned excess inventory. I guess, where are you seeing this? And just given some of the changes you've made in 2014 to your offering, how are you positioned if the environment does get more promotional?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Well, in terms of where we're seeing the promotions, I mean, I think that's pretty widespread across the spectrum. It was particularly in holiday a pretty promotional category. In terms of what we're doing from a product perspective, I still feel that we're on the right track. And, as I said, despite the sort of near-term headwind in Q1, we do see that with this business starting to rebound in Q2 and I think that we'll be back on a better path as we move into the back half.
Jessica L. Schmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
And then just quickly, are you seeing any performance differences by region? I know that you had talked about some tourist-impacted areas a while ago. I was wondering if you were seeing anything in maybe some oil-impacted regions and if any of the tourist markets have seen some improvement?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. In terms of the regions that would be impacted by oil, we just don't have a very heavy exposure there. We have seen some impacted traffic in sales. But it's not a needle-mover for our overall retail business or our overall consolidated results.
The one thing that we've called out that we continue to see is this weakness in New York City, which we attribute to the tourism impact. Again, in Q4, while we had a 6% consolidated comp, we had a down comp in New York City. And I think that we're still seeing pressure there. I think that, hopefully, we're going to start to lap this in a couple of months and be able to start to see some positive comps there again, but we're not there yet.
Jessica L. Schmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Thanks. I'll pass it along.
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer

We'll take our next question from Jeff Van Sinderen with B. Riley.
Jeff Van Sinderen - B. Riley & Co.
Good morning. And I'd just like to have a follow-up on the retail segment. Maybe you could just touch a little more on the performance of your outlet stores versus full-price? And then maybe also how your newest outlet units are performing versus your plan? And then I know you also mentioned the – I think there was a closure of one New York store, maybe just if you can touch on that.
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Sure. The outlets are performing well. We're pleased with what we're seeing there. They were actually stronger than the full-price stores in fourth quarter. For the full year, outlets were up about 13.3% and full-price stores were up 10.5%. So, both quite strong, but a little bit stronger in outlet. And we're also pleased with what we're seeing in the profitability there. The four-wall operating margins are a touch higher now in outlets than they are in full-price stores.

In terms of the new stores, we're also on track in terms of productivity of the new stores. So we're pleased with what we're seeing there. And you'll see us open another, say, 10 to 12 outlets again in 2016.
In terms of the store closure, I think you might be referring to in first quarter of last year; we closed our 5th Avenue location. I can't think of anything else in New York that closed since then.
Jeff Van Sinderen - B. Riley & Co.
Okay. Got it. Yeah, that's what I was thinking of. Thanks. And then as far as international, just maybe any more color you can give us on where you are most confident that you can grow this year, what sort of progress we should look for, maybe by country there this year?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Well, overall, again, international remains a real important growth opportunity for us. I think that I still view the Middle East as a really important growth region for us. And I think we should see some nice growth there in 2016. We've got very strong partner in the UAE as well as in Saudi Arabia as well as in Israel. So we're excited about that. And I'm also – we're working on some things in Europe, which, hopefully, we'll be able to talk about on the next call, which should fuel some growth in that region as well.
Jeff Van Sinderen - B. Riley & Co.
Okay. And then finally, is there anything in terms of opportunities you might have this year for sourcing, supply chain, anything that's shifting there that could potentially help you?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I think the biggest thing is, is what I mentioned earlier, which is being able to – because of the strength of the U.S. dollar, we're able to work more in terms of – in some other regions that we haven't been able to as much of late. So we're doing a lot more sourcing out of Brazil. That's probably the most important. But we're also doing more sourcing out of Italy. And we think that we're able to get product with – that just really has a real value to the consumer out of those countries, and it's a product that just frankly wasn't affordable for our price point a few years ago. So, that's probably the most significant thing.
Obviously, there's been the revaluation in China as well, and we are capturing some benefit from that. Some of that we're putting back into the product to try to increase the value proposition there, and some of it we'll capture in gross margin and, of course, some of it we'll have to share with our wholesale customers.
Jeff Van Sinderen - B. Riley & Co.
Got it. Okay. Thanks very much and good luck for the rest of the quarter.
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Jeff.

We'll take our next question from Sam Poser with Sterne Agee.
Sam Poser - Sterne Agee CRT
Good morning. Thank you for taking my call. Ed, just real quick, what share count should we use for the full year?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Given that we don't have any buybacks in the guidance, it should be pretty similar to where it was in 2015.
Sam Poser - Sterne Agee CRT
So about 61 million?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, that's a round number.
Sam Poser - Sterne Agee CRT
Okay. And then, when you look at the same-store sales for the year ahead – I mean, you had some really good numbers. I mean, should we be thinking about low single-digits with Q2 being in the flat range? Is that a good way to think about it? Or do you think you'd do a little better than that?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
We don't – we really don't provide comp guidance, so I'll leave that to you to build your model there.
Sam Poser - Sterne Agee CRT
You can always change what you do.
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer

I appreciate. I appreciate the offer.
Sam Poser - Sterne Agee CRT
When we looked at, like, Macy's and Dillard's just came out with their numbers the other day, and their inventories look like they were pretty much in line with sales. Are they beginning to get clean? The guidance that you are providing, was that guidance basically as what you were seeing as of December 30, or is this guidance as to what you are seeing today?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
The guidance incorporates our most updated thinking. In terms of inventory in the channel, yes, I do believe that retailers – many of our wholesale customers have moved through a lot of inventory recently. I think they are getting cleaner. I wouldn't say that across the board, everybody is exactly where they'd like to be. But they're certainly much better than they were at the end of December.
Sam Poser - Sterne Agee CRT
At then at PLATFORM, there was some commentary on some of your new product, I believe it was some of the open-toed dress, some of the sneakers and a few others, and I think some of the flat sandals that you were already starting to see some reorders now. I just want to – I think it was one of the first questions asked. I mean, the guidance you've given is basically your visibility now, but that's going to probably change a lot by the end of March when Easter comes and depending what the spring looks like. Is that a fair statement?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, that's a fair statement. And as you know, Sam, relative to – many of our competitors or many of the companies that you guys look at, we work close to season and we chase pretty darn well because of our speed-to-market capability. So, there is clearly potential for things to get better, but this is what we see today.
Sam Poser - Sterne Agee CRT
And then lastly, you talked about Brazil and Italy. Can you give some idea of sort of the percentage that you produced in 2015 out of those markets or shipped out of those markets versus what that percent of your total buys are looking like for 2016? Because I would think you're going to save a lot of money on freight and you can make smaller runs without it costing you a fortune out of those markets as compared to China, if I'm not mistaken.
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I would say, if you look at what we're ordering right now, and we're just talking about the Steve Madden line because, of course, many of the more moderately price lines are still exclusively out of China. But if we think about just Steve Madden, it's only around 50% out of China; we've got 15% out of Brazil; another 15% out of Mexico; 10% out of Italy; and about 10% other, which would include India and some other places. I hope that added up to 100%.
Sam Poser - Sterne Agee CRT
It was a little more, but...
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
But anyway, I don't have off the top of my head what Brazil and Italy were last year, but meaningfully smaller than that.
Sam Poser - Sterne Agee CRT
And when you combine Mexico, which I also gather would be growing, when you add Mexico in those three countries, you're talking about the ability to come a lot faster to market and at significantly less freight cost, I would think, on a year-over-year basis.
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
That's right.
Sam Poser - Sterne Agee CRT
Okay, well, thank you. Thank you very much and good luck.
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Sam.

We'll take our next question from Scott Krasik with Buckingham Research Group. Mr. Krasik, your line is open.
Scott D. Krasik - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
Yeah. Sorry about that. Thanks for squeezing me at the end here. Just some follow-ups, international, what percentage of sales was it in 2015?

Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
11%.
Scott D. Krasik - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
11%. And then, DV, how much in sales roughly?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
It was around $80 million in 2015.
Scott D. Krasik - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
Okay. And then Blondo, if I remember correctly, the U.S. portion when you bought it was sub-$10 million; is that...?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yes.
Scott D. Krasik - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
Okay. Good, thanks. And then, the DV at Target rollout, both shoes and handbags, is that all 1Q? Is that spaced out over 1Q, 2Q? What's the expectation for fall? And just generally speaking, how meaningful can this be?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Just one clarification on Blondo. It was sub-$10 million when we bought it in the U.S., not anymore.
Scott D. Krasik - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
Right.
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
In terms of DV, yeah, the initial shipments there were in Q4 of 2015. So you did have that showing up in last year's numbers in December. So, you'll see more of that throughout the year. I'm sorry, what was the – and what was the final part of the question?
Scott D. Krasik - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
Well, just what is the plan for fall going forward? And then, how meaningful is this compared to, maybe, Candy's or Peak or some of the other big programs you've had?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Look, it's an important brand for them. It's all door in shoes and bags, and it's doing very well. It's exceeding plan. In terms of what the sales numbers look like, that's particularly for something like this that's one account, we don't disclose that.
Scott D. Krasik - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
But you are going forward for fall in both categories?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Yeah. We expect this to be a long-term brand in the store.
Scott D. Krasik - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
And then, it seems like there are a lot of tailwinds in terms of the gross margin outlook for 2016, but you're only guiding to modest improvement. We would have expected, I guess, a little more recovery. So, what's holding that back?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Well, I just think that it's a challenging overall environment. That's all. And so, I hope that we can get a little bit more than what I articulated earlier, but this is what we're seeing at the moment.
Scott D. Krasik - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
So, assumptions around additional markdown support could be an upside, a place for upside, or you're just forced to compete and to get market share, you have to give better term upfront pricing. What's the...
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Well, look, we have not assumed any material improvement over 2015 in terms of markdown support. So, if we can do better than we did last year, that would be upside.
Scott D. Krasik - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
Okay. That makes sense. And then did you say how many stores you're going to open in 2016?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Derek, you want to...
Derek Browe - Director of Finance and Investor Relations
We didn't, Scott. The plan is to do five to seven full-price store openings, but that's going to be mainly in Canada and Mexico. And then on the outlet side, I think Ed commented that that's an area we'll continue to focus openings. We're looking at 10 to 12.
Scott D. Krasik - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
Okay. Awesome. Thanks very much, guys.
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Scott.

We'll take our next question from Corinna Freedman with BB&T.
Corinna Lynn Freedman - BB&T Capital Markets
Hi. Good morning, guys. Quick question on the apparel for Dolce Vita. It does appear to be a bit more refined than its previous foray into apparel. I'm wondering if you can talk about the changes in strategy there going forward? And then does this open the door for standalone retail stores that would include apparel?
And then my second question is on the core Steve Madden line, are there any other opportunities in dress and athletics to take up pricing? It does seem like you have more styles over $100 this year than you did last year. Thank you.
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Sure. Yeah. In terms of the Dolce Vita apparel, as you point out, they – prior to us acquiring the business, they did have an apparel line for a few years. And it actually did pretty well, was not a tiny business. But I think – but they had closed it prior to us acquiring the business and the reason was I think that they felt that while it was doing well, it wasn't 100% aligned with the footwear and wasn't really consistent with the vision for the brand. And so, we've now licensed it out and worked very closely with the licensee to make sure that this apparel line really has that Dolce Vita brand essence. And I think it's much more in line with what we're doing to shoes, and we're really pleased about it. So, we're excited to see how that does when it starts shipping in fall of this year.
In terms of AURs, we'll see selectively where we can try to push price. If we have great quality dress shoes, for instance, out of Brazil, there may be an opportunity to get a little bit more on those products. But given an overall environment that's not particularly robust, we also want to be careful about trying to push price too much. We really want to make sure we're delivering great value for the price.
Corinna Lynn Freedman - BB&T Capital Markets
Great. Thank you so much.

We'll take our next question from Steve Marotta with (sic) C.L. King & Associates.
Steven L. Marotta - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.
Good morning, Ed and Derek.
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Good morning.
Steven L. Marotta - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.
Considering that seasonal weather patterns play such a large role in retail traffic trends, and there is an inventory overhang currently with a little bit of winter merchandise in the wholesale channel, what's better for Steve Madden in the next four weeks if we were to look for mile markers as it pertains to weather? Is it cold weather in order to clean up? What – is this winter overhang in the wholesale channel, or is it warmer weather in order to spur your full-price selling? What are you rooting for?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I think we'd still rather have warm weather and sell a lot of the spring goods.
Steven L. Marotta - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.
That's helpful. And second question is, I had to join the call late. Did you comment at all on quarter-to-date trends either at wholesale or company-owned retail?
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
We did not.
Steven L. Marotta - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.
Still a few minutes left in the call.
Edward R. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
No. I don't think so.
Steven L. Marotta - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.
