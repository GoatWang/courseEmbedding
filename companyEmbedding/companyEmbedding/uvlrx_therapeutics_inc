				    What is the UVLrx System    Light is therapeutic – a fact that has been validated by countless clinical investigations conducted over decades.  We know more about how light affects the human body than some of our more common pharmaceutical agents.  The delivery of light has assumed many forms: thermal light for tissue ablation; transdermal light for photobiomodulation of superficial subdermal tissue; extracorporeal light for blood irradiation. Each delivery method serves a very specific function in medicine and has a strong clinical foundation.  At the same time, each delivery method has well-defined therapeutic limitations.  For instance, extracorporeal light irradiation requires the removal of blood from the body for therapeutic light exposure before being returned to the body. Limitations become immediately apparent:Patient discomfort observing extraction of bloodOften uses unstable, heat producing light sourceForeign body response triggeredUse of a prescription anti-coagulantApproximately 5% of blood can only be treatedUVLrx Therapeutics Inc. looks to challenge the traditional methods of light delivery, removing the limitations that have continued to hamper the promise of this therapy.  The UVLrx Treatment System™ is the first direct-to-blood intravenous light therapy system. It generates light energy within the UVLrx Station™ that is delivered through a flexible fiber optic to our patent-pending UVLrx Dry Light Adapter™ (DLA) – an accessory that integrates into a standard 20-gauge x 1″ intravascular catheter and delivers light directly within the blood vessel.  Accordingly, there is no extraction of blood required, there is no loss of light caused by skin absorption, and there is no limitation in the total volume of blood exposed to the therapeutic wavelengths.  It is intravenous light therapy delivered directly within a blood vessel, treating all blood and blood-based components moving past the IV catheter.Key benefits emerge from the direct-to-blood intervention of the UVLrx Treatment System™.  First, integration into a standard IV catheter eases the burden of use.  There is no need to initiate an additional catheter site to accommodate the treatment. Second, there is no foreign body response as the blood remains within its natural environment.  Third, and most important, nearly 100% of a patient’s total blood volume can receive a therapeutic dose of light, maximizing the health benefits.An additional feature of the UVLrx Treatment System™ is the application of multiple wavelengths concurrently.  Most light-based treatments deliver a single wavelength, which in turn, limits their therapeutic potential.  A disease or condition has a complex pathophysiology, involving numerous biochemical pathways.  Therefore, suppression or activation of a single pathway may provide a fleeting clinical response as it fails to address the other involved pathways. An example of this is the use of extracorporeal ultraviolet blood irradiation for the treatment of a blood-borne pathogen. UV light is a powerful antimicrobial agent; however, UV light alone would not enhance the immune system’s response or assuage the stress and damage caused by the pathogen.  A polychromatic, multiple wavelength, delivery platform uses specific wavelengths to affect multiple biochemical cascades involved in a diseased state.    Device Overview  Patients  Physicians      Back to top       Connect NowYour Name (required)  Your Phone number (required)  Your Email (required)
