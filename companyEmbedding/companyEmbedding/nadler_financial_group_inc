Wealth Management

Nadler Financial Group provides investment advisory and wealth management services to high net worth individuals and corporate sponsored retirement plans. Independent and fee-based, we are free to design portfolios and choose investments that are in the best interests of our clients. Our mission is the same as yours: to grow the value of your portfolio while managing risks over the long-term.
As an SEC-registered investment advisor, we have a relationship with Charles Schwab Advisory Services that allows us to offer discount brokerage services, state-of-the-art technology, and a large selection of no-load mutual funds, institutionally-priced mutual funds, and exchange traded funds (ETFs).  Our clients receive monthly statements directly from Charles Schwab, and we report on the financial markets and investment performance on a quarterly basis.


Strong Leader, Strong Team

We strive to help make our clients feel comfortable that their investments and their portfolio allocations are being carefully managed by our firm on an ongoing basis.  Our Investment Committee, led by our CIO, Michael Nadler, and comprised of the firm’s wealth managers, analyzes the economy and financial markets and develops and implements investment allocation strategies customized to each investor's needs.  As both financial planners and wealth managers, Nadler Financial Group brings extensive experience in estate, insurance, income tax investment, and retirement planning to each client’s specific financial situation.


Our Approach*

Ongoing communication with our clients is very important to our success.  In addition to regular updates on your performance and commentary on prevailing changes in the economy and financial markets, we request that our clients meet with us on an ongoing basis.  The reason is that we believe that we can help to manage your wealth more effectively if we understand what is happening in your life.  The birth of a child?  Change in career?  Want to retire earlier or later than planned?  These and other similar changes will impact our investment decisions.  Our friendly and responsive professional staff has many years of experience and is always available to answer your questions and handle day-to-day account service requests.

What are analysts saying about NCI stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about NCI stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "NCI, Inc. is a leading provider of information technology services and solutions to U.S. federal government agencies. NCI's award-winning expertise encompasses areas critical to its customers' mission objectives including enterprise systems management, information assurance, network engineering, and systems development and integration.   " (5/13/2017)
2. Cowen and Company analysts commented, "NCIT offers an attractive risk/reward profile as its peer-low valuation (5.9x EV/EBITDA)." (4/10/2017)
3. FBR & Co analysts commented, "We take a neutral perspective on NCI shares for the time being, although we are encouraged by the efforts that the company is taking to position itself for success in an evolving government IT landscape. CEO Paul Dillahay was appointed in October 2016, and we believe he is taking steps to increase NCI’s ability to capture new business. Given that we estimate that this company has a very strong recompete win rate, the base upon which the team can build appears fairly stable. That being said, we think that the company has outsized dependence on a few larger contracts —like the PEO Soldier contract that we estimate accounted for 16% of revenue in 2016—and there may be a near-term sentiment overhang on the stock related to the recently disclosed alleged embezzlement by the former controller. The company does have significant capabilities in agile software development, and we believe management’s approach is inspired; there could be an opportunity to become more constructive in the future, but for the time being, we think that remaining on the sidelines would be advisable."

Consensus Ratings for NCI (NASDAQ:NCIT) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 3 Hold Ratings, 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.25)Consensus Price Target: $18.33 (7.99% downside)

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
