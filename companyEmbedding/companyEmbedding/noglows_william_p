William P. Noglows


What went wrong: In July 2004, Mr. Noglows announced that Cabot had lost a major customer, which had accounted for 15% of its business. The loss led to a 12.6% drop in fiscal 2005 revenue. Aurora-based Cabot, which makes slurries � abrasive liquid polishers used to manufacture semiconductor chips and other computer parts � also had to drop its prices to maintain long-term agreements with four large Asian customers because of competition from other chemical manufacturers, like Rohm & Haas Co. in Philadelphia.

Highest-paidnon-CEOsThe area's top 25
GO


The strategy: Mr. Noglows, who has been CEO since 2003, is increasing Cabot's presence in Asia, where most computer parts are made. Earlier this year, he moved Cabot's division that makes the slurries for data storage devices to Singapore. Last October, Cabot opened a second research and development center in Geino, Japan (the other one is in Singapore). And in April, Cabot started distributing its product directly to customers in Taiwan instead of using a third-party distributor, enabling its sales staff to have closer contact.
Mr. Noglows is also trying to make Cabot less dependent on the volatile semiconductor industry by researching new uses for its polishing technology, such as selling it to companies that make airplane parts.
Did it work? "The company's progress has been very good," says Dmitry Silversteyn, an analyst at Longbow Research in Independence, Ohio. "It's becoming more efficient and getting results."
In his defense: Mr. Noglows declined to be interviewed. Bill Johnson, the company's chief financial officer, says Cabot is disappointed with last year's financial performance but is repositioning itself with new products. "Those should provide benefit over the long term," he says.
