History[edit]
MakeMyTrip was founded by Deep Kalra, an alumnus of Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad.[6] It was launched in the US market in 2000 to cater to the overseas Indian community for their US-to-India travel needs.[7] MakeMyTrip started its Indian operations in September 2005,[8] offering online flight tickets to Indian travellers. The company also started to focus on non-air businesses like holiday packages and hotel bookings. On 13 August 2010, MakeMyTrip was listed on the NASDAQ[9] and went public, making a debut in the US market.
In 2011, the company created several travel-related apps[10] for all types of mobile devices (smartphones and basic cellphones). In the same year, MakeMyTrip also made three acquisitions,[11] namely, Luxury Tours and Travel Private Limited (Singapore), Le Travenues Technology Private Limited (Gurgaon, India) and My Guest House Accommodation (New Delhi, India). MakeMyTrip's other acquisitions include travel operators like ITC Group and Hotel Travel Group to enter new markets in the South-East Asian region in the year 2012. In June 2015, MakeMyTrip invested $3 million in Inspirock, a vacation itinerary planning website.[12] In September 2014, MakeMyTrip instituted a $15 million innovation fund to support early stage companies in the travel space.[citation needed]
MakeMyTrip acquired Mygola, a travel planning website in April 2015. The acquisition was done through the innovation fund and as part of the acquisition all employees of MyGola were absorbed into the MakeMyTrip team.[13]
In July 2015, MakeMyTrip invested in travel information and hotel review portal, HolidayIQ to pick up 28% stake in the company.[14] In the same month, it also invested $5 million in Bona Vita Technologies, a start-up which plans to utilize the funds to build innovative products in the travel industry.[15]

MakeMyTrip acquired Mygola, a travel planning website in April 2015. The acquisition was done through the innovation fund and as part of the acquisition all employees of MyGola were absorbed into the MakeMyTrip team.[13]
In July 2015, MakeMyTrip invested in travel information and hotel review portal, HolidayIQ to pick up 28% stake in the company.[14] In the same month, it also invested $5 million in Bona Vita Technologies, a start-up which plans to utilize the funds to build innovative products in the travel industry.[15]
In November 2015, MakeMyTrip launched a new offering called Value+, in the quality budget hotels category.[16]
