WrestleMania Promos Take Over Orlando

A week of magic and mayhem has ended as World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) presented WrestleMania 33 – professional wrestling’s annual promo-filled Super Bowl inside Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Florida. And, Counselor was on the scene to see all of the promotions that sponsors and hosts were running.

An all-time Orlando Citrus Bowl attendance record of 75,245 fans from 50 states and 62 countries made the pilgrimage to witness their favorite athletes clash at the nearly seven-hour event. WrestleMania 33 gained a record 18 million social media fan engagements, up 66% from last year. Digital and social media video views reached 133 million, skyrocketing 105% from 2016. For the first time, WrestleMania was made available in China on a pay-per-view basis via PPTV’s digital platform.
“WrestleMania made a triumphant return to Orlando and again broke multiple records,” said WWE Executive Vice President of Special Events John Saboor in a press release. “This success would not have been possible without the tireless support of Mayor Dyer, the Local Organizing Committee and all of the public and private sector partners throughout Central Florida.”
WrestleMania 33 grossed $14.5 million in revenue, down from the company’s record $17.3 million for last year’s event. It also generated an estimated $125 million in economic impact for the Central Florida area. That’s why each year cities bid on hosting the pop culture extravaganza – New Orleans has been chosen over Philadelphia and Minneapolis to hold WrestleMania 34 next year as part of the city’s tricentennial celebration.

"WrestleMania Week was a tremendous success for the city of Orlando and it was an honor to host WWE and their fans back in our community," said Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer. "This is a testament to the investments we've made in our community venues that continue to attract these showcase events and solidify Orlando as the nation's leading sports and entertainment destination." Orlando is home to many WWE operations including its developmental brand NXT and its training facility the WWE Performance Center.
As soon as fans arrived at Orlando International Airport, they were greeted by WrestleMania signs at baggage claim and rental car stations. The streets of downtown Orlando were plastered in WrestleMania banners showcasing top stars such as Brock Lesnar and Goldberg. There was even a 30-foot-wide, 12-foot-high championship belt replica on display at Lake Eola.  
Throughout the week, fans mobbed the Orange County Convention Centerin Orlando for WrestleMania Axxess, an annual fan fest with autograph signings, exhibits and merchandise. Attendees scooped up hats, shirts, wrist bands, posters, foam hands, and inflatable Bailey buddies, all emblazoned with the WrestleMania and WWE logos. Snickers sponsored the event for the second straight year, giving out free candy bars and sharing clips through social media and YouTube. During the WrestleMania broadcast, an ad featured WWE Hall of Famer Ric Flair and WWE Superstars Charlotte and James Ellsworth as part of the “You’re Not You When You're Hungry" campaign.

Coffee Mug Is Popular Promo for News Station

Los Angeles Tribune  TV station’s KTLA 5 will be celebrating a milestone anniversary with an iconic  item that appeals to a wide target audience. 
The “Anchor Desk”  drinkware, which is placed prominently on the studio desk during broadcasts, is  a 15-oz. coffee mug. When the station worked with its distributor partner to  develop a giveaway program celebrating 70 years of broadcasting, a special  anniversary edition of this mug was the logical item. The mugs have been a coveted  giveaway among viewers over the years.

Beginning on KTLA’s  70th anniversary date, the “Watch and Win” promotion gives viewers  in the Los Angeles area the opportunity to text the station with a specific  code word during its daily broadcast. KTLA then chooses winning viewers to  receive a special-edition anniversary branded mug that matches the official  Anchor Desk drinkware. The station was provided with 2,500 of the double-sided  mugs. The promotion will run all year, and if the anchor mugs’ popularity is  any indicator, they’ll continue to drive many viewers to enter the contest.

Surfs Up

Luxury  swimwear brand Basta Surf’s identity is built on a line of  conscientiously-produced beach apparel aimed at discriminating customers.  Shoring up that brand identity means that even the hang tags on Basta’s  products must reflect values of quality, subtlety and an environmentally  conscious worldview.
So, when  Basta approached its distributor partner with an idea for a seeded hangtag, the  rep knew just the right product. She suggested the seeded paper hang tag, an  idea that became a resounding success. “They wanted to elevate their brand,”  the rep says. “They thought that this would be effective in showing their earth  consciousness and organic materials.” 

Basta  donates a part of its profits to causes that promote clean water. The company  promoted this eco-conscious initiative on the back of the letter-pressed tags.  Beyond complementing Basta’s environmental efforts, the wildflower-seeded tags  promote a free-and-fruitful attitude that is in keeping with Basta’s worldview.  The rep adds: “It allows the business to show the customer they are thinking of  them in other ways than just selling swimwear.”

	GoToMarket and digital transformation company, Visulon, in apparel, footwear and accessories domain, announced electronic Brand Review software. BrandReVue, as it is named, will replace current manual and expensive design review process that uses PDF/ Photoshop images, and foam core boards with stickers and post-its.

	Building on it’s experience with New York-based premier accessories brands, Visulon designed and developed innovative, cloud-connected, real-time electronic boards to display in meeting room using large screen TV, Wi-Fi, and projections.

	Working in tandem with Visulon’s award-winning visual planning platform, it gives management team’s ability to deep dive into high-resolution product images in 2D or 3D along attributes, and historical data.

	BrandRvue allows real-time collaboration for the teams to join and comment during the review process from the global locations, saving time and travel costs.

	The innovative review platform also allows saving comments and changes on to the cloud. The team can share or even export the boards to PDF, PPT or XLS. The days of hauling foam core boards and printing photoshop images are now replaced by cloud-based real-time electronic Brand ReVue.

	Contact us for demo or write to us for more information info@visulon.com
