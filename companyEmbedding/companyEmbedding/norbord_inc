Solarbord

Claude St. Hilaire of Home Energy Group in South Carolina says:
“Here in the Carolina’s we have seen on average a 1/2 ton HVAC sizing reduction on homes using the Solarbord Radiant Barrier OSB roof sheathing. Builders are able to save money on the HVAC equipment, roughly $500 to $600 per house and the homeowner gets the energy savings for the life of the home.”
Dave Erickson of Grayhawk Homes praises Solarbord.
Dave Erickson from Grayhawk Homes talks about Energy Star Certification, and how Solarbord helped him get there.
“We are proud to have Norbord as a partner in our efforts to build energy efficient homes. Energy efficiency takes a number of professionals from various industries working together on a common goal and we are happy to be working with Norbord as one of our partners to create energy efficient homes that are high quality and cost effective.” says Dave
To learn more about Homes’ secret to energy efficiency success click here.
Architect Elizabeth Kaufman from Grapevine, Texas said this about Solarbord.
“I have long been skeptical of radiant barrier products. I was completely surprised when I found that the shell building I inspected yesterday was 80-90 degrees inside. It was 106 outside!!! The only possible explanation was the Norbord Solarbord decking. The building had no ceilings, no wall insulation, no gypsum board. The windows and doors were not caulked. The windows were low quality, dual pane, not Low-E and faced south and west. I really expected it to be beyond sweltering when I arrived at 1:30 p.m. I had to insist that the door be kept closed to keep the ‘cool’ air inside. I plan to specify this product on future projects.”
It’s a lot cooler.
A house protected by Solarbord® Radiant Barrier Sheathing has a head start on comfort. Up to 97% of radiant heat from the sun is reflected by Solarbord, so the attic will be as much as 30° cooler. This means the rest of the house will certainly be cooler too. Cooler attic. Cooler house.
Lower energy costs.
A house kept comfortable by Solarbord is easy on energy bills. And today a house that conserves energy is a whole lot more attractive to home buyers, so the small additional cost of Solarbord for roofs and walls is a really good investment.
HERS ratings:  Some HERS raters have told us that when Solarbord roof sheathing is used in their markets that they can calculate reduced AC requirements by 1/2 ton.  That’s hundreds of dollars in savings by using Norbord Solarbord structural sheathing.
A cool 25-year warranty.
Solarbord, SFI® Chain of Custody certified, installs like any roof sheathing and gives builders an extra edge in these energy-conscious times. And because it’s made in the USA and backed by a 25-year warranty, you’ll have total confidence in its quality and durability. Make it the crowning achievement of every build. Learn more.

Return to Member Companies page


Norbord Inc. is an international manufacturer of wood-based panels with seventeen plant locations in the United States, Europe and Canada. Fifteen of these operations produce Oriented Strand Board (OSB), making Norbord the world’s largest supplier of OSB, a product used by the building construction industry for roof, wall and floor applications and in industrial market segments including internal furniture components, decorative interior panels and large SIPs panels for roofs and walls.
The OSB operation in 100 Mile House, British Columbia, was built in 1994 to produce JAS grade panels for Japan and still carries the signature branding and color that customers recognize for its quality and value. One of the most advanced OSB operations in Western North America, it is the closest OSB production facility to a major Pacific seaport and is complimented with export focussed operations in Grande Prairie and High Level, Alberta, as well as operations in La Sarre, Quebec, and in the south-eastern USA serving the ports of Savannah and Mobile from Joanna/Kinnards, South Carolina, and Cordele, Georgia. These Norbord operations are strategically located near major seaports making them logistically efficient to service export markets from North America. All Norbord OSB operations are APA-certified and known for consistent quality and reliability, as well as providing PEFC™ Chain of Custody (CoC) certified sustainable products to export markets.
Norbord’s three Western Canadian operations’ access to high quality, abundant and renewable forest resources, advanced mill technology and proximity to Asian markets, combined with the Company’s uncompromised commitment to quality, innovation and customer service, have been the foundation on which Norbord has earned a lead position as a respected OSB supplier in Japan and other Asian countries.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

TORONTO, July 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ - Norbord Inc. (TSX and NYSE:    OSB) today announced that its OSB mill in 100 Mile House, British Columbia resumed production over the weekend after the evacuation order for 100 Mile House and nearby communities was lifted.
On July 10th, Norbord reported that its OSB mill in 100 Mile House had temporarily suspended production in order to comply with evacuation orders due to wild fires burning in the region. 








All mill employees were safely evacuated at the time and the mill was not damaged.  The curtailment is not expected to materially impact Norbord's third quarter results.
The 100 Mile House mill has a stated annual production capacity of 440 million square feet (3/8-inch basis).
