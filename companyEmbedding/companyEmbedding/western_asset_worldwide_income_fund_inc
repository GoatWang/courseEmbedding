Pricing & Performance
Literature





Pricing & Performance

Literature










Performance shown represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Returns based on Market Price assume the reinvestment of all distributions at the Dividend Reinvestment Plan Price and the deduction of all fund expenses. Returns based on NAV assume the reinvestment of all distributions at net asset value and the deduction of all fund expenses. Year-To-Date (YTD) returns are calculated from January 1st of the reporting year and not annualized.
Net Asset Value (NAV) is total assets less total liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding. Market Price, determined by supply and demand, is the price an investor purchases or sells the fund. The Market Price may differ from a fund's NAV.
The Distribution Rate is not guaranteed, subject to change, and is not a quotation of Fund performance. Distribution Rate is calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution amount paid, excluding special distributions, divided by the closing market price or NAV as of the date indicated. Distributions paid by the Fund may be comprised of income, capital gains, and/or return of capital. At year-end the Fund will issue a Form 1099 with the final composition of the distribution for tax purposes. A current estimate of the distribution's composition can be found on each fund's Overview page or in the most recent distribution press release and/or Section 19 notice located in the press release section of each individual product page. The Distribution Rate is not guaranteed, subject to change, and is not a quotation of Fund performance. A return of capital is not taxable and results in a reduction in the tax basis of a shareholder's investment. Please go to the individual product pages for information relating to the composition of the quoted distribution rates. 
 
Effective June 1, 2017, the following Funds changed their security pricing methodology to now use the mean value of the bid and ask prices (of underlying fund holdings) to calculate the NAV: Western Asset Income Fund and Western Asset Premier Bond Fund.  Funds may show a one-time increase of the NAV, which is due to this change in pricing methodology.


























The Closed-End Funds are not sold or distributed by Legg Mason Investor Services, LLC ("LMIS") or any affiliate of Legg Mason, Inc. Unlike open-end funds, shares are not continually offered. Like other public companies, closed-end funds have a one-time initial public offering, and once their shares are first issued, are generally bought and sold through non-affiliated broker/dealers and trade on nationally recognized stock exchanges. Share prices will fluctuate with market conditions and, at the time of sale, may be worth more or less than your original investment. Shares of exchange-traded closed-end funds may trade at a discount or premium to their original offering price, and often trade at a discount to their net asset value. Investment return, market price and net asset value will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. The Funds are subject to investment risks, including the possible loss of principal invested. Note that unlike other closed-end funds, Western Asset Middle Market Debt Fund, and Western Asset Middle Market Income Fund are not publicly traded and closed to new investors.

Western Asset Emerging Markets Income Fund Inc., Western Asset 
      Worldwide Income Fund Inc. and Western Asset Emerging Markets Debt Fund 
      Inc. Announce Board Approval of Proposed Merger Plan




Western Asset Emerging Markets Debt Fund Inc. Announces Board 
      Approval of Changes to Investment Objectives






February 16, 2016 08:45 AM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Western Asset Emerging Markets Income Fund Inc. (NYSE:EMD), Western 
      Asset Worldwide Income Fund Inc. (NYSE:SBW) and Western Asset Emerging 
      Markets Debt Fund Inc. (NYSE:ESD) today announced approval by each 
      Fund’s Board of Directors of a proposal to merge (i) EMD with and into 
      ESD and (ii) SBW with and into ESD, subject to approval by the 
      stockholders of each Fund. The approval of each merger is not contingent 
      upon the approval of the other merger. If approved, the mergers are 
      anticipated to occur during the third quarter of 2016. If the proposed 
      mergers are approved by the stockholders of each Fund, stockholders of 
      EMD and SBW would receive common stock of ESD, based on each Fund’s 
      respective net asset value per share. In lieu of issuing fractional 
      shares, ESD will pay cash to each former stockholder of EMD and SBW in 
      an amount equal to the value of the fractional shares of ESD common 
      stock that the investor would otherwise have received in the merger.
    

      Management and each Board of Directors believe it is in the best 
      interests of stockholders to merge EMD and SBW with and into ESD in part 
      because the combined Fund may benefit from economies of scale, as one 
      set of fixed expenses would be spread over a larger asset base, as well 
      as from enhanced market liquidity. Furthermore, stockholders of EMD, 
      SBW, and ESD would likely benefit from greater asset diversification and 
      lower overall expenses, in addition to a more streamlined emerging 
      market product offering allowing for more focused marketing and 
      stockholder servicing efforts.
    

      ESD also today announced approval by its Board of Directors of a change 
      to its primary and secondary investment objectives, subject to 
      stockholder approval. If approved by stockholders, ESD’s primary 
      investment objective would become high current income and its secondary 
      investment objective would become capital appreciation. The current 
      primary investment objective of ESD is total return and high current 
      income is a secondary investment objective. The approval of changes to 
      ESD’s investment objectives is not contingent upon the approval of the 
      mergers. Currently, EMD, SBW and ESD have different investment 
      objectives. EMD’s primary investment objective is to seek high current 
      income. As a secondary objective, EMD seeks capital appreciation. SBW’s 
      primary investment objective is to maintain a high level of current 
      income. As a secondary objective, SBW seeks to maximize total return.
    

      In connection with the proposal to merge EMD and SBW with and into ESD, 
      and the proposal to change the investment objectives of ESD, the Funds 
      intend to file a combined proxy statement and prospectus with the 
      Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Investors and 
      stockholders are advised to read the proxy statement and prospectus when 
      it becomes available because it will contain important information. When 
      filed with the SEC, the proxy statement and prospectus and other 
      documents filed by the Funds will be available free of charge at the 
      SEC’s website, http://www.sec.gov. 
      Stockholders can also obtain copies of these documents, when available, 
      for free by calling the Funds at 1-888-777-0102.
    

      EMD, SBW and ESD, their directors and executive officers and investment 
      adviser, members of their management and employees may be deemed to be 
      participants in the solicitation of proxies from the Funds’ stockholders 
      in connection with the proposed merger and change of investment 
      objectives. Information concerning the interests of the participants in 
      the solicitation will be set forth in the proxy statement and prospectus 
      to be filed with the SEC and is or will be set forth in the stockholder 
      reports of the Funds on Form N-CSR on file and/or to be filed with the 
      SEC.
    

      As of January 31, 2016, EMD had net assets of approximately 
      $330,039,521, SBW had net assets of approximately $151,546,738, and ESD 
      had net assets of approximately $494,645,142. Each Fund is a 
      non-diversified closed-end management investment company managed by Legg 
      Mason Partners Fund Advisor, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Legg 
      Mason, Inc., and sub-advised by Western Asset Management Company, 
      Western Asset Management Company Limited and Western Asset Management 
      Company Pte. Ltd, wholly-owned subsidiaries of Legg Mason, Inc. SBW is 
      also sub-advised by Western Asset Management Company Ltd., a 
      wholly-owned subsidiary of Legg Mason, Inc.
    

      For more information, please call Investor Relations: 1-888-777-0102, or 
      consult the Funds’ web sites at www.lmcef.com. Hard 
      copies of each Fund’s complete audited financial statements are 
      available free of charge upon request.

They are subject to change at any time. Negative allocations and allocations in excess of 100%, if any, are primarily due to the Fund's unsettled trade activity.     **      Credit quality is a measure of a bond issuer's ability to repay interest and principal in a timely manner. The credit ratings shown are based on each portfolio security's rating as provided by Standard and Poor's, Moody's Investors Service and/or Fitch Ratings, Ltd. and typically range from AAA (highest) to D (lowest), or an equivalent and/or similar rating. For this purpose, when two or more of the agencies have assigned differing ratings to a security, the highest rating is used. Securities that are unrated by all three agencies are reflected as such. The credit quality of the investments in the Fund's portfolio does not apply to the stability or safety of the Fund. These ratings are updated monthly and may change over time. Please note, the Fund itself has not been rated by an independent rating agency.     ***     The difference between total assets and net assets, if any, is due primarily to the Fund's use of borrowings; net assets do not include borrowings. The Fund may employ leverage in the form of loans, preferred stock, reverse repurchase agreements and/or other instruments. When the Fund engages in transactions that have a leveraging effect on the Fund's portfolio, the value of the Fund will be more volatile and all other risks will tend to be compounded.     ****     Percentages are based on total assets. If the Fund employs leverage, the Effective Duration is based on net assets.     *****     Pursuant to its managed distribution policy, the Fund intends to make regular monthly distributions to shareholders of its common stock at a fixed rate per common share, which may be adjusted from time to time by the Fund's Board of Directors. Under the Fund's managed distribution policy, if, for any monthly distribution, the value of the Fund's net investment income and net realized capital gain is less than the amount of the distribution, the difference will be distributed from the Fund's assets (and will constitute a "return of capital"). The Board of Directors may modify, terminate or suspend the managed distribution policy at any time, including when certain events would make part of any return of capital taxable to shareholders. Any such modification, termination or suspension could have an adverse effect on the market price for the Fund's shares.                Western Asset Worldwide Income Fund Inc., a non-diversified closed-end investment management company, is advised by Legg Mason Partners Fund Advisor, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Legg Mason, Inc., and is sub-advised by Western Asset Management Company, an affiliate of the advisor.

		What I Should Know 
Before Investing




All investments are subject to risks, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund's investments are subject to credit risk, inflation risk, and interest rate risk. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall, reducing the value of the Fund's share price. The Fund may invest in lower-rated high yield bonds which are subject to greater credit risk (risk of default) than higher-rated obligations. Investments in foreign securities involve risks, including the possibility of losses due to changes in currency exchange rates and negative developments in the political, economic, or regulatory structure of specific countries or regions. These risks are greater in emerging markets. Leverage may result in greater volatility of NAV and the market price of common shares and increases a shareholder's risk of loss. The Fund may make significant investments in derivative instruments. Derivative instruments can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses, and have a potentially large impact on Fund.

Distributions are not guaranteed and are subject to change.

Tapering of the Federal Reserve Board’s quantitative easing program and a general rise in interest rates may lead to increased portfolio volatility.

 Performance 






Performance








IMPORTANT PERFORMANCE INFORMATION: Performance shown represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Returns based on Market Price or NAV, and assume the reinvestment of all distributions at the Dividend Reinvestment Plan Price or NAV, respectively. All returns include the deduction of management fees, operating expenses and all other fund expenses, and do not reflect the deduction of brokerage commissions or taxes that investors may pay on distributions or the sale of shares. Returns for periods of less than one year are not annualized.

 Net Asset Value (NAV) is total assets less total liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding.

 Market Price, determined by supply and demand, is the price an investor purchases or sells the fund. The Market Price may differ from a fund’s NAV.
*Distribution rate is calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution amount paid, excluding special distributions, divided by the closing market price or NAV. As of 06/30/2017, the fund estimates that the distributions will be paid from: 98.20% investment income;0.00% realized capital gains; and, 1.80% return of capital. The Distribution Rate is subject to change and is not a quotation of Fund performance. The Board of Directors may terminate or suspend the managed distribution policy at any time. Any such termination or suspension could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund's shares. A return of capital is not taxable and results in a reduction in the tax basis of a shareholder's investment. For more information about a distribution's composition refer to the Fund's distribution press release or, if applicable, the Section 19 notice located in the Press Releases section below.



























A NOTE ABOUT FEES & EXPENSES: Based on the Fund’s net assets of the common shares, as of the most recent Annual Report.
Management fees: Under the investment management agreement, the Fund pays an annual fee, paid monthly, as a portion of the Fund's average daily Managed Assets. “Managed Assets” are defined as net assets plus the amount of any borrowing, including loans from certain financial institutions and/or the issuance of debt securities (collectively, “Borrowings”), and assets attributable to any preferred stock (“Preferred Stock”) that may be outstanding. Please see the fund’s Annual Report for more information on expenses.


Expense ratio shown reflects a voluntary investment management fee waiver/or expense reimbursements by the fund's investment adviser which can be modified or discontinued at any time without notice. Absent the fee waiver/or expense reimbursements, expenses would be higher and total returns would be less. See the fund’s Annual Report for information on expenses and waivers.

For informational purposes only and not to be considered a recommendation to purchase or sell any security. Negative allocations and allocations in excess of 100% are primarily due to the Fund's unsettled trade activity.
The difference between total assets and net assets, if any, is due primarily to the Fund’s use of borrowings and other liabilities; net assets do not include borrowings. The Fund may employ leverage in the form of loans, preferred stock, reverse repurchase agreements and/or other instruments. When the Fund engages in transactions that have a leveraging effect on the Fund’s portfolio, the value of the Fund will be more volatile and all other risks will tend to be compounded. 

Percentages are based on total portfolio as of quarter-end and are subject to change at any time. For informational purposes only and not to be considered a recommendation to purchase or sell any security. Negative allocations and allocations in excess of 100% are primarily due to the Fund's unsettled trade activity.
 


Weighted Average Life (WAL) is the average number of years for which each dollar of unpaid principal on a loan or mortgage remains outstanding. Once calculated, WAL tells how many years it will take to pay half of the outstanding principal. 


Effective duration is a duration calculation for bonds with embedded options. Effective duration takes into account that expected cash flows will fluctuate as interest rates change. Duration measures the sensitivity of price (the value of principal) of a fixed-income investment to a change in interest rates. The higher the duration number, the more sensitive a fixed-income investment will be to interest rate changes.


Credit quality is a measure of a bond issuer's ability to repay interest and principal in a timely manner. The credit ratings shown are based on each portfolio security's rating as provided by Standard and Poor's, Moody's Investors Service and/or Fitch Ratings, Ltd. and typically range from AAA (highest) to D (lowest). For this purpose, if two or more of the agencies have assigned differing ratings to a security, the lowest rating is used. Securities that are unrated by all three agencies are reflected as such. The credit quality of the investments in the Fund's portfolio does not apply to the stability or safety of the Fund. These ratings are updated monthly and may change over time. Please note, the Fund itself has not been rated by an independent rating agency.

IMPORTANT HOLDINGS INFORMATION: Portfolio holdings are based on total portfolio, and are subject to change at any time. Holdings are provided for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a recommendation to purchase or sell any security. Any negative allocations or allocations in excess of 100% are primarily due to unsettled trade activities.
Derivatives, such as options and futures, which can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and have a potentially large impact on Fund performance.

 Distributions 






Distributions









IMPORTANT DISTRIBUTION INFORMATION: Distributions paid by the Fund may be comprised of income, capital gains, and/or return of capital. At year-end the Fund will issue a Form 1099 with the final composition of the distribution for tax purposes. A current estimate of the distribution's composition can be found in the performance section on this page or in the most recent distribution press release and/or Section 19 notice located in the press release section below. The Distribution Rate is not guaranteed, subject to change, and is not a quotation of Fund performance. A return of capital is not taxable and results in a reduction in the tax basis of a shareholder's investment.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION: All investments involve risk, including loss of principal. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Please see each product’s web page for specific details regarding investment objective, risks associated with hedge funds, alternative investments and other risks, performance and other important information. Review this information carefully before you make any investment decision.
The Closed-End Funds are not sold or distributed by Legg Mason Investor Services, LLC ("LMIS") or any affiliate of Legg Mason, Inc. Unlike open-end funds, shares are not continually offered. Like other public companies, closed-end funds have a one-time initial public offering, and once their shares are first issued, are generally bought and sold through non-affiliated broker/dealers and trade on nationally recognized stock exchanges. Share prices will fluctuate with market conditions and, at the time of sale, may be worth more or less than your original investment. Shares of exchange-traded closed-end funds may trade at a discount or premium to their original offering price, and often trade at a discount to their net asset value. Net Asset Value (NAV) is total assets less total liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding. Market Price, determined by supply and demand, is the price an investor purchases or sells the fund. Investment return, market price and net asset value will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. The Funds are subject to investment risks, including the possible loss of principal invested.
