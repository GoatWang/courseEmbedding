An investor should consider the fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing or sending money. This and other important information about the fund can be found in the fund’s prospectus, or, if applicable, the summary prospectus. To obtain a copy, visit the prospectus page. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.  All investing involves risk, including potential loss of principal. There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its objective. Investments in small and mid-size companies can involve risks such as less publicly available information, higher volatility, and less liquidity than larger companies. International investing involves special risks, which include changes in currency rates, foreign taxation, differences in auditing standards and securities regulations, political uncertainty, and greater volatility. Emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors as well as increased volatility and lower trading volume. Fixed income funds are subject to interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise bond values decline. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments.  The Funds are distributed by Victory Capital Advisers, Inc. ("VCA"), member FINRA and SIPC.

Victory Capital Announces the Launch of VictoryShares US Multi-Factor Minimum Volatility ETF
Jun 22 17
Victory Capital announced that it has launched the VictoryShares US Multi-Factor Minimum Volatility ETF (VSMV), which began trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market® on June 22, 2017. The new ETF seeks to provide investment results that track the performance of the Nasdaq Victory US Multi-Factor Minimum Volatility Index (NQVMVUS), which Victory Capital developed in partnership with Nasdaq. The Index employs a two-step approach that aims to deliver superior risk-adjusted equity returns, while potentially minimizing overall expected volatility relative to the US broad market. Step one screens for more durable companies by isolating certain characteristics such as momentum, quality, value and growth potential. Step two optimizes the portfolio to ensure diversification and to help reduce overall index volatility. The VictoryShares ETF platform, which has grown to approximately $1.5 billion in AUM as of May 31, 2017, is designed to provide investors with rules-based solutions that help bridge the gap between the active and traditional passive elements of their portfolios. VSMV is the second in a series of new VictoryShares ETFs that track indexes developed with Nasdaq. The VictoryShares Dividend Accelerator ETF (VSDA), which launched in April 2017 and tracks the Nasdaq Victory Dividend Accelerator Index (NQVDIV), targets companies that it believe are mostly likely to grow dividends consistently over time. The new ETFs build on the strong experience that VictoryShares has delivered to clients over the past three years through its 11 ETFs that track Victory Capital’s proprietary CEMP Volatility Weighted Indexes.

The Index uses fundamental criteria, including proven earnings stability, to select companies with the higher likelihood of consistently growing dividends year over year. It seeks to identify those companies early in their lifecycles and assemble them in a rules-based portfolio that emphasizes growing dividends per share. The VictoryShares ETF platform is designed to provide investors with rules-based solutions that bridge the gap between the active and traditional passive elements of their portfolios.

Institutional Investment


About Institutional Investment
Institutional investment is that type of investment, which is done by an organization, which is a financial services provider. Common examples are an insurance company, a bank, a hedge fund, a retirement fund, or a mutual fund.
Institutional investment is a form of financially advanced investment and it is invested in substantial volumes. Institutional investment portfolios normally have a large number of investments. Due to the advanced characteristics of institutional investment, the institutional investors are frequently involved in private security placements where particular features of the securities regulations are not enforced. 










For instance, in the U.S., a private placement according to the Rule 506 of Regulation D can be done with an accredited investor excluding the requirement of enlisting the bidding of securities with the SEC or Securities and Exchange Commission.
In principle of an institutional investor, the definition of an accredited investor in the regulation is as follows:
An insurance company, a bank, a business development company, a small business investment company or a registered investment company (usually, a mutual fund institution)
An employee benefit plan subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, if the investment decisions are taken by an insurance company, a bank, or a registered investment consultant, or in case the overall amount of assets of the plan is more than 5 million U.S. dollars. 





A charitable institution, partnership, or business corporation, which has assets of more than 5 million U.S. dollars
An executive officer, a general partner, or a director of the firm trading the securities.
A commercial enterprise where every equity holder is an accredited investor.
A natural individual whose personal net worth or combined net worth with the spouse of that individual is more than 1 million U.S. dollars during the time of buying
A natural individual whose earnings is more than 200,000 U.S. dollars in every single year of the two latest years or combined earnings with a spouse is more than 300,000 U.S. dollars for the same period and a sensible anticipation of similar level of income in the present year. 





A trust, which has assets of more than 5 million U.S. dollars, which was not established for purchasing the securities provided, which a sophisticated individual can only buy.
Importance of Institutional Investment
The importance of institutional investment may vary. Sovereign wealth funds in oil-exporting countries are quite significant and on the other hand, pension funds are highly popular in developed economies.
Institutional Investment in Canada
Both government funds and pension funds are holding strong position in the Canadian financial market and form a significant portion of the Canadian economy. 





The leading institutional investors in Canada include the following
Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (C$282.6 Billion [2015])
Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (C$248 Billion [2015])
Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan (C$171.4 Billion [2015])
British Columbia Investment Management (C$123.6 Billion [March 31 2015])
Alberta Investment Management (C$83.9 Billion [December 31 2014])
The leading institutional investors United Kingdom
In the UK, institutional investors may play a major role in economic affairs, and are highly concentrated in the City of London’s square mile. Their wealth accounts for around two thirds of the equity in public listed companies. For any given company, the largest 25 investors would have to be able to muster over half of the votes.
The major investor associations are
Investment Management Association.
Association of British Insurers
National Association of Pension Funds
The Association of Investment Trust Companies
