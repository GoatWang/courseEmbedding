Samuel Belzberg
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer




Mr. Belzberg has extensive international experience in real estate and finance with a distinguished track record. In 1962, City Savings and Trust received a Charter from the Alberta Government to set up a provincial trust company. This evolved into First City Financial, which Mr. Belzberg built into a $7 billion financial services organization with offices across North America and Europe. First City was involved in many large investment transactions including Bache Securities before it was sold to Prudential, Gulf Oil, Armstrong World (a large building supply company) and Scovill (a manufacturing company which included Yale Locks, Hamilton Beach, NuTone and many other brand-name products).
During the 1990s, Mr. Belzberg founded Balfour Holdings Ltd. (“Balfour”), a real estate company which, at its peak, operated over 26 projects spreading through the United States. Balfour’s mandate was to profit from the dislocations in value in the United States due to the Savings and Loan crisis. Balfour subdivided and serviced its purchased lands and sold the lots to National Builders. In 1997, Balfour was sold to Blackstone, a large U.S. private equity group and generated realized returns in excess of 20% per annum. During the 1990′s, Mr. Belzberg was an active acquirer of distressed property in Alberta where values had dramatically declined due to the softness in the oil industry. These properties were subsequently divested when the market recovered. In 1992, Mr. Belzberg started a private real estate and equity investments company, which is now called Gibralt Capital Corporation.
Mr. Belzberg serves on various Board of Directors and is involved with numerous charities. He was awarded the Order of Canada in 1989 from the Governor General, and also in 1989 he received an honorary doctorate from Simon Fraser University. In 1992, he received the Governor General of Canada Award. In 2002, Mr. Belzberg was promoted to Officer of the Order of Canada.

              By Stratford P. Sherman RESEARCH ASSOCIATE Darienne L. Dennis
            

              March 4, 1985
            


                (FORTUNE Magazine) – The three brothers are astute bargain hunters who now control more than $5 billion of assets. Friends of the family say their recent $523-million purchase
                of Scovill Inc. proves they aren't greenmailers and cheapskates--but Wall Street isn't convinced.
              

                MYSTERIOUS, controversial, and very, very rich, the Belzberg brothers of Canada--Samuel, William, and Hyman--confounded Wall Streeters in January with their acquisition of Scovill
                Inc. for about $523 million. The brothers are widely believed to be cheapskates--''They want to buy a dollar for eighty cents,'' complains an investment banker--yet they paid a price
                for the Waterbury, Connecticut, producer of Yale locks and other familiar products that some security analysts consider excessive. It works out to around 14 times last year's
                earnings. The Belzbergs are also regarded as greenmailers, yet they appear perfectly happy not to have been bought off by Scovill, and to be owners of their first U.S. industrial
                company. Despite their reputation, the Belzbergs appear to be nothing better or worse than successful practitioners of a particularly ardent and unmuddled brand of capitalism. Family
                intimates say the brothers learned it as toddlers from their father, Abraham, a Polish fishmonger who emigrated to Canada in 1919 and died a real estate tycoon in 1976. Devoted to one
                another and deeply rooted in family tradition, the brothers have been more consistent in their three decades of business dealings than most people realize. Like their father, they are
                opportunistic acquisitors who regard their capital as too precious to invest in any but the safest tangible assets. ''They like to kick the tires,'' says a financier who knows their
                ways. They shun risk with a firmness that has won them many admirers but few friends in the U.S. When the brothers were just getting started, they could borrow only against personal
                notes backed by everything they owned, so a single really sour deal could have wiped them out. As a result, the Belzbergs carefully consider the downside of every transaction. Once
                committed, they try to proceed with such caution that a profit is virtually guaranteed. Sam, 57, the middle brother and the only one with a college education, approves most of the
                Belzbergs' deals. His sense of value is so sure that a Belzberg investment almost inevitably attracts the attention of arbitragers and competing bidders. Several of the latter have
                bought the Belzbergs out at prices the brothers probably consider insane. Last year, in an extreme example, the Belzbergs bought $87 million of Gulf stock, 1.2% of the total, as part
                of T. Boone Pickens's now famous ''investment group.'' Seven months later Chevron Corp. (then Standard Oil Co. of California) bought the brothers' shares for a more-than-handsome $157
                million. And the Belzbergs don't seem to mind accepting greenmail from independence-minded--a nd sometimes economically irrational--managements. U.S. Industries Inc. and Masonite
                Corp. paid premiums to buy out the Belzbergs and then were swallowed by other companies. Managements of no fewer than eight other major U.S. companies, including Blue Bell Inc. and
                H.H. Robertson Co., also fought off the Belzbergs--perhaps motivated partly by fear for their jobs. But when the dust settled, the brothers almost always came out with a profit. It is
                a wonder that such conservative financiers end up owning much, yet the Belzbergs' holdings are enormous. With a net worth believed to run well into the hundreds of millions of
                dollars, the brothers control a large and bewildering collection of public and private companies. Their largest, which Sam serves as chief executive, provides a classic example of the
                Belzberg approach to leverage: First City Financial Corp., a Vancouver bank holding company whose shares trade on the Toronto exchange. The Belzbergs' 69% of the stock was recently
                worth only $119 million, but it gives them control of First City's $2.9 billion in assets. The company's minority shareholders are not complaining. Thanks partly to stock profits from
                all those failed takeover attempts, First City has for the last five years produced impressive returns to investors. David Ramsay of the Toronto securities firm Wood Gundy estimates
                that its total returns--dividends plus stock appreciation--avera ged 31% a year through 1984, and return on shareholders' equity averaged 25%. The brothers use the same leverage
                technique as 62% owners of Far West Financial Corp., a publicly traded Beverly Hills savings and loan with assets of $1.8 billion. Their third major public company is 69%-owned First
                City Properties of Beverly Hills. With revenues of only $111 million a year, this real estate development company was the vehicle for the leveraged buyout of Scovill, whose 1984
                revenues totaled $825 million. Wholly owned First City Capital of New York currently holds minority positions in some 20 major U.S. companies acquired for an estimated $300 million,
                including a stake in Revere Copper & Brass. An investment banker who knows the Belzbergs well argues that the brothers, all workaholics, ''are so similar the differences aren't
                worth thinking about.'' The three boys, as these grown men are still said to refer to themselves at times, are all about six feet tall and curly haired, though Bill, 52, and Hy, 59,
                are balding. ''They are very direct,'' says a friend. ''They don't kill you with subtleties.'' All are known to feel strongly about their identity as Belzbergs and as Jews, though
                none is Orthodox. Notoriously tough in business, the brothers nevertheless know how to relax, sharing an easy affability and a sense of humor that relies partly on droll tales from
                their youth. All are devoted family men, and two members of the younger generation--Sam's son, Marc, 30, and Hy's son Brent, 34--have taken prominent positions in the family
                enterprise. The brothers are also earnest and generous philanthropists: having lost scores of relatives to Hitler's gas chambers, for example, they are heavy backers of the Simon
                Wiesenthal Center for Holocaust Studies in Los Angeles.
              

                THE BROTHERS are not clones, however. Although they share their profits equally, Sam, who lives in Vancouver, is usually the brother who earns them. He prefers phone calls to memos
                and frequently jumps out of his chair to pace as he talks. ''Sam's in the first turn while other guys are still tying their shoes,'' says an ex-employee. He makes decisions so fast
                that some of his subordinates suspect he acts on instinct, but investment bankers who have worked with him say Sam is a relentless and thorough analyst. Bill, the youngest, moved to
                Beverly Hills in 1976, perhaps to get out of Sam's shadow. He lives in a Spanish-style mansion formerly owned by actor Gene Hackman and socializes with TV emcee Monty (Let's Make a
                Deal) Hall and other local notables. Far West is Bill's fiefdom. He is an accomplished dealmaker in his own right with a special flair for real estate, but he is a more emotional
                businessman than Sam, and a tougher boss. Six men have served him as president of Far West since 1976. Bill has often been criticized for renegotiating apparently finished deals. ''He
                has to be sure he has squeezed out the last dollar,'' says one observer. ''I think he's trying to compete with Sam.'' Hy, the eldest, is the least visible. He still lives in sleepy
                Calgary, Alberta, and devotes most of his working time to Cristy's Arcade, a thriving furniture store inherited from Abraham that is among the Belzbergs' smallest holdings. His quiet
                life was interrupted in 1982 when three armed kidnappers --one a car salesman who had lost his shirt in commodities--hurled him into a rainbow-striped van and kept him handcuffed and
                blindfolded until Sam paid a ransom, soon recovered, of nearly $2 million. Hyman's other claim to fame is being spotted chatting on an Acapulco beach in 1970 with Miami mobster Meyer
                Lansky, who was reportedly there to carve up the action in Atlantic City with some business associates. Eleven years later the brothers had acquired 22% of Bache Group, and Harry
                Jacobs, chief executive of the struggling securities house, vigorously opposed them. Perhaps by coincidence, reports of the Acapulco encounter found their way into the press around
                that time. The family's reputation in the U.S. never fully recovered, although the FBI says it has no reason to believe Hyman has links to the mob. Jacobs lost his title and his
                company anyway, to Prudential Insurance Co. of America, in the first of a wave of so-called financial supermarket combinations. The brothers netted $28 million. If their financial
                dynasty can be said to have a corporate culture, it traces back to Radom, Poland, where Abraham grew up. His neighborhood in Radom was by all accounts an insular community, many of
                whose inhabitants spoke Yiddish, hewed to Orthodox traditions, and had suffered from the depredations of their Christian neighbors. In that environment clannishness had more than its
                usual social utility. Abraham left Radom at 22, one of hundreds of local Jews whose passage was paid by an earlier emigree named Bella Singer. When he arrived in Calgary, Abraham
                joined a small but growing community of transplanted Poles. Abraham began by working as a farmhand and in the abattoir of a local meatpacking plant. But his entrepreneurial skills
                showed up early. One of his first jobs gave rise to a family story that Sam still uses to instruct his employees. The owner of a small market, who employed Abraham as a produce buyer,
                gave him a raise but didn't give one to his own nephew, also a produce buyer. When the nephew protested, the owner explained that when he sent Abraham to the fields to buy
                strawberries, the young man would buy whatever offered the greatest potential for profit. But when the inept nephew was told to buy strawberries, he bought strawberries. By 1921
                hardworking Abraham was flush enough to bring his wife, Hinda, and daughter, Fanny, over from Poland. Another daughter, Lil, was born in Canada, then the three sons. Fanny and Lil,
                both of whom married young and now live in Calgary near their mother and Hy, never caught their father's enthusiasm for commerce. But even as children the boys were expected to take
                paying jobs on weekends. They discussed business over the dinner table with their father, and each in his turn joined Abraham, for years a trader of used furniture, on his buying
                trips, learning young how to spot value. These lessons had their intended effect. As the oldest, Hy joined the family furniture store after a stint in the Royal Canadian Navy. Sam
                left home at 16 to study commerce at the nearby University of Alberta, selling used cars on the side. After graduation he began buying real estate, financed by the capital he had
                accumulated and a $15,000 revolving bank credit co-signed by his father. Bill went into the dog-food business and bought still more real estate, later selling his Red Top brand of
                processed horsemeat to Standard Brands. Adept land traders, the brothers also made killings in western Canadian oil leases. The family's entry into financial services came in 1962. At
                the time, Alberta was isolated from Canada's Toronto-based banking community. So Sam set up City Savings & Trust Co. (now called First City Trust, the principal subsidiary of
                First City Financial) along the lines of an S&L in the States. Among its original purposes was to finance the family's real estate deals, but it became a completely separate line
                of business for the Belzbergs. Its investments, though skewed toward real estate, later included equities, giving Sam the opportunity to develop his skill as a stock picker. The
                Belzbergs made their first big money--and a bunch of enemies--in 1973. A few years earlier they had brought most of their landholdings together into a company called Western Realty
                Projects, ending up with 62% of its shares after it went public. Then they accepted a $12-a-share buyout offer from a British company that offered nothing at all to Western's minority
                stockholders. After that the shares never approached $12 in public trading. Under laws then in effect the deal was perfectly legal, but it understandably aroused the ire of minority
                stockholders, who felt cheated. The deal went through even so, and the Belzbergs got $48 million.
              

                WITH THAT STAKE they began investing in the U.S. Their original strategy, long since abandoned, evidently was to build a second financial services empire in the States. In a series of
                quiet and friendly deals, they bought Far West Financial as well as a publicly traded real estate investment trust and several other companies. Then, in 1979, they began investing in
                Bache. This episode, profitable but unpleasant, set the tone for most of the brothers' subsequent transactions in the U.S. Harry Jacobs apparently feared the Belzbergs more than
                Beelzebub himself--perhaps with reason, given the poor financial performance of the firm under his leadership. The brothers started by accumulating a 7% stake in Bache. Shortly
                thereafter Sam met with Jacobs, who made it clear he wanted nothing to do with the Belzbergs. Sam kept buying and eventually asked for two seats on the 16-member Bache board. Jacobs
                refused, and Sam--motivated now by anger, according to family intimates --bought still more shares, eventually raising the family's stake to over 20%. Jacobs went wild. Using treasury
                stock, he acquired an odd collection of small companies, including an Ohio smelter, which diluted the Belzberg holdings. He didn't protest when Bache's clients, the Hunt brothers of
                Texas --who had nearly ruined the firm by involving it in their huge silver- trading gamble of 1979--bought almost 7% of Bache's shares. And the press got the story of Hyman and Meyer
                Lansky. In the end Jacobs fled into the arms of Prudential, which kept him on as chairman but replaced him as chief executive after a year. The Belzbergs' big profit didn't erase the
                sting of the smear.
              

                FROM THAT TIME until the Scovill deal the Belzbergs were unable to acquire a major publicly traded company in the U.S. They got Scovill only by dramatically changing their tactics.
                However fearsome they appeared in the ! past, in the end the brothers had meekly allowed managements to drive them away. This time they used force. After buying their usual small
                initial stake--6.3% in this case--Sam filed a hostile tender offer for the first time in his life. Explains Robert S. Pirie, 50, the investment banker from Rothschild Inc. who
                represented the Belzbergs, ''Having managements continually react the way they did made Sam realize there was no other way.'' William F. Andrews, 53, Scovill's chief executive,
                quickly announced that the brothers' $35-a-share offer was inadequate. He organized a private auction of Scovill, inviting the Belzbergs to participate. They won with an offer of
                $42.50 a share--and a promise to let Scovill's present management in for a piece of the company's equity. The offer bolstered arguments by family loyalists that the brothers, far from
                threatening managements of takeover targets, are financiers desperate to keep the operating experts in place. Andrews's board endorsed the revised offer with every appearance of
                enthusiasm. ''They were completely open, frank, and fair,'' says Andrews. ''I was surprised.'' The deal surprised almost everyone, but it has not put to rest the controversy about the
                Belzbergs' intentions. The brothers would probably argue that the Scovill takeover proves their claim to be acquisitors at heart, but Wall Street isn't convinced. Contends an
                investment banker who once worked for the Belzbergs, ''They had to buy one to be taken seriously as greenmailers in the future.'' The truth will no doubt become clearer as the
                brothers bid for more U.S. companies. A key executive at a First City subsidiary indicates that Belzberg watchers probably won't have to wait long for more clues: ''We are looking at
                a couple of opportunities,'' he says, ''right now.''

Belzberg Is Turning Reins Over to Nephew


By ALISON LEIGH COWAN


Published: March 2, 1991









                    Samuel Belzberg, a 62-year-old financier who rode the takeover wave to become head of one of Canada's foremost dynasties, is surrendering day-to-day control of the centerpiece of his family's empire.        

                    He will hand the reins of the company, the First City Financial Corporation, to his 40-year-old nephew, Brent S. Belzberg.        

                    First City Financial, whose shares are traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange, is the parent company for most of the Belzberg family interests. Though Samuel has run the business as its chief executive for 35 years, he and his older brother, Hyman, and his younger brother, William, each owns 26.7 percent of the company's shares. The public has owned the balance since the mid-1960's.  Two Biggest Holdings        

                    The two biggest holdings of the company are its 89.5 percent stake in First City Trustco Inc., a financial services concern, and a wholly owned real estate development arm, the First City Development Corporation.        

                    The company has had a difficult time in the last year, starting with its disastrous 1989-90 run at Armstrong World Industries, based in Lancaster, Pa. That takeover battle invited a spirited defense from the floor-covering company and the Pennsylvania business establishment. The fight led Pennsylvania to adopt one of the country's toughest anti-takeover laws and ultimately cost the would-be acquirers about $20 million in losses.        

                    The year continued with a second money-losing run at the Asda Group P.L.C., a British retail chain. In addition, the company announced last fall that it was taking huge losses on its securities portfolio and would shut down its trading operations, then run by Marc Belzberg, Samuel's son.        

                    Those setbacks have cost the family dearly. At recent market prices, the three brothers' combined stock holdings in the parent company are worth about $179 million (Canadian), a nice sum but less than a third of what the stakes were worth at the high. And according to one analyst in Vancouver, British Columbia, Tony Yue of Goepel Shields & Partners, the parent company has essentially given back in the last 14 months the money it made speculating in takeover stocks in the 1980's.        

                    The company acknowledged yesterday that the last year had been trying. "First City Financial has experienced a significant erosion in shareholder value over the last year, and faces a very difficult year of asset restructuring and debt refinancing," Brent Belzberg said in the statement.        

                    The transition, which calls for Brent to assume the title of chief executive from his uncle, was decided at a First City board meeting on Thursday in Toronto and is effective immediately. Brent will also pick up the chief executive title at First City Trustco and keep his titles as chief executive of First City Trust, the operating unit of Trustco, and of First City Development. Samuel will remain chairman of the parent company.        

                    The moves, following the company's decision last fall to close the New York trading operation, an office that speculated on takeover stocks, signal a further retreat for the Belzberg family from the takeover business that has shaped much of its dealings over the last decade and an effort to refocus on its two core operating companies.        

                    "It reflects the strategic changes that are going on and just confirms that the company is not going to be involved in takeovers and securities transactions in the future," said Eric W. Evans, First City spokesman. "The intention is to be strictly a holding company for those two businesses."        

                    Brent alone of the family's second generation has held significant management positions at both operating companies, which may have favored him over other contenders, analysts and others close to the family said yesterday. A lawyer who graduated from the University of Toronto, he spent a few years practicing securities law at Tory, Tory, DesLauriers & Bennington, a Canadian law firm, before joining the family business, Mr. Evans said.        

                    "Sam made a decision that was best for the company and for the shareholders," said Byron Menides, a Worcester, Mass., executive who has served on the board of a Belzberg-controlled company. "Marc is very good at what he does, but for all the time I've known him he's not been used as a manager. So Brent is the logical successor."        

                    While Brent's younger brother, Murray, is expected to continue as an executive in the First City Trust, Marc's future with the company is less clear once he finishes shutting down the New York trading office. "He won't actively be involved in the business because there really isn't a role, given the change in direction of the company," Mr. Evans said.        

                    First City Financial's stock closed yesterday at $4, up 25 cents.

Biography[edit]
Samuel Belzberg was born to a Jewish family[1] in Calgary, Alberta[2] and educated at the University of Alberta.[2] In 1962, he founded the provincial trust company, City Savings and Trust in Edmonton which was heavily involved in real-estate development financing.[2] In 1968, he moved to Vancouver with his brothers, Hyman Belzberg and William Belzberg, and formed Western Realty.[2] In 1970, he founded First City Financial Corp as the parent company for City Savings and Trust.[2] In 1973, Belzberg and his brothers sold Western Realty and purchased Far West Financial Corp of California, marking their entrance into the United States.[2] By the late 1980s, First City Financial Corp, now a diversified holding company, had assets of $5.4 billion with operations in Canada and the US.[2] First City was involved in many large investment transactions including Bache Securities before it was sold to Prudential, Gulf Oil, Armstrong World (a large building supply company)[citation needed] and Scovill (a manufacturing company which included Yale Locks, Hamilton Beach, NuTone) which they purchased in 1985 for $523 million.[2]
During the 1990s, Belzberg founded Balfour Holdings Ltd., a real estate company which, at its peak, operated over 26 projects spreading through the United States. Balfour’s mandate was to profit from the dislocations in value in the United States due to the Savings and Loan crisis. Balfour subdivided and serviced its purchased lands and sold the lots to National Builders. In 1997, Balfour was sold to The Blackstone Group, a large U.S. private equity group and generated realized returns in excess of 20% per annum. During the 1990s, Mr. Belzberg was an active acquirer of distressed property in Alberta where values had dramatically declined due to the softness in the oil industry. These properties were subsequently divested when the market recovered. In 1992, Belzberg started a private real estate and equity investments company, which is now called Gibralt Capital Corporation.
Philanthropy and awards[edit]
Belzberg serves on various Board of Directors and is involved with numerous charities. He was awarded the Order of Canada in 1989 from the Governor General, and also in 1989 he received an honorary doctorate from Simon Fraser University. In 1992, he received the Governor General of Canada Award. In 2002, Mr. Belzberg was promoted to Officer of the Order of Canada. In 1977, with a donation of $500,000, he helped fund the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles. He is the founder of both the Canadian and American Dystonia Medical Research Foundations.In 1988 he was made a Member of the Order of Canada and was promoted to Officer in 2001. In 2009, he was made a member of the Order of British Columbia.
Personal life[edit]
He is married to Frances Belzberg. They have four children: Marc, Lisa, Wendy, and Sherry. His daughter Lisa, was married to and has three children (Sasha, Tess and Ezekiel) with Matthew Bronfman, son of Canadian billionaire Edgar Bronfman, Sr.[3]

Biography[edit]
Samuel Belzberg was born to a Jewish family[1] in Calgary, Alberta[2] and educated at the University of Alberta.[2] In 1962, he founded the provincial trust company, City Savings and Trust in Edmonton which was heavily involved in real-estate development financing.[2] In 1968, he moved to Vancouver with his brothers, Hyman Belzberg and William Belzberg, and formed Western Realty.[2] In 1970, he founded First City Financial Corp as the parent company for City Savings and Trust.[2] In 1973, Belzberg and his brothers sold Western Realty and purchased Far West Financial Corp of California, marking their entrance into the United States.[2] By the late 1980s, First City Financial Corp, now a diversified holding company, had assets of $5.4 billion with operations in Canada and the US.[2] First City was involved in many large investment transactions including Bache Securities before it was sold to Prudential, Gulf Oil, Armstrong World (a large building supply company)[citation needed] and Scovill (a manufacturing company which included Yale Locks, Hamilton Beach, NuTone) which they purchased in 1985 for $523 million.[2]
During the 1990s, Belzberg founded Balfour Holdings Ltd., a real estate company which, at its peak, operated over 26 projects spreading through the United States. Balfour’s mandate was to profit from the dislocations in value in the United States due to the Savings and Loan crisis. Balfour subdivided and serviced its purchased lands and sold the lots to National Builders. In 1997, Balfour was sold to The Blackstone Group, a large U.S. private equity group and generated realized returns in excess of 20% per annum. During the 1990s, Mr. Belzberg was an active acquirer of distressed property in Alberta where values had dramatically declined due to the softness in the oil industry. These properties were subsequently divested when the market recovered. In 1992, Belzberg started a private real estate and equity investments company, which is now called Gibralt Capital Corporation.
Philanthropy and awards[edit]
Belzberg serves on various Board of Directors and is involved with numerous charities. He was awarded the Order of Canada in 1989 from the Governor General, and also in 1989 he received an honorary doctorate from Simon Fraser University.

In 1977, with a donation of $500,000, he helped fund the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles. He is the founder of both the Canadian and American Dystonia Medical Research Foundations.In 1988 he was made a Member of the Order of Canada and was promoted to Officer in 2001. In 2009, he was made a member of the Order of British Columbia.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
