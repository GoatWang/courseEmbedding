Life Insurance




There’s more to life insurance than taking care of loved ones if you pass away. 

Life insurance can also be an essential part of a financial plan. In addition to helping to protect loved ones financially with a death benefit, some products can grow money on a tax-advantaged basis that can be used during one’s lifetime. The ability to meet more than one need makes life insurance a product that adds valuable flexibility to any portfolio.

Talk to your financial professional if you think life insurance might be right for you.















                                Our easy-to-use tool can help guide you to start the conversation around life insurance with your financial professional. 
 

















Types of Life Insurance





Permanent Life Insurance
Provides coverage that lasts a lifetime and can build cash value that can be used while living. 



Term Life Insurance
Provides coverage for a specific length of time and provides the most payout for the money, but does not build cash value.

















Permanent Life Insurance
Permanent life insurance is designed to provide coverage for life. Many permanent life insurance products also have a feature called cash value. This cash value can grow over time through interest credits, market returns, or dividends, providing money that can be used for a variety of needs.  

Permanent life insurance products include: Universal Life, Indexed Universal Life, Whole Life, and Variable Universal Life.







Premier Accumulator Universal Life
Can grow cash value quickly and allows faster access to your money when you need it.
Learn More 
.


















Term Life Insurance
Term life insurance covers you for a fixed number of years, such as 1, 5, 10, 20, or 30 and pays a death benefit if you pass away during the covered time period. Most term insurance policies offer a level premium, death benefit, and the ability to convert to a permanent policy if your needs change. You can also choose coverage for current needs and add optional riders for future needs.







Guaranteed Level Term
Available in coverage amounts of $1 million or more, with premiums guaranteed to stay the same throughout the level premium period.

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield Level Selector annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Finding the best life insurance company typically involves weighing customer service, financial strength and price. Hundreds of life insurance companies are competing for your business, often selling very similar products.
The other element of your buying decision will be price. It’s smart to get life insurance quotes from at least a few companies.
Our calculations show that Northwestern Mutual is the best life insurance company among those we scored, and many others also are worthy of consideration. (Full methodology below.)

How to choose the best life insurance company for you
Look at customer satisfaction scores: Other customers’ experience can help you decide whether you want to do business with a company. You can get clues about a company’s reputation through:

Customer satisfaction scores from J.D. Power. The independent ratings firm publishes scores for nearly two dozen of the largest life insurers each year. 
Complaints filed against the company with state regulators.

Consider financial strength: Financial strength is especially important for life insurance companies because you’ll want a company that can pay claims many years down the road. Financial strength ratings are available through ratings agencies such as A.M. Best and Standard & Poor’s. We don’t recommend considering insurers with an A.M. Best rating of B or lower. 
Get prices: The cost of coverage varies among companies. It’s smart to get prices from at least a few insurance companies.
» COMPARE: Term life insurance quotes
Evaluate product selection: Although many companies sell similar policies, some focus more on certain products, such as whole life insurance, or on certain customers, such as seniors. Knowing generally the type of life insurance you want to buy will help you narrow the choices. You can learn more about the product offerings of each life insurance company below by clicking on the NerdWallet reviews.


Methodology 


How we came up with our rankings: We started with a list of the largest life insurance companies and then calculated a total score based on three measurements, each with equal weight within the score. We then adjusted scores to a 300-point scale:

Customer satisfaction scores from J.D. Power, worth up to 100 points.
Complaint ratios from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners for 2015, which measure complaints to state regulators adjusted for market share. We adjusted the complaint ratios to a 5-star scale, with companies getting the median number of complaints for their size earning 3 stars.
Financial strength ratings from A.M. Best, which indicate a company’s ability to pay future claims, worth up to 100 points. All of the companies shown have solid financial strength. A.M. Best defines the ratings shown above as:


A++ and A+ = superior.
A = excellent.

The Differences Between Term and Whole Life Insurance

Insurance, Life Insurance





  


Term vs. whole life insurance

Term life insurance is easier to understand and costs much less than whole life insurance, but it has an end date. A 30-year policy is typically the longest term available, depending on your age. 
Whole life insurance will last the rest of your life, so your beneficiaries are guaranteed a payout no matter when you die.

Whole life insurance also builds up “cash value,” which is money you can access while you’re alive. Term life has no cash value.




Buying life insurance now provides a financial safety net for your dependents later if you’re not around to take care of them. After you’re gone, your family can use the proceeds to cover funeral costs, mortgage payments, college tuition and other expenses.

There are two main types of life insurance: 
Term life insurance is the easiest to understand and has the lowest prices.
Permanent insurance is more complex and tends to cost more than term, but it offers additional benefits. Whole life is the most well-known and simplest form of permanent life insurance. Other kinds of permanent life insurance include universal, variable and variable universal.













Let’s take a closer look at term life versus whole life insurance.

Choosing between term life and whole life
Term life insurance explained
Term life insurance provides coverage for a certain time period. It’s often called “pure life insurance” because it’s designed only to protect your dependents in case you die prematurely. If you have a term policy and die within the term, your beneficiaries receive the payout. The policy has no other value.
You choose the term when you buy the policy. Common terms are 10, 20 or 30 years. With most policies, the payout, called the death benefit, and the cost, or premium, stay the same throughout the term.
» COMPARE: NerdWallet’s life insurance comparison tool
When you shop for term life:

Choose a term that coincides with the years you’ll be paying the bills and want life insurance coverage in case you die early.
Buy an amount your family would need if you were no longer there to provide for them. The payout could replace your income and help your family pay for services you perform now, such as child care.

Ideally, your family’s need for life insurance will end around the time the term expires: Your kids will be on their own, you’ll have paid off your house, and you’ll have plenty of money in savings to serve as a financial safety net.
All of the best life insurance companies sell term life, so it’s easy to find rates.

Whole life insurance explained
Like all permanent life insurance policies, whole life provides lifelong coverage and includes an investment component known as the policy’s cash value. The cash value grows slowly, tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes on its gains while they’re accumulating. 
You can borrow money against the account or surrender the policy for the cash. But if you don’t repay policy loans with interest, you’ll reduce your death benefit, and if you surrender the policy, you’ll no longer have coverage.
Although it’s more complicated than term life insurance, whole life is the most straightforward form of permanent life insurance. Here’s why:

The premium remains the same for as long as you live
The death benefit is guaranteed
The cash value account grows at a guaranteed rate

Some whole life policies can also earn annual dividends, a portion of the insurer’s financial surplus. You can take the dividends in cash, leave them on deposit to earn interest or use them to decrease your premium, repay policy loans or buy additional coverage. Dividends are not guaranteed.

Cost comparison
Term life insurance is cheap because it’s temporary and has no cash value; in most cases, your family won’t receive a payout because you’ll live to the end of the term. Whole life insurance premiums are much higher because the coverage lasts for a lifetime, and the policy has cash value, with a guaranteed rate of investment return on a portion of the money that you pay.
Below are price comparisons between term life and whole life insurance. We used 20-year and 30-year term life policies because no apples-to-apples comparison is possible for the length of term life to whole life.

Choosing between term and whole life insurance
Term life is sufficient for most families who need life insurance, but whole life and other forms of permanent coverage can be useful in certain situations.




Choose term life if:Choose whole life if:




 You need life insurance only to replace your income over a certain period, such as the years you’re raising children or paying off your mortgage
You want the most affordable coverage
You think you might want permanent life insurance but can’t afford it. Most term life policies are convertible to permanent coverage. The deadline for conversion varies by policy.You want to provide money for your heirs to pay estate taxes. In 2017, estates worth more than $5.49 million per individual and $10.98 million per couple are subject to federal estate taxes. State estate taxes vary. Here’s a map of state estate and inheritance taxes from the Tax Foundation.
Without a life insurance payout, your heirs might be forced to sell off parts of the estate, such as heirlooms or property, to pay the tax bill.
You have a lifelong dependent, such as a child with special needs. Life insurance can fund a special needs trust to provide care for your child after you’re gone. Consult with an attorney and financial advisor if you want to set up a trust.
You want to spend your retirement savings and still leave an inheritance or money for final expenses, such as funeral costs. With a whole life policy, your beneficiaries get a payout no matter when you die.
You want to equalize inheritances. If you plan to leave a business or other property to one child, you could use whole life insurance to compensate your other children.

Types of Life Insurance

Insurance, Life Insurance





  

What type of life insurance is best for you? That depends on a variety of factors, including how long you want the policy to last, how much you want your life insurance rates to be, and whether you want to be able to withdraw money from the policy later.
Term life insurance is suitable for most people. Permanent life insurance policies (such as whole life and universal life) usually contain a “cash value” account, which builds value over time. Eventually you may have enough cash value to take a loan against it to use for large expenses, such as college. Because permanent policies can be complex and expensive, it’s best to have a financial advisor guide you through the options and costs.













Here’s a deeper overview of types of life insurance:

Term
Whole
Universal



Term life insurance

Pros: It’s easy to understand and is the cheapest way to buy life insurance.
Cons: You could outlive your policy. If you still need coverage, you’d need to buy another policy and will pay more based on your age and, possibly, health.

You only have to make two decisions if you buy term life insurance: what amount you want, and how long you want the coverage to last. “Small” term life policies are available with under $50,000 in coverage, but policy amounts can go into the millions. Term life is typically sold in lengths of five, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 years. “Level premium” term life means you’re locking in a price for the length of the policy. Typically you will pay a monthly or annual premium to keep the insurance in force. “Annual renewable” term life is a one-year policy that renews every year for a higher price.

Whole life insurance (sometimes called ordinary life insurance)

Pros: It covers you for your entire life. Everything in the policy is guaranteed, so there are no surprises.
Cons: It’s a very expensive way to buy life insurance.

Whole life insurance is a form of permanent life insurance, meaning it doesn’t expire. It’s the closest thing to “set it and forget it” life insurance. As long as you pay the bill, you don’t have to think much about the policy. Your payments stay the same, you get a guaranteed rate of return on the “cash value” investment component of the policy, and the death benefit amount doesn’t change.


Universal life insurance
Guaranteed
Indexed
Variable
Guaranteed universal life insurance (GUL)

Pros: It’s cheaper than whole life and other forms of universal life insurance. You can choose the age to which you want the death benefit guaranteed, such as 95 or 100.
Cons: Every payment must be made on time or you could lose the guarantee and forfeit the policy, thereby losing all your previous payments. The policy may have little or no cash value.

Guaranteed universal life insurance offers insurance at a cheaper price than other permanent life insurance products. The policies promise a certain death benefit and payments that don’t change. There’s typically little or no cash value within the policy, and insurers demand on-time payments. Missing a payment could mean you forfeit the policy. And since there’s no cash value in the policy, you’d walk away with nothing if you forfeit. If you are sometimes late with bills, this is not the product for you. In addition, consider that future financial or health problems could cause you to miss a payment.
Indexed universal life insurance (IUL)

Pros: You can access cash value, which grows over time. The cash value is linked to a stock market index, so if the stock market goes up, you get some upside, too. Within limits, your payments and death benefit amount are flexible.
Cons: Your cash value doesn’t take full advantage of stock market gains. You should understand the policy’s fees, participation rates and the ceiling on your return (called a cap) before you buy.

Indexed universal life insurance links the cash value component of the policy to a stock market index like the S&P 500. Your gains are determined by a formula, which is outlined in the policy. The policy will dictate how much your cash value “participates” in any gains. For example, if your participation rate is 80% and the S&P 500 goes up 10%, you get an 8% return. Fortunately, if the index goes down, you won’t lose cash value; you’ll just get zero rate of return. Some policies offer a small guaranteed interest rate in case the market goes down.
Your gains in cash value will also be limited by your “cap,” which is the maximum you’ll get no matter how high the market goes. For example, a cap might be 10%. If the index goes up 20%, and your cap is 10%, you still get only 10%. And remember, only a portion of your payments are going into the cash value to begin with.
There are additional moving parts to keep track of, such as your payments and death benefit. Within limits you can decrease your premiums or skip a payment, as long as your cash value covers the insurance costs. You need to keep track of this. If you’re skipping payments and you don’t have enough cash value to cover costs, your policy could lapse. Some policies allow you to adjust your death benefit, too, as your family’s needs change.
Variable universal life insurance (VUL) and variable life insurance (VL)

Pros: There’s a chance for a large potential gain in cash value if your investment choices do well. A policy owner can take partial withdrawals from cash value or loans against it.
Cons: It requires you to be hands-on in managing your policy. The cash value changes every day based on the market. Lots of fees and administrative charges are deducted from your payment before anything goes to cash value.

With variable universal life and variable life insurance, you tie your cash value to investment accounts, such as bonds or money market and equity accounts. There can be high risk to the investment account value based on the market, but if you do have cash value, you can take partial withdrawals or loans against it. You can also vary your premium payments, within certain minimums and maximums, and vary the death benefit. The “policy illustrations” shown to potential customers can be complex and optimistic, but if you’re considering a policy like this, a fee-only financial advisor (who doesn’t earn commissions based on policy sales) can help you sort it out.

Types of underwriting for life insurance policies
You may hear some other words that sound like additional types of life insurance, but they’re really about how the policy is “underwritten,” meaning how the life insurance companies will determine how much of a “risk” you are.

Fully underwritten life insurance: A life insurance medical exam is often required. The application will also generally include many questions about your health, your family’s health history, your lifestyle (such as hobbies like skydiving), and your plans for travel outside the United States. This “full underwriting” allows the insurance company to most accurately price the policy based on your life expectancy. If you are healthy — or even if you have a couple health issues — this will generally be the cheapest way to buy life insurance.
Simplified issue life insurance: No life insurance medical exam is required, but you will be asked a few health questions and you could be turned down based on your answers.
Guaranteed issue life insurance: There’s no medical exam and no questions asked. You can’t be turned down. This is the most expensive way to buy life insurance, and you might find only low coverage amounts available, such as $50,000 or $100,000. In addition, if you die within the first few years of having the policy, your beneficiaries may receive only a partial death benefit or a check for the premiums you paid. People often buy these policies when they’ve been turned down elsewhere but they want to cover final expenses, such as funeral costs.

There are also types of life insurance meant for specific situations:
Mortgage life insurance: Covers specifically the current balance of your mortgage and pays out to the lender, not your family, if you die.
Credit life insurance: Covers only the balance of a specific loan, like a home equity loan. Your bank might offer to sell you a credit life insurance policy when you take out a loan. If you die it pays off the lender, not your family.
Accidental death and dismemberment (AD&D): Pays a death benefit only if you die accidentally, such as in a car crash. Accidental death and dismemberment policies also offer insurance payouts for loss of limbs, sight and hearing, and other problems.
Joint life insurance: This type of permanent life insurance insures two lives (usually spouses) under one policy and comes in two forms:

First-to-die: Pays out upon the death of the first person, whichever one it is. The surviving spouse would typically be the beneficiary. The policy would then expire; it doesn’t continue to cover the second person.
Second-to-die: Pays out when both people have died. A policy like this is typically used when heirs (such as children) will need money to pay estate or inheritance taxes, so that they don’t have to sell off assets.

What is Term Life Insurance?

Term life insurance is the most affordable way to protect your family's financial security if something happens to you.
Men and women in excellent health in their mid 30s and 40s can buy $100,000+ of term life insurance for under a dollar a day.
You can buy term life insurance for 10, 15, 20, or 30 years — however long you need it.
In most cases, term life insurance proceeds are tax-free. Consult with your tax advisor if you have any questions.  



How Much Do I Need?

Term life insurance is the most affordable – and flexible – Life insurance product available. Why? Because term life insurance provides a specific death benefit amount for a duration – or term – chosen by the policyholder. Once a 10-, 15-, 20-, or 30-year term is selected, the coverage and premium amounts remain the same for the life of the policy. So rather than paying a monthly premium for the rest of your life, you can simply buy coverage for however long you need it – usually until your children are grown and out of the house.
Life insurance is a personal affair. Standard formulas such as buying coverage equal to eight, nine or ten times your annual income are inadequate shortcuts. Online calculators can provide a general guide, but it doesn't make sense to say that someone with four young children should have the same amount of coverage as empty nesters with no mortgage and a substantial retirement fund. Other items to consider:
The time factor. Figure out how many years you'll need to be covered.
Final expenses. Determine the total cost of your funeral, burial and related expenses.
Mortgages and other debts. Tally your mortgage balance, car loans, student loans, and any other major expenses.
Education expenses. This calculation can be tricky because you need to consider the cost of a college education at the time your kids will enroll, as opposed to what it would cost today. Hint: It will be more expensive.
Income replacement. Once you cover funeral expenses, debts and education, you need to determine the amount of income required for your family members to sustain their current lifestyle. 
A conversation with an experienced agent can provide the guidance you need.

How to Buy Life Insurance in 5 Easy Steps

1. Get a quote.
We'll give you a side-by-side comparison of your best prices from highly-rated life insurance companies based on your age, health, family health history, and lifestyle. 
Quotes are based on the information you give upfront. Final prices are determined by the life insurance company after they review your mini medical exam and other information. The more accurate the information you provide upfront, the more accurate your quote will be.
2. Choose your insurance company.
Decide which life insurance company you prefer. While their prices may vary, they're all highly-rated – and excellent at paying claims promptly.
3. Get a mini checkup.
We'll send a licensed paramedic to examine you. You'll receive a free copy of your lab results, which are completely confidential.
4. Get your underwriting results.
Your life insurance company will make a decision regarding your insurability – and final price – based on your medical results and other information.
5. Start your coverage.
Depending on your state of residence, you have up to 30 days to return your policy and be fully reimbursed for any premiums paid. It brings peace of mind to know that your family will be financially secure in the event of a tragedy. Visit our life insurance quote page or call 1-800-670-3213 to get a free quote from one of our agents.

Mortgages and other debts. Tally your mortgage balance, car loans, student loans, and any other major expenses.
Education expenses. This calculation can be tricky because you need to consider the cost of a college education at the time your kids will enroll, as opposed to what it would cost today. Hint: It will be more expensive.
Income replacement. Once you cover funeral expenses, debts and education, you need to determine the amount of income required for your family members to sustain their current lifestyle. 
A conversation with an experienced agent can provide the guidance you need.

the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.;                           

   WHEREAS, the General Agent, which is an Affiliate of, or the same
person as, the Broker-Dealer, or whose employees are also employees of the

    WHEREAS, The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States
("Equitable") has appointed the Distributor as principal underwriter or         
distributor of the Variable Accounts and the MVA Interests and as distributor   
of the Contracts and has authorized the Distributor to recommend persons for    
appointment as agents of Equitable to solicit applications for the sale of the  
Contracts;                                                                      

       WHEREAS, it is intended that the General Agent shall be authorized to
offer and sell the Contracts to the general public subject to the terms and     
conditions set forth more fully herein;                                         

 WHEREAS, Equitable has authorized the Distributor to enter into
separate written agreements with broker-dealers registered under the 1934 Act

parties hereto desire that the Broker-Dealer be authorized to solicit           
applications for the sale of the Contracts;                                     

 WHEREAS, in the future, Contracts may be issued by an insurance

authorized to promote the offer and sale of such Contracts in the same manner   
that Equitable has authorized the Distributor to act, as described above.

The Broker-Dealer and the General Agent accept such authorization and agree to  
use their best efforts to find purchasers for the Contracts in each case        
acceptable to the Equitable Life Company issuing such Contracts. The

sale under all applicable securities and insurance laws. The Broker-Dealer and

P-->EX-99.3(B)4th�Page�of�22TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�4th
                e.   If any event occurs as a result of which the Contract
Prospectus(es) or any sales literature for the Contracts would include any      
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary  
to make the statements therein not misleading.                                  

The Distributor will provide the Broker-Dealer and the General Agent with       
notification of these matters immediately by telephone, with notification in    
writing promptly thereafter.                                                    

Section 2.3    Authority to Recommend Agent Appointments. The General   
Agent is vested under this Agreement with power and authority to select and     
recommend individuals who are associated with the General Agent and are         
registered representatives of the Broker-Dealer for appointment as agents of    
Equitable, and only individuals so recommended by the General Agent to the      
Distributor shall become Agents, provided that Equitable reserves the right in  
its sole discretion to refuse to appoint any proposed agent or, once            
appointed, to terminate the same at any time with or without cause.             

  Section 2.4    Limitations on Authority. Neither the Broker-Dealer nor the
General Agent shall possess or exercise any authority on behalf of the          
Distributor or the Equitable Life Companies other than that expressly           
conferred on the Broker-Dealer or the General Agent by this Agreement. In       
particular, and without limiting the foregoing, neither the Broker-Dealer nor   
the General Agent shall have any authority, nor shall either grant such         
authority to any Agent, on behalf of the Distributor (i) to make, alter or      
discharge any Contract or other contract entered into pursuant to a Contract;   
(ii) to waive any Contract provision; (iii) to extend the time for payment of   
any Premiums; or (iv) to receive any monies or Premiums from applicants for or  
purchasers of the Contracts (except for the sole purpose of forwarding monies   
or Premiums to an Equitable Life Company).                                      

Section 2.5    Insurer's Right to Reject Applications. The Broker-Dealer
and the General Agent acknowledge that each Equitable Life Company has the      
right in its sole discretion to reject any applications or Premiums received    
by it and to return or refund to an applicant such applicant's Premium. In the  
event that an Equitable Life Company rejects an application solicited by an     
Agent, such Equitable Life Company will return any Premium paid by the          
applicant to such applicant and will promptly notify the General Agent of such  
action. In the event that a purchaser exercises his or her free look right      
under a Contract, any amount to be refunded as provided in such Contract will   
be so refunded to the purchaser by or on behalf of the Equitable Life Company   
that issued such Contract, and such Equitable Life Company will promptly        
notify the General Agent of such action.                                        

Section 2.6    Contracts Included Under Agreement. Schedule I to this   
Agreement describes the life insurance and annuity contracts which are          
included as Contracts under this Agreement. Schedule I may be amended by the    
Distributor in its sole discretion from time to time to include other classes   
of annuity contracts or life insurance contracts issued by an Equitable Life    
Company and distributed by the Distributor pursuant to any distribution         
agreement with an Equitable Life Company which relates to the Contracts. The    
provisions of this Agreement shall apply with equal force to such additional    
Contracts unless the context otherwise requires. Schedule I may be amended by   
the Distributor in its sole discretion from time to time to delete classes of   
annuity contracts or life insurance contracts.                                  

  Section 2.7    Independent Contractor Status. The Distributor acknowledges
that the Broker-Dealer and the General Agent are each independent contractors.  
Accordingly, while the Broker-Dealer and the General Agent agree to use their   
best efforts to solicit applications for the Contracts, the Broker-Dealer and   
the General Agent are not obliged or expected to give full time and energies    
to the performance of their obligations hereunder or to sell or solicit a       
specified number of Contracts, nor are the Broker-Dealer and the General Agent  
obliged or expected to represent the Distributor or any Equitable Life Company  
exclusively. Nothing herein contained shall constitute the Broker-Dealer, the   
General Agent, or any agents

or representatives of the Broker-Dealer or the General Agent as employees of

registered as a broker-dealer under the 1934 Act and in each state or other     
jurisdiction in which Broker-Dealer intends to perform its functions and        
fulfill its obligations hereunder and in which such registration is required,   
and be a member in good standing of the NASD.                                   

 Section 3.2    General Agent Qualifications. The General Agent represents
that it is a licensed life insurance agent where required to solicit            
applications. The General Agent must, at all times when performing its          
functions and fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement, be duly          
licensed to sell the Contracts in each state or other jurisdiction in which     
the General Agent intends to perform its functions and fulfill its obligations  
hereunder.                                                                      

Section 3.3    Qualifications of Broker-Dealer Representatives. The     
Broker-Dealer represents and warrants that it shall take all necessary action   
to ensure that no individual shall offer or sell the Contracts on behalf of     
Broker-Dealer in any state or other jurisdiction in which the Contracts may     
lawfully be sold unless such individual is an associated person of              
Broker-Dealer (as that term is defined in Section 3(a)(18) of the 1934 Act),    
is not subject to a statutory disqualification (as that term is defined in the  
1934 Act) and is duly registered with the NASD and any applicable state         
securities regulatory authority as a registered person of Broker-Dealer         
qualified to distribute the Contracts in such state or other jurisdiction.      

Section 3.4 Qualifications of General Agent's Agents and Appointment of 
Agents. The General Agent represents and warrants that it shall take all        
necessary action to ensure that no individual shall offer or sell the           
Contracts on behalf of the General Agent in any state or other jurisdiction     
unless such individual is duly appointed as an agent of the General Agent,      
duly licensed and appointed as an agent of the appropriate Equitable Life       
Company and appropriately licensed, registered or otherwise qualified to offer  
and sell the Contracts to be offered and sold by such individual under the      
insurance laws of such state or jurisdiction. The General Agent understands     
that certain states may require that a special variable contracts examination   
be passed by agent before he or she can solicit applications for the            
Contracts. Nothing in this Agreement is to be construed as requiring an         
Equitable Life Company to obtain a license or issue a consent or appointment    
to enable any particular agent to sell Contracts. Moreover, without limiting    
the generality of the foregoing, an Equitable Life Company shall not consider   
for appointment any individual who was a member of Equitable's career agency    
force within the preceding 12 months. All matters concerning the licensing of   
any individuals recommended for appointment by the General Agent under any      
applicable state insurance law shall be a matter directly between the General   
Agent and such individual. The General Agent shall furnish the Equitable Life   
Companies with proof of proper licensing of such individual or other proof,     
reasonably acceptable to the Equitable Life Companies, of satisfaction by such  
individual of licensing requirements prior to the appointment of any such       
individual as an agent of any Equitable Life Company. In conjunction with the   
submission of appointment papers for all such individuals as insurance agents   
of an Equitable Life Company, the General Agent shall be deemed to represent    
that each individual is competent and qualified to act as an agent for the      
Equitable Life Companies and to hold himself or herself out in good faith to    
the general public.

Broker-Dealer and General Agent Compliance  

 Section 4.1    Supervisory Responsibilities of General Agent. The General
Agent shall train, supervise and be solely responsible for the conduct of the   
Agents in their solicitation activities in connection with the Contracts, and   
shall supervise Agents' strict compliance with applicable rules and             
regulations of any governmental or other insurance authorities that have        
jurisdiction over insurance contract activities, as well as the rules and       
procedures of the Equitable Life Companies pertaining to the solicitation,      
sale and submission of applications for the Contracts and the provision of      
services relating to the Contracts. The General Agent shall be solely           
responsible for background investigations of the proposed agents to determine   
their qualifications, good character and moral fitness to sell the Contracts.   

Section 4.2    Supervisory Responsibilities of Broker-Dealer. The       
Broker-Dealer shall be responsible for securities training, supervision and     
control of the Agents in connection with their solicitation activities and any  
incidental services with respect to the Contracts and shall supervise Agents'   
strict compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws and NASD    
requirements in connection with such solicitation activities and with the       
rules and procedures of the Equitable Life Companies.                           

 Section 4.3    Compliance With Applicable Laws. The Broker-Dealer and the
General Agent hereby represent and warrant that they are in compliance with     
all applicable federal and state securities laws and regulations and all        
applicable insurance laws and regulations, including, without limitation,       
state insurance laws and regulations imposing insurance licensing               
requirements. The Broker-Dealer and the General Agent each agree to carry out   
their respective sales and administrative activities and obligations under      
this Agreement in continued compliance with federal and state laws and          
regulations, including those governing securities and insurance-related         
activities or transactions, as applicable. The Broker-Dealer and the General    
Agent shall notify the Distributor and the Equitable Life Companies             
immediately in writing if Broker-Dealer and/or the General Agent fail to        
comply with any of the laws and regulations applicable to either of them.       

Section 4.4    Restrictions on Sales Activity. The Broker-Dealer and the
General Agent and Agents shall not offer or attempt to offer the Contracts,     
nor solicit applications for the Contracts, nor deliver Contracts, in any       
state or other jurisdiction in which the Contracts may not lawfully be sold or  
offered for sale. For purposes of determining where the Contracts may be        
offered and applications solicited, the Broker-Dealer and the General Agent     
may rely on written notification, as revised from time to time, received from   
the Distributor.                                                                

Section 4.5    Premiums and Other Payments. All Premiums and loan       
repayments shall be sent promptly (and in any event not later than two          
business days after receipt) to the appropriate Equitable Life Company at the   
address indicated in the rules and procedures of the Equitable Life Companies,  
or at such other address as the Equitable Life Companies or the Distributor     
may subsequently specify in writing. Each initial Premium shall be accompanied  
by a properly completed application for a Contract, unless such Premium is      
submitted in accordance with the procedures set forth in Exhibit B, which have  
been accepted and agreed to by the Broker-Dealer and the General Agent, as      
provided in Exhibit B. Checks in payment of Premiums or outstanding loans       
shall be drawn to the order of the appropriate Equitable Life Company.          

Section 4.6    Misdirected Payments. In the event that Premiums or loan 
repayments are sent to the General Agent or Broker-Dealer, rather than to the   
appropriate Equitable Life Company, the General Agent and Broker-Dealer shall   
promptly (and in any event, within two business days) remit such Premiums to    
the appropriate Equitable Life Company at the address indicated in the rules    
and procedures of the Equitable Life Companies. The General Agent and           
Broker-Dealer acknowledge that if any Premium or other                          

-6-   

P-->EX-99.3(B)7th�Page�of�22TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�7th
payment is held at any time by either of them, such Premium or other payment    
shall be held on behalf of the client, and the General Agent or Broker-Dealer   
shall segregate such Premium or other payment from their own funds and          
promptly (and in any event, within two business days) remit such Premium or     
other payment to the Equitable Life Company issuing the Contract pursuant to    
which such amounts have been paid.                                              

Section 4.7    Delivery of Contracts. Upon issuance of a Contract by an 
Equitable Life Company and delivery of such Contract to the General Agent, the  
General Agent shall promptly deliver such Contract to its purchaser. For        
purposes of this provision, "promptly" shall be deemed to mean not later than   
five calendar days. Consistent with its administrative procedures, each         
Equitable Life Company will assume that a Contract issued by it will be         
delivered by the General Agent to the purchaser of such Contract within five    
calendar days. As a result, if a purchaser exercises the free look rights       
under a Contract, the Broker-Dealer and the General Agent shall indemnify the   
Equitable Life Company issuing a Contract for any loss incurred by such         
Equitable Life Company that results from the General Agent's failure to         
deliver such Contract to its purchaser within the contemplated                  
five-calendar-day period.                                                       

    Section 4.8    Restrictions on Communications. Neither the Broker-Dealer nor
the General Agent, nor any of their directors, partners, officers, employees,   
registered persons, associated persons, agents or affiliated persons, in        
connection with the offer or sale of the Contracts, shall give any information  
or make any representations or statements, written or oral, concerning the      
Contracts, the Variable Accounts or the Trust other than information or         
representations contained in the Contract and Trust Prospectuses, statements    
of additional information and Registration Statements, or in reports or proxy   
statements therefor, or in promotional, sales or advertising material or other  
information supplied and approved in writing by the Distributor.                

Section 4.9    Directions Given on Behalf of Contract Owners. The       
Broker-Dealer and the General Agent shall be solely responsible for the         
accuracy and propriety of any instruction given or action taken by an Agent on  
behalf of an owner or prospective owner of a Contract, including any            
instruction or action pursuant to Exhibit B. Neither the Distributor nor the    
Equitable Life Companies shall have any responsibility or liability for any     
action taken or omitted by it or by them in good faith in reliance on or by     
acceptance of such an instruction or action.                                    

Section 4.10   Restrictions on Sales Material and Name Usage. The       
Broker-Dealer and the General Agent shall neither use nor authorize the use of  
any promotional, sales or advertising material relating to the Contracts, the   
Equitable Life Companies, the Variable Accounts, the MVA Interests or the       
Trust without the prior written approval of the Distributor. Furthermore, the   
Broker-Dealer and the General Agent shall neither use nor authorize the use of  
the name of Equitable or of an Affiliate of Equitable, or any other name,       
trademark, service mark, symbol or trade style that is now or may hereafter be  
owned by Equitable or by an Affiliate of Equitable, except in the manner and    
to the extent that such use may be specifically authorized in writing by        
Equitable or the Distributor.                                                   

  Section 4.11   Market Timing and Other Prohibitions. The Broker-Dealer and
the General Agent understand and acknowledge that the Distributor, in its sole  
discretion and at any time during the term of this Agreement, may restrict or   
prohibit the solicitation, offer or sale of Contracts and Premiums thereunder   
in connection with any so-called "market timing" or "asset allocation"          
program, plan, arrangement or service. Should the Distributor determine in its  
sole discretion that the Broker-Dealer or the General Agent is soliciting,      
offering or selling, or has solicited, offered or sold, Contracts or Premiums   
subject to any so-called "market timing" or "asset allocation" program, plan,   
arrangement or service which is not permitted under this Agreement (an          
"unapproved program"), the Distributor may take such action which is            
necessary, in its sole discretion, to halt such solicitations, offers or        
sales. Furthermore, in addition to any indemnification provided in Article XI   
and any other liability that the Broker-Dealer and the General Agent            

-7-   

P-->EX-99.3(B)8th�Page�of�22TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�8th
might have, the Distributor may hold the Broker-Dealer and the General Agent    
liable for any damages or losses, actual or consequential, sustained by the     
Distributor or any of its Affiliates, or the Trust or any Equitable Life        
Company, as a result of any unapproved program which causes such losses or      
damages following solicitation, offer or sale of a Contract or Premium subject  
to any unapproved program or similar service made available by or through the   
Broker-Dealer or the General Agent. Notwithstanding any prohibitions which may  
be imposed pursuant to this Section 4.11, the Broker-Dealer and its registered  
representatives who are Agents may provide incidental services in the form of   
guidance to applicants and owners of Contracts regarding the allocation of      
Premiums and Contract value, provided that such services are (i) solely         
incidental to the Broker-Dealer's activities in connection with the sales of    
the Contracts, (ii) subject to the supervision and control of the               
Broker-Dealer, and (iii) furnished in accordance with rules and procedures      
prescribed by Equitable.                                                        

Section 4.12   Tax Reporting Responsibility. The Broker-Dealer and the  
General Agent shall be solely responsible under applicable tax laws for the     
reporting of compensation paid to Agents and for any withholding of taxes from  
compensation paid to Agents, including, without limitation, FICA, FUTA, and     
federal, state and local income taxes.                                          

Section 4.13   Maintenance of Books and Records. The General Agent      
represents that it maintains and shall maintain such books and records          
concerning the activities of the Agents as may be required by the appropriate   
insurance regulatory agencies that have jurisdiction and that may be            
reasonably required by the Distributor to reflect adequately the Contracts      
processed through the General Agent. The General Agent shall make such books    
and records available to the Distributor and/or an Equitable Life Company at    
any reasonable time upon written request by the Distributor. The Broker-Dealer  
represents that it maintains and shall maintain appropriate books and records   
concerning the activities of the Agents as are required by the SEC, the NASD    
and other agencies having jurisdiction and that may be reasonably required by   
the Distributor to reflect adequately the Contracts processed through the       
General Agent. Broker-Dealer shall make such books and records available to     
the Distributor and/or an Equitable Life Company at any reasonable time upon    
written request by the Distributor or an Equitable Life Company.                

 Section 4.14   Bonding of Agents and Others. The Broker-Dealer represents
that all directors, officers, employees, and registered representatives of the  
Broker-Dealer who are appointed pursuant to this Agreement as Agents for state  
insurance law purposes or who have access to funds of the Equitable Life        
Companies, including but not limited to funds submitted with applications for   
the Contracts or funds being returned to purchasers of Contracts, are and       
shall be covered by a blanket fidelity bond, including coverage for larceny     
and embezzlement, issued by a reputable bonding company. This bond shall be     
maintained by the Broker-Dealer at the Broker-Dealer's expense. Such bond       
shall be, at least, of the form, type and amount required under the NASD Rules  
of Fair Practice. The Distributor may require evidence, satisfactory to it,     
that such coverage is in force, and the Broker-Dealer shall give prompt         
written notice to the Distributor of any cancellation or change of coverage.    
The Broker-Dealer assigns any proceeds received from the fidelity bonding       
company to the Equitable Life Companies to the extent of each Equitable Life    
Company's loss due to activities covered by the bond. If there is any           
deficiency amount, as a result of a deductible provision or otherwise, the      
Broker-Dealer shall promptly pay the affected Equitable Life Company such       
amount on demand, and the Broker-Dealer hereby indemnifies and holds harmless   
such Equitable Life Company from any such deficiency and from the costs of      
collection thereof (including reasonable attorneys' fees).                      

   Section 4.15   Reports to Insurers. The Broker-Dealer and the General Agent
shall promptly furnish to each Equitable Life Company or its authorized agent   
any reports and information that such Equitable Life Company may reasonably     
request for the purpose of meeting such Equitable Life Company's reporting and  
recordkeeping requirements under the insurance laws of any state, under any     
applicable federal or state securities laws, rules or regulations, or the       
rules of the NASD.

ARTICLE V 
Standard of Conduct for Agents  

Section 5.1    Basic Rules of Conduct. The Broker-Dealer and the General
Agent shall ensure that each Agent shall comply with a standard of conduct      
including, but not limited to, the following:                                   

          a.   An Agent shall be duly qualified,  licensed and

          b.   An Agent shall not solicit applications for the
Contracts without delivering the appropriate Contract Prospectus(es) the Trust  
Prospectus and, where required by state insurance law (as set forth in a        
notice to be supplied by the Equitable Life Companies), the then currently      
effective statement of additional information for the Contracts, and any other  
information whose delivery is specifically required. In soliciting              
applications for the Contracts, an Agent shall only make statements, oral or    
written, which are in accordance with the Contract Prospectus, the Trust        
Prospectus and written sales literature regarding the Contracts authorized by   
the Distributor. An Agent shall utilize only those applications for the         
Contracts provided to the General Agent by the Distributor.                     

                 c.   An Agent shall recommend the purchase of a Contract to
an applicant only if he or she has reasonable grounds to believe that such      
purchase is suitable for the applicant in accordance with, among other things,  
applicable regulations of any state regulatory authority, the SEC and the       
NASD. While not limited to the following, a determination of suitability shall  
be based on information supplied to an Agent after a reasonable inquiry         
concerning the applicant's insurance and investment objectives and financial    
situation and needs.                                                            

                d.   An Agent shall require that any payment of an initial
Premium, whether in the form of a check or otherwise, shall be drawn in U.S.    
dollars on a bank located in the United States and made payable to the          
appropriate Equitable Life Company and, if in the form of a check, signed by    
the applicant for the Contract. An Agent shall not accept third-party checks    
or cash for Premiums.                                                           

                 e.   All checks and applications for the Contracts received
by an Agent shall be forwarded promptly, and in any event not later than two    
business days after receipt, to the processing office designated by the         
Equitable Life Companies.                                                       

                f.   An Agent shall have no authority to endorse checks to
an Equitable Life Company.                                                    

                g.   An Agent shall have no  authority  to alter,  modify,
waive or change any of the terms, rates, charges or conditions of the           
Contracts.                                                                      

                h.   An Agent shall make no representations concerning the
continuation of non-guaranteed terms or provisions of the Contracts.            

                i.   An Agent shall have no authority to advertise for, on
behalf of, or with respect to an Equitable Life Company, the Distributor, the   
Variable Accounts, the MVA Interests, the Contracts or the Trust without prior  
written approval and authorization from the Distributor.                        

      j.   An Agent shall have no authority to solicit
applications for Contracts or Premiums thereunder which will be subject to or   
in connection with any so-called "market timing" or "asset allocation"          
program, plan, arrangement or service which is an unapproved program.

P-->EX-99.3(B)10th�Page�of�22TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�10th
           k.   An Agent shall not furnish any transfer or other
instructions by telephone to an Equitable Life Company on behalf of an owner    
of a Contract without having first obtained from such owner a written           
authorization in a form acceptable to the Equitable Life Companies.             

               l.   An Agent shall not encourage a prospective purchaser
to surrender or exchange an insurance policy or contract issued by an           
Equitable Life Company in order to purchase a Contract or, conversely, to       
surrender or exchange a Contract in order to purchase another insurance policy  
or contract issued by an Equitable Life Company, except to the extent such      
surrenders or exchanges have been authorized by the Distributor. In the event   
that an insurance policy or contract issued by an Equitable Life Company is     
surrendered or exchanged in order to purchase a Contract, no compensation       
shall be paid under this Agreement.                                             

               m.   An Agent shall act in accordance  with the rules and
procedures of the Equitable Life Companies in connection with any solicitation  
activities relating to the Contracts.

this Agreement, the Distributor will be responsible for providing and

the Distributor shall pay to the General Agent (or to the Broker-Dealer, at     
the request of the General Agent) as compensation for Contracts for which it    
is the Broker-of-Record, the amounts set forth in Schedule II, as such

P-->EX-99.3(B)11th�Page�of�22TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�11th
Compensation with respect to any Contract shall be paid to the General Agent    
only for so long as the General Agent is the Broker-of-Record for such          
Contract.                                                                       

Section 7.2    Limitations on Compensation. No compensation or          
reimbursement of any kind other than that described in this Agreement is        
payable to the General Agent or the Broker-Dealer. In addition, the             
Broker-Dealer and the General Agent recognize that, unless the provisions of    
Exhibit B apply to the receipt of an initial Premium, all compensation payable  
to the General Agent hereunder will be disbursed by or on behalf of the         
Distributor after each Premium is received and accepted by the appropriate      
Equitable Life Company.                                                         

Section 7.3    Expenses Paid by Broker-Dealer and General Agent. Neither
the Broker-Dealer nor the General Agent shall, directly or indirectly, expend   
or contract for the expenditure of any funds of the Distributor or any          
Equitable Life Company. The Broker-Dealer and the General Agent shall each pay  
all expenses incurred by each of them in the performance of this Agreement,     
unless otherwise specifically provided for in this Agreement or unless the      
Distributor shall have agreed in advance in writing to share the cost of        
certain expenses. Initial state appointment fees for agents of an Equitable     
Life Company who are associated with the General Agent will be paid by such     
Equitable Life Company unless otherwise paid by the General Agent or            
Broker-Dealer. Renewal state appointment fees for any Agent shall be paid by    
such Equitable Life Company if, in the sole discretion of such Equitable Life   
Company, its minimum production and activity requirements for the payment of    
renewal appointment fees have been met by such Agent. Each Equitable Life       
Company shall establish reasonable minimum production and activity              
requirements for the payment of renewal state appointment fees, which may be    
changed by such Equitable Life Company in its sole discretion at any time       
without notice. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Broker-Dealer will be  
obligated to pay all state appointment fees, including, but not limited to,     
renewal appointment fees not paid for by an Equitable Life Company, transfer    
fees and termination fees, and any other fees required to be paid to obtain     
state insurance licenses for Agents.                                            

Section 7.4    Offsets of Compensation Under Other Agreements. With     
respect to commissions, compensation or any other amounts owed by the           
Distributor or any Affiliate of the Distributor to the Broker-Dealer or the     
General Agent under any other agreement, the Distributor shall have a right to  
set off against such amounts any monies payable by the General Agent under      
this Agreement, including Schedule II, to the Distributor, to the extent        
permitted by applicable law. This right on the part of the Distributor shall    
not prevent both of them or either of them from pursuing any other means or     
remedies available to them to recover such monies payable by the General        
Agent.                                                                          

Section 7.5    No Rights of Agents to Compensation Paid by Distributor. 
Agents shall have no interest in this Agreement or right to any commissions to  
be paid by the Distributor to the General Agent. The General Agent shall be     
solely responsible for the payment of any commission or consideration of any    
kind to Agents. The General Agent shall have no interest in any compensation    
paid by an Equitable Life Company to the Distributor, now or hereafter, in      
connection with the sale of any Contracts under this Agreement.

meaning of such terms under the federal securities laws, and any officer,

             f.   any failure on the part of the Broker-Dealer,  the
General Agent, or an Agent to deliver Contracts to purchasers thereof on a      
timely basis in accordance with Section 4.7 and in accordance with the rules    
and procedures of the Equitable Life Companies; or                              

               g.   any other breach by the Broker-Dealer or the General
Agent of any provision of this Agreement, including, without limitation,        
Section 5.1.                                                                    

This indemnification will be in addition to any liability which the             
Broker-Dealer and the General Agent may otherwise have.                         

Section 11.2   Indemnification of Broker-Dealer and General Agent. The  
Distributor shall indemnify and hold harmless the Broker-Dealer and the         
General Agent and each person who controls or is associated with the            
Broker-Dealer or the General Agent within the meaning of such terms under the   
federal securities laws, and any officer, director, employee or agent of the    
foregoing, against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint    
or several (including any investigative, legal and other expenses reasonably    
incurred in connection with, and any amounts paid in settlement of, any         
action, suit or proceeding or any claim asserted), to which they or any of      
them may become subject under any statute or regulation, at common law or       
otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of  
or are based upon a breach by the Distributor of any provision of this          
Agreement. This indemnification will be in addition to any liability which the  
Distributor may otherwise have.

entitled to indemnification ("Indemnified Party") under this Article XI of      
notice of the commencement of any action or threat of such action, if a claim   
in respect thereof is to be made against any person obligated to provide        
indemnification under this Article XI ("Indemnifying Party"), such Indemnified  
Party will notify the Indemnifying Party in                                     

-14   

P-->EX-99.3(B)15th�Page�of�22TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�15th
writing of the commencement thereof as soon as practicable thereafter,          
provided that the omission so to notify the Indemnifying Party will not         
relieve it from any liability under this Article XI, except to the extent that  
the omission results in a failure of actual notice to the Indemnifying Party    
and such Indemnifying Party is damaged solely as a result of the failure to     
give such notice. The Indemnifying Party, upon the request of the Indemnified   
Party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party    
to represent the Indemnified Party and any others the Indemnifying Party may    
designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such   
counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified     
Party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and          
expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Party,     
unless (i) the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall have          
mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to   
any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the          
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and representation of both         
parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential   
differing interests between them. The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable    
for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but  
if such proceeding is settled with such consent or if final judgment is         
entered in such proceeding for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Party shall      
indemnify the Indemnified Party from and against any loss or liability by       
reason of such settlement or judgment.

insist upon strict compliance with any of the conditions of this Agreement      
shall not be construed as a waiver of any of the conditions, but the same       
shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any of the provisions of    
this Agreement shall be deemed, or shall constitute, a waiver of any other      
provisions, whether or not similar, nor shall any waiver constitute a           
continuing waiver.

ARTICLE XIII

Section 13.1   Applicability of Article; Supplemental Definitions. This 
Article XIII applies only if the Broker-Dealer or the General Agent             
distributes Contracts in one or more of the following circumstances             
(collectively referred to as "Bank-Related Sales"): (i) on the premises of a

originating from the premises of a Bank; or (iii) to persons which are          
referred to the Broker-Dealer or General Agent by a Bank. For purposes of this  
Article XIII, the term "Bank Regulatory Requirements" shall include (i) the     
Interagency Statement on Retail Sales of Nondeposit Products (February 15,
1994), published by the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the     
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the FDIC and the U.S. Office  
of Thrift Supervision, as supplemented or amended from time to time, and (ii)   
any federal or state laws, regulations, orders, directives, circulars,          
agreements in writing, memoranda, commitments in writing or other legal or      
supervisory requirements which may be administered, adopted, promulgated,       
enforced or applied with respect to any Bank-Related Sales under this           
Agreement (regardless of whether any such requirement is of general or          
specific applicability) by any federal or state bank or financial institution   
regulatory agency or authority.                                                 

Section 13.2   Written Agreements for Bank-Related Sales. The           
authorization to distribute Contracts which is conferred on the Broker-Dealer   
and the General Agent under Article II shall not include Bank-Related Sales     
unless such activities are conducted under the terms of a written agreement     
with each and any Bank where such Bank-Related Sales will take place which      
complies in all respects with applicable Bank Regulatory Requirements. The      
Broker-Dealer or General Agent shall, upon request of the Distributor, provide  
the Distributor with a copy of each such written agreement. The Broker-Dealer   
and the General

P-->EX-99.3(B)17th�Page�of�22TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�17th
Agent shall have exclusive responsibility for ensuring strict compliance with   
the terms and conditions of any such written agreement.                         

Section 13.3   Compliance with Bank Regulatory Requirements. The        
Broker-Dealer and the General Agent each represent and warrant, on behalf of    
itself and the Agents, that it is in compliance with all Bank Regulatory        
Requirements applicable to third parties engaged in Bank-Related Sales. The     
Broker-Dealer and the General Agent shall have exclusive responsibility for     
ensuring strict compliance with all Bank Regulatory Requirements with respect   
to any Bank-Related Sales under this Agreement. The Broker-Dealer and the       
General Agent each undertake to keep the Distributor promptly informed of any   
amendments, supplements or changes to applicable Bank Regulatory Requirements   
which may affect this Agreement.                                                

  Section 13.4   Production by Distributor of Certain Books and Records. The
Distributor agrees to provide to the Broker-Dealer or the General Agent, upon   
request, any books and records relating to Contracts distributed through        
Bank-Related Sales for purposes of making such records available for            
inspection by any federal or state bank or financial institution regulatory     
agency with jurisdiction over such Bank-Related Sales, or over a Bank through   
which such sales are conducted. The Distributor's agreement under this Section  
13.4 shall not constitute or represent in any respect an admission or           
acknowledgment by Distributor that such federal or state bank or financial      
institution regulatory authority has any jurisdiction over Distributor or the   
activities of the Distributor, and the Distributor expressly disclaims any      
such jurisdiction.                                                              

Section 13.5   Prospectuses and Applications Provided by Distributor;   
Sales Materials. During the term of this Agreement, the Distributor will        
provide the Broker-Dealer and the General Agent, without charge, with as many   
copies of the Contract Prospectus(es), Trust Prospectus and applications for    
the Contracts, containing those disclosures specifically required by any        
applicable Bank Regulatory Requirements with respect to products not insured    
by the FDIC and similar matters, as the Broker-Dealer or the General Agent      
reasonably may request. The Broker-Dealer and the General Agent shall have      
exclusive responsibility for ensuring the use and delivery of such materials,   
and any sales materials described in Article VI, in compliance with applicable  
Bank Regulatory Requirements. The terms of Article VI otherwise shall govern    
the furnishing, use and return of such documents and materials.                 

  Section 13.6   Supplemental Indemnification of Distributor. In addition to
the indemnifications provided to the Distributor under Section 11.1, the        
Broker-Dealer and the General Agent, jointly and severally, shall indemnify     
each person entitled to indemnification under Section 11.1 for any losses,      
claims, damages or liabilities (as described in Section 11.1) arising out of    
or based on violations or failures to comply with any Bank Regulatory           
Requirements. The provisions of Article VI otherwise shall govern the terms     
and procedures with respect to any indemnifications provided under this         
Section 13.6.                                                                   

 Section 13.7   Construction With Other Provisions. The provisions of this
Article XIII are in addition to the other terms and conditions of this          
Agreement. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of this     
Article XIII and any other term or condition of this Agreement, the             
requirements of this Article XIII and not such other term or condition, shall   
govern.

EXHIBIT B 

Special Procedures for Initial Premium Transmittal  

As indicated in Section 4.5, an initial Premium which is not  
accompanied by a properly completed application for a Contract may be accepted  
by an Equitable Life Company if the Broker-Dealer and the General Agent have    
accepted, agreed to and complied with the procedures set forth in this Exhibit  
B.                                                                              

Wire Transmittal and Electronic Data Transmission                               
of Application Information                                                      

     1.   The Broker-Dealer will cause the initial Premium to be paid to
the appropriate Equitable Life Company by wire transfer.                        

2.   The wire transfer will be accompanied by an electronic   
transmission of application information in a form prescribed by the Equitable   
Life Companies.                                                                 

  3.   The proposed Contract issuance will not occur in any of the
following states: Kentucky, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania.             

 4.   The proposed Contract issuance will not involve any of the
following:                                                                      

a.   A contract replacement.                        

          b.   A contract exchange within the meaning of Section 1035 of
the Internal Revenue Code.                                                      

         c.   The funding of benefits under a tax-qualified retirement

       5.   The Broker-Dealer and the General Agent will advise the proposed
owner of the Contract that, unless a transaction has been requested in writing  
by the owner and the signature of the owner has been guaranteed, no financial   
transactions with respect to the Contract shall be executed until a signed      
acknowledgment form has been received by the appropriate Equitable Life         
Company.                                                                        

      6.   Any cost associated with the correction of an error made in the
investment of an initial Premium shall be borne by the Broker-Dealer, unless    
such error results directly from any improper action of an Equitable Life       
Company.                                                                        

    7.   If the owner of the Contract requests a return of the initial
Premium after the Premium has been invested and the Contract issued, the        
provisions of subparagraph a.ii. of Schedule II shall apply.                    

Wire Transmittal and Submission of Application

telephone facsimile transmission of application information in a form           
prescribed by the Equitable Life Companies.                                     

      3.   Any cost associated with the correction of an error made in the
investment of an initial Premium shall be borne by the Broker-Dealer, unless

Company.                                                                        

      4.   If no properly completed application for a Contract is received
by an Equitable Life Company within the period of time specified by it, and     
the initial Premium is therefore returned to the proposed owner of the          
Contract, the provisions of subparagraph a.ii. of Schedule II shall apply.      

     The procedures set forth in this Exhibit B, as further described in
the Contract Prospectus and as modified from time to time, are hereby accepted

  This Supplement updates certain information in the most recent prospectuses and
statements of additional information dated May 1, 2014 (collectively the Prospectus) you received. You should read this Supplement in conjunction with the Prospectus and retain it for future reference. Unless otherwise indicated, all
other information included in the Prospectus remains unchanged and the Prospectus is hereby incorporated by reference. The terms and section headings we use in this Supplement have the same meaning as in the Prospectus. We will send you another copy
of any prospectus or supplement without charge upon request. Please contact the customer service group referenced in the Prospectus.   
This Supplement describes a new lump sum payment option (Guaranteed Benefit Lump Sum Payment), which is currently available under limited
circumstances, as an alternative to receiving periodic cash payments over your lifetime under the Guaranteed minimum income benefit option. Please be advised that electing the Guaranteed Benefit Lump Sum Payment is completely voluntary and
you are not required take any action at this time under your contract.   


1.
The following is added after the last paragraph under Guaranteed benefit offers in Contract features and benefits: 
  Guaranteed Benefit Lump Sum Payment Option 
  The Guaranteed Benefit Lump Sum Payment option is currently available under limited
circumstances. It is available to you if you elected a Guaranteed minimum income benefit (GMIB), and the no-lapse guarantee is in effect and your account value falls to zero, either due to a withdrawal that is not an Excess withdrawal or
due to a deduction of charges.    We reserve the right to terminate the
availability of this option at any time. This option is not available under Rollover TSA contracts.    If your account value falls to zero, as described above, we will send you a letter which will describe the options available to you, including the Guaranteed Benefit Lump Sum Payment option to make your election.
In addition, the letter will include the following information:   


 
1.
The Guaranteed Benefit Lump Sum offer is optional;   


 
2.
If no action is taken, you will receive the stream of payments as promised under your contract;   


 
3.
The amount and frequency of the stream of payments;   


 
4.
The amount you would receive if you elect the Guaranteed Benefit Lump Sum offer; 
 


 
5.
That the amount of the Guaranteed Benefit Lump Sum offer is less than the present value of the stream of payments; 
 


 
6.
A description of the factors you should consider before accepting the Guaranteed Benefit Lump Sum offer; and 
 


 
7.
The reason we are making the Guaranteed Benefit Lump Sum offer.   
You will have no less than 30 days from the day your account value falls to zero to elect an option. If you elect the Guaranteed Benefit Lump Sum Payment option,
you will receive the lump sum amount in a single payment.    If you elect the
Guaranteed Benefit Lump Sum Payment, your contract and optional benefits will terminate. If you do not make an election, we will automatically exercise your GMIB by issuing a supplementary annuity contract using the default option described in your
contract.    We will determine the Guaranteed Benefit Lump Sum Payment amount
as of the day your account value fell to zero. The amount of a Guaranteed Benefit Lump Sum Payment will vary based on the factors described below.   
We first determine the contract reserves attributable to your contract using standard actuarial calculations, which is a conservative measurement of present value.
In general, the contract reserve is the present value of future benefit payments. In determining your contract reserve, we take into account the following factors: 
 


 

 
 The owner/annuitants life expectancy (based on gender and age); 
 


 

 
 The current annual payment for the GMIB in the form of a single life annuity, adjusted for any outstanding withdrawal charge; and 
 


 

 
 The interest rate at the time your account value fell to zero.

The Guaranteed Benefit Lump Sum Payment is calculated based on a percentage of the computed contract reserve. We
will use the percentage that is in effect at the time of your election. The percentage will range from 50% to 90% of the contract reserve. If your account value falls to zero, as described above, we will notify you then of the current percentage
when we send you the letter describing the options available to you. Your payment will be reduced, as applicable, by any annual payments made under a Customized payment plan or Maximum payment plan since your account value fell to zero. For
information on how the Guaranteed Benefit Lump Sum Payment option works under certain hypothetical circumstances, please see Appendix A.   
In the event your account falls to zero, as described above, you should evaluate this payment option carefully. If you elect the Guaranteed Benefit Lump Sum
Payment option, you would no longer have the ability to receive periodic cash payments over your lifetime under the GMIB. When you purchased your contract you made a determination that the income stream available under the GMIB was important to
you based on your personal circumstances. When considering this payment option, you should consider whether you still need the benefits of an ongoing income stream, given your personal and financial circumstances. 
  In addition, you should consider the following factors: 
 


 

 
 Whether, given your state of health, you believe you are likely to live to enjoy the future income benefits provided by the GMIB; and
  


 

 
 Whether a lump sum payment is more important to you than a future stream of payments.    In considering the factors above, and any other factors you believe are relevant, you may wish to consult with your financial
professional or other advisor.    We believe that offering this payment
option could be mutually beneficial to both us and to contract owners whose financial circumstances may have changed since they purchased the contract. If you elect the Guaranteed Benefit Lump Sum Payment option, you would benefit since you would
immediately receive a lump sum payment rather than a stream of future payments over your lifetime. We would gain a financial benefit because we anticipate that providing a lump sum payment to you will be less costly to us than paying you periodic
cash payments during your lifetime.    If you elect the Guaranteed Benefit
Lump Sum Payment option it will be treated as a surrender of the contract and may be taxable. For information on tax consequences, please see the section entitled Tax information in the Prospectus. 
  This payment option may not be available in all states. We may, in the future, suspend
or terminate this payment option, or offer this payment option on more or less favorable terms upon advance notice to you.

This Supplement describes a new lump sum payment option (Guaranteed Benefit Lump Sum Payment), which is currently available under limited
circumstances, as an alternative to receiving periodic cash payments over your lifetime under the Guaranteed minimum income benefit option or taking certain guaranteed withdrawals and keeping a guaranteed death benefit under the Guaranteed
withdrawal benefit for life option. Please be advised that electing the Guaranteed Benefit Lump Sum Payment is completely voluntary and you are not required take any action at this time under your contract.

that is not an Excess withdrawal or due to a deduction of charges;    or   


 
(2)
If you elected a Guaranteed withdrawal benefit for life (GWBL) or elected a GMIB that converted to a GWBL, and your account value falls to zero, either due to a
withdrawal or surrender that is not an Excess withdrawal or due to a deduction of charges.    We reserve the right to terminate the availability of this option at any time. This option is not available under Rollover TSA contracts. 
  If your account value falls to zero, as described above, we will send you a letter

         (b)    Indemnification of Principal Underwriters

                 To the extent permitted by law of the State of New York and
subject to all applicable requirements thereof, AXA Distributors, LLC and AXA
Advisors, LLC have undertaken to indemnify each of its respective directors and
officers who is made or threatened to be made a party to any action or
proceeding, whether civil or criminal, by reason of the fact the director or
officer, or his or her testator or intestate, is or was a director or officer
of AXA Distributors, LLC and AXA Advisors, LLC.

         (c)    Undertaking

                 Insofar as indemnification for liability arising under the
Securities Act of 1933 ("Act") may be permitted to directors, officers and
controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or
otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the
Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public
policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event
that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the
payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer
or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any
action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or
controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the
registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been
settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction
the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as
expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such
issue.

Variable Annuities

The opportunity for market appreciation with tax-deferral






























Variable annuities provide the opportunity for market appreciation — through a variety of investment options — with tax-deferral and future income. Variable annuities are designed for people willing to take on more risk in exchange for greater growth potential. While there is risk associated with a variable annuity, many offer guarantees of principal and downside protection at an additional cost and depending on contract rider availability. However, these guarantees do not apply to the investment performance or amounts held in the variable investment options.













Investment Edge®
Defers current taxes when trying to accumulate wealth and provides tax-efficient distributions, adding powerful tax advantages to a diversified portfolio.


BENEFITSDiversificationTax-efficient Tax deferralDeath Benefit





Retirement Cornerstone®
A single tax-deferred platform comprised of two separate accounts with distinct features that help address different goals - offering the ability to not only accumulate, but also protect retirement income.


BENEFITSInvestment opportunityGuaranteed incomeDeath benefit guarantees





Structured Capital Strategies®
Several investment options, some of which allow participation in the upside potential of indices, up to a cap, that track certain domestic, international and commodities markets, and which have a built-in partial protection feature.
 


BENEFITSUpside potential up to a capPartial protectionTax deferral





The Accumulator® Series
A long-term retirement product that allows the ability to invest for growth potential on a tax-deferred basis. Also provides for guaranteed benefits through optional riders available for an additional fee.


BENEFITSInvestment Lifetime incomeDeath benefit






















Important Note AXA believes that education is a key step toward addressing your financial goals, and we've designed this material to serve simply as an informational and educational resource.  Accordingly, the information on this website does not offer or constitute investment advice and makes no direct or indirect recommendation of any particular product or of the appropriateness of any particular investment-related option.  Your needs, goals and circumstances are unique, and they require the individualized attention of your financial professional.
Annuities are long-term financial products designed for retirement purposes. In essence, annuities are contractual agreements in which payment(s) are made to an insurance company, which agrees to pay out an income or a lump sum amount at a later date. There are contract limitations and fees and charges associated with annuities, administrative fees, and charges for optional benefits. A financial professional can provide cost information and complete details. Variable annuities are subject to fluctuation in value and market risk, including loss of principal.
Withdrawals from annuities are subject to normal income tax treatment and if taken prior to age 59½, may be subject to an additional 10% federal income tax penalty. Withdrawals may also be subject to a contractual withdrawal charge.
Please consider the charges, risk, expenses, and investment objectives carefully before purchasing a variable annuity. For a prospectus containing this and other information, please contact a financial professional. Read it carefully before you invest or send money.
Guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company (NY,NY).
Variable annuities are issued by AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company (NY, NY) and co-distributed by affiliates AXA Distributors, LLC and AXA Advisors, LLC (members FINRA, SIPC).GE-92925 (10/2016)

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield Level Selector annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Life Insurance




There’s more to life insurance than taking care of loved ones if you pass away. 

Life insurance can also be an essential part of a financial plan. In addition to helping to protect loved ones financially with a death benefit, some products can grow money on a tax-advantaged basis that can be used during one’s lifetime. The ability to meet more than one need makes life insurance a product that adds valuable flexibility to any portfolio.

Talk to your financial professional if you think life insurance might be right for you.















                                Our easy-to-use tool can help guide you to start the conversation around life insurance with your financial professional. 
 

















Types of Life Insurance





Permanent Life Insurance
Provides coverage that lasts a lifetime and can build cash value that can be used while living. 



Term Life Insurance
Provides coverage for a specific length of time and provides the most payout for the money, but does not build cash value.

















Permanent Life Insurance
Permanent life insurance is designed to provide coverage for life. Many permanent life insurance products also have a feature called cash value. This cash value can grow over time through interest credits, market returns, or dividends, providing money that can be used for a variety of needs.  

Permanent life insurance products include: Universal Life, Indexed Universal Life, Whole Life, and Variable Universal Life.







Premier Accumulator Universal Life
Can grow cash value quickly and allows faster access to your money when you need it.

.


















Term Life Insurance
Term life insurance covers you for a fixed number of years, such as 1, 5, 10, 20, or 30 and pays a death benefit if you pass away during the covered time period. Most term insurance policies offer a level premium, death benefit, and the ability to convert to a permanent policy if your needs change. You can also choose coverage for current needs and add optional riders for future needs.







Guaranteed Level Term
Available in coverage amounts of $1 million or more, with premiums guaranteed to stay the same throughout the level premium period.

Finding the best life insurance company typically involves weighing customer service, financial strength and price. Hundreds of life insurance companies are competing for your business, often selling very similar products.
The other element of your buying decision will be price. It’s smart to get life insurance quotes from at least a few companies.
Our calculations show that Northwestern Mutual is the best life insurance company among those we scored, and many others also are worthy of consideration. (Full methodology below.)

How to choose the best life insurance company for you
Look at customer satisfaction scores: Other customers’ experience can help you decide whether you want to do business with a company. You can get clues about a company’s reputation through:

Customer satisfaction scores from J.D. Power. The independent ratings firm publishes scores for nearly two dozen of the largest life insurers each year. 
Complaints filed against the company with state regulators.

Consider financial strength: Financial strength is especially important for life insurance companies because you’ll want a company that can pay claims many years down the road. Financial strength ratings are available through ratings agencies such as A.M. Best and Standard & Poor’s. We don’t recommend considering insurers with an A.M. Best rating of B or lower. 
Get prices: The cost of coverage varies among companies. It’s smart to get prices from at least a few insurance companies.
» COMPARE: Term life insurance quotes
Evaluate product selection: Although many companies sell similar policies, some focus more on certain products, such as whole life insurance, or on certain customers, such as seniors. Knowing generally the type of life insurance you want to buy will help you narrow the choices. You can learn more about the product offerings of each life insurance company below by clicking on the NerdWallet reviews.


Methodology 


How we came up with our rankings: We started with a list of the largest life insurance companies and then calculated a total score based on three measurements, each with equal weight within the score. We then adjusted scores to a 300-point scale:

Customer satisfaction scores from J.D. Power, worth up to 100 points.
Complaint ratios from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners for 2015, which measure complaints to state regulators adjusted for market share. We adjusted the complaint ratios to a 5-star scale, with companies getting the median number of complaints for their size earning 3 stars.
Financial strength ratings from A.M. Best, which indicate a company’s ability to pay future claims, worth up to 100 points. All of the companies shown have solid financial strength. A.M. Best defines the ratings shown above as:


A++ and A+ = superior.
A = excellent.

The Differences Between Term and Whole Life Insurance

Insurance, Life Insurance





  


Term vs. whole life insurance

Term life insurance is easier to understand and costs much less than whole life insurance, but it has an end date. A 30-year policy is typically the longest term available, depending on your age. 
Whole life insurance will last the rest of your life, so your beneficiaries are guaranteed a payout no matter when you die.

Whole life insurance also builds up “cash value,” which is money you can access while you’re alive. Term life has no cash value.




Buying life insurance now provides a financial safety net for your dependents later if you’re not around to take care of them. After you’re gone, your family can use the proceeds to cover funeral costs, mortgage payments, college tuition and other expenses.

There are two main types of life insurance: 
Term life insurance is the easiest to understand and has the lowest prices.
Permanent insurance is more complex and tends to cost more than term, but it offers additional benefits. Whole life is the most well-known and simplest form of permanent life insurance. Other kinds of permanent life insurance include universal, variable and variable universal.













Let’s take a closer look at term life versus whole life insurance.

Choosing between term life and whole life
Term life insurance explained
Term life insurance provides coverage for a certain time period. It’s often called “pure life insurance” because it’s designed only to protect your dependents in case you die prematurely. If you have a term policy and die within the term, your beneficiaries receive the payout. The policy has no other value.
You choose the term when you buy the policy. Common terms are 10, 20 or 30 years. With most policies, the payout, called the death benefit, and the cost, or premium, stay the same throughout the term.
» COMPARE: NerdWallet’s life insurance comparison tool
When you shop for term life:

Choose a term that coincides with the years you’ll be paying the bills and want life insurance coverage in case you die early.
Buy an amount your family would need if you were no longer there to provide for them. The payout could replace your income and help your family pay for services you perform now, such as child care.

Ideally, your family’s need for life insurance will end around the time the term expires: Your kids will be on their own, you’ll have paid off your house, and you’ll have plenty of money in savings to serve as a financial safety net.
All of the best life insurance companies sell term life, so it’s easy to find rates.

Whole life insurance explained
Like all permanent life insurance policies, whole life provides lifelong coverage and includes an investment component known as the policy’s cash value. The cash value grows slowly, tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes on its gains while they’re accumulating. 
You can borrow money against the account or surrender the policy for the cash. But if you don’t repay policy loans with interest, you’ll reduce your death benefit, and if you surrender the policy, you’ll no longer have coverage.
Although it’s more complicated than term life insurance, whole life is the most straightforward form of permanent life insurance. Here’s why:

The premium remains the same for as long as you live
The death benefit is guaranteed
The cash value account grows at a guaranteed rate

Some whole life policies can also earn annual dividends, a portion of the insurer’s financial surplus. You can take the dividends in cash, leave them on deposit to earn interest or use them to decrease your premium, repay policy loans or buy additional coverage. Dividends are not guaranteed.

Cost comparison
Term life insurance is cheap because it’s temporary and has no cash value; in most cases, your family won’t receive a payout because you’ll live to the end of the term. Whole life insurance premiums are much higher because the coverage lasts for a lifetime, and the policy has cash value, with a guaranteed rate of investment return on a portion of the money that you pay.
Below are price comparisons between term life and whole life insurance. We used 20-year and 30-year term life policies because no apples-to-apples comparison is possible for the length of term life to whole life.

Choosing between term and whole life insurance
Term life is sufficient for most families who need life insurance, but whole life and other forms of permanent coverage can be useful in certain situations.




Choose term life if:Choose whole life if:




 You need life insurance only to replace your income over a certain period, such as the years you’re raising children or paying off your mortgage
You want the most affordable coverage
You think you might want permanent life insurance but can’t afford it. Most term life policies are convertible to permanent coverage. The deadline for conversion varies by policy.You want to provide money for your heirs to pay estate taxes. In 2017, estates worth more than $5.49 million per individual and $10.98 million per couple are subject to federal estate taxes. State estate taxes vary. Here’s a map of state estate and inheritance taxes from the Tax Foundation.
Without a life insurance payout, your heirs might be forced to sell off parts of the estate, such as heirlooms or property, to pay the tax bill.
You have a lifelong dependent, such as a child with special needs. Life insurance can fund a special needs trust to provide care for your child after you’re gone. Consult with an attorney and financial advisor if you want to set up a trust.
You want to spend your retirement savings and still leave an inheritance or money for final expenses, such as funeral costs. With a whole life policy, your beneficiaries get a payout no matter when you die.
You want to equalize inheritances. If you plan to leave a business or other property to one child, you could use whole life insurance to compensate your other children.

Types of Life Insurance

Insurance, Life Insurance





  

What type of life insurance is best for you? That depends on a variety of factors, including how long you want the policy to last, how much you want your life insurance rates to be, and whether you want to be able to withdraw money from the policy later.
Term life insurance is suitable for most people. Permanent life insurance policies (such as whole life and universal life) usually contain a “cash value” account, which builds value over time. Eventually you may have enough cash value to take a loan against it to use for large expenses, such as college. Because permanent policies can be complex and expensive, it’s best to have a financial advisor guide you through the options and costs.













Here’s a deeper overview of types of life insurance:

Term
Whole
Universal



Term life insurance

Pros: It’s easy to understand and is the cheapest way to buy life insurance.
Cons: You could outlive your policy. If you still need coverage, you’d need to buy another policy and will pay more based on your age and, possibly, health.

You only have to make two decisions if you buy term life insurance: what amount you want, and how long you want the coverage to last. “Small” term life policies are available with under $50,000 in coverage, but policy amounts can go into the millions. Term life is typically sold in lengths of five, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 years. “Level premium” term life means you’re locking in a price for the length of the policy. Typically you will pay a monthly or annual premium to keep the insurance in force. “Annual renewable” term life is a one-year policy that renews every year for a higher price.

Whole life insurance (sometimes called ordinary life insurance)

Pros: It covers you for your entire life. Everything in the policy is guaranteed, so there are no surprises.
Cons: It’s a very expensive way to buy life insurance.

Whole life insurance is a form of permanent life insurance, meaning it doesn’t expire. It’s the closest thing to “set it and forget it” life insurance. As long as you pay the bill, you don’t have to think much about the policy. Your payments stay the same, you get a guaranteed rate of return on the “cash value” investment component of the policy, and the death benefit amount doesn’t change.


Universal life insurance
Guaranteed
Indexed
Variable
Guaranteed universal life insurance (GUL)

Pros: It’s cheaper than whole life and other forms of universal life insurance. You can choose the age to which you want the death benefit guaranteed, such as 95 or 100.
Cons: Every payment must be made on time or you could lose the guarantee and forfeit the policy, thereby losing all your previous payments. The policy may have little or no cash value.

Guaranteed universal life insurance offers insurance at a cheaper price than other permanent life insurance products. The policies promise a certain death benefit and payments that don’t change. There’s typically little or no cash value within the policy, and insurers demand on-time payments. Missing a payment could mean you forfeit the policy. And since there’s no cash value in the policy, you’d walk away with nothing if you forfeit. If you are sometimes late with bills, this is not the product for you. In addition, consider that future financial or health problems could cause you to miss a payment.
Indexed universal life insurance (IUL)

Pros: You can access cash value, which grows over time. The cash value is linked to a stock market index, so if the stock market goes up, you get some upside, too. Within limits, your payments and death benefit amount are flexible.
Cons: Your cash value doesn’t take full advantage of stock market gains. You should understand the policy’s fees, participation rates and the ceiling on your return (called a cap) before you buy.

Indexed universal life insurance links the cash value component of the policy to a stock market index like the S&P 500. Your gains are determined by a formula, which is outlined in the policy. The policy will dictate how much your cash value “participates” in any gains. For example, if your participation rate is 80% and the S&P 500 goes up 10%, you get an 8% return. Fortunately, if the index goes down, you won’t lose cash value; you’ll just get zero rate of return. Some policies offer a small guaranteed interest rate in case the market goes down.
Your gains in cash value will also be limited by your “cap,” which is the maximum you’ll get no matter how high the market goes. For example, a cap might be 10%. If the index goes up 20%, and your cap is 10%, you still get only 10%. And remember, only a portion of your payments are going into the cash value to begin with.
There are additional moving parts to keep track of, such as your payments and death benefit. Within limits you can decrease your premiums or skip a payment, as long as your cash value covers the insurance costs. You need to keep track of this. If you’re skipping payments and you don’t have enough cash value to cover costs, your policy could lapse. Some policies allow you to adjust your death benefit, too, as your family’s needs change.
Variable universal life insurance (VUL) and variable life insurance (VL)

Pros: There’s a chance for a large potential gain in cash value if your investment choices do well. A policy owner can take partial withdrawals from cash value or loans against it.
Cons: It requires you to be hands-on in managing your policy. The cash value changes every day based on the market. Lots of fees and administrative charges are deducted from your payment before anything goes to cash value.

With variable universal life and variable life insurance, you tie your cash value to investment accounts, such as bonds or money market and equity accounts. There can be high risk to the investment account value based on the market, but if you do have cash value, you can take partial withdrawals or loans against it. You can also vary your premium payments, within certain minimums and maximums, and vary the death benefit. The “policy illustrations” shown to potential customers can be complex and optimistic, but if you’re considering a policy like this, a fee-only financial advisor (who doesn’t earn commissions based on policy sales) can help you sort it out.

Types of underwriting for life insurance policies
You may hear some other words that sound like additional types of life insurance, but they’re really about how the policy is “underwritten,” meaning how the life insurance companies will determine how much of a “risk” you are.

Fully underwritten life insurance: A life insurance medical exam is often required. The application will also generally include many questions about your health, your family’s health history, your lifestyle (such as hobbies like skydiving), and your plans for travel outside the United States. This “full underwriting” allows the insurance company to most accurately price the policy based on your life expectancy. If you are healthy — or even if you have a couple health issues — this will generally be the cheapest way to buy life insurance.
Simplified issue life insurance: No life insurance medical exam is required, but you will be asked a few health questions and you could be turned down based on your answers.
Guaranteed issue life insurance: There’s no medical exam and no questions asked. You can’t be turned down. This is the most expensive way to buy life insurance, and you might find only low coverage amounts available, such as $50,000 or $100,000. In addition, if you die within the first few years of having the policy, your beneficiaries may receive only a partial death benefit or a check for the premiums you paid. People often buy these policies when they’ve been turned down elsewhere but they want to cover final expenses, such as funeral costs.

There are also types of life insurance meant for specific situations:
Mortgage life insurance: Covers specifically the current balance of your mortgage and pays out to the lender, not your family, if you die.
Credit life insurance: Covers only the balance of a specific loan, like a home equity loan. Your bank might offer to sell you a credit life insurance policy when you take out a loan. If you die it pays off the lender, not your family.
Accidental death and dismemberment (AD&D): Pays a death benefit only if you die accidentally, such as in a car crash. Accidental death and dismemberment policies also offer insurance payouts for loss of limbs, sight and hearing, and other problems.
Joint life insurance: This type of permanent life insurance insures two lives (usually spouses) under one policy and comes in two forms:

First-to-die: Pays out upon the death of the first person, whichever one it is. The surviving spouse would typically be the beneficiary. The policy would then expire; it doesn’t continue to cover the second person.
Second-to-die: Pays out when both people have died. A policy like this is typically used when heirs (such as children) will need money to pay estate or inheritance taxes, so that they don’t have to sell off assets.

What Is Guaranteed Acceptance Life Insurance?


                Guaranteed acceptance life insurance can help your loved ones pay for your final expenses, such as funeral and burial costs, medical bills, or other consumer debts. These policies can also build cash value you can use later in life.
            

                A MassMutual Guaranteed Acceptance Life Insurance policy is an affordable way to help protect your loved ones’ future—and help provide peace of mind today. Premiums can start at less than $10 per month, and your coverage is guaranteed throughout the life of the policy, provided the required premiums are paid. You can rest assured that your benefits will never decrease, and your premiums will never increase during the life of the policy. The policy provides a limited benefit in the first two policy years.
            

                If you are between the ages of 50 and 75, you cannot be denied for health reasons. You won’t be required to take a medical exam, or answer any health questions. Our quick approval process ensures that you get the coverage you need, when you need it.
            









Why MassMutual?

                Since 1851, we’ve been dedicated to helping people secure their financial future and protect the ones they love.
            

                MassMutual Guaranteed Acceptance Life Insurance will help secure your family’s financial future. A policy provides guaranteed lifelong coverage with no medical exam or health questions.

Frequently Asked Questions


Do I need MassMutual Guaranteed Acceptance Life Insurance?

                        If someone relies on your financial support, Guaranteed Acceptance Life insurance may be helpful.
                        This policy is designed to help your loved ones pay for your final expenses, such as funeral and burial costs, medical bills, or other consumer debts.
                    


Do I qualify?
If you are between the ages of 50 and 75, you cannot be denied coverage for health reasons. You won’t be required to take a medical exam or answer any health questions.


Will my insurance coverage decrease?

                        No—your coverage amount is guaranteed, and will never decrease for the life of your policy.
                        As long as you pay the premiums, MassMutual will not cancel your policy.
                        You should know, however, that if you have taken a loan on your policy, it will decrease your cash value and death benefit until it’s paid back. If it’s not paid back before you die, the death benefit paid to your beneficiaries will be reduced by any outstanding loan amounts.
                    


How can I use a Guaranteed Acceptance Life Insurance policy?

                        The funds are for your beneficiaries to use as they see fit.
                        For example, they may use the proceeds of a Guaranteed Acceptance Life Insurance policy to pay for expenses such as funeral and burial costs, medical bills, or other consumer debts.
                        Plus, the policy builds cash value that you can use for a loan or cash withdrawal if you need it later in life.
                    


 Will my premiums increase?
Your premiums are guaranteed to remain level and will not increase for the life of your policy.


How can I use my policy’s cash value?

                        The decision to purchase life insurance should be based on long-term financial goals and the need for a death benefit.
                        Life insurance is not an appropriate vehicle for short-term savings or short-term investment strategies.
                        While the policy allows for loans, you should know that there may be little to no cash value available for loans in the policy's early years.
                        Access to cash values through borrowing will reduce the policy's cash value and death benefit, increase the chance the policy will lapse, and may result in a tax liability if the policy terminates before the death of the insured.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
