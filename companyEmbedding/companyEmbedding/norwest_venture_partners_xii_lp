The more engaging they can be w/ audiences, the better —@seancaptain #MediaTalkTech  What Entrepreneurs Are Saying Promod Haque and Norwest Venture Partners provided exceptional support during a fairly long product gestation and initial market fit exercise during the early period of FireEye’s business evolution. They showed fortitude as an investor and believed in the eventual opportunity to defend the world from advanced cyber attacks even when there were insufficient market proof points. I am grateful for their support in helping build FireEye into the global company it is today. Ashar Aziz, Founder, Vice Chairman of the Board, and Chief Strategy Officer - FireEye Norwest’s ability to invest against the grain in an enterprise mobility company like MobileIron speaks to the firm’s belief in its entrepreneurs and backing companies in new markets that aren’t yet obvious. MobileIron is a great example of how Norwest partners with companies to build great businesses. Bob Tinker, President & CEO - MobileIron As we built out our sales force across the United States and grew our sales over 3000% from commercialization to IPO, Norwest’s financing and guidance was critical to our success. Their partnership was and remains key during our rapid commercial growth and scaling. We would not be where we are today without them. Lisa Earnhardt, President and CEO - Intersect ENT Norwest has been championing our team since before day one. Along with Alagu, I was an Entrepreneur- in-Residence with Norwest. I know firsthand how the firm supports companies from idea to incubation to launch to growth and beyond. Matt Howard has been a tremendous part of this path for us at Blue Jeans and is available to us 24×7. Matt has brokered strategic relationships, including those that have led directly to revenue.

Headquartered in Silicon Valley and SF, we have subsidiaries in Israel and India. Israel India What Entrepreneurs Are Saying Promod Haque and Norwest provided exceptional support during a fairly long product gestation and initial market fit exercise during the early period of FireEye’s business evolution. They showed fortitude as an investor and believed in the eventual opportunity to defend the world from advanced cyber attacks even when there were insufficient market proof points. I am grateful for their support in helping build FireEye into the global company it is today. Ashar Aziz, Founder, Vice Chairman of the Board, and Chief Strategy Officer - FireEye Norwest’s ability to invest against the grain in an enterprise mobility company like MobileIron speaks to the firm’s belief in its entrepreneurs and backing companies in new markets that aren’t yet obvious. MobileIron is a great example of how Norwest partners with companies to build great businesses. Bob Tinker, President & CEO - MobileIron As we built out our sales force across the United States and grew our sales over 3000% from commercialization to IPO, Norwest’s financing and guidance was critical to our success. Their partnership was and remains key during our rapid commercial growth and scaling. We would not be where we are today without them.

NGF raises another $1.3 million, giving the fledgling firm a total of $2.5 million of capital. NGF invests $500,000 in an ice cream company: International Dairy Queen (IDQ). IDQ became a successful publicly-traded company that would eventually allow NGF to sell its stake for an estimated $3.5 million NGF makes an early investment in National Computer Systems, an optical reader company that is now a staple in virtually all standardized tests. Cray Research, a pioneer in supercomputing, is added to the NGF portfolio. NGF helps start Network Systems Corp., a company that pioneered the development of high speed data transmission products that would be the backbone of the first high speed computer networks. NGF raises its second fund, Northwest Venture Partners, a $60 million offering that included a $10 million contribution from Northwest Bancorporation. The firm transitions to the name Norwest Venture Capital (NVC). With the technology sector suffering from a downturn in the mid-1980s, NVC turns to opportunities in the consumer sector with investments in athletic footwear company Avia and children’s clothing company Gymboree. NVC’s East Coast presence takes shape with investments in Bright Horizons, GelTex Pharmaceuticals, Raptor Systems and VideoServer. George Still joins the firm and works out of its Bellevue, Washington office. Promod Haque also joins NVC as a consultant in the firm’s Minneapolis office to assist with due diligence on technology investments. NVC later hires Haque on a full-time basis in 1990.  The firm launches Norwest Equity Partners IV, LP,  a $200 million fund. NVC is instrumental in the development and consolidation of the emerging specialized mobile radio (SMR) communications business through investments in Atlantic Cellular, OneComm, and Transit Communications. PeopleSoft, one of the world’s first client server software companies, goes public. George Still led the firm’s investment in PeopleSoft in 1989, and Norwest was the sole venture investor. The investment helped drive the firm’s software strategy for years to come. George Still opens Norwest’s Silicon Valley office – on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, CA. Norwest continues its successful software streak, with investments in, and later exits from, Documentum, Vantive, and Xylan Coporation. Norwest completes a leveraged buyout of Transaction Systems Architects (TSA).  TSA goes public in 1995; Norwest would eventually realize $132 million on an investment of $8.6 million, a multiple of 15.4. The firm launches Norwest Equity Partners V, LP, a $300 Million fund. Promod Haque made his mark on such investments as Tivoli Systems (which went public in 1995 and was acquired by IBM in 1996) and Forte Software ( which went public in 1996 and was acquired by Sun Microsystems in 1999), generating returns of 32.0 and 23.0 times the firm’s initial investment, respectively. George Still and Norwest associate, Darin Brannan, develop the initial business plan for Verio, which was incubated in the firm’s West Coast office in 1996. At the time of Verio’s IPO in May 1998 at a $1.2 billion valuation, Verio had acquired 46 ISPs and was ultimately sold in 1999 to NTT DoComo for $5.5 billion cash. Promod Haque leads a seminal investment in Extreme Networks. Extreme was exceptionally successful, and with the help of a white-hot IPO market, delivered returns to NVC of more than $700 million, representing a multiple of 95.0 times its initial investment. The convergence of voice and data puts telecommunications at center stage with key NVC investments and exits. Brooks Fiber Properties goes public in 1996, and is acquired by MCI WorldCom in 1998 for $3.4 billion. Polycom results in a successful IPO in 1996. Brocade goes public in May of 1999, creating more than $313.5 million in returns for Norwest, a multiple of 46.0 times its original investment. Norwest moves its headquarters to downtown Palo Alto, CA – where it remains today. Norwest Venture Capital becomes Norwest Venture Partners (NVP), with George Still as Managing General Partner, launching Norwest Venture Partners VI (NVP VI), a $300 million fund. Norwest raises a brand new $325 million fund just one year later—Norwest Venture Partners VII (NVP VII), after a series of significant venture exits. Promod Haque transitions into a Managing General Partner role and joins Managing General Partner George Still in leading and expanding the firm. Norwest backs Michael Hatfield, co-founder and early CEO of Cerent, investing $11.8 million. Just 16 months later, Cisco Systems acquires Cerent for $7.2 billion. Cerent delivers returns of nearly $1.5 billion to Norwest, representing a multiple of 125.0 times the firm’s initial investment. Norwest invests $3.5 million in Siara Systems. Kleiner Perkins and Norwest later agree to merge Siara Systems with Redback Networks, a $4.3 billion transaction that in 1999 created one of the most powerful suppliers in the communications industry. Norwest’s investment in Siara Systems resulted in a 104 times return for the firm. Norwest makes a $7.2 million investment in Broadband Access Systems, a provider of highly integrated switching, broadband access and telephony systems for cable companies and carriers. A year later, ADC Telecommunications acquires Broadband Access Systems for $2.2 billion. Norwest raises an additional $300 million fund, Norwest Venture Partners VIII (NVP VIII), just two years after its previous fund had launched. Virtela, a virtual private network company, is funded and co-founded by General Partner Vab Goel. Norwest’s investment in Quantum Effect Devices (QED), an embedded microprocessor company, results in a successful IPO. Norwest eventually realizes $122 million on its investment of $5.2 million in QED, a multiple of 23.5. Israel-based Accord Networks, a voice and video company, goes public and is later sold to Polycom for $339 million. Norwest’s consistent returns over the previous decade helped the firm launch its largest fund to date in 2001—Norwest Venture Partners IX (NVP IX), a $411 million fund. SaaS emerges as a formidable infrastructure sector with Norwest’s investments in Cast Iron Systems and AmberPoint. Both companies would ultimately be acquired by tech giants IBM and Oracle, respectively. Norwest’s Matt Howard makes a significant investment in a wireless local area networking (“WLAN”) systems pioneer called Airespace. Winphoria Networks, a mobile data networking company, is sold to Motorola for $179 million. Norwest’s Vab Goel incubates Austin-based KMV Technologies, which would later be called LifeSize Communications, a pioneer in videoconferencing technology. Norwest portfolio company Spinnaker Networks, the Pittsburgh-based seller of network-attached storage servers, is acquired by Network Appliance Inc. for $300 million. Promod Haque ranks #1 on the 2004 Forbes Midas List as a top dealmaker. Norwest makes its first investment in India, a growth equity investment in Persistent Systems, a leading offshore product development company based in Pune. The company would later go public on the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange of India. Local area networking (“WLAN”) systems provider Airespace is acquired by Cisco Systems for $450 million. Norwest notches additional big exits with Arbortext, Authentica, Corio, Open-Silicon, ShoreTel, Sidestep, Skystream, Veraz Networks and Website Pros. The firm raises Norwest Venture Partners X (NVP X), a $650 million fund. In an effort to diversify and invest across multiple stages and sectors in India, Norwest establishes a day-to-day presence in the country via its NVP India advisory subsidiary in Mumbai, led by Niren Shah and Sohil Chand. Norwest expands further, establishing an advisory subsidiary in Herzliya, Israel, led by Dror Nahumi. Norwest adds a second Indian subsidiary in Bengaluru, led by Mohan Kumar. Norwest benefits from Rackspace’s successful initial public offering as the largest venture investor in the company. Rackspace is one of the largest and only technology IPOs occurring this year. Qumranet, an enterprise software company offering a virtual infrastructure platform, is acquired by Red Hat. Norwest portfolio company LifeSize Communications is sold to Logitech for $405 million. Norwest brings on Jon Kossow to focus more aggressively on growth equity opportunities and build out Norwest’s growth equity team. General Partners Jon Kossow and Sonya Brown now head up the growth equity practice at Norwest. Norwest begins investing out of its largest fund to date, Norwest Venture Partners XI (NVP XI), a $1.2 billion fund. Norwest revives its healthcare practice with an emphasis on growth equity and late stage venture investments. Norwest hires two partners to spearhead this practice—Dr. Ryan Harris and Casper de Clercq. Persistent Systems has a successful public offering on the Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange of India (Norwest’s first direct investment in India), and Cast Iron Systems, a SaaS/Cloud integration company is acquired by IBM.

The $1.2B fund targets early to late stage venture and growth equity investments across a wide range of sectors and geographies. The launch of Norwest Venture Partners XIII, which brings Norwest's total capital and commitments to more than $6 billion, closes on the heels of a record year and a half, as 22 of the Norwest's portfolio companies experienced liquidity events in the past 18 months.Norwest Venture Partners XIII follows Norwest Venture Partners XII, a $1.2B fund. Since the announcement of the firm's previous fund, Norwest opened new offices in San Francisco and New York City, and made significant investments in key areas of focus including healthcare, consumer Internet and enterprise. Norwest also further expanded its portfolio services advisory resources to support its growing network of companies in the areas of talent and retention, human resources advisory, business development, marketing, and operations, including domestic and international tax counsel. Norwest has invested in more than 575 companies since inception, and currently has over 130 active companies across its venture and growth equity portfolio."Norwest has a long track record of working with the most innovative companies across geographies, sectors and stages, and our new fund helps us continue this tradition. As a firm, entrepreneurs have relied on our team for decades not only as business partners, but for expertise across every part of their business," said Promod Haque, senior managing partner at Norwest Venture Partners. "With the new fund we'll be able to reach even more entrepreneurs and help them on their paths to building great companies that last."The firm's exit success has continued across the portfolio in the last 18 months, including seven public offerings in the U.S., India and Israel, as well as 15 acquisitions.Initial Public Offerings:On the heels of FireEye's (  NASDAQ :  FEYE ) initial public offering in late 2013, a company in which Norwest was an early-stage and long term investor, the firm continued its success on the public markets with the debut of the number one credit marketplace, Lending Club (  NASDAQ :  LC ). Norwest served as a Series A and lead investor supporting Lending Club from the early stages of the company through one of the most successful initial public offerings of 2014. Within the firm's growing healthcare sector, commercial drug-device company Intersect ENT (  NASDAQ :  XENT ) filed its initial public offering in July 2014. Other initial public offerings included such companies as Apigee (  NASDAQ :  APIC ), MobileIron (  NASDAQ :  MOBL ), Sadbhav (  NSE :  SADBHAV ), Snowman Logistics (  NSE :  SNOWMAN ) and Solar Edge Technologies (  NASDAQ :  SEDG ).Mergers & Acquisitions:The firm also witnessed the acquisitions of satellite imaging company Skybox Imaging by Google for $500M in its venture portfolio, as well as big data discovery and data sharing platform 1010data to Advance for $500M in its growth equity portfolio. Most recently, wearable tech company Misfit was acquired by the Fossil Group for $260M, video processing startup Elemental was sold to Amazon for $296M, and outplacement provider RiseSmart was sold to Randstad for $100M. Other mergers and acquisitions included the sale of online marketing firm AdChina to Alibaba (  NYSE :  BABA ), the acquisition of map tech startup deCarta by Uber, the sale of video advertising company true[x] media to 21st Century Fox, the sale of software defined networking startup ConteXtream to HP, software-defined networking company Cyan Inc. to Ciena, predictive analytics for retail businesses The Retail Equation to Appriss, big data startup Hadapt to Teradata, and the merger of Pertino with Cradlepoint.Active companies in Norwest's portfolio span a wide variety of sectors and stages including such enterprise innovators as Act-On, Adaptive Insights, Bitglass, Blue Jeans Network, Borqs, Bracket Computing, Dtex, Exabeam, Exablox, Glint, Palerra, PCH, Ravello and Velostrata, and consumer Internet leaders including Casper Sleep, Honeybook, IFTTT, Jet, Lumosity, Madison Reed, Minted, Modcloth, Spotify, SundaySky, Turn, Uber and Udemy. Active growth equity investments include such companies as Clarus Commerce, Kendra Scott, My Alarm Center, PCA Skin, PICS, Rainmaker, The Learning Experience (TLE), Turnitin, and WineAccess.

Current investments in India include such venture and growth companies as Cholamandalam Finance, Indusind Bank, Manthan, NSE, Quikr, Swiggy, Thyrocare and Yatra."Our exit success over the past 18 months, and our continued track record for partnering with passionate and innovative founders to help them build and grow meaningful businesses, enabled us to raise our third consecutive $1.2 billion fund," said Jeff Crowe, managing partner, Norwest Venture Partners. "Our portfolio company leaders have created more than $8 billion in market value over the last 18 months alone. We look forward to partnering with the next set of talented entrepreneurs to help them bring new technologies, products and services to life, as we are in the midst of an extraordinary time in innovation across sectors.""Raising a large, global fund is one the key differentiators for Norwest as it allows us the flexibility to invest in the right companies at the right time. We've been operating out of a global fund for a very long time. It has proven to work for our team and our entrepreneurs as our companies participate in a global economy along with broad access to talent and resources," said Matthew Howard, managing partner at Norwest Venture Partners.

With A New Generation Of Leaders Norwest Venture Partners Raises $1.2 Billion

Giving its new generation of leadership a deep capital pool to invest from, Norwest Venture Partners is expected to announce the close of a new $1.2 billion fund.
The announcement of Norwest Venture Partners XII LP comes on the heels of a record year for the firm in 2013, when it saw the liquidation of 11 of its portfolio companies create roughly $10 billion in value.
It also caps a remarkable run of infrastructure building within the 53-year-old firm. Since it raised the $1.2 billion Norwest Venture Partners XI fund, which closed in 2010, the company made its 50th partner appointment; announced the launch of its healthcare practice; added 40 new professional services staff members and promoted 11 investment or portfolio services executives to partner or general partner.
Chief among those new appointments was the elevation of Jeff Crowe and Matthew Howard to
the positions of managing partner at the firm, according to senior managing partner Promod Haque. “That’s the succession and the grooming plan,” Haque says of the process he’s been engaged with for the last 15 months. “We’re going to continue to empower them so that one day they can run the firm without me being there.”
Palo Alto, Calif.-based Norwest Venture Partners has offices in India and Israel in addition to its California locale and diversifies its investments by stage, technology, and geography.
From its single pool of capital the firm will invest in everything from early stage seed and Series A deals later stage growth capital investments. According to Haque later stage investments may be an area where Norwest Venture Partners would look to spend more time. “There’s a very interesting opportunity in the growth equity market,” he says. “Someone looking for a $25 million to $50 million round? Well that’s too small for the [TA Associates] or [Summit Partners]. If anything you’ve seen people like ourselves addressing that market.”
The new fund brings the firm’s total assets under management to $5 billion, and its limited partners are looking for Norwest to repeat its successes in deals like the security company FireEye, or the discount retailer, RetailMeNot, which both held lucrative public offerings within the past year. Other liquidity events last year included the $525 million NTT acquisition of the cloud-based networking services company Virtela; Experian’s $324 million deal to buy 41st Parameter’s fraud detection software; as well as the sale of the hardware company Passif — a low-power wireless semiconductor manufacturer.
So far in 2014 Norwest has also had the midas touch, with the sale of Echo Nest to Spotify; the public offering of Sabre Corp., and the sale of Basis to Intel.
As for particular sectors, Norwest’s current portfolio spans consumer services like Spotify, Lending Club, and Gilt Groupe; enterprise businesses like Adaptive Insights, Apigee, and BlueJeans Network; and in healthcare, CareCloud, Health Catalyst and others.
And whether there’s tech bubble or there isn’t a tech bubble matters very little to a firm like Norwest.
“We’ve had such a long track record,” says Haque. “We’ve never lost any money and we have consistent returns… Our longevity has been much longer than any investment cycles. We’ve seen these multiple cycles come and go.”

The $1.2B fund targets early to late stage venture and growth equity investments across a wide range of sectors. The new fund, which brings NVP's total capital and commitments to approximately $5 billion, closes on the heels of a record year for NVP as more than 11 of the firm's portfolio companies experienced liquidity events in 2013.NVP XII follows the firm's NVP XI, a $1.2 billion fund which the partnership began investing in 2010. Over the course of NVP XI, the firm celebrated its 50th anniversary, strengthened its leadership team with key managing partner appointments, announced its healthcare practice, added more than 40 investment, services and operations professionals to its staff and promoted 11 investment and portfolio services executives to partners/general partners. NVP has invested in nearly 550 companies since inception, and currently has over 120 active companies across its venture and growth equity portfolio."A key strategy for success at NVP is investment diversification. We invest across multiple sectors, stages and geographies, all with a team approach that enables our portfolio companies to tap into the breadth and depth of our expertise," said Promod Haque, senior managing partner at Norwest Venture Partners. "The closing of NVP XII will enable us to expand our focus in the enterprise IT, consumer Internet, healthcare, consumer products and services sectors and grow our presence in thriving entrepreneurial hubs. We look forward to working closely with passionate and talented entrepreneurs to build the next wave of successful companies." NVP's 2013 exit success across its portfolio included significant initial public offerings and merger and acquisition activity. Of note, NVP was an early-stage investor in cyber security leader, FireEye (  NASDAQ :  FEYE ), which celebrated one of the most successful initial public offerings in 2013. NVP was also a lead investor in the world's largest digital coupon destination, RetailMeNot (  NASDAQ :  SALE ), which celebrated a successful initial public offering in July 2013. Other liquidity events last year included the acquisition of leading global managed and cloud-based network services company Virtela by NTT Communications for $525 million, the sale of fraud detection leader 41st Parameter to Experian for $324 million and the acquisition of storage management software company ScaleIO by EMC. The firm also witnessed the sale of low-power wireless semiconductor company Passif to Apple, the acquisition of cybersecurity company Morta Security by Palo Alto Networks, and the partial sale of NVP shares of India financial services company Shriram City Union Finance Ltd (  NSE :  SCUF ).NVP's liquidity momentum has continued in 2014 with the acquisition of music intelligence platform company The Echo Nest by Spotify, the initial public offering of leading technology provider to the global travel and tourism industry Sabre Corporation (  NASDAQ :  SABR ), the sale of wearable device technologies company Basis to Intel, and the acquisition of personalized entertainment discovery solutions company Veveo by Rovi.Active companies in NVP's portfolio span a wide variety of sectors and stages including such innovators as Adaptive Insights, Apigee, BlueJeans Network, CareCloud, Clarus Marketing Group, Gilt Groupe, Health Catalyst, Intersect ENT, Lending Club, Lumosity, MobileIron, Skybox Imaging, Spotify, Turn and Yatra.In addition to growing its investment staff across various stages and sectors, NVP has expanded its internal portfolio services resources to further support its companies in the areas of marketing, business development, recruiting, human resources, domestic and international tax counsel and more."Because we invest out of one global fund, NVP partners are committed to each investment in the portfolio, regardless of the location or stage, and they all have a vested interest in making every NVP company successful," said Jeff Crowe, managing partner, NVP. "Furthermore, our ongoing commitment to serving as a value added business partner to our entrepreneurs has always been an important part of NVP's culture. Continuing to invest in our portfolio services team is a significant part of our strategy, and we'll continue to grow our staff in marketing, recruiting, HR, finance and other key areas to help our portfolio companies grow and thrive."Read More"We are experiencing another significant technology shift in the industry and it's an exciting time to be an investor," said Matthew Howard, managing partner, NVP. "The growing significance of such technologies as cloud, mobility, marketplaces and healthcare IT continue to create new venture and growth equity opportunities in an extremely promising investment climate. We are more excited than ever to continue partnering with leading entrepreneurs to build great businesses, and it's our philosophy to add value and fuel the growth of these companies in every way possible."NVP SnapshotSectors: NVP invests in companies across a wide range of sectors including: technology (cloud & IT infrastructure, Internet & consumer, SaaS), business services, financial services, consumer products/services, and healthcare.

The more engaging they can be w/ audiences, the better —@seancaptain #MediaTalkTech  What Entrepreneurs Are Saying Promod Haque and Norwest Venture Partners provided exceptional support during a fairly long product gestation and initial market fit exercise during the early period of FireEye’s business evolution. They showed fortitude as an investor and believed in the eventual opportunity to defend the world from advanced cyber attacks even when there were insufficient market proof points. I am grateful for their support in helping build FireEye into the global company it is today. Ashar Aziz, Founder, Vice Chairman of the Board, and Chief Strategy Officer - FireEye Norwest’s ability to invest against the grain in an enterprise mobility company like MobileIron speaks to the firm’s belief in its entrepreneurs and backing companies in new markets that aren’t yet obvious. MobileIron is a great example of how Norwest partners with companies to build great businesses. Bob Tinker, President & CEO - MobileIron As we built out our sales force across the United States and grew our sales over 3000% from commercialization to IPO, Norwest’s financing and guidance was critical to our success. Their partnership was and remains key during our rapid commercial growth and scaling. We would not be where we are today without them. Lisa Earnhardt, President and CEO - Intersect ENT Norwest has been championing our team since before day one. Along with Alagu, I was an Entrepreneur- in-Residence with Norwest. I know firsthand how the firm supports companies from idea to incubation to launch to growth and beyond. Matt Howard has been a tremendous part of this path for us at Blue Jeans and is available to us 24×7. Matt has brokered strategic relationships, including those that have led directly to revenue.

Norwest Venture Partners traces its roots back to 1961 with the formation of the Northwest Venture Fund, a private equity and venture capital affiliate of Norwest Corporation, a midwestern bank based in Minneapolis that merged with Wells Fargo in 1998.[3] In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Minneapolis was an early site for both venture capital and high-technology business.[citation needed]
The VC industry was active with the formation of the first Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) and First Midwest Capital Corporation. In 1957, Control Data Corporation, a pioneering supercomputer company, was founded by William Norris. Two years later Norris was instrumental in the formation of the Northwest Growth Fund and the firm was active in the Minneapolis high-tech industry.[citation needed]
The Northwest Growth Fund grew under the leadership of CEO Robert Zicarelli including the opening of an office in Silicon Valley. Zicarelli retired in 1988 and was succeeded by Daniel Haggerty who retired in the 1990s.[4] George J, Still, Jr. (now partner emeritus)[5] and Promod Haque took over as managing partners in 1994.[citation needed]
In January 2016, the firm announced Norwest Venture Partners XIII, a $1.2B fund. NVP XIII marked Norwest's third consecutive $1.2B fund raised in fewer than six years.[1] In 2016, 14 of Norwest's portfolio companies went public or were acquired. The number includes four public offerings in the U.S., India and Israel and 10 company acquisitions.[6]
Portfolio services[edit]
Norwest provides resources to funded companies through its Portfolio Services group. Resources include strategies and services for employee talent and retention, market development, human resources, public relations and marketing, and operations. The group manages the Norwest Loop, an online community for company leaders to use for sharing information and experiences with each other and their Norwest contacts.[7]
The Portfolio Services group also hosts events for Norwest-funded companies several times a year. Topics have included educational technology, demand generation strategies, employer branding, and an event series focused on female founders of companies.[8]
Executives[edit]
Norwest is led by senior managing partner Promod Haque and managing partners Jeff Crowe and Matthew Howard.[citation needed] George J. Still, Jr., partner emeritus, was named to the Forbes Midas List in 2011.[9]

Promod Hague - joined Norwest in 1990. As of early 2016, his investments in more than 70 companies have produced more than $40B in exit values, as 25 of his portfolio companies have gone public and 37 have been acquired (or have gone public and been acquired).[10] His most notable deal was cybersecurity company FireEye, which had the second-best performing initial public offering (IPO) in the U.S. in 2013.[10] His recent investments include Dtex Systems, Palerra, Shape Security, Health Catalyst, and CareCloud. Haque has been named to the Forbes Midas List of top tech investors since 2001, and in 2014 was named by Forbes as a “Hall of Fame” investor. 2017 marked his 13th appearance on the list, including 2004, when he was ranked the #1 venture capitalist based on performance over the previous decade.[10]


Jeff Crowe - joined Norwest in 2004 and became a managing partner in 2013. He worked in the tech world for 20 years as cofounder and CEO of software company Edify. In recent years, Crowe has invested in Jet.com, as well as HoneyBook and Modsy. He currently serves on the boards of public companies Lending Club (NYSE: LC) and RetailMeNot (NASDAQ: SALE) and private companies Extole, Glint, HoneyBook, Madison Reed, Modsy, Opendoor, Owler, Talkspace and Turn. Crowe is a board observer at Minted and is responsible for Norwest's investments in Jet.com (acquired by Walmart), Spotify, and Uber.[11] He was named to the Forbes Midas List in 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017.[12]


Matthew Howard - joined Norwest in 2000 as a general partner and was named a managing partner in 2013.[13] He has appeared on the Forbes Midas List as a top 100 investor three times and was recognized in 2013 by Business Insider as one of the “19 Best Enterprise Tech Venture Capitalists.”[14] He focuses his efforts on mobile, security, rich media, cloud-based services/applications, networking and storage sectors. He serves on the board of several companies, including Avere Systems, Bitglass, Blue Jeans Network, Bluenose Analytics, Exabeam, Mist Systems and MobileIron (Nasdaq: MOBL). He serves on the Technical Advisory Board for In-Q-Tel's Lab 41 initiative to address mission-critical problems for the United States Intelligence Community. Before joining Norwest, Howard was an early employee of Cisco.[15]

They showed fortitude as an investor and believed in the eventual opportunity to defend the world from advanced cyber attacks even when there were insufficient market proof points. I am grateful for their support in helping build FireEye into the global company it is today. Ashar Aziz, Founder, Vice Chairman of the Board, and Chief Strategy Officer - FireEye Norwest’s ability to invest against the grain in an enterprise mobility company like MobileIron speaks to the firm’s belief in its entrepreneurs and backing companies in new markets that aren’t yet obvious. MobileIron is a great example of how Norwest partners with companies to build great businesses. Bob Tinker, President & CEO - MobileIron As we built out our sales force across the United States and grew our sales over 3000% from commercialization to IPO, Norwest’s financing and guidance was critical to our success. Their partnership was and remains key during our rapid commercial growth and scaling. We would not be where we are today without them. Lisa Earnhardt, President and CEO - Intersect ENT Norwest has been championing our team since before day one. Along with Alagu, I was an Entrepreneur- in-Residence with Norwest. I know firsthand how the firm supports companies from idea to incubation to launch to growth and beyond.

Norwest Venture Partners traces its roots back to 1961 with the formation of the Northwest Venture Fund, a private equity and venture capital affiliate of Norwest Corporation, a midwestern bank based in Minneapolis that merged with Wells Fargo in 1998.[3] In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Minneapolis was an early site for both venture capital and high-technology business.[citation needed]
The VC industry was active with the formation of the first Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) and First Midwest Capital Corporation. In 1957, Control Data Corporation, a pioneering supercomputer company, was founded by William Norris. Two years later Norris was instrumental in the formation of the Northwest Growth Fund and the firm was active in the Minneapolis high-tech industry.[citation needed]
The Northwest Growth Fund grew under the leadership of CEO Robert Zicarelli including the opening of an office in Silicon Valley. Zicarelli retired in 1988 and was succeeded by Daniel Haggerty who retired in the 1990s.[4] George J, Still, Jr. (now partner emeritus)[5] and Promod Haque took over as managing partners in 1994.[citation needed]
In January 2016, the firm announced Norwest Venture Partners XIII, a $1.2B fund. NVP XIII marked Norwest's third consecutive $1.2B fund raised in fewer than six years.[1] In 2016, 14 of Norwest's portfolio companies went public or were acquired. The number includes four public offerings in the U.S., India and Israel and 10 company acquisitions.[6]
Portfolio services[edit]
Norwest provides resources to funded companies through its Portfolio Services group. Resources include strategies and services for employee talent and retention, market development, human resources, public relations and marketing, and operations. The group manages the Norwest Loop, an online community for company leaders to use for sharing information and experiences with each other and their Norwest contacts.[7]
The Portfolio Services group also hosts events for Norwest-funded companies several times a year. Topics have included educational technology, demand generation strategies, employer branding, and an event series focused on female founders of companies.[8]
Executives[edit]
Norwest is led by senior managing partner Promod Haque and managing partners Jeff Crowe and Matthew Howard.[citation needed] George J. Still, Jr., partner emeritus, was named to the Forbes Midas List in 2011.[9]

Promod Hague - joined Norwest in 1990. As of early 2016, his investments in more than 70 companies have produced more than $40B in exit values, as 25 of his portfolio companies have gone public and 37 have been acquired (or have gone public and been acquired).[10] His most notable deal was cybersecurity company FireEye, which had the second-best performing initial public offering (IPO) in the U.S. in 2013.[10] His recent investments include Dtex Systems, Palerra, Shape Security, Health Catalyst, and CareCloud. Haque has been named to the Forbes Midas List of top tech investors since 2001, and in 2014 was named by Forbes as a “Hall of Fame” investor. 2017 marked his 13th appearance on the list, including 2004, when he was ranked the #1 venture capitalist based on performance over the previous decade.[10]


Jeff Crowe - joined Norwest in 2004 and became a managing partner in 2013. He worked in the tech world for 20 years as cofounder and CEO of software company Edify. In recent years, Crowe has invested in Jet.com, as well as HoneyBook and Modsy. He currently serves on the boards of public companies Lending Club (NYSE: LC) and RetailMeNot (NASDAQ: SALE) and private companies Extole, Glint, HoneyBook, Madison Reed, Modsy, Opendoor, Owler, Talkspace and Turn. Crowe is a board observer at Minted and is responsible for Norwest's investments in Jet.com (acquired by Walmart), Spotify, and Uber.[11] He was named to the Forbes Midas List in 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017.[12]


Matthew Howard - joined Norwest in 2000 as a general partner and was named a managing partner in 2013.[13] He has appeared on the Forbes Midas List as a top 100 investor three times and was recognized in 2013 by Business Insider as one of the “19 Best Enterprise Tech Venture Capitalists.”[14] He focuses his efforts on mobile, security, rich media, cloud-based services/applications, networking and storage sectors. He serves on the board of several companies, including Avere Systems, Bitglass, Blue Jeans Network, Bluenose Analytics, Exabeam, Mist Systems and MobileIron (Nasdaq: MOBL). He serves on the Technical Advisory Board for In-Q-Tel's Lab 41 initiative to address mission-critical problems for the United States Intelligence Community. Before joining Norwest, Howard was an early employee of Cisco.[15]

Norwest Venture Partners traces its roots back to 1961 with the formation of the Northwest Venture Fund, a private equity and venture capital affiliate of Norwest Corporation, a midwestern bank based in Minneapolis that merged with Wells Fargo in 1998.[3] In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Minneapolis was an early site for both venture capital and high-technology business.[citation needed]
The VC industry was active with the formation of the first Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) and First Midwest Capital Corporation. In 1957, Control Data Corporation, a pioneering supercomputer company, was founded by William Norris. Two years later Norris was instrumental in the formation of the Northwest Growth Fund and the firm was active in the Minneapolis high-tech industry.[citation needed]
The Northwest Growth Fund grew under the leadership of CEO Robert Zicarelli including the opening of an office in Silicon Valley. Zicarelli retired in 1988 and was succeeded by Daniel Haggerty who retired in the 1990s.[4] George J, Still, Jr. (now partner emeritus)[5] and Promod Haque took over as managing partners in 1994.[citation needed]
In January 2016, the firm announced Norwest Venture Partners XIII, a $1.2B fund. NVP XIII marked Norwest's third consecutive $1.2B fund raised in fewer than six years.[1] In 2016, 14 of Norwest's portfolio companies went public or were acquired. The number includes four public offerings in the U.S., India and Israel and 10 company acquisitions.[6]
Portfolio services[edit]
Norwest provides resources to funded companies through its Portfolio Services group. Resources include strategies and services for employee talent and retention, market development, human resources, public relations and marketing, and operations. The group manages the Norwest Loop, an online community for company leaders to use for sharing information and experiences with each other and their Norwest contacts.[7]
The Portfolio Services group also hosts events for Norwest-funded companies several times a year. Topics have included educational technology, demand generation strategies, employer branding, and an event series focused on female founders of companies.[8]
Executives[edit]
Norwest is led by senior managing partner Promod Haque and managing partners Jeff Crowe and Matthew Howard.[citation needed] George J. Still, Jr., partner emeritus, was named to the Forbes Midas List in 2011.[9]

Promod Hague - joined Norwest in 1990. As of early 2016, his investments in more than 70 companies have produced more than $40B in exit values, as 25 of his portfolio companies have gone public and 37 have been acquired (or have gone public and been acquired).[10] His most notable deal was cybersecurity company FireEye, which had the second-best performing initial public offering (IPO) in the U.S. in 2013.[10] His recent investments include Dtex Systems, Palerra, Shape Security, Health Catalyst, and CareCloud. Haque has been named to the Forbes Midas List of top tech investors since 2001, and in 2014 was named by Forbes as a “Hall of Fame” investor. 2017 marked his 13th appearance on the list, including 2004, when he was ranked the #1 venture capitalist based on performance over the previous decade.[10]


Jeff Crowe - joined Norwest in 2004 and became a managing partner in 2013. He worked in the tech world for 20 years as cofounder and CEO of software company Edify. In recent years, Crowe has invested in Jet.com, as well as HoneyBook and Modsy. He currently serves on the boards of public companies Lending Club (NYSE: LC) and RetailMeNot (NASDAQ: SALE) and private companies Extole, Glint, HoneyBook, Madison Reed, Modsy, Opendoor, Owler, Talkspace and Turn. Crowe is a board observer at Minted and is responsible for Norwest's investments in Jet.com (acquired by Walmart), Spotify, and Uber.[11] He was named to the Forbes Midas List in 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017.[12]


Matthew Howard - joined Norwest in 2000 as a general partner and was named a managing partner in 2013.[13] He has appeared on the Forbes Midas List as a top 100 investor three times and was recognized in 2013 by Business Insider as one of the “19 Best Enterprise Tech Venture Capitalists.”[14] He focuses his efforts on mobile, security, rich media, cloud-based services/applications, networking and storage sectors. He serves on the board of several companies, including Avere Systems, Bitglass, Blue Jeans Network, Bluenose Analytics, Exabeam, Mist Systems and MobileIron (Nasdaq: MOBL). He serves on the Technical Advisory Board for In-Q-Tel's Lab 41 initiative to address mission-critical problems for the United States Intelligence Community. Before joining Norwest, Howard was an early employee of Cisco.[15]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
