(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and certain other factors that may affect our future results. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. See "Forward-Looking Statements." Our results and the timing of selected events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors.  Business Overview  T-BAMM is a company that intends to be an on-line store specializing in T-Shirts for the entire family, manufactured from Bamboo. The Company's target market are consumers who are looking for eco-friendly and environmentally sustainable products. We intend to identify and distinguish ourselves by positioning our proposed product at very competitive pricing, targeting a broad base of consumers.  The Company has begun to implement its business model. A logo and website has been developed; we have sourced our bamboo T-Shirt manufacturer. We have also registered our website domain; www.tbamm.com. T-BAMM has as of date of this Form 10-K has not generated any revenues we expect to have sales by the third quarter of 2017.  Table of Contents  Plan of Operations  During the next 12 months, T-BAMM has secured a Bamboo T-Shirt supplier. We have developed a unique logo and on-line presence for our proposed product. We have sourced a third-party firms to ship out our product; set-up the company's website (www.tbamm.com) and have begun to market our product via the internet and social media. We have commenced with marketing activities.  Over the next 12 month period starting from the date of this 10-K, our company must raise capital to introduce its planned product and start sales. We intend to market our product through its planned web-based internet store. We have three planned phases to our operations over the next twelve months as of February 28, 2017. The business activities and related expenses in each phase will be affected by the proceeds from the sales of shares in this offering received by the Company as discussed below. The Company requires is a minimum of $25,000 in proceeds, to continue to implement its business plan.  In the first phase of our planned operations will be to source out potential manufacturer and supplier to establish a Bamboo based T-Shirt market. We were able to source a supplier in North America. We have also designed the corporate logo, developed and launched the Company's website, www.tbamm.com.  The second phase of our planned operations, is to begin marketing and launching our product. We will engage a Search Engine Optimization firm that will assist us, not only identifying to successfully market our product over the internet but to ensure a high presence and to achieve a high search engine ranking. The cost for On-line advertising and Search Engine Optimization ("SOE") our estimated annual cost for these services is $15,000. We expect to have the second phase completed by the end of summer of 2017.  We require additional financing to implement our Plan of Operation and sustain business operations. Currently, we do not have any arrangements for financing and we may be unable to obtain financing when required. Obtaining additional financing would be subject to a number of factors, including the Company's ability to attract customers. The Company may be unable to access to capital markets in the future or that financing, adequate to satisfy the cash requirements of implementing our business strategies, will be available on acceptable terms. The inability of the Company to gain access to capital markets or obtain acceptable financing could have a material adverse effect upon the results of its operations and upon its financial conditions.  Going Concern  Our auditor has indicated in their reports on our financial statements for the fiscal years ended February 28, 2017 and February 29, 2016, that conditions exist that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern due to our recurring losses from operations, deficit in equity, and the need to raise additional capital to fund operations. A "going concern" opinion could impair our ability to finance our operations through the sale of debt or equity securities.  Table of Contents  Results of Operations  Fiscal Year Ended February 28, 2017 compared to the Fiscal Year Ended February 29, 2016  We did not earn any revenues from February 19, 2015 (inception) to February 28, 2017.  During the fiscal year ended February 28, 2017 we incurred operating expenses of $37,218 comprised of office and general expenses of $$9,118, professional fees in the amount of $14,100 and consulting fees in the amount of $14,000 resulting in a net loss of $37,218 as compared to operating expenses of $19,176 for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2016 comprised of office and general expenses of $3,636 and professional fees of $15,540 resulting in a net loss of $19,176. The increase in expenses between fiscal 2017 and 2016 was due to an increase in consulting fees and an increase in office and general expenses, comprised primarily of increases in transfer agent fees and website expenses.  Capital Resources and Liquidity  Our auditor's report on our February 28, 2017 financial statements expresses an opinion that substantial doubt exists as to whether we can continue as an ongoing business. Since our sole director maybe unwilling or unable to loan or advance us additional capital, we believe that if we do not raise additional capital over the next 12 months, we may be required to suspend or cease the implementation of our business plans. See "February 28, 2017 Audited Financial Statements - Auditors Report."  As of February 28, 2017, we had $140 of cash compared to $7,671 of cash as of February 29, 2016. We anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from financing activities will be insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months. To date the Company has incurred operating losses since inception of $59,276. As at February 28, 2017, the Company has a working capital deficit of $50,526.  The Company requires additional funding to meet its ongoing obligations and to fund anticipated operating losses. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on raising capital to fund its initial business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.  We expect to incur marketing and professional and administrative expenses as well expenses associated with maintaining our filings with the Commission. We will require additional funds during this time and will seek to raise the necessary additional capital. If we are unable to obtain additional financing, we may be required to reduce the scope of our business development activities, which could harm our business plans, financial condition and operating results. Additional funding may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. The Company intends to continue to fund its business by way of equity or debt financing and advances from related parties. Any inability to raise capital as needed would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  If we cannot raise additional funds, we will have to cease business operations. As a result, investors in the Company's common stock would lose all of their investment.  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  There are no off-balance sheet arrangements currently contemplated by management or in place that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the business, financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, result of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures and/or capital resources.  Critical Accounting Policies  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  The carrying amount of the Company's financial assets and liabilities approximates their fair values due to their short term maturities.  Stock-based Compensation  The Company follows ASC 718-10, "Stock Compensation", which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services, with a primary focus on transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. ASC 718-10 is a revision to SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," and supersedes Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and its related implementation guidance. ASC 718-10 requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). Incremental compensation costs arising from subsequent modifications of awards after the grant date must be recognized. The Company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options. As at February 28, 2017 the Company had not adopted a stock option plan nor had it granted any stock options. Accordingly no stock-based compensation has been recorded to date.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  The Company does not expect the adoption of any recent accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on its financial statements.

T-BAMM will establish a separate bank account and all proceeds will be deposited
into that account. In the event the Company sells less than the 25% ($25,000) of
this offering, the company will not be able to implement its plan of operations
(refer ‘Plan of Opertions page 35) If necessary, the Company’s sole officer and
director Mr. Stobbe has indicated that he will be willing to provide a maximum
of $25,000, required to fund the offering expenses and maintain the reporting
status, in the form of a non-secured loan for the next twelve months as the
expenses are incurred if less than $25,000 in proceeds are obtained by the
Company from the offering. However, there is no contract or written agreement in
place with Mr. Stobbe. Other than as described herein, the Company has no other
plans, arrangements or commitments to raise funds outside this offering.


The Bamboo T-Shirt market is primarily a niche market dominated by small to
medium companies. However there is a growing trend in this market and some of
the larger outlets are beginning to carry bamboo fabric products. These
companies include

. Cariloha Bamboo, Natural Clothing Company, Rapanui Clothing Company, Tasc
  Performance, Bamboo Village and Bamboo clothing is also sold through 
  Amazon.com.                                                              

The primary competitive edge of T-Bamm will be its ethically pro-environment
based bamboo products sold at a discount price.


Company Description
T-BAMM is a company that intends to be an on-line store specializing in T-Shirts
for the entire family, manufactured from Bamboo. We currently have no product to
sell, but we intend to source fabric suppliers and manufactures from China. We
intend to identify and distinguish ourselves by


 positioning our proposed product
at very competitive pricing, targeting a broad base of consumers.
---

T-BAMM anticipates that it will derive its income from the sale of its proposed
Bamboo T-Shirt products. We do not anticipate earning revenues until such time
as we enter into commercial operations. Since we are presently in the
development state of our business, we can provide no assurance that we will
successfully identify and sell any products or services related to our planned
activities.
---

We were incorporated under the laws of Nevada effective February 19, 2015. Our
principal business offices are Kiefernstr. 1, 76327 Pfinztal, Germany and our
telephone number is (888) 297-9207 and our fax number is (775) 882-8628.

	This Amendment No. 6 (this Amendment No. 6) relates to, amends and supplements where
	indicated the Statement on Schedule 13D originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 12, 2009 (the Original Statement), as amended by the Statement on Schedule 13D/A as filed with the Securities and Exchange
	Commission on April 5, 2010 (Amendment No. 1), as amended by the Statement on Schedule 13D/A as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 25, 2010 (Amendment No. 2), as amended by the
	Statement on Schedule 13D/A as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 7, 2011 (Amendment No. 3), as amended by the Statement on Schedule 13D/A as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on
	December 20, 2011 (Amendment No. 4), as amended by the Statement on Schedule 13D/A as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 27, 2012 (Amendment No. 5), by and on behalf of Lacuna

	Lacuna Entities) and relates to the Common Stock, no par value per share (Common Stock), of Tucows, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation (the Issuer). This Amendment No. 6, Amendment No. 5, Amendment
	No. 4, Amendment No. 3, Amendment No. 2, Amendment No. 1 and the Original Statement are collectively referred to herein as the Schedule 13D.


	Capitalized terms used herein but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Original Statement. This Amendment No. 6 amends and
	supplements the Original Statement, Amendment No. 1, Amendment No. 2, Amendment No. 3, Amendment No. 4 and Amendment No. 5 as specifically set forth herein. Except as set forth below, all previous Items in the Original

	Item 4. Purpose of Transaction



	Item 4 of the
	Schedule 13D is hereby supplemented by adding the following paragraph:


	On December 30, 2013, the Issuer affected a 1-for-4 reverse split of its
	Common Stock.


	Between December 5, 2014 and December 12, 2014, the Lacuna Entities effected a pro-rata in-kind distribution of 850,000 shares of
	the Issuers Common Stock to the members of Lacuna LLC without the receipt of consideration. In connection with such distribution, Rawleigh Ralls, a director of the Issuer and a member of Lacuna LLC, received 384,368 shares of the Issuers
	Common Stock and Kate Ralls, Mr. Rallss spouse, received 43,461 shares of the Issuers Common Stock. Upon completion of the foregoing pro-rata in-kind distribution none of the Lacuna Entities retained any beneficial ownership in any
	shares of the Issuers Common Stock.

	Item 5 of the Schedule 13D is hereby amended and supplemented with the following:



	(a) and (b)
