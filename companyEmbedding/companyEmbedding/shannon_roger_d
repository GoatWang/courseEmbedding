      directly to the company’s CEO.
    


      “Roger’s experience creating financial strength at large, multi-national 
      companies will be beneficial as ADTRAN looks to capitalize on the 
      significant growth opportunities in broadband services in markets around 
      the world,” said Thomas R. Stanton, chief executive officer and chairman 
      of the board, ADTRAN. “As ADTRAN has shifted its focus as a software

      Technologies LLC, a subsidiary of Mitsui & Co., Ltd. and Nucor 
      Corporation since July 2006, also serving as its principal accounting 
      officer. Prior to his nine-year tenure at Steel Technologies, Shannon 
      directed global treasury for Brown-Forman Corporation. During his 
      career, Shannon has held financial leadership positions in a wide range 
      of industries at large and mid-size international companies in the 
      manufacturing, consumer goods and business services markets. A native of 
      Decatur, Alabama, Shannon holds a master's degree in business 
      administration from the Terry Graduate School of Business at the 
      University of Georgia and a bachelor’s degree in accounting from Auburn 
      University. He is a certified public accountant and chartered financial 
      analyst.
    

      “ADTRAN is poised for a fundamental expansion of its business, both 
      globally and through the innovative software-driven service creation 
      solutions it has developed. I look forward to supporting the company 
      through this process in an effort to maximize its opportunities for 
      financial success,” said Shannon. “These business transformations 
      present exciting challenges and opportunities, and I believe my skills 
      and experience can help expand the company’s growth trajectory and 
      create more value for all of its shareholders and other stakeholders.”
    

      Michael Foliano, who has served as interim CFO, will remain responsible 
      for all manufacturing, supply chain and logistics functions, as well as 
      ADTRAN's corporate IT, facilities and real estate functions as the 
      company’s senior vice president of global operations. “Mike has done a 
      tremendous job in his dual role as both interim CFO and senior vice
