Traditional, Roth and rollover IRAs offer attractive tax advantages and can serve as primary or supplemental retirement savings vehicles.  




Traditional IRA



Invest in a traditional IRA and defer paying taxes until you make withdrawals in retirement. Why does deferral matter? Simply put, if you think you will be in a lower tax bracket when you retire, your tax savings could be significant when you withdraw the money. Learn more about the traditional IRA:


 Traditional IRA Flyer



Deferred taxes and tax deductions. In addition to deferring taxes on current investment income or appreciation, you may be able to deduct all or a portion of your annual contribution, depending on your adjusted gross income.
Contributions. If you are younger than 70½ in 2017 and have taxable compensation, you may contribute up to the current maximum of $5,500. If you are 50 or older, you can make an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution. You also may contribute for a non-working or minimally working spouse. 
Reinvested earnings. All earnings from your traditional IRA are automatically reinvested into your account to maximize your total return.
Required withdrawals.  At age 70½, the IRS mandates that you begin taking an annual withdrawal called a required minimum distribution (RMD). Your Waddell & Reed financial advisor can assist you in calculating and understanding the RMD process.  



IRA vs. Taxable Account Comparison
Your IRA’s potential growth is tax deferred until withdrawn and can accumulate substantially faster than identical savings in a taxable account

This chart is for illustration purposes only and does not represent the past or future performance of any specific investment. This chart assumes the reinvestment of all earnings
and does not take into account any applicable fees, expenses, or possible withdrawals. The chart does not reflect all possible variables that may affect results. This illustration does not reflect the impact of state income taxes. Your situation may be different.

The assumed rate of return is not a guarantee, and investments that pay higher rates of return are generally subject to higher risk and volatility. Please note that lower minimum
tax rates on capital gains and dividends would make the investment return for the taxable investment more favorable and thus would reduce the difference in performance
between the accounts shown.

Investors should consider their personal investment horizon and income tax bracket, both current and anticipated, when making an investment decision, as these may further
impact the comparison.



Roth IRA



What are your tax expectations when you retire? If you think you will be taxed at a higher rate than today, think about saving for retirement with a Roth IRA. You'll make Roth contributions with money that has already been taxed at today's potentially lower rate. When you withdraw in retirement, your contributions and any potential growth may be tax free. That's one big reason to contribute. Other reasons the Roth IRA may be right for you include:


 Roth IRA Flyer



Contributions. You can contribute to a Roth IRA as long as you or your spouse have taxable income and your modified adjusted gross income is within the Roth limits. For 2017 you may contribute up to the current maximum of $5,500. If you are 50 or older, you can make an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution.




Roth IRA Adjusted Gross Income Limits for 2017


Single, head of household
 $118,000-$133,000


Married filing jointly 
$186,000-$196,000


Married filing separately
 $10,000





Withdrawals. You can withdraw contributions for any reason at any time without taxes or penalties. However, request a withdrawal before your account is at least five years old or if you are not yet 59½ and the earnings portion may be subject to a 10% penalty (exceptions apply). With a Roth, unlike the traditional IRA, the IRS does not mandate a required minimum distribution at age 70½.

Earn too much to contribute to a Roth IRA? Consider contributing to and converting a traditional IRA to a Roth. A Waddell & Reed financial advisor can explain the details and guide you in this decision. 



Rollover IRA



When you’re ready to retire or switch employers, don’t leave without thinking about the assets in your employer’s retirement plan. One option is to transfer them directly to a rollover IRA, where you may benefit from:


 Rollover IRA Flyer



Tax-deferred retirement savings. Defer taxes on earnings until withdrawn in retirement.
    
No current income taxes. Avoid current income taxes, including a mandatory 20% income tax withholding and possible 10% excise tax, when you rollover.
    
Withdrawal flexibility. Withdraw without tax penalties between ages 59 ½ and 70 ½. After 70 ½, the IRS mandates require minimum distributions based on your average life expectancy

Other options for your assets in a former employer's retirement plan include: 

Leave the assets in the plan
Keep/spend the assets
Receive the assets in a check and deposit them yourself in an IRA rollover
Transfer your assets directly into your new employer’s retirement plan

What you choose depends on your previous employer’s plan document, your specific needs and your tax advisor's guidance. 






Add an IRA to your retirement savings plan.
A Waddell & Reed financial advisor can help make it happen.

Important Information:
Early withdrawals are subject to ordinary income tax and a 10% penalty if you take a distribution before reaching age 59½.

*Eligible Rollover Distribution (ERD) refers to those distributions from Qualified Plans that are eligible to move between various fiduciary plan types (for example - 403(b), 401(k)) without tax consequences. These Qualified Plan types are referred to in Internal Revenue Code (IRC) 401(a) and include Profit Sharing, 401(k), Money Purchase Pension, Defined-Benefit, and ESOP. An ERD may also be from an IRC 403(b) (7) plan, which is for employees of non-profit institutions and public schools.
If an election is made to take an ERD from these plans in cash or "in kind" there is a mandatory 20% federal withholding. When this occurs, various states require withholding as indicated.

SEC-Required Report on Routing of Customer Orders
Waddell & Reed, Inc. ("W&R") introduces transactions on a fully disclosed basis to our clearing firm, Pershing LLC ("Pershing") . In November 2000, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") adopted new rules aimed at improving the quality and availability of disclosure related to order execution and routing practices. Pershing has prepared reports pursuant to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 606 that requires all brokerage firms to make publicly available quarterly reports on their order routing practices. The report provides information on the routing of "non-directed orders" - any order that the customer has not specifically instructed to be routed to a particular venue for execution. For these non-directed orders, our clearing firm has selected the execution venue on behalf of its customers.

The report is divided into four sections: one for securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange, one for securities listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market, one for securities listed on the American Stock Exchange or regional exchanges, and one for exchange-listed options. For each section, this report identifies the venues most often selected by the clearing firm, sets forth the percentage of various types of orders routed to the venues, and discusses the material aspects of the respective clearing firm's relationship with the venues. W&R directs its equity order flow to its clearing firm, Pershing, for routing and execution based upon where the customer's account is held. W&R does not receive compensation for directing order flow to Pershing.

All shareholders of any Waddell & Reed Advisors Funds should have received a proxy mailing dated April 3, 2017.
The proxy asks for your vote, as a shareholder of one or more series (each, a “Fund,” and collectively, the “Funds”) of the Waddell & Reed Advisors Funds (the “Trust”) at a special meeting of shareholders of the Funds to be held on May 15, 2017 at 3:00 p.m. Central Time, at the offices of the Trust, 6300 Lamar Avenue, Overland Park, Kansas 66202 (the “Meeting”). The purpose of the Meeting is to vote upon a series of proposals affecting the Funds (each, a “Proposal” and collectively, the “Proposals”). You may download the complete proxy here.
Whether or not you plan to attend the Meeting in person, your vote is needed. You are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Meeting and any adjournment of the Meeting, even if you no longer hold shares of a Fund. Your vote is important no matter how many shares you own. It is important that your vote be received no later than the time of the Meeting.
Voting is quick and easy. Everything you need has been provided to you via mail or email. You may vote by completing and returning your proxy card in the postage paid return envelope provided , by calling (800) 821-8781, or by visiting proxyvote.com. You may receive more than one set of proxy materials if you hold shares in more than one account. Please be sure to vote each proxy card you receive. If we do not hear from you, our proxy solicitor, D.F. King & Co., Inc., may contact you. This will ensure that your vote is counted even if you cannot or do not wish to attend the Meeting in person. If you have any questions about the Proposals or the voting instructions, you may call (800) 821-8781 and a representative will assist you.

Proxy Voting

Prior to the general meeting of a company or fund, shareholders will receive a package
in the mail containing a variety of documents that report financial data and operations
results and announce important issues - such as proposals for changes to the company's
share structure or mergers and acquisitions. These are all matters that shareholders
or unit holders, the true owners of the company or fund, will vote on at the general
meeting. If, however, a shareholder is not able to attend an annual (or special)
meeting, he or she can vote on proposals by means of a proxy, one of the documents
that is included in the pre-meeting mailing package. Shareholders are encouraged
to take advantage of their opportunity to influence the company and fund’s operations
by casting their vote.

History






 Waddell & Reed has been serving the financial needs of families, individuals and businesses for more than 80 years. Here is a brief journey across the timeline of our growth.










1937
Two World War I veterans, Chauncey Waddell and Cameron Reed, form one of the first mutual fund and financial planning complexes in the country –Waddell & Reed, Inc., headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri. The two men shared an interest in finance and a belief that everyone, regardless of status or net worth, should be able to build a financial plan and take steps toward achieving long-term goals.










1940
Waddell & Reed Investment Management Company launches two of the first mutual funds in the industry under the United Funds name: the Accumulative Fund (now called the Waddell & Reed Advisors Accumulative Fund) and the Income Fund (now called the Waddell & Reed Advisors Core Investment Fund).










1950
Waddell & Reed Investment Management Company creates one of the nation’s first science and technology funds, known today as the Waddell & Reed Advisors Science and Technology Fund.










1959
Waddell & Reed’s assets under management reach more than $700 million with a sales force active in Latin America, Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico. Two years later, Waddell & Reed’s assets under management would reach $1 billion.










1961
United Investors Life Insurance Company (“UILIC”) becomes a Waddell & Reed subsidiary, fulfilling a longstanding goal of the company’s founders to offer its customers high-quality insurance products and services.










1969
Following the retirement of Chauncey Waddell and Cameron Reed, Monte and Neil Wallace assume ownership of Waddell & Reed, Inc., establishing Continental Investment Corporation (“CIC”) as a vehicle to acquire the company and its affiliates.










1981
Liberty National Insurance Holding Company acquires CIC, assuming several valuable assets, which include Waddell & Reed, UILIC and a national sales force.










1985
Waddell & Reed’s assets under management reach the $5 billion mark.










1987
Waddell & Reed launches the W&R Target Portfolios, today known as Ivy Variable Insurance Portfolios (VIP). The portfolios provide underlying investments within annuities and variable universal life products. Today Ivy VIP comprise 20 funds, including domestic and international equity, fixed income and specialty categories.1










1998
Waddell & Reed Financial, Inc.’s initial public offering of Class A common stock begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol WDR.

2005

2007

In addition, a customized “big rig” visits more than 70 cities nationwide that same year to further raise awareness and to encourage citizens to donate care packages, garnering a monetary equivalent of more than $400,000.










2011
Waddell & Reed launches a national tour – Honoring Our History – to mark its 75th anniversary in 2012 and to support the National World War I Museum as well as a variety of museums and cultural institutions around the country.










2013
Ivy becomes the first-ever jersey sponsor for Major League Soccer (MLS) team Sporting KC, helping to extend the awareness of the Ivy brand globally.










2016
Reflecting progressive product offerings and a growing global presence, Ivy modernized its brand moniker and imagery, becoming Ivy Investments.





 

1 - Ivy Variable Insurance Portfolios are only available as investment options in variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts issued by life insurance companies. They are not offered or made available directly to the general public.
2 - The Ivy InvestEd Plan is a Section 529 college savings plan.











Every day the world changes. We have high expectations of ourselves, and a responsibility to our investors, to continually understand those changes and interpret the implications.
Philip J. Sanders, CFA
Chief Executive Officer | Chief Investment Officer

Midyear Global Market Outlook 2017Market PerspectivesIt's not unusual for a new year to bring changes. But 2017 may be particularly noteworthy.








Perspectives





 



Investable Theme: Increasing web use in China


                                John Maxwell and Catherine Murray, portfolio managers of the International Core Equity strategy, believe an increase
in Chinese internet usage will benefit select companies that have dominant market share or are well positioned for
increased usage through their online platforms.
                            








 



A time to be selective in the energy sector


                                We believe a selective approach to the energy sector is important now, but do not advocate broad exposure across the industry in the current environment.
                            








 



Five reasons to choose energy in 2017


                                We think there are five key ideas to keep in mind as we enter 2017.

Website

Waddell & Reed Financial, Inc. (NYSE: WDR) is an American asset management and financial planning company founded in 1937. It has been a publicly traded company since 1998, and has its headquarters in Overland Park, Kansas. It operates asset management and distribution subsidiaries, including Ivy Investment Management Company and Waddell & Reed Investment Management Company.[1]
The company distributes products through three primary channels, the Advisors channel (a network of personal financial advisors around the country); the Wholesale channel (unaffilated broker/dealers, registered investment advisors and retirement platforms); and the Institutional channel (pension plans, defined benefit plans and endowments).
History[edit]
The company traces its history to September 3, 1937 when it was founded by Chauncey Waddell and Cameron Reed. The company was one of the first to sell funds following the Investment Company Act of 1940. Two of its funds—United Income Fund and United Accumulative Fund—were among the first mutual funds in the United States. Its first offices were in department stores. Continental Investment Corporation of Boston bought Waddell & Reed for $82.5 million in 1969. Liberty National Insurance Holding Company, later renamed Torchmark Corporation acquired it for $160 million in 1981.[2] Torchmark spun it off in 1998 in a deal where for 10 Torchmark shares held, Torchmark shareholders received 3 shares of Waddell & Reed.[3]

The company distributes products through three primary channels, the Advisors channel (a network of personal financial advisors around the country); the Wholesale channel (unaffilated broker/dealers, registered investment advisors and retirement platforms); and the Institutional channel (pension plans, defined benefit plans and endowments).
History[edit]
The company traces its history to September 3, 1937 when it was founded by Chauncey Waddell and Cameron Reed. The company was one of the first to sell funds following the Investment Company Act of 1940. Two of its funds—United Income Fund and United Accumulative Fund—were among the first mutual funds in the United States. Its first offices were in department stores. Continental Investment Corporation of Boston bought Waddell & Reed for $82.5 million in 1969. Liberty National Insurance Holding Company, later renamed Torchmark Corporation acquired it for $160 million in 1981.[2] Torchmark spun it off in 1998 in a deal where for 10 Torchmark shares held, Torchmark shareholders received 3 shares of Waddell & Reed.[3]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
