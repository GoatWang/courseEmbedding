Competitive Advantage:  Jamie Moldafsky





December 30, 2009


 

Jamie Moldafsky
Jamie Moldafsky is responsible for driving profitable growth in the Home Equity division of Well Fargo.
Prior to her role at Wells Fargo, Ms. Moldafsky was general manager of the KitchenAid brand at Whirlpool Corporation, head of Retail Marketing at Charles Schwab, and held multiple positions in the financial services, card, travel, and international divisions at
American Express.
Ms. Moldafsky holds a bachelor’s degree from the University of Michigan and a master’s degree from the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania.
What does competitive advantage mean to you and your organization?
I think of competitive advantage as first, defining your key differentiators and second, determining how sustainable those are.
How would you describe Wells Fargo’s competitive advantage?
We have a broad customer base and a unique operating model. Our 84 distinct businesses are complementary, leveragable across each other, and counter‐cyclical. And, we have deep distribution channels including a strong online business and extensive retail bank distribution network. Connecting that is a highly collaborative culture focused on finding the benefit to the customer. These are all advantages, but our true differentiator and competitive advantage is that we are a cross‐selling machine. We know how to leverage all of these strengths in a way that drives sustainable revenues.
How does that competitive advantage translate into the home equity division?
Home equity fits in nicely with the Wells advantage because it’s a relationship‐oriented product. It’s very profitable for the bank and can be cross‐sold by all channels. Also, our strong brand takes some pressure off of having to compete strictly on price. So, historically we’ve been able to be more innovative around the role of home equity for consumers.
So you drive more growth organically through your existing customer base than through new customer acquisitions?
Yes. A lot of our revenues and product innovations are driven by creative thinking about how to leverage our distribution channels. Our patented Home Asset Management Account product is an example. It enables customers to package their home equity and mortgage together so they get one statement and, as they pay down their mortgage, it comes back to them in their equity. It’s a very cool product that we would never have thought of without a large mortgage distribution channel.
Does your competitive advantage impact who you see as your competition?
We’re schizophrenic about our view of the competition. We don’t have any one competitor across our 84 product lines because every business competes differently. But when you think about distribution, we clearly have distinct competitors. Even these, however, are in two groups. The big national banks like Chase, Bank of America and Citi, are one set of competitors. But in the regions and stores, credit unions and small regional banks are our main competition.
That’s unusual in my experience. When I was with Whirlpool, there were three appliance manufacturers sharing the market. And at Schwab, you had a concentrated group of brokerage competitors. Here, we compete with both the big guys and the little guys.
How has a clear competitive advantage created significant growth in companies you’ve worked in?
At Wells, our competitive advantage around cross‐selling drives growth through products. More than 50 percent of customers who walk in to a branch to open an account walk out with a package of four or five products. They get an ATM card, checking account, online banking, etc. That packaged sale is a result of how we think, how we drive growth through our customer base, and how our product businesses and distribution work together.
At Whirlpool, design as a competitive advantage drove big gains. White goods never used to be about design. It was always about whether the icemaker could make eight or ten quarts of ice. We hired colorists and designed a whole line of appliances, focusing on the look and feel. Washers and dryers were suddenly available in colors and Sears was putting them out at the entrance to the mall stores to bring in customers. It became fashion, and a trend. We translated that across all brands and products so that if you had a Whirlpool washing machine, you’d want a Whirlpool dryer because they go together. If you had a Whirlpool refrigerator, you would want a whole Whirlpool kitchen. We differentiated on design and understanding packaged sales to drive strong growth.
How does a company get everyone pulling in the same direction on competitive advantage?
At Whirlpool every employee was trained in customer loyalty and, every employee, at every level, had to participate in an innovation team.
At Schwab it’s always been Chuck coalescing and driving people. It’s a religion with him, and the people who followed him. Everyone drinks the Kool‐Aid. Here at Wells, thinking about customers and helping them succeed financially is just part of the culture. There’s organic agreement around our competitive advantage.
How do you keep your advantage fresh?
You start looking at what you can build that grows share of wallet, makes money and also drives efficiencies for the customer.
So more of a ‘push’ than a ‘pull’ model where customer needs drive products?
Wells is a lot more ‘push’ than other companies I’ve been in. Schwab and AMEX are much more focused on understanding and solving customer pain points.
Wells innovates to make our customers’ lives easier, but the innovation originates more from the ‘push’ side. For example our division wanted customers to have a box on the mortgage form that says, “I want home equity as soon as I have equity”. Having that box eliminates a huge customer pain point because 90% of customers want it and it’s a hassle to have to resubmit paperwork and pay for appraisals later. But the idea originated from us asking how we can better leverage the point of origination with mortgage, reduce our costs, get higher penetration and,  therefore, block out our competitors. It’s great for the customer but we didn’t start by asking customers to tell us their biggest pain point.
The same was true at AMEX with their spending report. Customers want to have their cards with AMEX because the spending report provides an easy way to see what they’re spending across cards. But that didn’t start with the customer need. It started with a team at AMEX asking, “How do we get all of their credit cards to be with us?”
How do you know when it’s time to refresh?
When the metric you thought was driving your profitability isn’t, it’s time to refresh. At some point, more product doesn’t equal more profit. Consumers rebel and you hit diminishing returns. Then it’s time to find the next appropriate measure of healthy growth.
How does Wells define healthy growth?
Another Wells mantra is, “You get bigger by being better, not better by being bigger.” How many consumers wake up and say, “I want to be anonymous in a bank that has more customers than anyone else?” Nobody says that. They say, “I want a bank that cares about my business and makes it easier for me to do what I need to do to be successful.” By doing that, we will be bigger, we’ll sustain our differentiators and maintain our competitive advantage.
What tips do you have to help companies get clear on their competitive advantage?
To grow, you need to know why your customers value you and how you are going to continue to attract customers. Also, you need to figure out where you’re making your money and what’s sustainable in that. Trying to create a competitive advantage that you don’t already have is tough. So take something you have and figure out how to leverage it and make it uniquely sustainable.
I think that’s why competitive advantage so often starts with the culture. It was hard for a while at Whirlpool because we didn’t start with a culture of innovation. It was an engineering company which had to restructure to change the culture to shift its competitive advantage from engineering to design.
What company do you think has a strong competitive advantage?
Amazon has done a great job. Knowing their customers and being able to anticipate and respond to evolving needs has always been one of their key differentiators.
And Tiffany is a great example. Think about how long they have been in business and the significance of the blue box. To this day when somebody gets that box, they’re excited.

How Wells Fargo Has Evolved Its Marketing to Fit a Larger Footprint
CMO Looks to Develop Products in the 'White Space,' as It Aims For Social-Media Consistency And Governance Across 90-Plus Businesses


	By  

Abbey Klaassen.
	

	
	
 Published on August 20, 2013. 







Jamie Moldafsky may be the only financial-services CMO with a line item in her budget for hay.
Wells Fargo is the No. 4 U.S. bank by assets and the largest retail mortgage lender, but it still has to feed the horses that pull its iconic red-and-yellow stagecoaches, which appear in 350-plus parades across the country each year.



		A 2012 consumer-focused campaign emphasizes how easy it is for customers to manage their financial lives with the e-banking tools of Wells Fargo. 
 	

"It's a great asset ... the only other company that has anything like it is Budweiser with the Clydesdales," said Ms. Moldafsky, who joined Wells Fargo in 2005 from appliance giant Whirlpool, where she led the company's colorful KitchenAid brand. She was promoted to CMO from exec VP-home equity acquisition and customer management in 2011.
The wagons remain a part of Wells Fargo's brand, though the bank has become a vastly different entity. Its 2008 purchase of Wachovia gave it a national presence and it's fitting into that footprint well: Last month it reported 14 straight quarters of earnings-per-share growth. The company spent $578 million on U.S. advertising last year, ranking 70th on Ad Age's Leading National Advertisers list.
"We're broadening the role of marketing," Ms. Moldafsky said, to include product development and customer experience. "A lot of the product innovation is going to happen in the white space that's between products or channels, and our corporate marketing group sees all that -- we see what our customers want, and we see where there are gaps or space for us to play."
Ads are increasingly customer focused, emphasizing not the products but their benefits. For example, a recent millennial-focused campaign, "Done," centered on how easy it is to manage your financial life with Wells Fargo's e-banking options. Millennials want to bank "from the convenience of their cellphone," Ms. Moldafsky said, but value all channels, including ATM, phone and tablet. "It's the ability to do it how you want ... you have to fit into their life."
Wells Fargo, which has 275,000 employees and 90-plus businesses, has worked on finding the right structure for social media, which reports to Ms. Moldafsky but supports the whole corporation.



		Jamie Moldafsky, CMO, Wells Fargo 
 	

"You need some mechanism to make sure you're being consistent and have the right guardrails in place," she said.
The solution: a social-media steering committee, made up of corporate communications, Ms. Moldafsky, legal representation and a couple of senior business leaders. It meets biweekly and serves as a social-media governance forum and screens and selects tools and technologies. A second group more broadly representative of the company's businesses meets weekly to strategize on social-media content.
While "everybody wants their own Facebook page and their own Twitter handle, we're one brand," she said. The big challenge is how to stay consistent but allow various businesses -- especially distributed sales channels like the brokerage network or mortgage consultants -- to have their own voices.
The highly regulated nature of banking also complicates what Wells Fargo can and can't say in social media. "There are some things we say we just won't do ... we can't answer someone's question in social media with legalese," Ms. Moldafsky said. "We can make sure it's legally accurate, but we can't write it the way the lawyers want us to write it."
A social-media command center launched last month to "create the same rigor around capturing social-media interactions as we do with phone calls and branch visits," said Ms. Moldafsky. "You'll see that in Atlanta there's lots of messaging about ATMs so we know very quickly that an ATM in Atlanta is broken."
Wells Fargo works with DDB West's Los Angeles and San Francisco offices on creative, OMD on media, UM/MRM on digital creative and media, and Muse, DAE and Acento on multicultural marketing. Ms. Moldafsky didn't shift agencies when she came onboard -- but has changed how Wells Fargo works with them. In a model called "co-create," she brings agencies together earlier and takes ideas from all of them, even if one agency has been charged with leading the campaign. It's resulted in mass-market ideas originating from Wells Fargo's diverse agencies.
Ms. Moldafsky decided against calling a review when she assumed the CMO role and instead focused on better agency management and shifted some weight among the shops.
"We were already changing a lot and thought DDB deserved an opportunity to have the benefit of the doubt," she said. "But we refreshed the team. Some of the people had been on Wells Fargo for 12 or 14 years -- and that was a different Wells Fargo."
From Appliances to Mortgages: Jamie Moldafsky On What She's Learned And How She Hires
Ad Age: What did your time at Whirlpool teach you that applies to financial-services marketing?
Ms. Moldafsky: Whirlpool was a terrific experience because I learned so much about manufacturing and about how consumers live and think about their lives, and that does translate to financial services. Included in that was Whirlpool's approach to innovation, which is something I brought with me to Wells Fargo.
Ad Age: Customer experience is a key area of focus. What's an important lesson you've learned about it?
Ms. Moldafsky: One size never fits all, authenticity is critical, it's all about culture and, most importantly, the customer truly must come first.
Ad Age: Which traits do you look for when you hire marketers?
Ms. Moldafsky: Intellectual curiosity, customer passion, results orientation, communication and collaboration skills
Ad Age: What's your guilty media pleasure?
Ms. Moldafsky: Entire seasons of great shows, like "Mad Men" and "Downton Abbey," which are perfect for long plane rides. Also, I still read magazines and have been known to spend too much time on YouTube.

Building Better: 5 Questions With Wells Fargo CMO Jamie Moldafsky


				Posted
				
					April 17, 2017				

					by					

							Dale Buss						









Wells Fargo is climbing out of a huge reputational hole after a scandal broke in October that revealed dodgy retail sales practices (opening unauthorized accounts) spurred by aggressive targets. Since then, the financial giant has implemented internal reforms including replacing its CEO, transforming sales incentives and overhauling local-level manager compensation structures. It has paid huge fines and seen declines in customer loyalty and new customers, in addition to losing its crown as America’s biggest bank and its Better Business Bureau accreditation.

With structural fixes now underway, it’s now the marketing team’s turn to help get the word out, Wells Fargo chief marketing officer Jamie Moldafsky told brandchannel. Today, Wells Fargo launches a new brand campaign with the tagline “Building Better Every Day,” which Moldafsky stated “reflects what we are doing to make things right for our stakeholders, and our efforts to develop and offer innovative products and services that help our customers reach their financial goals.”
The kick-off ads in the campaign, which will be running on TV and its YouTube channel, highlight how the bank is bringing innovation to customers through improved security measures, digital technologies and other advances such as card-free ATMs, which let customers withdraw money by entering a one-time access code from its mobile app. The campaign’s other themes: guidance, service (financial health) and community support.

“We’ve done extensive research with various constituencies to understand where they are with the brand and Wells Fargo,” Moldafsky told us. “Most of them want to hear what we’re doing to be a better financial institution for them, whether it’s around their security and ease and convenience, or around guidance and education. So we’re sharing the things that we’re doing that will make their lives better. That’s why people choose to bank with Wells Fargo.”

In that spirit, two of the new TV ads depict the ease for customers of using their smartphones at a Wells Fargo to get card-free ATM access. Another spot highlights R&D advances in voice recognition security technology. (Its innovation incubator just received a $20 million infusion to continue funding startups and clean tech plays.)

The retail ethical breach concerned a compensation structure and sales incentives that encouraged branch employees to open multiple accounts for customers who never knew they “had” the accounts. Wells Fargo has been addressing the situation by firing thousands of employees, closing branches and implementing process reforms and new checks and balances. It attributed the phony accounts to an internal cultural breakdown, prompting CEO John Stumpf to step down and make way for a new management team.

An independent auditor’s report, released April 10th, also cast the company’s leadership culture as a contributing factor in the scandal. Meanwhile, its CFO also said the scandal’s costs will be higher than projected, while in the background there are efforts to oust directors. New CEO Tim Sloan told analysts on its April 13th quarterly earnings call, however, that he’s confident about the steps the company has made so far and the direction in which it’s headed.
To support the ongoing restructuring and the new campaign, throughout 2017 Wells Fargo is running a grassroots storytelling effort that brings to life “real, tangible examples of how the bank is building better every day.” These stories will be featured on WellsFargo.com/stories.
To expand the campaign’s reach, in-language language spots have been produced, such as these in Spanish and Chinese (Mandarin):



While this English-language spot appeals to the South Asian/Indian community:

brandchannel spoke with Moldafsky for more insights on the new campaign—which encompasses print, digital, broadcast TV and mobile channels in partnership with AOR BBDO San Francisco—and a new era for the brand.
bc: How is the journey to rebuild trust with customers, employees and key stakeholders progressing?

Jamie Moldafsky (right): It’s a journey. That’s the most important piece. The whole notion of “Building Better” is getting better every day, knowing that some days will be better than others. It’s going probably per what we’d expect. It’s going to take us time to restore all the relationships and trust in those relationships, but we’re making good headway because we’re head-on confronting some of the issues we had that made us less than ideal for some customers and stakeholders.
bc: What issues are you confronting head on?
Moldafsky: It’s an overarching platform for Wells Fargo. “Building Better Every Day” applies to us on several levels: becoming a better bank; fixing things for customers; making sure things that happened to us don’t happen again; building a better organization for team members, communities, and customers. The campaign fits in a lot with how people can experience better through their own lives and Wells Fargo, helping people on their own journey and providing a better financial experience for them. As in some of our parallel advertising, like a letter that was put out by Tim Sloan, we’re taking actions to make ourselves a better bank for employees and shareholders.
We’re sharing with our customers and key stakeholders all the actions we’re taking to address the issues that we have. We absolutely believe that is job number one. And that’s why it’s seven months later before we’re running a new campaign. The last seven months have really been about making sure we’re getting it right … and changing our processes. We’ve changed compensation structures in our community banks. We’ve done a lot of things to fix the basics so that people can trust us, and now we feel customers are ready to hear and desirous to hear what we’re doing for them as a customer.
It would have been for us a very bad idea to just have jumped into, “We’re a great bank and come bank with us.” We knew we had a lot of work to do to make sure our actions have come first. And we do believe we have, and are making it, a better bank. This [campaign] comes in on top of that.
bc: How does this campaign fit into the bigger goal of “decisive action” to win back the trust of customers and stakeholders? 
Moldafsky: We’ll be going in more directions too. The reason we chose these [launch ads] is because they’re actually important to rebuilding trust. The only way non-customers or prospects are going to trust us is to feel we’re on their side to do things that make them trust us most—the kinds of things we’re doing to protect their identity, to make banking easier, to provide objective guidance around loan products. These are tangible actions that we can share to make customers understand we’re on their side and this is how we can help.
Earning back trust will take time, and these services are different from other kinds of institutions. ATM cardless access has been viewed widely as an innovation and those specific spots tested extraordinarily well. People understand that’s a huge value to them, and they understand the benefit of them. When we want to highlight that they’re unique or competitively advantaged, we will.
bc: What steps have been taken to maintain or strengthen employee engagement in your brand purpose in the past few months?
Moldafsky: Our team members are job number one. They deliver the innovations, and team members are the most important stakeholder group. We’ve taken many actions to make sure they’re cared for, things like increasing our minimum wage, changing compensation plans—which has been very well-received by them—and a “raise your hand” program that encourages and doubles down on safeguarding and communicating.
We’ve held dozens to hundreds of town halls with leaders to be transparent and open about what we’ve encountered and our role in that, and teammates have our utmost support. We want to be the best place to work for them and for them to be able to deliver the best possible service to customers. They, more than anybody, are so excited about this campaign because they feel it represents them, and they want to help customers be successful. This represents the best of them.
bc: What is your long-term strategy for rebuilding the brand beyond this initial campaign?
Moldafsky: We’re sticking with our core values. We know that this was something that occurred in a piece of Wells Fargo and one of our divisions. We serve 70 million customers across our company and are 100 percent committed to serving them as well as possible. The notion of “Better” for our customers is very core to our values. Whether it’s that specific articulation may change but who we are as an institution will not change.
Because while this is going on, our employees are at work focusing on making a better Wells Fargo for customers. They wake up every day to make our customers’ lives better. We are doing these things, and it’s all about making our customers’ lives better. It’s innovation with very clear goals at the outset.

Marketing and customer experience are two sides of the same coin: Marketers are responsible for communicating the brand promise, and customer experience professionals are responsible for making sure that the promise is kept.
It’s that synergy between marketing and CX that led us to invite Jamie Moldafsky, CMO at Wells Fargo, to speak at Forrester’s Forum for Customer Experience Professionals in New York on the morning of June 25. As a run-up to our event, Jamie took the time to answer a few questions about why Wells Fargo cares about customer experience and how its approach to CX has evolved over the years.
Enjoy!

Q: When did your company first begin focusing on customer experience? Why?
Treating customers with courtesy and respect has been a core value at Wells Fargo for more than 160 years. Back in 1888, its agents were given the following instructions: “Proper respect must be shown to all — let them be men, women, or children, rich or poor, white or black—it must not be forgotten that the Company is dependent on these same people for its business.”
Much has changed over the years, but the company has not lost it focus on its customers and helping them succeed financially. The latest expression of this commitment began in 2006 as the company embarked on its One Wells Fargo initiative, with its emphasis on improving customer experience by focusing explicitly on opportunities that cut across its 80-plus businesses and multiple distribution channels. The One Wells Fargo initiative provided enterprise-wide leadership, structure, and funding to seize opportunities and solve issues for customers engaging with the company across multiple business lines, including research and measurement, problem resolution, enhanced communications, and collaboration across business units.
We embarked on this recognizing the increasingly complex ways in which customers "experienced" us (our average household customer had five or six financial products with us, cutting across multiple business lines), and aware of the need to be more consistent and integrated in our customer experience approach. We believed that our customers saw us as one company, and we wanted to make sure they experienced us seamlessly as One Wells Fargo.
Q: What, if anything, is different about what you're doing now to improve customer experience versus what you did when you were starting out?
The world is even more complex and changing more rapidly than when we began One Wells Fargo seven years ago. Large scale demographic, technological, and social changes bring with them new challenges and customer expectations, with more channels of commerce, more opportunities for engagement and more customized products/ services per customer. As a result, we have increased our focus on creating a more integrated experience, both in the way we design our products and go to market with them. This requires us to enhance our business disciplines, data and measurement approaches, and technology infrastructures and strengthen our core values surrounding customer experience and delivering a differentiated personal brand experience.
Q: What advice would you give to a company trying to plan their own path to CX maturity?
Various customer experience tools and techniques can be important to consider, but nothing is more important that creating a shared customer experience vision, building that vision into your culture, and demonstrating your commitment to that vision throughout the enterprise. It needs to start with leadership but has to be owned across the organization and, on some level, by every team member. If you want to see how we do that, go to wellsfargo.com and read our company’s Vision and Values. You can find it under the “About Us” tab.

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"
