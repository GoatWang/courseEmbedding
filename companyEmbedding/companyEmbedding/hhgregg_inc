History[edit]




An hhgregg retail store in Florida


In 1955, a small storefront was erected by Henry Harold and Fansy Gregg on the north side of Indianapolis. The new store featured home appliances such as washing machines, clothes dryers, refrigerators, and grills. Shortly thereafter, they began selling televisions and other electronics.

In 1975, Jerry W. Throgmartin began working in his grandfather's store while attending middle school. He eventually worked his way through many positions there over the next 24 years, and in 1999, took over his father's position as Chairman, CEO, and Director of hhgregg Appliances and Electronics.[10]
Dennis L. May succeeded Throgmartin as hhgregg's President and Chief Executive Officer on February 17, 2009, and Throgmartin was named Executive Chairman of the Board.[11] Throgmartin died in January 2012.[12]
Despite market trends that have diminished profit margins on high-tech devices, Throgmartin and May expanded the business to 125 stores in 9 states as of October 2009. Throgmartin said, "We've been fortunate in that the areas of the [overall CE] business that have been strong are the areas in which we excel: high-end large-screen flat-panel TVs and home theater, and higher-end appliances."[10]
On July 8, 2009, the company announced that it planned to open 22 stores in the following year, primarily in Richmond, Virginia, Tampa, Florida, and in Memphis, Tennessee, many of them being in buildings formerly occupied by defunct Circuit City, as part of an aggressive growth strategy to fill the gap created by Circuit City's bankruptcy.[13] In December 2009, construction began on several stores in the central and eastern parts of Pennsylvania, the first in the state. March 2010 brought the openings of the first stores in the Norfolk-Virginia Beach metro area, in converted Circuit City and Linens 'n Things locations. In Spring 2011, the company expanded into the Youngstown, Ohio market with the opening of a store in the Youngstown suburb Boardman.[14] Ten stores opened in July 2011 in South Florida along the east coast from Miami to West Palm Beach.




An hhgregg in Hanover, Maryland; opened in 2010 in a former Circuit City location


In the fall of 2010, hhgregg opened several stores in former Circuit City locations in Maryland and Virginia.[15] Also, in late 2010, hhgregg partnered with The Cellular Connection, a cellular phone wholesaler based out of Indianapolis, to roll out kiosks to sell Verizon Wireless products[citation needed]
In March 2011, hhgregg announced it would open a new location in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, also in the location of a defunct Circuit City.[16] In June 2011, hhgregg expanded into the Pittsburgh market with the opening of four stores in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.[17] On September 15, 2011, 14 new stores opened in the Chicago area as well.[18] In September 2012 hhgregg opened four stores in the St. Louis, Missouri metropolitan area.[19]
In August 2012, hhgregg made its debut in Wisconsin by opening stores in Appleton, Brown Deer, Greenfield, Green Bay, and Racine.[20] In November 2012, it entered Louisiana with stores in the New Orleans metropolitan area and in Baton Rouge.[21][22]
The company's motto was "Gregg's Got It!"
In February 2016, May resigned as CEO, and Robert Riesbeck was named interim CEO.[13] In August 2016, Riesbeck was named the permanent CEO.[2]
Bankruptcy[edit]
On March 6, 2017 hhgregg filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The filing followed the closure of 88 unprofitable locations outside of its core markets.[8] However, after failing to find a buyer after entering Chapter 11, the company announced on April 7, 2017 that it would close all 220 of its locations (the 88 stores previously announced to be closing, plus the other 132 locations) and lay off about 5,000 people, liquidating the company.[9] All stores were closed permanently on May 25, 2017.
Fine Lines[edit]
Fine Lines[23] was a division of hhgregg that was introduced November 1, 2004.[24] Each of its ten stores offered over 18,000 square feet (1,700 m2) of premium lines of appliances.[25] Products and brands vary by location. There were eleven Fine Lines locations.[26]
Stock[edit]
hhgregg had its initial public offering on July 20, 2007, at US$13.72 and is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol HGG.[27]
On February 27, 2017 it was announced that the NYSE suspended trading of HGG in preparation for delisting.[28]
Sponsorships[edit]
On December 17, 2007, hhgregg signed as one of 14 founding corporate partners for the Lucas Oil Stadium, home of the NFL's Indianapolis Colts. hhgregg's deal earned them rights to advertise in the south gate and display many of their large, flat panel televisions.
The south gate is also home to a new 26,000-square-foot (2,400 m2) hhgregg showroom.[29]
In late 2016 to when the company closed, hhgregg sponsored several drivers on the Andretti Autosport team. They sponsored Carlos Muñoz and Marco Andretti. They were slated to become the full time sponsor of Andretti in 2017 and sponsored them at St. Petersburg but when the company closed, the team removed their logos on their cars but remained on the firesuits. When Takuma Sato won the 2017 Indianapolis 500, the company logos were still seen on the left breast of his firesuit though hhgregg closed permanently three days prior to the race.

History[edit]




An hhgregg retail store in Florida


In 1955, a small storefront was erected by Henry Harold and Fansy Gregg on the north side of Indianapolis. The new store featured home appliances such as washing machines, clothes dryers, refrigerators, and grills. Shortly thereafter, they began selling televisions and other electronics.

In 1975, Jerry W. Throgmartin began working in his grandfather's store while attending middle school. He eventually worked his way through many positions there over the next 24 years, and in 1999, took over his father's position as Chairman, CEO, and Director of hhgregg Appliances and Electronics.[10]
Dennis L. May succeeded Throgmartin as hhgregg's President and Chief Executive Officer on February 17, 2009, and Throgmartin was named Executive Chairman of the Board.[11] Throgmartin died in January 2012.[12]
Despite market trends that have diminished profit margins on high-tech devices, Throgmartin and May expanded the business to 125 stores in 9 states as of October 2009. Throgmartin said, "We've been fortunate in that the areas of the [overall CE] business that have been strong are the areas in which we excel: high-end large-screen flat-panel TVs and home theater, and higher-end appliances."[10]
On July 8, 2009, the company announced that it planned to open 22 stores in the following year, primarily in Richmond, Virginia, Tampa, Florida, and in Memphis, Tennessee, many of them being in buildings formerly occupied by defunct Circuit City, as part of an aggressive growth strategy to fill the gap created by Circuit City's bankruptcy.[13] In December 2009, construction began on several stores in the central and eastern parts of Pennsylvania, the first in the state. March 2010 brought the openings of the first stores in the Norfolk-Virginia Beach metro area, in converted Circuit City and Linens 'n Things locations. In Spring 2011, the company expanded into the Youngstown, Ohio market with the opening of a store in the Youngstown suburb Boardman.[14] Ten stores opened in July 2011 in South Florida along the east coast from Miami to West Palm Beach.




An hhgregg in Hanover, Maryland; opened in 2010 in a former Circuit City location


In the fall of 2010, hhgregg opened several stores in former Circuit City locations in Maryland and Virginia.[15] Also, in late 2010, hhgregg partnered with The Cellular Connection, a cellular phone wholesaler based out of Indianapolis, to roll out kiosks to sell Verizon Wireless products[citation needed]
In March 2011, hhgregg announced it would open a new location in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, also in the location of a defunct Circuit City.[16] In June 2011, hhgregg expanded into the Pittsburgh market with the opening of four stores in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.[17] On September 15, 2011, 14 new stores opened in the Chicago area as well.[18] In September 2012 hhgregg opened four stores in the St. Louis, Missouri metropolitan area.[19]
In August 2012, hhgregg made its debut in Wisconsin by opening stores in Appleton, Brown Deer, Greenfield, Green Bay, and Racine.[20] In November 2012, it entered Louisiana with stores in the New Orleans metropolitan area and in Baton Rouge.[21][22]
The company's motto was "Gregg's Got It!"
In February 2016, May resigned as CEO, and Robert Riesbeck was named interim CEO.[13] In August 2016, Riesbeck was named the permanent CEO.[2]
Bankruptcy[edit]
On March 6, 2017 hhgregg filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The filing followed the closure of 88 unprofitable locations outside of its core markets.[8] However, after failing to find a buyer after entering Chapter 11, the company announced on April 7, 2017 that it would close all 220 of its locations (the 88 stores previously announced to be closing, plus the other 132 locations) and lay off about 5,000 people, liquidating the company.[9] All stores were closed permanently on May 25, 2017.
Fine Lines[edit]
Fine Lines[23] was a division of hhgregg that was introduced November 1, 2004.[24] Each of its ten stores offered over 18,000 square feet (1,700 m2) of premium lines of appliances.[25] Products and brands vary by location. There were eleven Fine Lines locations.[26]
Stock[edit]
hhgregg had its initial public offering on July 20, 2007, at US$13.72 and is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol HGG.[27]
On February 27, 2017 it was announced that the NYSE suspended trading of HGG in preparation for delisting.[28]
Sponsorships[edit]
On December 17, 2007, hhgregg signed as one of 14 founding corporate partners for the Lucas Oil Stadium, home of the NFL's Indianapolis Colts. hhgregg's deal earned them rights to advertise in the south gate and display many of their large, flat panel televisions.
The south gate is also home to a new 26,000-square-foot (2,400 m2) hhgregg showroom.[29]
In late 2016 to when the company closed, hhgregg sponsored several drivers on the Andretti Autosport team. They sponsored Carlos Muñoz and Marco Andretti. They were slated to become the full time sponsor of Andretti in 2017 and sponsored them at St. Petersburg but when the company closed, the team removed their logos on their cars but remained on the firesuits. When Takuma Sato won the 2017 Indianapolis 500, the company logos were still seen on the left breast of his firesuit though hhgregg closed permanently three days prior to the race.

History[edit]




An hhgregg retail store in Florida


In 1955, a small storefront was erected by Henry Harold and Fansy Gregg on the north side of Indianapolis. The new store featured home appliances such as washing machines, clothes dryers, refrigerators, and grills. Shortly thereafter, they began selling televisions and other electronics.

In 1975, Jerry W. Throgmartin began working in his grandfather's store while attending middle school. He eventually worked his way through many positions there over the next 24 years, and in 1999, took over his father's position as Chairman, CEO, and Director of hhgregg Appliances and Electronics.[10]
Dennis L. May succeeded Throgmartin as hhgregg's President and Chief Executive Officer on February 17, 2009, and Throgmartin was named Executive Chairman of the Board.[11] Throgmartin died in January 2012.[12]
Despite market trends that have diminished profit margins on high-tech devices, Throgmartin and May expanded the business to 125 stores in 9 states as of October 2009. Throgmartin said, "We've been fortunate in that the areas of the [overall CE] business that have been strong are the areas in which we excel: high-end large-screen flat-panel TVs and home theater, and higher-end appliances."[10]
On July 8, 2009, the company announced that it planned to open 22 stores in the following year, primarily in Richmond, Virginia, Tampa, Florida, and in Memphis, Tennessee, many of them being in buildings formerly occupied by defunct Circuit City, as part of an aggressive growth strategy to fill the gap created by Circuit City's bankruptcy.[13] In December 2009, construction began on several stores in the central and eastern parts of Pennsylvania, the first in the state. March 2010 brought the openings of the first stores in the Norfolk-Virginia Beach metro area, in converted Circuit City and Linens 'n Things locations. In Spring 2011, the company expanded into the Youngstown, Ohio market with the opening of a store in the Youngstown suburb Boardman.[14] Ten stores opened in July 2011 in South Florida along the east coast from Miami to West Palm Beach.




An hhgregg in Hanover, Maryland; opened in 2010 in a former Circuit City location


In the fall of 2010, hhgregg opened several stores in former Circuit City locations in Maryland and Virginia.[15] Also, in late 2010, hhgregg partnered with The Cellular Connection, a cellular phone wholesaler based out of Indianapolis, to roll out kiosks to sell Verizon Wireless products[citation needed]
In March 2011, hhgregg announced it would open a new location in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, also in the location of a defunct Circuit City.[16] In June 2011, hhgregg expanded into the Pittsburgh market with the opening of four stores in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.[17] On September 15, 2011, 14 new stores opened in the Chicago area as well.[18] In September 2012 hhgregg opened four stores in the St. Louis, Missouri metropolitan area.[19]
In August 2012, hhgregg made its debut in Wisconsin by opening stores in Appleton, Brown Deer, Greenfield, Green Bay, and Racine.[20] In November 2012, it entered Louisiana with stores in the New Orleans metropolitan area and in Baton Rouge.[21][22]
The company's motto was "Gregg's Got It!"
In February 2016, May resigned as CEO, and Robert Riesbeck was named interim CEO.[13] In August 2016, Riesbeck was named the permanent CEO.[2]
Bankruptcy[edit]
On March 6, 2017 hhgregg filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The filing followed the closure of 88 unprofitable locations outside of its core markets.[8] However, after failing to find a buyer after entering Chapter 11, the company announced on April 7, 2017 that it would close all 220 of its locations (the 88 stores previously announced to be closing, plus the other 132 locations) and lay off about 5,000 people, liquidating the company.[9] All stores were closed permanently on May 25, 2017.
Fine Lines[edit]
Fine Lines[23] was a division of hhgregg that was introduced November 1, 2004.[24] Each of its ten stores offered over 18,000 square feet (1,700 m2) of premium lines of appliances.[25] Products and brands vary by location. There were eleven Fine Lines locations.[26]
Stock[edit]
hhgregg had its initial public offering on July 20, 2007, at US$13.72 and is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol HGG.[27]
On February 27, 2017 it was announced that the NYSE suspended trading of HGG in preparation for delisting.[28]
Sponsorships[edit]
On December 17, 2007, hhgregg signed as one of 14 founding corporate partners for the Lucas Oil Stadium, home of the NFL's Indianapolis Colts. hhgregg's deal earned them rights to advertise in the south gate and display many of their large, flat panel televisions.
The south gate is also home to a new 26,000-square-foot (2,400 m2) hhgregg showroom.[29]
In late 2016 to when the company closed, hhgregg sponsored several drivers on the Andretti Autosport team. They sponsored Carlos Muñoz and Marco Andretti. They were slated to become the full time sponsor of Andretti in 2017 and sponsored them at St. Petersburg but when the company closed, the team removed their logos on their cars but remained on the firesuits. When Takuma Sato won the 2017 Indianapolis 500, the company logos were still seen on the left breast of his firesuit though hhgregg closed permanently three days prior to the race.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)

Founded in Princeton, Indiana in 1955, hhgregg was headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana.

History[edit]




An hhgregg retail store in Florida


In 1955, a small storefront was erected by Henry Harold and Fansy Gregg on the north side of Indianapolis. The new store featured home appliances such as washing machines, clothes dryers, refrigerators, and grills. Shortly thereafter, they began selling televisions and other electronics.

In 1975, Jerry W. Throgmartin began working in his grandfather's store while attending middle school. He eventually worked his way through many positions there over the next 24 years, and in 1999, took over his father's position as Chairman, CEO, and Director of hhgregg Appliances and Electronics.[10]
Dennis L. May succeeded Throgmartin as hhgregg's President and Chief Executive Officer on February 17, 2009, and Throgmartin was named Executive Chairman of the Board.[11] Throgmartin died in January 2012.[12]
Despite market trends that have diminished profit margins on high-tech devices, Throgmartin and May expanded the business to 125 stores in 9 states as of October 2009. Throgmartin said, "We've been fortunate in that the areas of the [overall CE] business that have been strong are the areas in which we excel: high-end large-screen flat-panel TVs and home theater, and higher-end appliances."[10]
On July 8, 2009, the company announced that it planned to open 22 stores in the following year, primarily in Richmond, Virginia, Tampa, Florida, and in Memphis, Tennessee, many of them being in buildings formerly occupied by defunct Circuit City, as part of an aggressive growth strategy to fill the gap created by Circuit City's bankruptcy.[13] In December 2009, construction began on several stores in the central and eastern parts of Pennsylvania, the first in the state. March 2010 brought the openings of the first stores in the Norfolk-Virginia Beach metro area, in converted Circuit City and Linens 'n Things locations. In Spring 2011, the company expanded into the Youngstown, Ohio market with the opening of a store in the Youngstown suburb Boardman.[14] Ten stores opened in July 2011 in South Florida along the east coast from Miami to West Palm Beach.




An hhgregg in Hanover, Maryland; opened in 2010 in a former Circuit City location


In the fall of 2010, hhgregg opened several stores in former Circuit City locations in Maryland and Virginia.[15] Also, in late 2010, hhgregg partnered with The Cellular Connection, a cellular phone wholesaler based out of Indianapolis, to roll out kiosks to sell Verizon Wireless products[citation needed]
In March 2011, hhgregg announced it would open a new location in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, also in the location of a defunct Circuit City.[16] In June 2011, hhgregg expanded into the Pittsburgh market with the opening of four stores in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.[17] On September 15, 2011, 14 new stores opened in the Chicago area as well.[18] In September 2012 hhgregg opened four stores in the St. Louis, Missouri metropolitan area.[19]
In August 2012, hhgregg made its debut in Wisconsin by opening stores in Appleton, Brown Deer, Greenfield, Green Bay, and Racine.[20] In November 2012, it entered Louisiana with stores in the New Orleans metropolitan area and in Baton Rouge.[21][22]
The company's motto was "Gregg's Got It!"
In February 2016, May resigned as CEO, and Robert Riesbeck was named interim CEO.[13] In August 2016, Riesbeck was named the permanent CEO.[2]
Bankruptcy[edit]
On March 6, 2017 hhgregg filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The filing followed the closure of 88 unprofitable locations outside of its core markets.[8] However, after failing to find a buyer after entering Chapter 11, the company announced on April 7, 2017 that it would close all 220 of its locations (the 88 stores previously announced to be closing, plus the other 132 locations) and lay off about 5,000 people, liquidating the company.[9] All stores were closed permanently on May 25, 2017.
Fine Lines[edit]
Fine Lines[23] was a division of hhgregg that was introduced November 1, 2004.[24] Each of its ten stores offered over 18,000 square feet (1,700 m2) of premium lines of appliances.[25] Products and brands vary by location. There were eleven Fine Lines locations.[26]
Stock[edit]
hhgregg had its initial public offering on July 20, 2007, at US$13.72 and is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol HGG.[27]
On February 27, 2017 it was announced that the NYSE suspended trading of HGG in preparation for delisting.[28]
Sponsorships[edit]
On December 17, 2007, hhgregg signed as one of 14 founding corporate partners for the Lucas Oil Stadium, home of the NFL's Indianapolis Colts. hhgregg's deal earned them rights to advertise in the south gate and display many of their large, flat panel televisions.
The south gate is also home to a new 26,000-square-foot (2,400 m2) hhgregg showroom.[29]
In late 2016 to when the company closed, hhgregg sponsored several drivers on the Andretti Autosport team. They sponsored Carlos Muñoz and Marco Andretti. They were slated to become the full time sponsor of Andretti in 2017 and sponsored them at St. Petersburg but when the company closed, the team removed their logos on their cars but remained on the firesuits. When Takuma Sato won the 2017 Indianapolis 500, the company logos were still seen on the left breast of his firesuit though hhgregg closed permanently three days prior to the race.

262 Reviews For Hhgregg, Inc Headquarters & Corporate Office

Lousy product, warranty and service 

Purchased LG top of line frig.  Within 3 mos have had two service calls.  Now fridge temp is 68 degrees.  Called for service and was told they would provide a list of people to call for service, they refused to call for warranty service.  Called store mgr who was busy and would call back.  That was Tues am, it is now Thurs.  on Wed. Called store to learn mgr was off Wednesday, and an assistant took info n would chk and call me back.  Meanwhile, throwing out food for the third time in three months.  Also, the water filter cracked (I suspect it froze) and dumped water in unit and damaged our hardwood floor.
Would recommend avoiding HHGregg and LG refrigerators. Maintenance friens says cracked filter was because it was plastic and poorly located.  Damage from that caused additional problems, and may well have ruined circuit board.

Poor customer service 

I walked into hhgregg and there are several salesman standing on the showroom floor, not with customers, they stare at you and wait for you to come up to them. That is not my idea of a good salesman. I was offered a service plan which I respectfully declined. After about the fifth time he offered me the service plan, he had a passive aggressive attitude with me. This is very frustrating and the salesman at hhgregg should probably go through training to learn how to work better with people. I will not shop here again. The hhgregg on north side of Indianapolis, in. 96th street location.

POOR SERVICE 

Received the worst service ever from the Chesapeake, VA Location. Staff was very unprofessional and very inconsiderate of those who were waiting for assistance. Six or seven employees gathered around the desk not asstisting or helping customers. Never looked to see who was in store.   This went on for sometime, so that customers began to leave (very upset)!

Buyer Beware-Selling Items as new, when they have sold previously 

I purchased an ipad I thought was new, after trying to get tech support, I was told that the ipad I bought had been sold previously, I confronted the Manager of the store and he told me they donot have to tell you that it had been sold, only that the box had been opened. I paid for a new ipad & got one that had been out of the store for a week & returned.

Horrible customer service 

We spent time and effort and worked with H&HGregg to find the most convenient delivery time for a dishwasher.  We waited for a full week to have deliver.  On day of deliver, HHGregg called to reschedule delivery.  Horrible customer service experience.  Will never buy anything from HHGregg.  Beware the company.  They have no idea about customer service.

Washer and dryer 

Thought we were buying a floor model and found out they were used. The saleman lied to us. Poor bussiness. You cannot trust these people. Reported this issue and never got a response. We will take our bussiness elsewhere.

I had multiple issues with my purchase at HH Gregg. Once HH Gregg had my money, they didn't care about anything else and wouldn't help me resolve any of my problems. Never again!

Golf Umbrella 

I sent in a complaint about Golf Umbrellas the other day when I went into the store at Wolf Chase Memphis Tn about the Golf Umbrella, I had a coupon valid March 7-16. I did not see any on display, so I went to the associate in the middle of the store where all the cashier were located and ask about the Umbrellas and showed her the coupon. She started laughing and as she walked away she said they never got any in the store, or plan on getting any in. 
 I complained to corporate and got a email from  Kathleen telling me that she would pass that on to Management and  hold off doing anything nothing else.
I explained this is a plain False advertisement.

Worst customer service experience ever!!! 

My wife and I brought a 65 inch samsung smart / 3D television from HH Gregg.  We were told in store that it would be delivered on the following Wednesday evening.  We were also told that we would receive a phone the night before notifying us on what time the tv would be delivered.   We never received the phone call.   We had to reschedule the deilvery twice because neither my wife or I could rearrance our schedules to meet with HH Gregg at their convenient time.

When the tv was delivered, the delivery men plugged the tv in and hooked the hdmi cable into it, but never explained how to use any of the functions.  The last comment the men said before leaving the house was, "you will receive a phone call in a few minutes to rate our service.  PLease give us 5's."   I did not give them 5's.   

The following Monday, I receive a phone call from someone asking why I gave such low rating.  I explained why, and he said he would have someone come to our house to explain the tv on Wednesday night.  No one ever showed up.   Then I get an accusing phone call on thursday saying, "I called and left a message, but you never called me back."   I did not receive any messages on Wedanesay.   Knowing that technology is not always 100% reliable, I called HH Gregg back.   They stated that we could have someone come to our and explain the tv, but we would have to work our schedule around HH Gregg's, again.  This is not possible, both me and my wife are very busy.

This has got to be the worst delivery, customer service I  have every dealt with.   Especially when they lie to your face in the store.

We will never do business with HH Gregg again.  We will also spread the word to all those interested in buying a new appliance/tv/ or other items to stay away from HH Gregg.

I am not done reporting this either.   I am going to take this to the BBB and Angies List giving both of them bad reviews of this store.

worst customer service 

I purchased a refrigerator from HHGreg in Boca Raton Fl. I had a few issues with the item. When I call the store to speak to the manager, the employees follow a pre-written script and sound
like robotics. They don't seem to care about customer service along with the manager. They will never  answer the phone and they tell the employee to take the name and phone number and never get back to me. I have never had issues with Home Depot , Sears etc.

Service 

The worst customer service I have ever seen. Just trying to speak to anyone regarding a problem with their rebate center was a joke. You can not get through to them at all!!!!!!!

Worst Customer Service 

I bought a Samsung frig/freezer.  It arrived with dents in the lower door.  That was September of last year, they have yet to get me a new door and it is now the middle of February.  This is the worst company for customer service.  I agee with the other posters, go somewhere else and save yourself the aggravation.

This is the worst store in the world to deal with. Once you take a purchase in for repair you have two wait a month before anyone knows anything. They have no problem getting the money off your card but take a purchase in for repair its like pulling teeth.

tv and custmer 

I bought HHgregg in Eastgate Ohio. Just a few days from Christmas 2012. The 55inch LG SMART TV is going out. So I called the store I bought it from and was told the wont fix it. It has not even been 2 months yet. So I ask to talk to the manger. And guess what happened he said there not fixing it. I said " I will call the BBB" he said don't threaten me and to my supprise he hanged up on me. I have spent on two TV about 1,900 cash. And that's how they treat there customers. I would not want anybody to shop there. That is so wrong. I will be calling BBB. If this is not fixed. Time 645pm Tuesday 12,2013

The worst ever!!!  Run, run, run! 

This is the worst company I have ever purchased anything from!  I will never buy from them again.  The refrigerator did not work and I went from Saturday to Tuesday without one!!  Nice for all the stuff I lost.  Then when they brought the new refrigerator they could not be within thier own delivery window, nice!  You pick the day and time and you can't meet it.  The customer service was the worste.  Do yourself a favor and run from this store even if you have to pay a little more.

Horrible Delivery, never buy at hhgreg 

I was very happy in getting a new refrigerator and microwave for my home. At the 11810 Pines Blvd store in Pembroke Pines, Fl 33026
But I had to return the product value of $1,759.53 and no one CARE. THE WORST DELIVERY SERVICE EVER.
Because, the delivery people were unprofessional and didn’t care or had any customer service skills.
The refrigerator was a bit big to fit, over the door, but they didn’t even try to just leave the refrigerator at my home and then I would have a way to lift it up and accommodate it myself.  They just didn’t even try to do that. Their attitude was they were an outsource company and didn’t care about the sales and they were only at my home for probably 3 minutes didn’t make any effort  to find a solution or a suggestion. For this reason and this EXTREMELY BAD SERVICE. I returned all the product, and I will never do any business with hhgregg and it is obvious they DON’T CARE.

History[edit]




An hhgregg retail store in Florida


In 1955, a small storefront was erected by Henry Harold and Fansy Gregg on the north side of Indianapolis. The new store featured home appliances such as washing machines, clothes dryers, refrigerators, and grills. Shortly thereafter, they began selling televisions and other electronics.




Map of hhgregg stores in the U.S. in August 2011.


In 1975, Jerry W. Throgmartin began working in his grandfather's store while attending middle school. He eventually worked his way through many positions there over the next 24 years, and in 1999, took over his father's position as Chairman, CEO, and Director of hhgregg Appliances and Electronics.[10]
Dennis L. May succeeded Throgmartin as hhgregg's President and Chief Executive Officer on February 17, 2009, and Throgmartin was named Executive Chairman of the Board.[11] Throgmartin died in January 2012.[12]
Despite market trends that have diminished profit margins on high-tech devices, Throgmartin and May expanded the business to 125 stores in 9 states as of October 2009. Throgmartin said, "We've been fortunate in that the areas of the [overall CE] business that have been strong are the areas in which we excel: high-end large-screen flat-panel TVs and home theater, and higher-end appliances."[10]
On July 8, 2009, the company announced that it planned to open 22 stores in the following year, primarily in Richmond, Virginia, Tampa, Florida, and in Memphis, Tennessee, many of them being in buildings formerly occupied by defunct Circuit City, as part of an aggressive growth strategy to fill the gap created by Circuit City's bankruptcy.[13] In December 2009, construction began on several stores in the central and eastern parts of Pennsylvania, the first in the state. March 2010 brought the openings of the first stores in the Norfolk-Virginia Beach metro area, in converted Circuit City and Linens 'n Things locations. In Spring 2011, the company expanded into the Youngstown, Ohio market with the opening of a store in the Youngstown suburb Boardman.[14] Ten stores opened in July 2011 in South Florida along the east coast from Miami to West Palm Beach.




An hhgregg in Hanover, Maryland; opened in 2010 in a former Circuit City location


In the fall of 2010, hhgregg opened several stores in former Circuit City locations in Maryland and Virginia.[15] Also, in late 2010, hhgregg partnered with The Cellular Connection, a cellular phone wholesaler based out of Indianapolis, to roll out kiosks to sell Verizon Wireless products[citation needed]
In March 2011, hhgregg announced it would open a new location in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, also in the location of a defunct Circuit City.[16] In June 2011, hhgregg expanded into the Pittsburgh market with the opening of four stores in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.[17] On September 15, 2011, 14 new stores opened in the Chicago area as well.[18] In September 2012 hhgregg opened four stores in the St. Louis, Missouri metropolitan area.[19]
In August 2012, hhgregg made its debut in Wisconsin by opening stores in Appleton, Brown Deer, Greenfield, Green Bay, and Racine.[20] In November 2012, it entered Louisiana with stores in the New Orleans metropolitan area and in Baton Rouge.[21][22]
The company's motto was "Gregg's Got It!"
In February 2016, May resigned as CEO, and Robert Riesbeck was named interim CEO.[13] In August 2016, Riesbeck was named the permanent CEO.[2]
Bankruptcy[edit]
On March 6, 2017 hhgregg filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The filing followed the closure of 88 unprofitable locations outside of its core markets.[8] However, after failing to find a buyer after entering Chapter 11, the company announced on April 7, 2017 that it would close all 220 of its locations (the 88 stores previously announced to be closing, plus the other 132 locations) and lay off about 5,000 people, liquidating the company.[9] All stores were closed permanently on May 25, 2017.
Fine Lines[edit]
Fine Lines[23] was a division of hhgregg that was introduced November 1, 2004.[24] Each of its ten stores offered over 18,000 square feet (1,700 m2) of premium lines of appliances.[25] Products and brands vary by location. There were eleven Fine Lines locations.[26]
Stock[edit]
hhgregg had its initial public offering on July 20, 2007, at US$13.72 and is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol HGG.[27]
On February 27, 2017 it was announced that the NYSE suspended trading of HGG in preparation for delisting.[28]
Sponsorships[edit]
On December 17, 2007, hhgregg signed as one of 14 founding corporate partners for the Lucas Oil Stadium, home of the NFL's Indianapolis Colts. hhgregg's deal earned them rights to advertise in the south gate and display many of their large, flat panel televisions.
The south gate is also home to a new 26,000-square-foot (2,400 m2) hhgregg showroom.[29]
In late 2016 to when the company closed, hhgregg sponsored several drivers on the Andretti Autosport team. They sponsored Carlos Muñoz and Marco Andretti. They were slated to become the full time sponsor of Andretti in 2017 and sponsored them at St. Petersburg but when the company closed, the team removed their logos on their cars but remained on the firesuits. When Takuma Sato won the 2017 Indianapolis 500, the company logos were still seen on the left breast of his firesuit though hhgregg closed permanently three days prior to the race.

About HHGREGG, INC.

Retailer hhgregg sells a range of electronics and appliances in
nearly 220 stores in 20 US states and online. It offers TV and
video products (LED TVs, Blu-ray disc players), home and car audio
gear (CD players, home theater systems), appliances (refrigerators,
washers and dryers), computers, gaming consoles, digital cameras,
GPS navigators, and mattresses. The company also offers
installation and tech services. Founded in 1955, Indianapolis-based
hhgregg had expanded from southern states to the Midwest and
mid-Atlantic regions. In early 2017 the company filed for Chapter
11 bankruptcy protection and was forced to liquidate its assets
after failing to secure a buyer. It ceased operations in May
2017.
Bankruptcy
In April 2017, after failing to find a buyer, hhgregg was forced
to liquidate its assets. The company closed all 220 of its stores
and ceased operations in May 2017. In its Chapter 11 filing, the
retailer listed assets and liabilities of up to $50,000. Affiliate
Gregg Appliances listed assets and liabilities from $100 million to
$500 million in a separate filing. At the time of its bankruptcy
filing, the company had been in business for 62 years.
Operations
Home appliances represent more than half of sales with consumer
electronics generating more than a third. The size of hhgregg
stores average around 31,000 sq. ft. By comparison, Best Buy stores
average about 41,000 sq. ft.
Geographic Reach
hhgregg operates stores in Alabama, Delaware, Florida, Georgia,
Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi,
Missouri, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South
Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.
Florida, with 36 stores, is the retailer's largest market, followed
by Ohio with 28 and Illinois and Pennsylvania with 19 each. The
company can reach customers around the country through its
website.
Financial Performance
The hhgregg's revenue has dropped since 2013 and in 2016 (ended
March) it fell below the $2 billion mark, landing at $1.9 billion.
Revenue was 8% lower than in 2015. The company had lower same-store
sales in 2016 as sales of consumer electronics decreased. It sold
fewer units of TVs although many of them had bigger screen sizes
and more features than previous years.
The retailer reduced its loss to about $55 million in 2016 from
about $133 million in 2015 by cutting selling, general and
administrative costs, which included lower labor costs. The company
also saved by increasing routing efficiency for deliveries and
lower fuel prices.
Cash outflow reached $21.8 million in 2016, compared to cash
flow from operations of about $13 million in 2015.
Strategy
hhgregg is giving its customers more opportunities to buy from
it through a multi-channel strategy it calls Store2Door service.
Customers can buy in store or online and pick up the item in a
store or have it delivered. The company has expanded its
online-only product line and added mobile phone apps, and an online
financing application process. It has invested in upgrading its IT
infrastructure.
To enhance its selection of appliances, hhgregg has rolled out
Fine Lines departments in a number of its stores. Fine Lines
display ultra-premium appliance brands(Sub-Zero, Bosch, and Asko,
for example) that aren't sold in hhgregg stores. It had Fine Lines
in 11 stores at the end of its 2016 year and planned to open more
than a dozen in 2017.
The company reworked the layout of 25 stores in 2016 to better
display its wares in a more visually appealing manner as well as to
show product functionality. Furniture and appliance displays were
placed in prominent spots in the front of stores. hhgregg planned
to redesing as many as 100 stores before the holiday selling
season.
