Important Information
 
  Uniplan Investment Counsel is a boutique investment firm, with roots dating back to 1984, that manages a variety of portfolios primarily for US clients. 
The REIT composite was created January 1, 1989. The Micro Cap composite was created August 1, 1999. The HITR K1 composite was created January 1, 2001. The HITR Non-K1 composite was created March 1, 2005. Performance is calculated in US dollars utilizing a time-weighted total rate of return. Total return for the composite is represented by the asset-weighted returns of the portfolios within the composite. Trade-date valuation is used. 
Performance is net of all transaction costs and net performance is net of transaction costs and (maximum allowable total) investment management fee, but before any custodial fees (that may be incurred separately by the client).
 The benchmark for the REIT composite is the FTSE NAREIT All Equity REITs Index that represents the tax-qualified REITs listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ National Market System. The index is adjusted to reflect the reinvestment of dividends. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. The benchmark for the Micro Cap composite is the Wilshire US Micro Cap Index that represents a float-adjusted, market capitalization-weighted portfolio of all stocks below the 2,500th rank by market capitalization in the Wilshire 5000 at March 31 and September 30 of each year. The index is used to measure small stocks and is adjusted to reflect the reinvestment of dividends, when applicable. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. The index figures do not reflect any deduction for fees, expenses or taxes. The benchmark for the HITR K1 and HITR Non-K1 composite is the Russell 1000 Index that measures the performance of the 1,000 largest companies in the Russell 3000 Index. The Russell 3000 Index represents approximately 98% of the investable US equity market. The index is adjusted to reflect reinvestment of dividends. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. The index figures do not reflect any deductions for fees, expenses or taxes. 
The composite does not have a minimum size criterion for composite membership. All fee-paying discretionary accounts with similar investment objectives are included. Leverage is not used in these composites as a means to generate higher returns. There is one non-fee paying portfolio in the composite. 
There have been no changes in the personnel responsible for the management of this composite. 
The composite contains both traditional and wrap fee portfolios. Uniplan has a flexible and negotiable fee schedule reflecting the differences in size, composition and servicing needs of clients’ accounts. A complete description of investment advisory fees is contained in Uniplan’s Form ADV and is available upon request. 
 Individual account performance may vary from the results shown because of differences in inception date, restrictions and other factors. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. 
Uniplan Investment Counsel does not claim GIPS compliance. A complete description of investment advisory fees is contained in Uniplan’s Form ADV and is available upon request. Individual account performance may vary from the results shown because of differences in inception date, restrictions and other factors.
Investors should understand that micro cap stocks are subject to a higher degree of risk than other equity investments due to the small size of the companies and the limited trading volume inherent in micro cap stocks.
Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment involves a risk of loss.
