Since Iordanou became CEO in November 2009 (he had already been at the company for years before that), Arch Capital’s stock has enjoyed a premium 230% rise (vs. 100% for the S&P 500 during the period.) Iordanou has expanded and diversified the portfolio of this Bermuda-based insurer and re-insurer, adding lines such as private mortgage insurance. He’s not done yet: Iordanou has told reporters that the company is always “looking for other avenues to grow,” citing areas such as reinsurance for mortality-only life insurance. Iordanou knows a little about risk first-hand: The son of a police officer in Cyprus, according to Risk & Insurance, he came to the U.S. on his own by ship and worked his way through New York University, then learned the insurance ropes at AIG and then Berkshire Hathaway.

What are analysts saying about Arch Capital Group stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Arch Capital Group stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Shares of Arch Capital have underperformed the Zacks categorized Property and Casualty industry quarter to date. The company witnessed its 2017 estimates moving south over the last 30 days. Exposure to catastrophe losses poses an inherent risk to the P&C business, inducing volatility in underwriting results. Also, a still low interest rate environment and intense competition raise concerns for the company. Nonetheless, with a strong product portfolio, Arch Capital has been maintaining an exemplary track record of premium growth. This apart, the company has been making efforts to diversify its Mortgage Insurance business through strategic acquisitions. Moreover, the insurer remains focused in boosting shareholders’ value through share buybacks and dividend payments. Such effective capital deployment makes the stock an attractive pick for yield-seeking investors." (6/27/2017)
2. Wells Fargo & Company analysts commented, "We await more details from the company to determine whether this will potentially lead to additional reserve charges across the industry." (6/7/2017)
3. BMO Capital Markets analysts commented, "We are incorporating a $4 embedded value into our ACGL valuation stemming from the future earn-out of already written mortgage insurance business. In addition, we expect the incorporation of the UGC book to lower the overall earnings volatility of Arch as a majority of earnings over the next 12-24 months will come from already written mortgage insurance. While Arch was never known for volatility, the reduced PMLs and mortgage insurance earn-out should stabilize it even further, justifying an increased valuation." (2/28/2017)
4. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (The) analysts commented, "management is willing to ramp up its sub-scale mortgage operations faster than previously expected" with the acquisition of American International Group Inc (NYSE: AIG)'s United Guaranty operations.The brokerage noted that the acquisition shows the willingness of the company to deploy significant capital to scale its mortgage insurance business faster than it could do so organically."Our analysis implies that Arch could see approximately 10–50 percent of EPS accretion, which could increase Arch ROEs by approximately 50bps to 300bps, all else being equal," analyst Michael Nannizzi wrote in a note.The brokerage said the shift to mortgage "would provide the company with an additional earnings lever not available to pure P&C peers." Also, the company appears to be more willing to bypass organic growth via the usage of M&A.Related Link: Stocks Affected By Hurricane Season"Given market conditions and returns in MI are much more attractive than P&C more broadly, on a pro-forma basis a potentially scaled up MI platform could have a significant impact on earnings," Nannizzi highlighted.Nannizzi also raised his price target to $79 from $66, equivalent to 1.4x 2Q17E book value (from 1.1x previously)."[W]e believe the company should garner a higher multiple as it continues to shift its business profile away from reinsurance and into mortgage insurance," (9/7/2016)

Constantine “Dino” Iordanou, 63, is president, CEO and Chairman of the Board of Arch Capital Group, Ltd, a Bermuda-based insurance/reinsurance global giant.
The CEO’s journey began in Cyprus. He arrived in the U.S. and worked his way through New York University, earning a B.S. in aerospace engineering before entering the insurance industry in a trainee role at American International Group (AIG).
Iordanou told the publication Risk & Insurance in 1999 that it was when AIG chairman Hank Greenberg noticed him in 1980 that he was promoted. In 1987 he moved onto Berkshire Hathaway, where he worked up to heading their commercial casualty operations. From March 1992 through December 2001, Mr. Iordanou served in various capacities for Zurich Financial Services and its affiliates, including as senior executive vice president of group operations and business development of Zurich Financial Services, president of Zurich American Specialties Division, chief operating officer and chief executive officer of Zurich American and chief executive officer of Zurich North America.
He joined Bermuda-based Arch (NASDAQ: ACGL) in December 2001 as its president and member of its Board of Directors. In 2003, Iordanou was appointed president and CEO of Arch Capital Group, Ltd. In November 2008, he was also appointed to the post of Chairman of the Board.
Rated one of Forbes’ Global 2000 Leading Companies in 2013, Arch had $5.84 billion in capital at the end of 2013, with stocks valued at about $56 in March 2014.
Arch writes insurance and reinsurance on worldwide basis through operations in Bermuda, the US Europe and Canada. Its subsidiaries offer full range of property and casualty insurance and reinsurance products globally, with a focus on specialty lines of business. Some 34% of its work is in casualty and professional liability, about 33% for property/energy/marine and aviation. Arch Capital Group Ltd. recently completed acquisition of CMG Mortgage Insurance Company from CUNA Mutual Group and PMI Mortgage Insurance Co.
Iordanou, who is based in Glen Head, N.Y., has considerable stocks in the company and his compensation for 2012 was $10.4 million.
He is also a director at Verisk Analytics, Inc. of Jersey City, N.J., the American Insurance Association (AIA) and the Association of Bermuda Insurers and Reinsurers (ABIR).
He is a founding member and lifetime trustee of the Pancyprian Association of America, established in 1975. He also is a founding member of Faith: An Endowment for Orthodoxy and Hellenism.

"Truthfinder is a very accurate updated system. Their information is proper. And can be very helpful too." -Juan M.









Notice
This site contains REAL police records (court records of driving citations, speeding tickets, felonies, misdemeanors, sexual offenses, mugshots, etc.), background reports, photos, court documents, address information, phone numbers, and much more. Please BE CAREFUL when conducting a search and ensure all the information you enter is accurate.
Learning the truth about the history of your family and friends can be shocking, so please be cautious when using this tool.
TruthFinder does not provide consumer reports and is not a consumer reporting agency. We provide a lot of sensitive information that can be used to satisfy your curiosity, protect your family, and find the truth about the people in your life. You may not use our service or the information it provides to make decisions about consumer credit, employers, insurance, tenant screening, or any other purposes that would require FCRA compliance.
