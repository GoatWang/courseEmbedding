Warranty Information

	            Product Quality Guarantee, Limited Lifetime Warranty
Except for products with their own warranties, Hu-Friedy instruments have a lifetime warranty against defects in materials and workmanship, and Hu-Friedy will, at its option, repair or replace any product that fails as a result of any such defect. Hu-Friedy guarantees against breakage, joint failure, and corrosion under normal use. Instruments that show expected wear under ordinary use are not considered to be defective. Instrument "lifetime" means the ordinary expected life, which varies by type of instrument. Please call Hu-Friedy Technical Services at 1-888-TEC-TECH (1-888-832-8324) with questions about the expected life of any specific instrument type. Modifying or retipping an instrument or failure to provide proper instrument care, including proper cleaning and maintenance, may void this warranty. Sharpening and repairing minor tip damage are considered routine maintenance with normal use, and are not covered by warranty.

How the best perform

Hu-Friedy listens to you—the dental practitioner—and creates products that are easier to use, more efficient, and put less stress on you and your patients so that you can provide the best clinical care. 
Through this product philosophy, we have made quality our trademark and we seek to earn that distinction again and again, every day we go to work.
The high level of craftsmanship that goes into each step of the creation of our dental instruments is evident every time you use them. Our staff completes 80% of the manufacturing process by hand—they meticulously mold, treat, and sharpen instruments to perfection, which is why we call them artisans. Our proprietary processes and best-in-class materials match their precision and the three work together flawlessly. 
When you use a Hu-Friedy dental instrument, you might not know all of the steps that go into creating each one … but you’ll certainly feel it.
*Some of the devices advertised may not be licensed for sale in accordance with Canadian Law.

China’s Volatile Growth



MILAN – Uncertainty about China’s economic prospects is roiling global markets – not least because so many questions are so difficult to answer. In fact, China’s trajectory has become almost impossible to anticipate, owing to the confusing – if not conflicting – signals being sent by policymakers.In the real economy, the export-driven tradable sector is contracting, owing to weak foreign demand. Faced with slow growth in Europe and Japan, moderate growth in the United States, and serious challenges in developing countries (with the exception of India), the Chinese trade engine has lost much of its steam.At the same time, however, rising domestic demand has kept China’s growth rate relatively high – a feat that has been achieved without a substantial increase in household indebtedness. As private consumption has expanded, services have proliferated, generating employment for many. This is clear evidence of a healthy economic rebalancing.The situation in the corporate sector is mixed. On one hand, highly innovative and dynamic private firms are driving growth. Indeed, as a forthcoming book by George S. Yip and Bruce McKern documents, these innovations are occurring in a wide range of areas, from biotechnology to renewable energy. The most visible progress has come in the information technology sector, thanks to firms like Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, Lenovo, Huawei, and Xiaomi.
