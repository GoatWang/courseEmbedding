View Prospectus

This is a “blind-pool” offering because we have not specifically identified our investments and likely will not have done so at the time you invest. As a result, you cannot evaluate the risks of, or potential returns from, any of our investments at the time you invest.
Our lack of operating history and our General Partner’s and our Investment Manager’s limited operating history decreases your ability to evaluate your investment.
We will not apply for an advance ruling from the Internal Revenue Service as to any federal tax consequences of an investment in us, and if the Internal Revenue Service classifies us as a corporation you will lose tax benefits.
Since there is no public market for our units, an investment in our units is considered illiquid. You should be prepared to hold your units for the life of the fund, which is anticipated to be approximately six to eight years, but may be longer.
You will have very limited voting rights and you must rely on our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates to manage us.
If we borrow funds to make investments, we may need to divert our cash flow from operations and distributions to service our indebtedness.
A prolonged economic recession or changes in general economic conditions, or both, including fluctuations in demand for equipment and other portfolio assets, lease rates, and interest rates may result in delays in investment and reinvestment, delays in leasing, re- leasing and disposition of equipment, and reduced returns on capital.
Our performance will be subject to the risk of lease and other investment defaults. Uncertainties associated with the equipment leasing and financing industry may have an adverse effect on our business and may adversely affect our ability to provide you any economic return from our units or a complete return of your capital.
Our success will depend in part on our ability to realize residual value from a portion of our assets and equipment once the leases on those assets and equipment terminate.
Our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates will receive significant compensation from us, which will reduce distributions to you.
There are potential conflicts of interest between us and our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates.
You may incur tax liabilities in excess of cash distributions you receive from us in a particular year.
There are material federal income tax risks associated with this offering.

Organization
and Nature of Operations




 

Organization
–
SQN Asset Income Fund V, L.P. (the “Partnership”) was
formed on January 14, 2016, as a Delaware limited partnership and
is engaged in a single business segment, the ownership and
investment in leased equipment and related financings which
includes: (i) purchasing equipment and leasing it to third-party
end users; (ii) providing equipment and other asset financing;
(iii) acquiring equipment subject to lease and (iv) acquiring
ownership rights (residual value interests) in leased equipment at
lease expiration. The Partnership will terminate no later than
December 31, 2040.

 

Nature of
Operations – The
principal investment strategy of the Partnership is to invest in
business-essential, revenue-producing (or cost-savings) equipment
or other physical assets with high in-place value and long,
relative to the investment term, economic life and project
financings. The Partnership executes its investment strategy by
making investments in equipment already subject to lease or
originating equipment leases and loans in such equipment, which
will include: (i) purchasing equipment and leasing it to
third-party end users; (ii) providing equipment and other asset and
project financings; (iii) acquiring equipment subject to lease and
(iv) acquiring ownership rights (residual value interests) in
leased equipment at lease expiration. From time to time, the
Partnership may also purchase equipment and sell it directly to its
leasing customers. The Partnership may use other investment
structures that SQN Investment Advisors, LLC (the “Investment
Manager”) believes will provide the Partnership with an
appropriate level of security, collateralization, and flexibility
to optimize its return on its investment while protecting against
downside risk. In many cases, the structure will include the
Partnership holding title to or a priority or controlling position
in the equipment or other asset.

 

The
General Partner of the Partnership is SQN AIF V GP, LLC (the
“General Partner”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Partnership’s Investment Manager. Both the
Partnership’s General Partner and its Investment Manager are
Delaware limited liability companies. The General Partner manages
and controls the day to day activities and operations of the
Partnership, pursuant to the terms of the Limited Partnership
Agreement. The General Partner paid an aggregate capital
contribution of $100 for a 1% interest in the Partnership’s
income, losses and distributions. The Investment Manager makes all
investment decisions and manages the investment portfolio of the
Partnership.

 

The
Partnership’s income, losses and distributions are allocated
99% to the Limited Partners and 1% to the General Partner until the
Limited Partners have received total distributions equal to their
capital contributions plus an 8% per year, compounded annually,
cumulative return on their capital contributions. After such time,
all income, losses and distributable cash will be allocated 80% to
the Limited Partners and 20% to the General Partner. The
Partnership expects to conduct its activities for at least six
years and divide the Partnership’s life into three distinct
stages: (i) the Offering Period, (ii) the Operating Period and
(iii) the Liquidation Period. The Offering Period began on August
11, 2016, will terminate no later than two years after this date,
unless extended by our General Partner, from time to time, in its
sole discretion, by up to an additional 12 months. The Operating
Period will commence on the date of the Partnership’s initial
closing and last for four years unless extended at the sole
discretion of the General Partner. During the Operating Period, the
Partnership will invest most of the net proceeds from its offering
in business-essential, revenue-producing (or cost-saving)
equipment, other physical assets with substantial economic lives
and, in many cases, associated revenue streams and project
financings. The Liquidation Period, which follows the conclusion of
the Operating Period, is the period in which the Partnership will
sell its assets in the ordinary course of business and will last
two years, unless it is extended, at the sole discretion of the
General Partner. The General Partner may extend the Offering
Period, from time to time, in its sole discretion, by up to an
additional 12 months. The General Partner may also extend the
Operating Period and subsequent Liquidation Period in its sole
discretion.

SQN
Securities, LLC (“Securities”), is a Delaware limited
liability company, is affiliated with our General Partner.
Securities will act initially as the selling agent for the offering
of our units. The units will be offered on a “best
efforts,” “minimum-maximum” basis. This means the
selling agent must sell at least 120,000 units and receive
subscription proceeds of at least $1,200,000 in order for this
offering to close (excluding subscription proceeds, if any, from
our General Partner or its affiliates and from residents of
Pennsylvania), and it must use only its best efforts to sell our
remaining units. Our subscription proceeds will be held in an
interest-bearing escrow account until $1,200,000 has been received.
At that time we will admit investors as limited partners, receive
the escrowed subscription proceeds from the escrow agent and pay in
cash to such investors’ interest earned on their escrowed
subscription proceeds, net of bank fees. Unless extended by our
General Partner, from time to time, in its sole discretion, for up
to an additional 12 months, this offering will terminate on the
date that is two years from the date of August 11, 2016. If the
minimum subscription proceeds are not received within one year from
the date of August 11, 2016, then your subscription proceeds will
be promptly returned to you from the escrow account with any
interest earned thereon and without deduction for any
fees.

 

During
the Operating Period, the Partnership plans to make quarterly
distributions of cash to the Limited Partners, if, in the opinion
of the Partnership’s Investment Manager, such distributions
are in the Partnership’s best interests. Therefore, the
amount and rate of cash distributions could vary and are not
guaranteed. The targeted distribution rate is 6.0% annually, paid
quarterly as 1.5%, of each Limited Partner’s capital
contribution (pro-rated to the date of admission for each Limited
Partner).

Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies




 

Basis of
Presentation —
The condensed balance sheets, statement of operations, statement of
changes in partner’s equity and statement of cash flows of
the Partnership at September 30, 2016 and for the period from June
30, 2016 to September 30, 2016 are unaudited and have been prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim
financial information and pursuant to the rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X.
Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and
footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements.
The unaudited interim condensed financial statements furnished
reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring
adjustments) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for
a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented.
The results reported in these condensed financial statements should
not necessarily be taken as indicative of results that may be
expected for the entire year. These unaudited interim condensed
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
financial statements and notes contained in the Partnership’s
Registration Statement on Form S-1, as filed with the SEC on May
26, 2016 and as amended on July 14, 2016.

 

Cash and
Cash Equivalents —
The Partnership considers all highly liquid investments with a
maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash
equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of funds maintained
in checking and money market accounts maintained at financial
institutions.

 

The
Partnership’s cash and cash equivalents are held principally
at one financial institution and at times may exceed federally
insured limits. The Partnership has placed these funds in an
international financial institution in order to minimize risk
relating to exceeding insured limits.

 

Restricted
Cash —
Restricted cash primarily consists of cash held in an escrow
account from subscriptions received in advance which will be
released subject to the receipt and acceptance by the General
Partner of subscriptions for 120,000 Units or $1,200,000, excluding
any subscriptions, if any, by the General Partner and its
affiliates and Pennsylvania residents.

 

Income
Taxes — As
a partnership, no provision for income taxes is recorded since the
liability for such taxes is the responsibility of each of the
Partners rather than the Partnership. The Partnership’s
income tax returns are subject to examination by the federal and
state taxing authorities, and changes, if any, could adjust the
individual income tax of the Partners.

Uncertain
Tax Position —
The Partnership follows the provisions of Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes (“Uncertain Tax Position”).
Uncertain Tax Position prescribes recognition thresholds that must
be met before a tax position is recognized in the financial
statements and provides guidance on de-recognition, classification,
interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure,
and transition. Under Uncertain Tax Position, an entity may only
recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet a
“more likely than not” threshold.

 

The
Partnership has adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting
Standards Board’s Topic 740, Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes. This accounting guidance prescribes recognition
thresholds that must be met before a tax position is recognized in
the financial statements and provides guidance on de-recognition,
classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim
periods, disclosure, and transition. Additionally, an entity may
only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet a
“more likely than not” threshold.

 

Use of
estimates - The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP
requires the Partnership to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of
the balance sheet. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

 

In
February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued new guidance to improve consolidation
guidance for legal entities (Accounting Standards Update
(“ASU”) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842): Amendments to
Leases Analysis), effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those years and early
adoption is permitted. The standard amends the existing accounting
standards for lease accounting, including requiring lessees to
recognize most leases on their balance sheets and making targeted
changes to lessor accounting. The new leases standard requires a
modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing
at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an
option to use certain transition relief. The Partnership is
currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its condensed
consolidated financial statements.

 

Management
does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet
effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a
material effect on the condensed consolidated financial
statements.

Capital
Contributions




 

The
General Partner has made the following cash payments to the
Partnership: (i) a General Partner capital contribution of $100,
and (ii) an additional $1,000 for any incidental costs which may
arise which is shown as loans payable in the accompanying balance
sheet. The Partnership’s Investment Manager made the initial
cash payment to the Partnership of $1,000 which was applied against
the Investment Manager’s purchase of the initial Limited
Partner’s interest in the Partnership. Once the Partnership
completes its first closing and admits additional Limited Partners,
the initial Limited Partner will be refunded its initial capital
contribution.

 




4.



Related
Party Transactions




 

The
Partnership will enter into certain agreements with the General
Partner, the Investment Manager and Securities, an affiliate of the
General Partner that is acting as exclusive sales agent for the
offering of the Partnership’s limited partnership units,
whereby the Partnership pays certain fees and reimbursements to
these parties.

 

Pursuant
to the terms of the Partnership Agreement, the General Partner is
entitled to (i) 1% of the Partnership’s profits, losses, cash
distributions and liquidation proceeds, and (ii) a promotional
interest in the Partnership, and (iii) a promotional interest in
the Partnership equal to 20% of all distributed distributable cash
after the Partnership has provided a return to its Limited Partners
of their respective capital contributions plus an 8% per annum,
cumulative return, compounded annually on their capital
contributions. In addition, the General Partner and its affiliates
will be reimbursed for organizational and offering expenses
incurred in connection with the Partnership’s organization
and offering of limited partnership units and certain
administrative expenses incurred in connection with the
Partnership’s operations. Once the Partnership raises the
minimum capital contributions of $1,200,000, fees and expenses
associated with the Partnership’s organization and offering
costs will become reimbursable to the Partnership’s General
Partner and Investment Manager.
