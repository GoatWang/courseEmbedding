Ferro's Merrick fund draws Chicago business titans


Internet entrepreneur Michael Ferro has assembled a group of Chicago corporate poohbahs in a secretive investment fund that could help fill a gap that local technology startups have groused about for years.
Mr. Ferro launched Merrick Ventures LLC after selling supply-chain software company Click Commerce Inc. to Illinois Tool Works Inc. in late 2006. He won't discuss the fund, its investment strategy or its backers, but Merrick's Web site includes a list of 11 other board members, with names like Pritzker, McKenna and Crown.
Merrick has shown a wide-ranging appetite for deals, from Merge Healthcare Inc., a publicly traded medical-software company based in Milwaukee, to startups such as SoCore Energy LLC, a Chicago-based solar venture launched by Glen Tullman, CEO of Allscripts-Misys Healthcare Solutions Inc.
While Merrick isn't focused solely on startups, it represents an A-list of deep-pocketed executives who have a unique combination of cash, clout and wisdom to offer young companies, something that entrepreneurs have long complained is missing in Chicago.
Board members, whom sources say invest up to $3 million, include John Canning, chairman of private-equity firm Madison Dearborn Partners LLC; industrialist Lester Crown; private-equity investor William Devers; former ITW CEO W. James Farrell; McDonald's Corp. Chairman Andrew McKenna Sr.; former telecommunications executive Richard Notebaert; venture investor J. B. Pritzker; Christopher Reyes, CEO of food and beverage distributor Reyes Holdings LLC; former CME Group Inc. Chairman John "Jack" Sandner; National Material L.P. CEO Michael Tang; Bruce White, CEO of hotel giant White Lodging Services Corp., and Abbott Laboratories CEO Miles White.

"These people aren't in it for their own glory," says Matt McCall, a partner at venture-capital firms Draper Fisher Jurvetson and New World Ventures, Mr. Pritzker's fund. "Chicago's got great potential if you can find the right spark."
The fund is part of a broader resurgence of interest in backing startups, a focus many wealthy investors rejected after being burned in the dot-com crash.
Even during the boom, Chicago technology entrepreneurs complained about the area's lack of venture funding. This year has seen several new efforts to correct that problem. Start-up veterans Brad Keywell and Eric Lefkofsky have launched a fund and incubator called LightBank. Excelerate Labs, a start-up boot camp, provides seed funding and mentoring from a large group of experienced technology entrepreneurs, including Mr. Tullman's brother Howard and Mr. Ferro.
"It's getting better," says Sam Guren, a veteran Chicago venture capitalist and managing director of Hyde Park Angels, a group of individual investors that has seen its ranks grow to 55 people from 35 in the past 18 months. "The attitude toward startups is evolving. It's more open to risk. It's not perfect, but you've got money and people willing to invest and mentor."
Mr. Ferro declined an interview, and no board members returned calls for this story.
When Mr. Ferro sold Click Commerce to ITW for $292 million in cash, he held stock valued at about $65 million, not counting options-related expenses. ITW sold Click last year, recording a $29.8-million loss.
Since selling, Mr. Ferro has turned his attention back to building new companies. He's been active in the Chicagoland Entrepreneurship Center, a non-profit arm of the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce. He and Merrick are investors in CEC's $10-million Illinois Accelerator (I2A) Fund, launched in 2007 (the I2A fund is an investor in Excelerate).
' The attitude toward startups is evolving. It's more open to risk.'
 Sam Guren, managing director,Hyde Park Angels
It's not clear how much money Mr. Ferro or board members have put into Merrick. But the source familiar with the fund says Mr. Ferro is the primary investor.
Like any investor, Mr. Ferro has enjoyed both hits and misses. With many of the investments, it's too soon to tell.
BEST BET
Merrick's biggest deal so far appears to be a $20-million turnaround bet on Merge Healthcare, which makes medical-imaging software. Justin Dearborn, a Click Commerce veteran and former managing partner of Merrick, became Merge Healthcare CEO after Merrick bought the company in 2008. Merrick returned Merge to profitability last year, and the stock has doubled to about $2. A stock offering in November allowed the company to repay debt of $18 million to Merrick, which still owns about 43% of the company.
But Merrick's primary focus, according to its Web site, is on Chicago-based companies, with an emphasis on technology and the Internet. It looks for companies seeking $1 million to $5 million in funding.
Merrick recently backed SoCore, which leases solar panels to commercial building owners. It's also an investor in VendorCheckin, a Skokie startup that developed a Web-based tool for commercial property managers, such as hotels, to authorize and manage vendors coming in and out of loading docks.
It's also backing individual entrepreneurs and launching its own companies, such as Olivia Greets, which developed a virtual receptionist and is run by Spyglass Inc. co-founder Tim Krauskopf. Olivia Greets and SoCore are based in Merrick's offices at 233 N. Michigan Ave., Click Commerce's former headquarters.

or would result in, any of the results described in subparagraphs (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D.  Except as disclosed herein, the
Reporting Persons have no present intention to further acquire securities of the Issuer; provided, however, the Reporting Persons intend to review their investment on a regular basis and may determine at any time or from time to time, either alone
or as part of a group:         to acquire additional securities of the Issuer through open market purchases, in privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise,        to dispose of all or a portion of the securities of the Issuer beneficially owned in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise, or        to take any other available course of action which may involve one or more of the transactions described in subparagraphs (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D or have the results described in those
subparagraphs. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each Reporting Person specifically reserves the right to change its
intention with respect to any and all matters disclosed or referenced herein. In reaching any decision with respect to any course of action, each Reporting Person expects it would take into consideration a variety of factors including, but not
limited to, the Issuers business and prospects, other business opportunities available to the Reporting Person, changes in applicable laws and regulations, general economic conditions, worldwide money and equity market conditions (including
the market price of the securities of the Issuer), tax considerations and any other factors deemed relevant.  Item 5. Interest in Securities
