TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORSOur goal is to provide complete, accurate, up-to-date information on our Sites.

They typically use words such as or similar to “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe.”Forward-looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many such factors may have a significant impact on actual future results. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed.

THE ARBITRATORS’ DECISION WILL BE FINAL AND BINDING. OTHER RIGHTS THAT EITHER PARTY WOULD HAVE IF SUCH PARTY WENT TO COURT, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE RIGHT TO CONDUCT DISCOVERY OR TO APPEAL, MAY BE LIMITED OR UNAVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.The award of the arbitrators may be enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  Each party hereby consents (a) to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Tennessee or to any Federal Court located within the State of Tennessee for any action (i) to compel arbitration, (ii) to enforce any award of the arbitrators, or (iii) at any time prior to the qualification and appointment of the arbitrators, for temporary, interim or provisional equitable remedies, and (b) to service of process in any such action by registered mail or any other means provided by law.
