The motion picture industry is intensely competitive. Competition comes from 
companies within the same business and companies in other entertainment media 
that create alternative forms of entertainment. The industry is currently 
evolving in such a way that certain multinational multimedia firms will be able
to dominate this space because of their control over key film, magazine, and 
television content, as well as key network and cable outlets. These 
organizations have numerous competitive advantages, such as the ability to 
acquire financing for their projects and to make favorable arrangements for the
distribution of completed films. All of our competitors will likely be 
organizations of substantially larger size and capacity, with far greater 
financial and personnel resources and longer operating histories, and may be 
better able to acquire properties, personnel and financing, and enter into more
favorable distribution agreements. Our success will depend on public taste, 
which is both unpredictable and susceptible to rapid change. 

As an independent film production company, we most likely will not have the 
backing of a major studio for production and distribution support. 
Consequently, we may not be able to complete a motion picture.   

In order to be competitive, we intend to create independent motion pictures 
that may appeal to a wide range of public taste both in the United States and 
abroad. Moreover, by producing our films in Canada we believe that we will be 
able to significantly reduce production costs, and thereby offer our films to 
distributors at competitive pricing. Investors must be aware that at this time 
we have not produced any film and may not ever be successful in doing so in the
future.


Company Description
We were incorporated in the State of California as a for-profit company on 
September 10, 2009 and established a fiscal year end of December 31. We are 
a development stage enterprise. On September 15, 2009, our incorporator 
adopted our bylaws and appointed our sole director. We were formed to


 develop,
produce and distribute low-budget, independent feature films and exploit other
entertainment opportunities, which may include the licensing and selling of 
intellectual properties. 


-----

We are a development stage enterprise that was formed to develop and produce 
low-budget, feature length motion pictures and other entertainment related 
projects. We also intend to acquire scripts and the rights to projects. We have
had limited operations and have limited financial resources. We have not yet 
begun any entertainment projects. Our auditors indicated in their report on 
our financial statements (the “Report”) that “the Company’s lack of business 
operations and continuing losses raise substantial doubt about its ability 
to continue as a going concern.” Our operations to date have been devoted 
primarily to start-up and development activities, which include: 

1.    Formation of the Company;  

2.    Development of our business plan;  

3.    Evaluating various entertainment properties;  

4.    Research on marketing channels/strategies for our entertainment 
      properties and the industry;  

5.    Secured our website domain www.thunderclapinc.com and developed our 
      initial online website; and  

6.    Research on books and ideas that we may develop into film projects.  

In 2011, we plan to focus our business operations on the development and 
production of commercial, feature-length, low-budget motion pictures having 
budgets of up to $2 million dollars. We plan to utilize our website to solicit 
projects from writers, directors, producers and agents. We anticipate promoting
these film properties by assembling a business plan for presentation to 
prospective investors and financiers, consisting of the screenplay, a budget, 
shooting schedule, production board and identification of recognizable actor(s)
or director(s) for the film. We also intend to have discussions with various 
film distributors to determine what our best options are for the distribution
of a completed project. We plan to offer grants of our stock or options to 
acquire our stock in order to secure screenplays, treatments, actors’ 
participation and directors’ participation in our films. A treatment is a 
written sketch outlining the plot, characters, and action for a screenplay but 
not including certain elements of a finished screenplay, such as camera 
directions and dialogue. There can be no assurance that writers, actors and/or 
directors, in exchange for their participation in a film, will ever consider 
our stock in exchange for their screenplays or services. Any such grants of 
stock may involve substantial dilution to our existing shareholders. 

We currently do not have sufficient capital to independently finance our own 
film projects. We intend to rely on outside sources of financing for all film 
production activities. Our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and 
positive cash flow is dependent upon our ability to produce commercially 
successful motion picture films. In order to succeed, we must develop or 
acquire screenplays appropriate for production and distribution. We intend to 
rely on our Chairman’s and President's access to and relationships with, 
creative talent, including writers, actors and directors to find suitable
existing screenplays. We also intend to market our website to the film industry
to solicit screenplays for our consideration. There can be no guarantee or 
assurance that our Chairman or President and/or our website will enable us to 
attract and produce commercially viable screenplays into films that will result
in future profits to us. 

We plan to profit from this business activity by exclusively owning all right 
title, and interest in and to, the screenplay and any film derived from it and 
also capitalizing on other marketing opportunities associated with these
properties including but not limited to the publishing and promotion of 
associated music, the incorporation of original songs on sound tracks for 
subsequent use in promotion, sound track albums, story-telling records and the 
licensing of merchandising rights. Motion picture revenue is derived from the 
worldwide licensing of a film to several distinct markets, each having its own
distribution network and potential for profit. The selection of the distributor
for each of our feature films will depend upon a number of factors. Our most 
basic criterion is whether the distributor has the ability to secure bookings
for the exhibition of the film on satisfactory terms. We will consider whether,
when and in what amount the distributor will make advances to us. We will also 
consider the amount and manner of computing distribution fees and the extent to
which the distributor will guarantee certain print, advertising and promotional
expenditures. 

No assurance can be given that our films, if produced, will be distributed and,
if distributed, will return the investment or make a profit. To achieve the 
goal of producing profitable low-budget, feature films, we plan to be selective
in our choice of screenplays that we decide to produce, exercise a high degree 
of control over the cost of production, and work with potential distributors 
on a viable and cost-effective distribution and marketing plan for our films.

The production of feature films does not require the ownership of expensive 
equipment. We believe that all the necessary equipment needed to engage in 
every aspect of the film production process can be rented or borrowed for the 
period in which it is needed. We believe that many production companies follow 
this operating procedure and we plan to rent or borrow the needed equipment in 
our anticipated film productions. 

Since September 10, 2009 (our inception) to March 31, 2011, we have not 
generated any revenues and have a net loss of $(148,331). We anticipate 
generating revenues within the first twelve months after we have secured 
separate financing for our first film project. We believe that we have 
sufficient working capital to continue our operations for the next 12 months 
without the need to seek additional financing. Our Selling Security Holders 
are offering for sale, 1,485,000 shares of common stock at an offering price of
$0.20 per share. We currently have two officers and a sole director. These 
individuals allocate time and personal resources to us on a part-time basis and
devote approximately 10 hours per week to us. One of our shareholders, who is 
neither an officer or director and who owns less than 10% of our common stock, 
has advanced $12,000 as an interest-free demand loan and has orally agreed to 
defer payment until we are financially able to repay it.
