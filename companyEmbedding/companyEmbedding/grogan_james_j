Continuing Legal Education (CLE)

Our reputation in the legal community is not only the result of our history of success, but also of our devotion to continuing legal education. Below, you will see a list of our firm's upcoming and past CLEs.*Please note: previously recorded webinars are not approved for CLE credit. 2018 Webinar: "The Changing Ethical Landscape of Litigation"More info to come on this webinar soon.2017 Webinar: "Social Media Ethics Outside and in the Courtroom"Social media is now part of the fabric of practicing law. There are ethics opinions galore and not all of them are consistent. Courts are grappling with difficult issues of preservation of, or access to, information on social media sites, and even the more difficult issues of jurors who live on their mobile devices.
2016 Webinar: "The Ethics of Pre-Trial and Trial Work"The objectives of this program are to familiarize attorneys with the Rules of Professional Conduct involving pre-trial and trial issues. Typically, that involves evidentiary issues that face lawyers on a day-to-day basis - from witness preparation to spoliation of evidence, calling a party as a witness to influencers in closing argument.
2015 Webinar: "The Ethics of Conflicts of Interest"Conflicts of interest can bedevil both litigators and transactional lawyers. The relevant rules seem complicated and highly technical, and the decisions interpreting them sometimes give inconsistent guidance. But get it wrong and you can face discipline, disqualification or a civil lawsuit. This two-hour program will give practical advice about how to handle conflicts of interest.
2014 Webinar: "The Ethics of Client Communications"The 2014 program will cover the dos, don'ts and best practices of lawyer communication with both commercial and consumer clients; issues in ex parte communications between lawyers and adjudicators; and how to avoid breaches of client confidentiality. The program will also address the unique challenges and ethics of client communications in the Internet Age.
2013 Webinar: "Ethics of Witness Preparation for Deposition and Trial"A number of hypotheticals will be presented to help attendees understand the ethics of dealing with witnesses for deposition and trial. Should I first explain the law before asking the client what happened? Should I reveal other evidence and ask a witness her testimony? What are the differences between preparing a witness for deposition or for trial? These are some of the questions that will be answered.
2012 Webinar: "Ethical Issues in Mediation"The program will include an examination of various hypotheticals involving negotiation, settlement and mediation. These can be effective ways to advocate for your client, but even when an outside person comes on the scene to help the parties come to a resolution, various ethical issues can arise.
2011 Webinar: "Ethical Applications of the New Illinois Rules of Evidence"For the first time, the Illinois Supreme Court has approved and promulgated Illinois Rules of Evidence in codified form effective Jan. 1, 2011. They are aimed at expediting the trial process and improving the administration of justice in Illinois courts. Before, the rules of evidence in Illinois were dispersed throughout case law. The codification contains some changes dealing with opinion testimony and hearsay.
2010 Webinar: "The Ethics of E-Discovery and Social Media"Clifford Law Offices is sponsoring a two-hour continuing legal education program on the hot topic of The Ethics of E-Discovery and Social Media. Two highly experienced and educated instructors will be teaching the free seminar on Thursday, Feb. 25, 2010, from 2:30-4:30pm. It will be offered live in a classroom setting at DePaul University as well as via an interactive webinar. This program has been approved for 2 hours of professional responsibility credit. For questions, email programs@cliffordlaw.com.
2009 Webinar: "The Ethics of Lincoln the Lawyer"Panelists will discuss the life of Abraham Lincoln, the country’s 16th president, who practiced law throughout the state before entering the White House.
2008 Webinar: "The Ethics of Trial Work"The objectives of the course are to familiarize attorneys with the Rules of Professional Conduct. In particular, the objective of the course is to promote the civility of lawyers’ conduct in preparation of trial and during trial.
