MINNEAPOLIS- Buffalo Wild Wings has announced the retirement of EVP and President, North America, Judith Shoulak. Buffalo Wild Wings will eliminate the President, North America position upon Shoulak’s retirement. Shoulak’s team will report to the COO, James Schmidt, after her retirement on June 30, 2017.
“On behalf of the entire management team, I would like to thank Judy for her nearly 16 years of tireless service at Buffalo Wild Wings,” said Sally Smith, CEO and president of Buffalo Wild Wings in a statement. “Judy has played a key role in a wide variety of executive capacities and her intimate knowledge of the restaurant business has enabled her to be an agent of positive change throughout the Company. We are very grateful to Judy for her dedication and leadership and wish her the best in the future.”
“I am proud of the Company’s accomplishments during my tenure and the recent progress we have made in implementing our strategic plan,” Shoulak said. “Buffalo Wild Wings is an extraordinary company and it has been an honor to come to work here every day. While I will miss working with a great leadership team, talented team members and dedicated franchisees, I am confident that Buffalo Wild Wings is on track to achieve its objectives as it becomes an even stronger, more profitable restaurant company.”
