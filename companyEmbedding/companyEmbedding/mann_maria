The MANN+HUMMEL product highlights at the IAA

Innovation & Technology The MANN+HUMMEL product highlights at the IAA

 13 Sep, 2013 

In terms of MANN+HUMMEL product management, the IAA is an absolute highlight for me. Next to customer fairs, which take place at different automobile customer premises each year, the IAA in Frankfurt, which only takes place every two years, is the key event which my team and I are always working towards. In contrast to customer events, this is where we have the opportunity to introduce our new products to customers and to the public, and where we get the first reactions from the market and discover whether we have met – or even beaten – future customer expectations.
This is also the case at the International Motor Show in Frankfurt, which takes place from 12th to 22nd September 2013. We are presenting numerous product highlights that we have put a lot of time, effort, and commitment into.

IAA Highlights in high tech
We are breaking new ground in air filter development with the VarioPleat. This application for air intake systems in combustion engines takes everything that was previously technically possible and blows it out of the water. This new technology enables much better exploitation of the available installation space than with conventional air filters. This is the first of its kind globally, and offers a significantly lower pressure loss and a higher dust holding capacity than ever before. It is expected to be available on the market in two or three years.

Our intake manifold with its fully integrated air intercooler and innovative charge air duct follows the same direction. It saves on weight, costs, and interfaces, and is ideally suited to turbocharged gasoline engines. The smaller front-end package and the lower pressure drop in the intake system (and therefore improved response characteristics) has already impressed us, and is sure to receive a positive reception from vehicle manufacturers.
Our new SD oil separator ensures compact and cost efficient component protection without disadvantages for separation performance. It combines durability with optimal component protection in the air intake system. Its compact and flexible design means that it can be quite easily adapted to the engine compartment even during later project phases.
Our highly functional LP-EGR modular system supports an important environmental aspect. Low pressure EGR systems reduce combustion engine emissions, and therefore look set to become more important in the automotive industry in the future. The modular construction of our system also offers customers greater freedom. The functions of the module can be individually tailored to suit specifications and installation space requirements.
Our three-stage fuel filter for particle-free and water-free diesel fuel will be going into series production for the first time in the new Chevrolet Cruze. It achieves a consistently high level of water separation in excess of 90 percent. In contrast to one-stage fuel filters, where performance always decreases over the complete service lifetime, the three-stage fuel filter maintains its level of water separation between services, and thus avoids system failures.
IAA Highlights: sounds great!
One of the highlights of the IAA is our innovative sound application Active Noise Control. ANC reduces the noise level of combustion engines. In electric and hybrid vehicles, it simulates the sound of a motor in operation, thus making the vehicle audible and subsequently improving safety to counter criticism that electric power units are to quite for pedestrians and cyclists.  In addition, ANC also offers the possibility to create a unique sound design. Lots of car enthusiasts recognise their favourite models from the sound of the engine alone – and we believe that sound branding will become increasingly popular in the future. The ANC allows the generation of a sound, which can then be individually designed and fine-tuned.
Have some of our products piqued your interest? If so, I would be delighted if you would come and see our highlights for yourself at the IAA. Our employees will be happy to answer any questions you might have. Our team can be found at the IAA in hall 8, stand F2.0.
We are looking forward to your visit.

          Mann Made Products is proud to offer you a superior line of boat handling equipment. Through close involvement with several users over the past 20 years we have improved upon many areas of the storage and transport industry. In doing so we feel we have made users tasks easier, safer and more economical. Our equipment is designed for more strength and durability backed by a 1 year structural and workmanship warranty.           By using our exclusive yard hooks on your sailboat hydraulic trailer instead of cross bars you can become at least 25% more efficient. The yard hooks allow you to pick and set cradles with only two inch blocking. When used with the corner hooks on our cradles you may then set the cradle directly on the ground.            Our all steel cradle is built strong enough to withstand the torque and loading stress during loading and unloading with minimal hull stress and defection.           Our powerboat stands are also unique in design. They can be stacked on top of one another. Because of this your initial shipping charges will be cheaper and less off-season storage area will be needed. They are also rated at #5000 but have been tested to withstand 14 tons. The following are some of the items available to you: All steel Cradles, 4,000 lb. to 50,000 lb. Power Boat stands 12� to 48� heights Custom road trailers - sail & power Storage Trailers Hydraulic trailers and accessories Boat handling equipment Repairs and modifications  Welding � Steel, aluminum, stainless
