Biostage Appoints Harout DerSimonian, Ph.D. as Chief Scientific Officer to Oversee Cell Biology, Materials Science and Other Research Underlying its Organ Implant Development


Posted
07/22/2016





HOLLISTON, Mass., July 21, 2016 -- Biostage, Inc. (Nasdaq: BSTG), a biotechnology company developing bioengineered organ implants to treat cancers and other life-threatening conditions of the esophagus, bronchus and trachea, announced today that Harout DerSimonian, Ph.D. has joined the company as Chief Scientific Officer, a new position at Biostage. Dr. DerSimonian will direct and manage the cell biology, materials science and other scientific research that forms the basis of Biostage's Cellframe™ technology platform.
Dr. DerSimonian has over 20 years of experience in developing immunotherapy and cell therapy programs and was instrumental in directing the science that enabled the first FDA-approved clinical trial using autologous human stem cells for cardiac repair. Throughout his career, he has played a critical, senior role in designing and implementing therapeutic programs at leading global institutions.  Dr. DerSimonian is a former assistant professor and post-doctoral fellow at Harvard Medical School and completed his post-doctoral training at the Dana-Faber Cancer Institute and Brigham and Women's Hospital. Dr. DerSimonian holds a Ph.D. in immunology from Tufts University and a B.A. in biology from Hartwick College.
Biostage CEO Jim McGorry commented, "The complexity of what we are doing, combined with the number of potential applications of our technology, necessitate that Biostage augment the leadership and management of our scientific research. Harout has the necessary cellular and molecular technology expertise, along with an impressive record of achievement in cell therapy programs to support our path to commercialization for our Cellframe technology. Dr. DerSimonian will be responsible for leading our scientific efforts and supporting the translation of our laboratory preclinical research findings for our Cellspan™ Esophageal Implant to advance the preparation of our IND for submission with the FDA. He is a proven translational research scientist and we believe a very important addition to our team."
Dr. DerSimonian stated, "I am excited to contribute to the advancement of Biostage's groundbreaking Cellframe technology. Already the company has demonstrated outstanding progress in pre-clinical research in regenerative medicine that provides an exciting window on an array of potential medical solutions and scientific pathways."
About Biostage, Inc.: www.biostage.com 
Biostage is a biotechnology company developing bioengineered organ implants utilizing the company's new Cellframe™ technology which combines a proprietary biocompatible scaffold with a patient's own stem cells to create Cellspan™ organ implants. Cellspan implants are being developed to treat life-threatening conditions of the esophagus, bronchus and trachea with the hope of dramatically improving the treatment paradigm for patients. Based on its preclinical data, Biostage has selected life-threatening conditions of the esophagus as the initial clinical application of its technology.
Cellspan implants are currently being advanced and tested in preclinical studies. This testing is intended to expand the base of preclinical data in support of Biostage's goal of filing an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the U.S. FDA in late 2016. The IND will seek approval to initiate clinical trials for its esophageal implants in humans.

To investigate the nature of the human anti-pig xenogeneic cellular response, we performed standard 51Cr-release cell-mediated lympholysis (CML) experiments. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) allele specificity of the xenogeneic cellular response was tested on porcine target cells of three distinct homozygous MHC haplotypes (SLAaa, SLACC, SLAdd) and three intra-MHC recombinant haplotypes (SLAjj, SLAgg, SLAkk), obtained from our herd of partially inbred miniature swine. After stimulation with irradiated porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of SLAaa haplotype, a strong nonspecific cytotoxic response of the bulk culture against xenogeneic targets of all three haplotypes was observed. However, SLA allele specificity could be demonstrated after T cell enrichment, and mapping experiments revealed predominantly SLA class I restriction of xenoreactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), although some class II restriction was also observed. The experiments were repeated in the presence of anti-T cell monoclonal antibodies, anti-CD3 (OKT3), anti-CD2 (35.1), anti-CD4 (OKT4), or anti-CD 8 (OKT8). The bulk xenogeneic CML was not inhibited by any of the anti-T cell antibodies tested. However, after T cell-enrichment, lysis of porcine targets was significantly inhibited by anti-CD3 or anti-CD8 antibody and partially inhibited by anti-CD2 antibody. In comparable assays, the human allogeneic CML was blocked by anti-CD3 and anti-CD8, but not by anti-CD2 or anti-CD4 antibodies. Finally, the cytotoxic activity of A3b3, a human CD4+ T-cell clone, was tested. A3b3 lysed xenogeneic targets of SLAaa haplotype, but not SLACC or allogeneic targets, and was inhibited by anti-CD4, anti-CD2, and anti-CD3 antibodies, but not by anti-CD8. With the aid of intra-MHC recombinant haplotypes, the xenogeneic CML reactivity of A3b3 was mapped to SLA class II, suggesting direct xenogeneic recognition of porcine MHC class II antigens by human T cells. Thus, the human anti-pig cell-mediated cytotoxic response is similar in magnitude to comparable allogeneic responses, and involves both SLA class I and class II restricted T-cell mediated cytotoxicity, as well as additional nonspecific killing, possibly by NK cells.

Among the cell populations participating in such rejection, NK cells have been proposed as an important component. In this study we report the in vitro cytotoxic activity of natural killer (NK) cells obtained from healthy human donors against porcine target cells. Freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and purified NK cells (CD16+/CD56+, CD3-, CD20-, CD33-) exhibited little or no cytotoxic activity when tested on porcine phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated lymphoblasts or bone marrow- or aortic-derived endothelial cell lines in the presence of serum-free medium. Killing was considerably higher in the presence of human decomplemented plasma, containing xenoreactive nAb, or purified Gal(α1,3)Gal-reactive antibodies, suggesting that antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) mediated by NK cells is an important mechanism involved in xenogeneic cytotoxicity. After incubation of human PBMC for 6 days in the presence of irradiated xenogeneic porcine or allogeneic stimulator cells, or in the presence of exogenous interleukin 2 (IL-2), the cytotoxic activity of the bulk cultures as well as that of isolated NK cells (separated from stimulated bulk cultures) against xenogeneic targets increased considerably, and corresponded to an increased NK-specific lysis of K562 target cells. Cell surface staining and flow cytometry showed that CD16+/CD56+, CD3- NK cells composed ca. 25% of short-term (6 days) xenogeneic, allogeneic, or IL-2 stimulated bulk cultures. In summary, these data suggest that, in contrast to allogeneic cell- mediated killing, xenogeneic human anti-porcine cytotoxicity includes an important contribution from NK cells.

To facilitate studies of xenogeneic human anti-pig immune responses in vitro, pig microvascular bone-marrow (BM) and macrovascular aortic EC were obtained from our herd of partially inbred miniature swine, homozygous for the major histocompatibility locus, and immortalized with a modified SV40 large T vector. The resulting BM-derived (2A2) and aortic (PEDSV.15) immortalized EC lines showed unlimited growth and EC phenotype as indicated by expression of von Willebrand Factor (vWF) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors as well as by formation of typical cobblestone monolayers. Ultrastructural studies revealed morphological similarities in primary and immortalized EC. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated constitutive SLA class I expression by all lines whereas SLA class II was only expressed after stimulation with porcine IFNγ. Furthermore, pig CD34 mRNA was detected by Northern blot analysis in primary and immortalized aortic EC but not in 2A2. Both EC lines expressed a number of myeloid markers, adhesion molecules and xeno-antigens, the latter being determined by binding of human natural antibodies. Gene transfer into the porcine EC lines was successfully performed by electroporation or calcium-phosphate transfection, as well as by adenoviral infection. Finally, the functional similarity between primary and immortalized EC was demonstrated in adhesion and cytotoxicity assays. Together, these results suggest that 2A2 and PEDSV.15 represent valuable tools to study both human cellular and humoral immune responses in vitro against pig EC derived from microvascular and large vessels.

Consequently human sera contain anti-alphaGal natural antibodies. The human blood group B antigen [Gal alpha1,3(Fuc1,2)Galactose] is differentiated from the alphaGal epitope by the presence of a fucosyl group. To determine whether the expression of the B antigen has any effect on the level of alphaGal-reactive natural antibodies, equal numbers (n=12) of A, B, AB, and O serum samples were evaluated by ELISA and flow cytometry. A significant reduction in IgG alphaGal reactivity was observed with serum samples from B antigen-expressing donors (B, AB) relative to non-B antigen-expressing donors (A, O). These results are consistent with the possibility that anti-alphaGal antibodies in non-B antigen-expressing individuals include a subset that is reactive with the structurally related B antigen and that this subset is absent in B and AB individuals.

An ELISA system was developed for the detection of this subpopulation of porcine cell-reactive NAb using synthetic alphaGal conjugated to bovine serum albumin. A screen of 95 human serum samples by this method demonstrated marked variability in the alphaGal reactivity of unrelated donors. The percentage of alphaGal-reactive NAb relative to total immunoglobulin was determined for 10 donors. alphaGal-reactive NAb comprised 1.0-2.4% of total serum IgG, whereas the range was from 3.9% to 8.0% for IgM. The higher level of alphaGal-reactive IgM suggests that xenoreactive NAbs may be the product of germ-line genes. Two-dimensional gel analysis of affinity-purified alphaGal-reactive NAb from two donors provided evidence suggesting that IgM from this subpopulation of NAb were restricted in protein charge heterogeneity.

To investigate the nature of the human anti-pig xenogeneic cellular response, we performed standard 51Cr-release cell-mediated lympholysis (CML) experiments. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) allele specificity of the xenogeneic cellular response was tested on porcine target cells of three distinct homozygous MHC haplotypes (SLAaa, SLACC, SLAdd) and three intra-MHC recombinant haplotypes (SLAjj, SLAgg, SLAkk), obtained from our herd of partially inbred miniature swine. After stimulation with irradiated porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of SLAaa haplotype, a strong nonspecific cytotoxic response of the bulk culture against xenogeneic targets of all three haplotypes was observed. However, SLA allele specificity could be demonstrated after T cell enrichment, and mapping experiments revealed predominantly SLA class I restriction of xenoreactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), although some class II restriction was also observed. The experiments were repeated in the presence of anti-T cell monoclonal antibodies, anti-CD3 (OKT3), anti-CD2 (35.1), anti-CD4 (OKT4), or anti-CD 8 (OKT8). The bulk xenogeneic CML was not inhibited by any of the anti-T cell antibodies tested. However, after T cell-enrichment, lysis of porcine targets was significantly inhibited by anti-CD3 or anti-CD8 antibody and partially inhibited by anti-CD2 antibody. In comparable assays, the human allogeneic CML was blocked by anti-CD3 and anti-CD8, but not by anti-CD2 or anti-CD4 antibodies.
