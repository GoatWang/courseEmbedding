Where the net expense ratio is lower than the gross expense ratio, certain fees have been waived and/or expenses reimbursed. These waivers and/or reimbursements will continue for at least one year from the date of the applicable fund’s current prospectus (unless otherwise noted in the applicable prospectus) or until such time as the fund's Board of Directors /Trustees acts to discontinue all or a portion of such waivers and/or reimbursements. Absent such waivers and/or reimbursements, returns would have been lower. Expenses are based on the portfolio’s current annual report.
DEFINITIONS 
Net Asset Value (NAV) is the dollar value of a single fund share, based on the value of the underlying assets of the fund minus its liabilities, divided by the number of shares outstanding. It is calculated at the end of each business day. Sales growth is the increase in sales over a specific period of time, often but not necessarily annually. Return on capital is a measure of a company’s efficiency at allocating the capital under its control to profitable investments, calculated by dividing net income minus dividends by total capital. Earnings per share (EPS) growth is the weighted average of earnings per share growth for all securities in the portfolio projected for the past five fiscal years. Earnings per share for a company is defined as total earnings divided by shares outstanding. Weighted median market capitalization is the point at which half of the market value of a portfolio is invested in stocks with a greater market cap, and consequently the other half is invested in stocks with a lower market cap. Debt/equity (D/E) is a measure of a company’s financial leverage calculated by dividing its total liabilities by stockholders’ equity.

Subject to change daily. Portfolio information, composition, and characteristics are provided for informational purposes only, and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell any security or securities in the sectors presented. Monthly Holdings are updated 15 calendar days after month-end.
Turnover is sourced from the fund's current prospectus.
The index data displayed under allocations are calculated using MSIM and other third-party methodologies and may differ from data published by the vendor.
RISK CONSIDERATIONS
There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. In general, equities securities’ values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with foreign investments. Investments in medium capitalization companies tend to be more volatile and less liquid than those of larger, more established, companies. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than public traded securities (liquidity risk).

OTHER CONSIDERATIONS
The Russell Midcap Growth Index measures the performance of the mid-cap growth segment of the U.S. equity universe. It includes those Russell Midcap Index companies with higher price-to-book ratios and higher forecasted growth values. The Russell Midcap Index is a subset of the Russell 1000 Index and includes approximately 800 of the smallest securities in the Russell 1000 Index, which in turn consists of approximately 1,000 of the largest U.S. securities based on a combination of market capitalization and current index membership. The index is unmanaged and does not include any expenses, fees or sales charges. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

 The Portfolios are not available for direct investment. Shares of the Portfolio are offered exclusively to certain life insurance companies in connection with particular variable life insurance and/or variable annuity contracts they issue. The insurance companies invest in shares of the Portfolios in accordance with instructions received from owners of variable life insurance or annuity contracts.

Variable annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. Withdrawals prior to age 59 1/2 are subject to a 10% tax penalty. Only individuals or institutions domiciled in the United States of America are legally permitted to invest in these funds.

Effective May 30,2014, Select Dimensions Investment Series Mid Cap Growth Portfolio is closed to new investors.

 Please consider the investment objective, risks, charges and expenses of the portfolio carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other information about the portfolio. To obtain a prospectus, download one at www.morganstanley.com/im. Please read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money.       
As of January 1, 2011, the SEC requires fund companies to file a new exhibit with risk/return summary information in interactive data (XBRL) format. Click here for XBRL files.

Morgan Stanley Investment Management (MSIM) is the asset management division of Morgan Stanley.


 










 

  WAM is the weighted average maturity of the portfolio. The WAM calculation utilizes the interest-rate reset date, rather than a security's stated final maturity, for variable- and floating- rate securities. By looking to a portfolio's interest rate reset schedule in lieu of final maturity dates, the WAM measure effectively captures a fund's exposure to interest rate movements and the potential price impact resulting from interest rate movements.
 


  WAL is the weighted average life of the portfolio. The WAL calculation utilizes a security's stated final maturity date or, when relevant, the date of the next demand feature when the fund may receive payment of principal and interest (such as a put feature). Accordingly, WAL reflects how a portfolio would react to deteriorating credit (widening spreads) or tightening liquidity conditions.
 


  Tracking error and information ratio are calculated using the Portfolio's Blended Index (added October 2, 2013), as this is a better representation of the Portfolio's global multi-asset strategy. The investment team manages the Portfolio relative to this Blended Index.
 


  Excess return versus Custom Benchmark is calculated using the Portfolio's Blended Index based on the period since it was added as a benchmark on October 2, 2013.
 


  NTM = Next Twelve Months
 


  LTM = Last Twelve Months
 


  Because the Portfolio had not commenced operations as of the most recent fiscal year end, no portfolio turnover rate is available for the Portfolio.
 


  The Reorganization occurred on January 6, 2015. The inception date reflects the inception date of the Private Fund.
 


  Global equities is represented by the MSCI All Country World Index.
 


  Net exposure % calculated as [(MV of long cash security and derivative positions)-(absolute value of MV in short derivative positions)]/(portfolio MV)
 


  Gross exposure % calculated as [(MV of long cash security and derivative positions)+(absolute value of MV in short derivative positions)]/(portfolio MV).
 


  Fixed income net and gross exposure is duration adjusted (U.S. Treasury 10-Year equivalents)
 


  Security ratings disclosed above have been obtained from Standard & Poor's Ratings Group ("S&P"). S&P's credit ratings express its opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer to meet its financial obligations in full and on time.'AAA' is the highest rating. Any rating below 'BBB-' rating 
		is considered non-investment grade. Ratings are relative and subjective and are not absolute standards of quality. Ratings apply only to the underlying holdings of the portfolio and does not remove market risk.
		"NR" or "Not Rated" indicates that no rating has been requested, that there is insufficient information on which to base a rating, or that S&P does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy. Futures are not rated.

The Portfolios are not available for direct investment. Shares of the Portfolio are offered exclusively to certain life insurance companies in connection with particular variable life insurance and/or variable annuity contracts they issue. The insurance companies invest in shares of the Portfolios in accordance with instructions received from owners of variable life insurance or annuity contracts.
Variable annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. Withdrawals prior to age 59 1/2 are subject to a 10% tax penalty. Only individuals or institutions domiciled in the United States of America are legally permitted to invest in these funds.
Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the portfolio(s) carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other information about the Portfolio(s). To obtain a prospectus, contact your financial advisor or click here. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.
Morgan Stanley Investment Management (MSIM) is the asset management division of Morgan Stanley.
Effective May 1, 2017, The Universal Institutional Funds, Inc. (UIF) changed its name to Morgan Stanley Variable Insurance Fund, Inc. (VIF). There were no other changes to the Portfolio or investment process.



 

 During calendar year 2016, the VIF Core Plus Fixed Income Portfolio received monies related to certain nonrecurring litigation settlements. If these monies were not received, any period returns which include these settlement monies would have been lower. The returns on the other Share Classes would also have been similarly impacted. These were one-time settlements, and as a result, the impact on the net asset value and consequently the performance will not likely be repeated in the future. Rankings for the fund were more favorable due to these settlements and ratings may also have been positively impacted. Please call the toll free number for additional information.

 On May 1, 2015, The Universal Institutional Funds, Inc. Global Tactical Asset Allocation Portfolio was renamed The Universal Institutional Funds, Inc. Global Strategist Portfolio. There were no changes to the Portfolio’s investment policies or strategies.
 



 

  WAM is the weighted average maturity of the portfolio. The WAM calculation utilizes the interest-rate reset date, rather than a security's stated final maturity, for variable- and floating- rate securities. By looking to a portfolio's interest rate reset schedule in lieu of final maturity dates, the WAM measure effectively captures a fund's exposure to interest rate movements and the potential price impact resulting from interest rate movements.
 


  WAL is the weighted average life of the portfolio. The WAL calculation utilizes a security's stated final maturity date or, when relevant, the date of the next demand feature when the fund may receive payment of principal and interest (such as a put feature). Accordingly, WAL reflects how a portfolio would react to deteriorating credit (widening spreads) or tightening liquidity conditions.
 


  Tracking error and information ratio are calculated using the Portfolio's Blended Index (added October 2, 2013), as this is a better representation of the Portfolio's global multi-asset strategy. The investment team manages the Portfolio relative to this Blended Index.
 


  Excess return versus Custom Benchmark is calculated using the Portfolio's Blended Index based on the period since it was added as a benchmark on October 2, 2013.
 


  NTM = Next Twelve Months
 


  LTM = Last Twelve Months
 


  Because the Portfolio had not commenced operations as of the most recent fiscal year end, no portfolio turnover rate is available for the Portfolio.
 


  The Reorganization occurred on January 6, 2015. The inception date reflects the inception date of the Private Fund.
 


  Global equities is represented by the MSCI All Country World Index.
 


  Net exposure % calculated as [(MV of long cash security and derivative positions)-(absolute value of MV in short derivative positions)]/(portfolio MV)
 


  Gross exposure % calculated as [(MV of long cash security and derivative positions)+(absolute value of MV in short derivative positions)]/(portfolio MV).
 


  Fixed income net and gross exposure is duration adjusted (U.S. Treasury 10-Year equivalents)
 


  Security ratings disclosed above have been obtained from Standard & Poor's Ratings Group ("S&P"). S&P's credit ratings express its opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer to meet its financial obligations in full and on time.'AAA' is the highest rating. Any rating below 'BBB-' rating 
		is considered non-investment grade. Ratings are relative and subjective and are not absolute standards of quality. Ratings apply only to the underlying holdings of the portfolio and does not remove market risk.
		"NR" or "Not Rated" indicates that no rating has been requested, that there is insufficient information on which to base a rating, or that S&P does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy. Futures are not rated.

Re:��������� Morgan Stanley Select Dimensions
Investment Series
(File No.�033-54047; 811-7185)
�
Dear Mr.�Kosoff:
�
Thank
you for your telephonic comments regarding the registration statement on Form�N-1A
for Morgan Stanley Select Dimensions Investment Series�(the �Trust�) filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the �Commission�) on February�11,
2010 incorporating changes to the Prospectuses of the various portfolios of the
Trust (the �Portfolios�) and Statement of Additional Information in compliance
with changes to Form�N-1A that came into effect in February�2009.� Below, we describe any necessary changes made
to the registration statement in response to the Staff�s comments and provide
responses to or any supplemental explanations of such comments, as
requested.� These changes will be
reflected in Post-Effective Amendment No.�29 to the Trust�s registration
statement on Form�N-1A, which will be filed via EDGAR on or about April�12,
2010.
�
GENERAL COMMENTS TO THE
PROSPECTUSES
�
Comment 1.��������� Please either remove or move the �Eligible Investors�
section so that it follows Items 2 through 8 of Form�N-1A, as per General
Instruction C(3)(a)�of Form�N-1A.
�
Response 1.��������� The referenced disclosure has been
removed.
�
Comment 2.��������� Please change the caption in the Fee Table from �Advisory
fee� to �Management fee.�
�
Response 2.��������� We respectfully acknowledge your comment;
however, we refer to this fee as an advisory fee in the prospectus and SAI and
prefer to keep this caption consistent across all funds in the Morgan Stanley
Fund Complex.
�
Comment 3.��������� Please provide completed Fee
Tables (including any footnotes) to the Staff in an EDGAR correspondence filing
as soon as this information is available.
�
Response 3.� Completed Fee
Tables (including any footnotes) were provided to the Staff in an EDGAR
correspondence filing on March�30, 2010.
�
Comment 4.��������� Please revise the introduction
to the expense example to note that expenses do not reflect the expenses of the
separate account and would be higher if they did.
�




�
Response 4.� The
disclosure has been revised accordingly.
�
Comment 5.��������� If the Portfolios can only be
held by tax-advantaged accounts, please remove the disclosure regarding taxable
accounts.
�
Response 5.� The
disclosure has been revised accordingly.
�
Comment 6.��������� The Balanced and Focus Growth Portfolios list certain
principal strategies in the Summary section, such as derivatives and junk
bonds, but do not summarize the liquidity risk that such instruments entail
similar to what the Flexible Income Portfolio does for public bank loans.� In addition, these Portfolios do not
summarize the prepayment or �call� risk that these securities entail.� Please consider revising the prospectus
accordingly.
�
Response 6.� We
respectfully acknowledge your comment; however, we believe that the current
disclosure is adequate.
�
Comment
7.��������� The Balanced, Focus Growth and Flexible
Income Portfolios describe fixed income
securities and/or junk bonds as a principal strategy in the Summary
section but do not summarize the associated
credit risk (even though certain of them may identify that risk without
summarizing what that means).� Please
revise the prospectus accordingly.
�
Response 7.� The
disclosure has been revised accordingly for Balanced and Flexible Income.� Focus Growth does not currently invest in
fixed-income securities.
�
Comment 8.��������� The Balanced and Capital Opportunities Portfolios
describe convertible and/or preferred securities as a principal strategy but do
not summarize the associated risk that the principal value of these securities
can be expected to vary with the price of the underlying equity.� Please
revise the prospectus accordingly.
�
Response 8.� We
respectfully acknowledge your comment; however, we believe that the referenced
disclosure is adequate.
�
Comment
9.��������� The Capital
Opportunities and Capital Growth Portfolios describe the purchase of warrants
as a principal strategy but do not summarize the associated risk that there may
be restrictions imposed on the resale of these securities or on the securities
they are converted into.� Please revise the
prospectus accordingly.
�
Response 9.� We
respectfully acknowledge your comment; however, we believe that the current
disclosure is adequate.
�
Comment
10.������ Please remove the
description of the indices from the footnotes to the Average Annual Total
Returns table.� If there is only a
broad-based index, no description of the index is permitted by Form�N-1A.� If there is a broad-based and a secondary
index, a brief description of the indices is permitted in the narrative preceding
the Average Annual Total Returns table.
�
Response 10.� Item 4(b)(2)(iii)�requires
the Average Annual Total Returns table to include the returns of an appropriate
broad based securities market index as 
�
2




�
defined in Instruction 5 to Item 27(b)(7).� Instruction 2(b)�to Item 4 further
allows a fund to include information for one or more other indexes as permitted
by Instruction 6 to Item 27(b)(7).� The
referenced footnotes provide an explanation to investors as to why the particular
indexes chosen by a Portfolio provide appropriate comparisons to the Portfolio�s
performance as contemplated by these Instructions.
�
Comment 11.������ In the Average Annual Total Return table, please include the
following parenthetical following the name of the index �(reflects no deduction
for [fees, expenses, or taxes]).�
�
Response 11.������� The disclosure has been revised
accordingly.
�
Comment 12.������ Please delete the narrative preceding the �Portfolio
Managers� section in the Summary section if it is not permitted by Form�N-1A.
�
Response 12.������� We respectfully acknowledge your comment;
however, we believe that the narrative preceding the �Portfolio Managers�
section in the Summary section is permitted by Form�N-1A.
�
Comment 13.������ Several prospectuses list strategies following the
Summary section, but do not summarize those strategies in the Summary
section.� For example, (i)�the Focus
Growth Portfolio discusses preferred securities and REITs as principal
strategies, but leaves the summary section silent on these strategies as well
as the associated principal risks and (ii)�the Flexible Income Portfolio
discusses warrants as principal strategies, but leaves the summary section
silent on these strategies as well as the associated principal risks.� Please ensure that all principal strategies
discussed in response to Item 10 are summarized in response to Item 4
requirements.
�
Response 13.������� The disclosure has been revised
accordingly, as appropriate.
�
Comment 14.������ Please consider moving the first and second paragraphs
in the �Purchase and Sale of Portfolio Shares� section out of the Summary
section and remove the cross-reference at the end of this section.
�
Response 14.� We
respectfully acknowledge your comment; however, we believe that the disclosure
is appropriate.
�
Comment 15.������ If applicable, please state that a description of the
Trust�s policies and procedures with respect to portfolio holdings is available
on the Trust�s website.
�
Response 15.� A description
of the Trust�s policies and procedures with respect to portfolio holdings is
not available on the Trust�s website.
�
COMMENTS ON PROSPECTUS FOR MID CAP GROWTH
PORTFOLIO (CLASS�Y)
�
Comment 16.������ Please revise the Fee Table to show a Rule�12b-1
fee of 0.25% or explain supplementally why the fee is not applicable in spite
of the disclosure on page�14 of the prospectus.
�
3




�
Response 16.� The Fee Table
has been revised to show a Rule�12b-1 fee of 0.25%.
�
Comment 17.������ If you do not revise the disclosure referred to in
Comment 14 above, please update the first paragraph of the �Purchase
and Sale of Portfolio Shares� section to reflect that the prospectus describes Class�Y
shares.
�
Response 17.� The
disclosure has been revised accordingly.
�
COMMENTS ON PROSPECTUS FOR EQUALLY-WEIGHTED
S&P 500 PORTFOLIO
�
Comment 18.������ Please remove the disclaimer
regarding the use of the term S&P as this disclosure is not permitted or
required by Item 4 of Form�N-1A.
�
Response 18.� We
respectfully acknowledge your comment; however, we have a contractual

EXHIBIT A




PLAN OF LIQUIDATION AND DISSOLUTION



The following Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution (the "Plan") of the

[Emerging Markets Portfolio][North American Government Securities Portfolio]
(the "Portfolio"), a series of Morgan Stanley Select Dimensions Investment
Series, (the "Fund"), a trust organized and existing under the laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, which has operated as an open-end diversified
management investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of
1940 , as amended (the "Investment Company Act"), is intended to accomplish the
complete liquidation and dissolution of the Portfolio in conformity with the
provisions of the Fund's Declaration of Trust dated June 2, 1994, as amended
(the "Declaration"), and under Massachusetts law.


WHEREAS, the Fund's Board of Trustees (the "Board") has deemed that it is
advisable and in the best interests of the Portfolio and its Shareholders to
liquidate and to dissolve the Portfolio, and the Board, on April 25, 2002,
considered the matter and determined to recommend the termination of the
Portfolio pursuant to this Plan;


NOW, THEREFORE, the liquidation and dissolution of the Portfolio shall be
carried out in the manner hereinafter set forth:


1. Effective Date of Plan. This Plan shall be and become effective only
upon the adoption and approval of the Plan at a meeting of Shareholders
of the Portfolio ("Meeting") called for the purpose of voting upon the
Plan. Approval of the Plan is to be determined by the vote of a majority
of the outstanding shares of the Portfolio which means an affirmative
vote of the lesser of (1) a majority of the outstanding shares of the
Portfolio, or (2) 67% or more of the shares of the Portfolio represented
at the Meeting if more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the
Portfolio are present or represented by proxy. The date of such adoption
and approval of the Plan by Shareholders is hereinafter called the
"Effective Date."


2. Dissolution. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Date,
consistent with the provisions of this Plan, the Portfolio shall be
liquidated and dissolved pursuant to applicable provisions of
Massachusetts law.


3. Cessation of Business. After the Effective Date, the Portfolio shall not
engage in any business activities except for the purpose of winding up
its business and affairs, preserving the value of its assets and
distributing its assets to Shareholders in accordance with the
provisions of this Plan after the payment to (or reservation of assets
for payment to) all creditors of the Portfolio; provided that the
Portfolio shall, prior to the making of the final liquidating
distribution, continue to honor requests for the redemption of shares
and may, as determined to be appropriate by the Board, make payment of
dividends and other distributions to Shareholders and permit the
reinvestment thereof in additional shares.


4. Liquidation of Assets. The Portfolio shall cause the liquidation of its
assets to cash form as is practicable consistent with the terms of the
Plan.


5. Payment of Debts. As soon as practicable after the Effective Date, the
Portfolio shall determine and pay (or reserve sufficient amounts to pay)
the amount of all known or reasonably ascertainable liabilities of the
Portfolio incurred or expected to be incurred prior to the date of the
liquidating distribution provided in Section 6 below.


6. Liquidating Distribution. As soon as practicable after the Effective
Date, and in any event within sixty (60) days thereafter, the Portfolio
will mail the following to each Shareholder of record who has not





redeemed its shares: (i) a liquidating distribution equal to the
Shareholder's proportionate interest in the remaining assets of the
Portfolio (after the payments and creation of the reserves contemplated
by Section 5 above); and (ii) information concerning the sources of the
liquidating distribution.


7. Expenses of Liquidation and Dissolution. Except as may be otherwise
agreed to between the Portfolio and its investment manager, all expenses
incurred by or allocable to the Portfolio in carrying out this Plan and
dissolving the Portfolio, shall be borne by Morgan Stanley Investment
Advisors Inc.


8. Power of the Board of Trustees. The Board and, subject to the general
direction of the Board, the officers of the Portfolio, shall have
authority to do or authorize any and all acts and things as provided for
in this Plan and any and all such further acts and things as they may
consider necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Plan,
including without limitation, the execution and filing of all
certificates, documents, information returns, tax returns, forms, and
other papers which may be necessary or appropriate to implement this
Plan or which may be required by the provisions of the Investment
Company Act, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and applicable
Massachusetts law.


The death, resignation or other disability of any Trustee or any officer
of the Portfolio shall not impair the authority of the surviving or
remaining Trustees or officers to exercise any of the powers provided
for in this Plan.


9. Amendment of the Plan. The Board shall have the authority to authorize
such variations from or amendments to the provisions of this Plan (other
than the terms of the liquidating distribution) as may be necessary or
appropriate to effect the dissolution, complete liquidation and
termination of existence of the Portfolio, and the distribution of
assets to Shareholders in accordance with the purposes intended to be
accomplished by this Plan.

Dear Hartford Variable Annuity and/or Life Contract Owner:


On behalf of The Hartford and Morgan Stanley, I would like to take this
opportunity to inform you of the proposed closing of the Emerging Markets
portfolio (The "Emerging Markets Portfolio") of the Morgan Stanley Select
Dimensions Investment Series and to request your voting instructions on this
matter. As the owner of a variable annuity contract and/or variable life
insurance contract issued by Hartford Life Insurance Company or Hartford Life
and Annuity Insurance Company who has invested in the Emerging Markets
Portfolio sub-account, you are entitled to provide us with your voting
instructions.


The Board of Trustees of the Morgan Stanley Select Dimensions Investment
Series has recommended the liquidation of the Emerging Markets Portfolio. The
Emerging Markets Portfolio is a relatively small investment portfolio ($10.5
million) when compared with other investment portfolios with similar investment
objectives. As a result, the annual expense ratios for the Emerging Markets
Portfolio, without any expense reimbursement, have been higher than the ratios
of most similar, but larger, portfolios, and the Emerging Markets Portfolio
does not have the investment flexibility that larger funds have.


In order to liquidate the Emerging Markets Portfolio, the Fund must obtain
the consent of its Shareholders. Currently the Portfolio's Shareholders are two
insurance companies, Hartford Life Insurance Company or Hartford Life and
Annuity Insurance Company, whose variable contract owners are invested in the
Emerging Markets Portfolio. Each insurance company must give its variable
contract owners of record as of the close of business on June 4, 2002, the
right to instruct the insurance company as to the manner in which shares of the
Emerging Markets Portfolio attributable to the owner's variable contract should
be voted. If approved by Shareholders, the liquidation is expected to occur on
or about September 23, 2002.


To assist you in giving us your instructions, a Voting Instruction Form is
enclosed that reflects the number of shares of the Emerging Markets Portfolio
for which you are entitled to give us voting instructions. In addition, a
Notice of Special Meeting of Shareholders and a proxy statement are enclosed
which describe the matters to be voted on at the Special Meeting of
Shareholders.


If you have not transferred your contract value out of the Emerging
Markets Portfolio by the date of the liquidation, your contract value invested
in shares of the Emerging Markets Portfolio will be automatically transferred
to the variable account that invests in the Money Market Portfolio of Morgan
Stanley Select Dimensions Investment Series. From the date of this letter until
30 days after the date of the liquidation, you will be permitted to make one
free transfer of all contract value that you have invested in the Emerging
Markets Portfolio to other variable investment funds available under your
contract. Any limitations on transfers under your contract will not be affected
by this free transfer.


YOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT. Please read the enclosed proxy materials and
complete, date and sign the enclosed voting instruction forms. It is also
important that you consider using your free transfer right to transfer your
contract value out of the Emerging Markets Portfolio prior to the date of the
liquidation.





If you have any questions, please contact your Morgan Stanley Financial
Advisor, or call The Hartford at 1-800-862-6667, Monday through Friday, 8:00

a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Eastern time. Thank you for allowing us the opportunity to
help provide for your financial needs.

Dear Hartford Variable Annuity and/or Life Contract Owner:


On behalf of The Hartford and Morgan Stanley, I would like to take this
opportunity to inform you of the proposed closing of the North American

The Board of Trustees of the Morgan Stanley Select Dimensions Investment
Series has recommended the liquidation of the North American Government
Securities Portfolio. The North American Government Securities Portfolio is a
relatively small investment portfolio ($5.9 million) when compared with other
investment portfolios with similar investment objectives. As a result, the
annual expense ratios for the North American Government Securities Portfolio,
without any expense reimbursement, have been higher than the ratios of most
similar, but larger, portfolios, and the North American Government Securities
Portfolio does not have the investment flexibility that larger funds have.

If you have not transferred your contract value out of the North American
Government Securities Portfolio by the date of the liquidation, your contract
value invested in shares of the North American Government Securities Portfolio
will be automatically transferred to the variable account that invests in the
Money Market Portfolio of Morgan Stanley Select Dimensions Investment Series.
From the date of this letter until 30 days after the date of the liquidation,
you will be permitted to make one free transfer of all contract value that you

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

Overview of the Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment ETF | Direxion


























 






























Why KNOW? Why now?
Since inception, the Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment Shares ETF (Ticker: KNOW) has outperfomed the major U.S. stock indexes including the: S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, S&P SmallCap 600 and S&P1500 (source: Morningstar Direct). 
It makes sense. Corporate insiders− top officers, boards of directors, and major shareholders − have a natural edge over retail investors, and even financial analysts, because they typically know their businesses and industries better than anyone. That’s why, no matter how much research you do, or how much financial news you consume, you’re always a step behind those “in the know”.
The Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment Shares (KNOW) is designed to help long term-investors pursue better portfolio outcomes by using insider sentiment to seek alpha relative to S&P 500® Index.
With a net expense ratio of just 0.65%, this strategic index-based ETF provides investors with cost-effective access to stocks that corporate officers, directors, and shareholders who own more than 5% of each company’s stock, are accumulating.
This insider sentiment selection uses a screening methodology based on public-company filings and positive earnings analysis that provides the basis for the funds’ quantitatively-weighted indexes. The ETF is comprised of 100 companies selected from the S&P 1500 Index.
