Why is this contact information displayed?  

Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.

	PROSPECTUS




	THE INFORMATION IN THIS PROSPECTUS MAY BE CHANGED. THESE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE SOLD UNTIL THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION IS EFFECTIVE. THIS PROSPECTUS IS NOT AN OFFER TO SELL THESE SECURITIES AND IT IS NOT SOLICITING AN OFFER TO BUY THESE SECURITIES IN ANY STATE WHERE THE OFFER OR SALE IS NOT PERMITTED. THERE IS NO MINIMUM PURCHASE REQUIREMENT FOR THE OFFERING TO PROCEED.



	 



	RIZZEN INC.




	6,000,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK




	$0.02 PER SHARE






	This is the initial offering of common stock of Rizzen Inc. and no public market currently exists for the securities being offered. We are registering for sale a total of 6,000,000 shares of common stock at a fixed price of $0.02 per share to the general public in best efforts offering. We estimate our total offering registration costs to be approximately $8,000. There is no minimum number of shares that must be sold by us for the offering to proceed, and we will retain the proceeds from the sale of any of the offered shares. The offering is being conducted on a self-underwritten, best efforts basis, which means our President, Shuisheng Zhu, will attempt to sell the shares. We are making this offering without the involvement of underwriters or broker-dealers.





	This Prospectus will permit our President to sell the shares directly to the public, with no commission or other remuneration payable to him for any shares he may sell. Mr. Zhu will sell all the shares registered herein. In offering the securities on our behalf, he will rely on the safe harbor from broker-dealer registration set out in Rule 3a4-1 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. The shares will be offered at a fixed price of $0.02 per share for a period of two hundred and forty (240) days from the effective date of this prospectus. The offering shall terminate on the earlier of (i) when the offering period ends (240 days from the effective date of this prospectus), (ii) the date when the sale of all 6,000,000 shares is completed, (iii) when the Board of Directors decides that it is in the best interest of the Company to terminate the offering prior the completion of the sale of all 6,000,000 shares registered under the Registration Statement of which this Prospectus is part. 







	Rizzen Inc. is a development stage company and has recently started its operations. To date we have been involved primarily in organizational activities. We do not have sufficient capital to commence operations. Any investment in the shares offered herein involves a high degree of risk. You should only purchase shares if you can afford the loss of your investment. Our independent registered public accountant has issued an audit opinion which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.





	There has been no market for our securities and a public market may never develop, or, if any market does develop, it may not be sustained. Our common stock is not traded on any exchange or on the over-the-counter market. After the effective date of the registration statement relating to this prospectus, we hope to have a market maker file an application with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) for our common stock to be eligible for trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. To be eligible for quotation, issuers must remain current in their quarterly and annual filings with the SEC. If we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board. We do not yet have a market maker who has agreed to file such application. There can be no assurance that our common stock will ever be quoted on a stock exchange or a quotation service or that any market for our stock will develop.





	We are an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act).








	THE PURCHASE OF THE SECURITIES OFFERED THROUGH THIS PROSPECTUS INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY READ AND CONSIDER THE SECTION OF THIS PROSPECTUS ENTITLED RISK FACTORS ON PAGES 7 THROUGH 12 BEFORE BUYING ANY SHARES OF RIZZEN INC.S COMMON STOCK.









	NEITHER THE SEC NOR ANY STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION HAS APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED OF THESE SECURITIES OR PASSED UPON THE ADEQUACY OR ACCURACY OF THIS PROSPECTUS. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.







	THE INFORMATION IN THIS PROSPECTUS IS NOT COMPLETE AND MAY BE CHANGED. WE MAY NOT SELL THESE SECURITIES UNTIL THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION IS EFFECTIVE. THIS PROSPECTUS IS NOT AN OFFER TO SELL THESE SECURITIES AND IT IS NOT SOLICITING AN OFFER TO BUY THESE SECURITIES IN ANY STATE WHERE THE OFFER OR SALE IS NOT PERMITTED.

	PROSPECTUS SUMMARY



	 



	AS USED IN THIS PROSPECTUS, UNLESS THE CONTEXT OTHERWISE REQUIRES, WE, US, OUR, AND RIZZEN INC. REFERS TO RIZZEN INC. THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY DOES NOT CONTAIN ALL OF THE INFORMATION THAT MAY BE IMPORTANT TO YOU. YOU SHOULD READ THE ENTIRE PROSPECTUS BEFORE MAKING AN INVESTMENT DECISION TO PURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK.



	 



	RIZZEN INC.



	 


	Rizzen Inc. was incorporated in Nevada on October 21, 2015. We are development stage company and intends to provide vending and shipping services of electronic toys of various kinds manufactured in the Republic of China. The company sees its primary goal as to distribute electronic kids toys of various price categories to both small and medium-sized vendors.





	We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to develop our business operations (See Description of Business and Use of Proceeds). To implement our plan of operations we require a minimum of $52,000 for the next twelve months as described in our Plan of Operations. There is no assurance that we will generate any revenue in the first 12 months after completion our offering or ever generate any revenue.





	Being a development stage company, we have very limited operating history. If we do not generate any revenue we may need a minimum of $10,000 of additional funding to pay for ongoing SEC filing requirements. We do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing. Our principal executive offices are located at 201-5, Xin Jia Garden, Heng Qing Village, Zhuhai, China 519000. Our phone number is +852-8191-5516.



	From inception (October 21, 2015) until the date of this filing, we have had limited operating activities. Our financial statements from inception (October 21, 2015) through January 31, 2016, reports no revenue and a net loss of $982. Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit opinion for Rizzen Inc., which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. To date, we have developed our business plan.





	As of the date of this prospectus, there is no public trading market for our common stock and no assurance that a trading market for our securities will ever develop.





	Proceeds from this offering are required for us to proceed with your business plan over the next twelve months. We require minimum funding of approximately $52,000 to conduct our proposed operations and pay all expenses for a minimum period of one year including expenses associated with this offering and maintaining a reporting status with the SEC. If we are unable to obtain minimum funding of approximately $52,000, our business may fail. Since we are presently in the development stage of our business, we can provide no assurance that we will successfully sell any products or services related to our planned activities.

	RISK FACTORS



	 



	AN INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE RISKS DESCRIBED BELOW AND THE OTHER INFORMATION IN THIS PROSPECTUS BEFORE INVESTING IN OUR COMMON STOCK. IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS OCCUR, OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE SERIOUSLY HARMED. THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK, WHEN AND IF WE TRADE AT A LATER DATE, COULD DECLINE DUE TO ANY OF THESE RISKS, AND YOU MAY LOSE ALL OR PART OF YOUR INVESTMENT.









	RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS









	BECAUSE OUR AUDITORS HAVE RAISED A GOING CONCERN, THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTY THAT WE WILL CONTINUE OPERATIONS IN WHICH CASE YOU COULD LOSE YOUR INVESTMENT.






	Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty about our ability to continue in business. As such we may have to cease operations and you could lose your investment.






	WE MAY CONTINUE TO LOSE MONEY, AND IF WE DO NOT ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE OUR BUSINESS.






	We are company with limited operations, have incurred expenses and have losses. In addition, we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses. As a result, we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability, which may not occur. We expect our operating expenses to increase as a result of our planned expansion. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may be unable to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. We expect to have quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in revenues, expenses, losses and cash flow, some of which could be significant. Results of operations will depend upon numerous factors, some beyond our control, including regulatory actions, market acceptance of our products and services, new products and service introductions, and competition.






	7 |
















	WE ARE SOLELY DEPENDENT UPON THE FUNDS TO BE RAISED IN THIS OFFERING TO START OUR BUSINESS, THE PROCEEDS OF WHICH MAY BE INSUFFICIENT TO ACHIEVE REVENUES AND PROFITABLE OPERATIONS. WE MAY NEED TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING WHICH MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE.



	 


	Our current operating funds are less than necessary to complete our intended operations. We need the proceeds from this offering to start our operations as described in the Plan of Operation section of this prospectus. As of January 31, 2016, we had cash in the amount of $6,060 and liabilities of $1,042. As of this date, we have no income and just recently started our operation. The proceeds of this offering may not be sufficient for us to achieve revenues and profitable operations. We need additional funds to achieve a sustainable sales level where ongoing operations can be funded out of revenues. There is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us.





	We require minimum funding of approximately $52,000 to conduct our proposed operations for a period of one year. If we are not able to raise this amount, or if we experience a shortage of funds prior to funding we may utilize funds from Shuisheng Zhu, our president, treasurer and director, who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for professional fees, including fees payable in connection with the filing of this registration statement and operation expenses. However, Mr. Zhu has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. After one year we may need additional financing. If we do not generate any revenue we may need a minimum of $10,000 of additional funding to pay for ongoing SEC filing requirements. We do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing.


	 


	If we are successful in raising the funds from this offering, we plan to commence activities to continue our operations. We cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funds to continue our business plan according to our plan of operations.






	WE ARE A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY AND HAVE COMMENCED LIMITED OPERATIONS IN OUR BUSINESS. WE EXPECT TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT OPERATING LOSSES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

	 





	We were incorporated on October 21, 2015 and to date have been involved primarily in organizational activities. We have commenced limited business operations. Accordingly, we have no way to evaluate the likelihood that our business will be successful. Potential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by new companies and the high rate of failure of such enterprises. The likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays encountered in connection with the operations that we plan to undertake. These potential problems include, but are not limited to, unanticipated problems relating to the ability to generate sufficient cash flow to operate our business, and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates. We anticipate that we will incur increased operating expenses without realizing any revenues. We expect to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future. We recognize that if the effectiveness of our business plan is not forthcoming, we will not be able to continue business operations. There is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful, and it is doubtful that we will generate any operating revenues or ever achieve profitable operations. If we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks, our business will most likely fail.








	WE HAVE LIMITED SALES AND MARKETING EXPERIENCE, WHICH INCREASES THE RISK THAT OUR BUSINESS WILL FAIL.




	 



	We have no experience in the marketing of electronic toys distribution and have only nominal sales and marketing experience. Our future success will depend, among other factors, upon whether our services can be sold at a profitable price and the extent to which consumers acquire, adopt, and continue to use them. There can be no assurance that our business will gain wide acceptance in its targeted markets or that we will be able to effectively market our services.






	8 |
















	WE ARE IN A COMPETITIVE MARKET WHICH COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO GAIN MARKET SHARE WHICH COULD HARM OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.





	 




	The business of niche of electronic toys distribution is very competitive. Barriers to entry are relatively low, and we face competitive pressures from companies anxious to join this niche. There are a number of successful entities operated by proven companies that offer similar niche services, which may prevent us from gaining enough market share to become successful.  These competitors have existing customers that may form a large part of our targeted client base, and such clients may be hesitant to switch over from already established competitors to our service.  If we cannot gain enough market share, our business and our financial performance will be adversely affected.






	SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS MAY BE ABLE TO USE THEIR FINANCIAL STRENGTH TO DOMINATE THE MARKET, WHICH MAY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUES.



	Some of our competitors may be much larger companies than us and very well capitalized. They could choose to use their greater resources to finance their continued participation and penetration of this market, which may impede our ability to generate sufficient revenue to cover our costs. Their better financial resources could allow them to significantly out spend us on research and development, as well as marketing and production. We might not be able to maintain our ability to compete in this circumstance.






	WE CANNOT GUARANTEE FUTURE CUSTOMERS. EVEN IF WE OBTAIN CUSTOMERS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO GENERATE A PROFIT. IF THAT OCCURS WE WILL HAVE TO CEASE OPERATIONS.






	We have not identified any customers and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to attract future customers. Even if we obtain new customers for our service, there is no guarantee that we will make a profit. If we are unable to attract enough customers to operate profitably, we will have to suspend or cease operations.






	BECAUSE WE ARE SMALL AND DO NOT HAVE MUCH CAPITAL, OUR MARKETING CAMPAIGN MAY NOT BE ENOUGH TO ATTRACT SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS TO OPERATE PROFITABLY. IF WE DO NOT MAKE A PROFIT, WE WILL SUSPEND OR CEASE OPERATIONS.






	Due to the fact we are small and do not have much capital, we must limit our marketing activities and may not be able to make our services known to potential customers. Because we will be limiting our marketing activities, we may not be able to attract enough customers to operate profitably. If we cannot operate profitably, we may have to suspend or cease operations.






	BECAUSE OUR PRESIDENT, TREASURER AND DIRECTOR WILL OWN MORE THAN 50% OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK, HE WILL MAKE AND CONTROL CORPORATE DECISIONS THAT MAY BE DISADVANTAGEOUS TO MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS.






	Mr. Zhu, our president, treasurer and director, will own more than 50% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Accordingly, he will have significant influence in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters, including the election of directors, mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and also the power to prevent or cause a change in control. The interests of Mr. Zhu may differ from the interests of the other stockholders and may result in corporate decisions that are disadvantageous to other shareholders.






	WE DEPEND TO A SIGNIFICANT EXTENT ON CERTAIN KEY PERSON, THE LOSS OF WHOM MAY MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COMPANY.






	Currently, we have only two employee, our president, treasurer, director, Mr. Shuisheng Zhu and Mr. Aleksandr Deshin, our secretary. We depend entirely on Shuisheng Zhu, our president, treasurer, director for all of our operations. The loss of Mr. Zhu would have a substantial negative effect on our company and may cause our business to fail. Mr. Zhu has not been compensated for his services since our incorporation, and it is highly unlikely that he will receive any compensation unless and until we generate substantial revenues. There is intense competition for skilled personnel and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel on acceptable terms. The loss of Mr. Zhus services could prevent us from completing the development of our plan of operation and our business. In the event of the loss of services of such personnel, no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain the services of adequate replacement personnel.





	We do not have any employment agreements or maintain key person life insurance policies on our officer and director. We do not anticipate entering into employment agreements with him or acquiring key man insurance in the foreseeable future.









	9 |










	BECAUSE OUR PRESIDENT, TREASURER AND DIRECTOR WILL ONLY BE DEVOTING LIMITED TIME TO OUR OPERATIONS, OUR OPERATIONS MAY BE SPORADIC WHICH MAY RESULT IN PERIODIC INTERRUPTIONS OR SUSPENSIONS OF OPERATIONS. THIS ACTIVITY COULD PREVENT US FROM ATTRACTING ENOUGH CUSTOMERS AND RESULT IN A LACK OF REVENUES WHICH MAY CAUSE US TO CEASE OPERATIONS.






	Shuisheng Zhu, our president, treasurer and director will only be devoting limited time to our operations. He will be devoting approximately 20 hours a week to our operations. Because our sole office and director will only be devoting limited time to our operations, our operations may be sporadic and occur at times which are convenient to him. As a result, operations may be periodically interrupted or suspended which could result in a lack of revenues and a possible cessation of operations.






	OUR PRESIDENT, TREASURER AND DIRECTOR HAS NO EXPERIENCE MANAGING A PUBLIC COMPANY WHICH IS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN DISCLOSURE CONTROL AND PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.






	We have never operated as a public company. Shuisheng Zhu, our president, treasurer and director has no experience managing a public company which is required to establish and maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. As a result, we may not be able to operate successfully as a public company, even if our operations are successful. We plan to comply with all of the various rules and regulations, which are required for a public company that is reporting company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. However, if we cannot operate successfully as a public company, your investment may be materially adversely affected.






	WE ARE AN EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY UNDER THE JOBS ACT, AND WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN IF THE REDUCED DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO EMERGING GROWTH COMPANIES WILL MAKE OUR COMMON STOCK LESS ATTRACTIVE TO INVESTORS.






	We qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to:





	-


	have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;


	-


	provide an auditor attestation with respect to managements report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting;


	-


	comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditors report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);


	-


	submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as say-on-pay and say-on-frequency; and


	-


	disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the Chief Executives compensation to median employee compensation.


	 


	In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.





	We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues is $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates is $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.





	Until such time, however, we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.

	RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS OFFERING









	BECAUSE THE OFFERING PRICE HAS BEEN ARBITRARILY SET BY THE COMPANY, YOU MAY NOT REALIZE A RETURN ON YOUR INVESTMENT UPON RESALE OF YOUR SHARES.



	 


	The offering price and other terms and conditions relative to the Companys shares have been arbitrarily determined by us and do not bear any relationship to assets, earnings, book value or any other objective financial criteria. Additionally, as the Company was formed on October 21, 2015, and has only a limited operating history with no earnings, the price of the offered shares is not based on its past earnings, and no investment banker, appraiser, or other independent third party, has been consulted concerning the offering price for the shares or the fairness of the offering price used for the shares, as such our stockholders may not be able to receive a return on their investment when they sell their shares of common stock.






	WE ARE SELLING THIS OFFERING WITHOUT AN UNDERWRITER AND MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL ANY SHARES.



	 


	This offering is self-underwritten, that is, we are not going to engage the services of an underwriter to sell the shares; we intend to sell our shares through our President, who will receive no commissions. There is no guarantee that he will be able to sell any of the shares. Unless he is successful in receiving the proceeds in the amount of $120,000 from this offering, we may have to seek alternative financing to implement our business plan.






	THE REGULATION OF PENNY STOCKS BY THE SEC AND FINRA MAY DISCOURAGE THE TRADABILITY OF THE COMPANY'S SECURITIES.



	 


	The shares being offered are defined as a penny stock under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and rules of the Commission. The Exchange Act and such penny stock rules generally impose additional sales practice and disclosure requirements on broker-dealers who sell our securities to persons other than certain accredited investors who are, generally, institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 ($300,000 jointly with spouse), or in transactions not recommended by the broker-dealer. For transactions covered by the penny stock rules, a broker dealer must make certain mandated disclosures in penny stock transactions, including the actual sale or purchase price and actual bid and offer quotations, the compensation to be received by the broker-dealer and certain associated persons, and deliver certain disclosures required by the Commission. Consequently, the penny stock rules may make it difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase, if at all.






	OUR PRESIDENT, MR. ZHU DOES NOT HAVE ANY PRIOR EXPERIENCE OFFERING AND SELLING SECURITIES , AND OUR OFFERING DOES NOT REQUIRE A MIMIMUM AMOUNT TO BE RAISED. AS A RESULT OF THIS WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RAISE ENOUGH FUNDS TO COMMENCE AND SUSTAIN OUR BUSINESS AND INVESTORS MAY LOSE THEIR ENTIRE INVESTMENT.






	Mr. Zhu does not have any experience conducting a securities offering. Consequently, we may not be able to raise any funds successfully. Also, the best effort offering does not require a minimum amount to be raised. If we are not able to raise sufficient funds, we may not be able to fund our operations as planned, and our business will suffer and your investment may be materially adversely affected. Our inability to successfully conduct a best-effort offering could be the basis of your losing your entire investment in us.








	DUE TO THE LACK OF A TRADING MARKET FOR OUR SECURITIES, YOU MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY SELLING ANY SHARES YOU PURCHASE IN THIS OFFERING.



	We are not registered on any market or public stock exchange. There is presently no demand for our common stock and no public market exists for the shares being offered in this prospectus. We plan to contact a market maker immediately following the completion of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board (OTCBB). The OTCBB is a regulated quotation service that displays real-time quotes, last sale prices and volume information in over-the-counter securities. The OTCBB is not an issuer listing service, market or exchange. Although the OTCBB does not have any listing requirements, to be eligible for quotation on the OTCBB, issuers must remain current in their filings with the SEC or applicable regulatory authority. If we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board. Market makers are not permitted to begin quotation of a security whose issuer does not meet this filing requirement. Securities already quoted on the OTCBB that become delinquent in their required filings will be removed following a 30 to 60 day grace period if they do not make their required filing during that time. We cannot guarantee that our application will be accepted or approved and our stock listed and quoted for sale. As of the date of this filing, there have been no discussions or understandings between Rizzen Inc. and anyone acting on our behalf, with any market maker regarding participation in a future trading market for our securities. If no market is ever developed for our common stock, it will be difficult for you to sell any shares you purchase in this offering. In such a case, you may find that you are unable to achieve any benefit from your investment or liquidate your shares without considerable delay, if at all. In addition, if we fail to have our common stock quoted on a public trading market, your common stock will not have a quantifiable value and it may be difficult, if not impossible, to ever resell your shares, resulting in an inability to realize any value from your investment.









	11 |










	WE WILL INCUR ONGOING COSTS AND EXPENSES FOR SEC REPORTING AND COMPLIANCE. WITHOUT REVENUE WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE, MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR INVESTORS TO SELL THEIR SHARES, IF AT ALL.



	 


	The estimated cost of this registration statement is $8,000 which will be paid from offering proceeds. If the offering proceeds are less than registration cost, we will have to utilize funds from Shuisheng Zhu, our president, treasurer and director, who has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process. Mr. Zhus verbal agreement to provide us loans for registration costs is non- binding and discretionary. After the effective date of this prospectus, we will be required to file annual, quarterly and current reports, or other information with the SEC as provided by the Securities Exchange Act. We will voluntarily continue reporting in the absence of an SEC reporting obligation. We plan to contact a market maker immediately following the close of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board. To be eligible for quotation, issuers must remain current in their filings with the SEC. In order for us to remain in compliance we will require future revenues to cover the cost of these filings, which could comprise a substantial portion of our available cash resources. The costs associated with being a publicly traded company in the next 12 month will be approximately $10,000. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to remain in compliance it may be difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase, if at all. Also, if we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board.











	THE COMPANY'S INVESTORS MAY SUFFER FUTURE DILUTION DUE TO ISSUANCES OF SHARES FOR VARIOUS CONSIDERATIONS IN THE FUTURE.



	Our Articles of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of 75,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of which 6,000,000 shares are currently issued and outstanding. If we sell the 6,000,000 shares being offered in this offering, we would have 12,000,000 shares issued and outstanding. As discussed in the Dilution section below, the issuance of the shares of common stock described in this prospectus will result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common stock held by our existing shareholders. The issuance of common stock for future services or acquisitions or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by our investors, and might have an adverse effect on any trading market for our common stock.









	FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS



	 


	This prospectus contains forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. We use words such as anticipate, believe, plan, expect, future, intend, and similar expressions to identify such forward-looking statements. Investors should be aware that all forward-looking statements contained within this filing are good faith estimates of management as of the date of this filing. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the risks faced by us as described in the Risk Factors section and elsewhere in this prospectus.

	The above figures represent only estimated costs. The estimated cost of this registration statement is $8,000 which will be paid from offering proceeds. If the offering proceeds are less than registration costs, Shuisheng Zhu, our president and director, has verbally agreed to loan the Company funds to complete the registration process. Mr. Zhus verbal agreement to provide us loans for registration costs is non- binding and discretionary. Also, these loans would be necessary if the proceeds from this offering will not be sufficient to implement our business plan and maintain reporting status and quotation on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board when and if our common stocks become eligible for trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. Mr. Zhu will not be paid any compensation or anything from the proceeds of this offering. There is no due date for the repayment of the funds advanced by Mr. Zhu. Mr. Zhu will be repaid from revenues of operations if and when we generate revenues to pay the obligation.

	DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE



	 


	The offering price of the shares has been determined arbitrarily by us. The price does not bear any relationship to our assets, book value, earnings, or other established criteria for valuing a privately held company. In determining the number of shares to be offered and the offering price, we took into consideration our cash on hand and the amount of money we would need to implement our business plan. Accordingly, the offering price should not be considered an indication of the actual value of the securities.








	DILUTION



	 


	Dilution represents the difference between the Offering price and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of this Offering. Net tangible book value is the amount that results from subtracting total liabilities and from total assets. Dilution arises mainly as a result of our arbitrary determination of the Offering price of the shares being offered. Dilution of the value of the shares you purchase is also a result of the lower book value of the shares held by our existing stockholder.





	The historical net tangible book value as of January 31, 2016 was $5,018 or approximately $0.0008 per share. Historical net tangible book value per share of common stock is equal to our total tangible assets less total liabilities, divided by the number of shares of common stock outstanding as of January 31, 2016.





	The following table sets forth as of January 31, 2016, the number of shares of common stock purchased from us and the total consideration paid by our existing stockholders and by new investors in this offering if new investors purchase 50%, 75% or 100% of the offering, after deduction of offering expenses payable by us, assuming a purchase price in this offering of $0.02 per share of common stock.

	MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION



	You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this prospectus. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this prospectus, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the Risk Factors section of this prospectus for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.





	We qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to:


	 











	 




	




	 




	have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;
















	




	 




	provide an auditor attestation with respect to managements report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting;

















	 




	




	 




	comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditors report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);





	 











	 




	




	 




	submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as say-on-pay and say-on-frequency; and





	 











	 




	




	 




	disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEOs compensation to median employee compensation.





	 


	In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.





	We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues is $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates is $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.


	 


	Our cash balance was $6,060 as of January 31, 2016. We believe our cash balance is not sufficient to fund our operations for any period of time. We have been utilizing and may utilize funds from Shuisheng Zhu, our Chairman and President, who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for offering costs, filing fees, and professional fees. As of January 31, 2016, Mr. Zhu has advanced to us $1,042. Mr. Zhu, however, has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. In order to implement our plan of operations for the next twelve month period, we require a minimum of $52,000 of funding from this offering. Being a development stage company, we have very limited operating history we do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing. Our principal executive offices are located at 201-5, Xin Jia Garden, Heng Qing Village, Zhuhai, China 519000. Our phone number is +852-8191-5516.





	We are a development stage company and we have generated no revenue to date. Our full business plan entails activities described in the Plan of Operation section below. Long term financing beyond the maximum aggregate amount of this offering may be required to expand our business. The exact amount of funding will depend on the scale of our development and expansion. We do not currently have planned our expansion, and we have not decided yet on the scale of our development and expansion and on exact amount of funding needed for our long term financing. If we do not generate any revenue we may need a minimum of $10,000 of additional funding at the end of the twelve month period described in our Plan of Operation below to maintain a reporting status.









	14 |









	Our independent registered public accountant has issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. This is because we have not generated revenues and no revenues are anticipated until we complete our initial business development. There is no assurance we will ever reach that stage.





	To meet our need for cash we are attempting to raise money from this offering. If we are unable to successfully find customers we may quickly use up the proceeds from this offering and will need to find alternative sources. At the present time, we have not made any arrangements to raise additional cash, other than through this offering.





	If we need additional cash and cannot raise it, we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash, or cease operations entirely. Even if we raise $120,000 from this offering, we may need more funds for ongoing business operations after the first year, and would have to obtain additional funding.






	PLAN OF OPERATION






	We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 21, 2015. We have never declared bankruptcy, have never been in receivership, and have never been involved in any legal action or proceedings. Since incorporation, we have not made any significant purchase or sale of assets. We are a development stage company that has not generated any revenue and just recently started our operations. If we are unable to successfully find clients who will use our service, we may quickly use up the proceeds from this offering.





	We intend to provide vending and shipping services of electronic toys of various kinds manufactured in the Republic of China. The company sees its primary goal as to distribute electronic kids toys of various price categories to both small and medium-sized vendors.





	We intend to spend money on research and development when our business plan is complete in order to develop our business. We do not expect to purchase or sell plant or significant equipment. Further we do not expect significant changes in the number of employees.





	Our plan of operations is as follows:






	Complete Our Public Offering






	We expect to complete our public offering within 240 days after the effectiveness of our registration statement by the Securities and Exchange Commissions. We intend to concentrate our efforts on raising capital during this period. Our operations will be limited due to the limited amount of funds on hand. Upon completion of our public offering, our specific goal is to profitably sell our services. If we are unable to obtain minimum funding of approximately $52,000 (If 50% of the shares sold), our business may fail.





	Our plan of operations following the completion is as follows:








	Gathering of market information (1-2 months)





	No costs





	We are going to search for electronic kids toys plants around of China. We plan to study plants assortment and estimate quality and price range of electronic kids toys. We plan to find the optimal manufactures and negotiate agreements with them.








	Office and Warehouse (1st-3d months)





	$4,000-$5,000





	To successfully perform basic services it is estimated that our company would demand a PC to be connected to the Internet in order to exchange up-to-date information with toys manufacturers and their stock databases, concerning the goods. Laptops for the sales managers and a server to store our customers database and the information related to it would be another state of expenditure. The company would need an office customers and manufacturers might wish to contact to, if any information regarding services needed. We also plan to lease the small (about 1000 sq.ft) warehouse with prepared shelves to store the electronic toys for distribution. Provided that only 50% of shares are sold, the office might be equipped with simple and basic furniture, basic stationery, via phone, a fax, a printer, and two computers powerful enough to perform everyday operations, taking orders online, for instance. Provided that if 75% of shares are sold the company could consider buying better equipment. In case if 100% shares are sold, the company would consider renting an office big enough for the staff, buying all furniture needed, more powerful computers able to perform everyday operations, as well as website maintenance directly from the office.









	15 |












	Website (1st-6th months)





	$5,000-$7,000





	Once the company incorporated it is likely to need a website where all the goods are planned to be displayed. In case if 50% shares sold we would order a website of a simple design with the functions of a webstore. In case of more than 50% shares sold, we are likely to order a website designed according current trends, with embedded animation to advertise the goods. In case if 100% of shares sold, we are likely employ a multifunctional website with functions of a webstore, embedded animation and embedded video advertisements to promote either particular goods or particular vendors, with the built-in functions to order a call from the support centre, the website that would monitor the customer's activity, in order to offer them the goods they would likely need.








	Marketing (3th-12th months)





	$30,000-$75,000





	Primarily, we plan to use internet marketing tools in our marketing campaign. We plan to advertise our services and product on the following websites: www.alibaba.com, www.ebay.com, social networks such as www.facebook.com, and other specialized websites with using context ad. Our advertising budget will be spent on paying for any advertising, long distance phone calls, designing and printing of business catalogs, and traveling expenses. We plan to use internet catalogs and SEO in web search engines such as www.google.com (with using Google Adwords) and www.baidu.com. Also we are going to issue monthly printed catalog and send it to our clients. We will take part on the specialized forums and exhibitions to present our service to potential clients. We plan that it will cost at least $30,000 to start our marketing campaign. If we sell 75% of the shares offered we plan to spend approximately $22,500 more. In this case, the marketing campaign expenses will be approximately $52,500. In the event we sell all of the shares offered we plan to hire professional marketing agency to promote our service, therefore it will be approximately $75,000.








	Sales Manager (6th-12th months)





	$10,000-$20,000





	If we sell 50% of the shares offered we plan to hire a sales person to sell our service by calls and direct mails. The job of such sales person will be to find additional customers for us. If we sell 75% or 100% of the shares offered we are going to increase the quantity of sales associates to 2 and 3 accordingly.

	OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS



	 


	We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.









	16 |










	LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY; NEED FOR ADDITIONAL CAPITAL



	 


	There is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in the start-up stage of operations and have not generated any revenues. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products.


	We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholder.






	Results of operations








	From Inception on October 21, 2015 to January 31, 2016







	During the period we incorporated the company, prepared a business plan. Our loss since inception is $982. We have just recently started our business operations, however, will not start significant operations until we have completed this offering.


	 







	LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES



	 


	As of January 31, 2016, the Company had $6,060 cash and our liabilities were $1,042, comprising $1,042 owed to Shuisheng Zhu, our president, treasurer and director. As of January 31, 2016 our cash balance was $6,060. The available capital reserves of the Company are not sufficient for the Company to remain operational. We require minimum funding of approximately $52,000 to conduct our proposed operations and pay all expenses for a minimum period of one year including expenses associated with this offering and maintaining a reporting status with the SEC.





	Since inception, we have sold 5,000,000 shares of common stocks to our president, treasurer and director, at a price of $0.001 per share, for net proceeds of $5,000 and 1,000,000 shares of common stocks to our secretary, at a price of $0.001 per share, for net proceeds of $1,000





	We are attempting to raise funds to proceed with our plan of operations. We will have to utilize funds from Shuisheng Zhu, our president, treasurer and director, who has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process if offering proceeds are less than registration costs. However, Mr. Zhu has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. Mr. Zhus verbal agreement to provide us loans for registration costs is non- binding and discretionary. To proceed with our operations within 12 months, we need a minimum of $52,000. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to sell all the shares required to satisfy our 12 month financial requirements. If we are successful, any money raised will be applied to the items set forth in the Use of Proceeds section of this prospectus. We will attempt to raise at least the minimum funds necessary to proceed with our plan of operations. In the long term we may need additional financing. We do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing. Obtaining additional funding will be subject to a number of factors, including general market conditions, investor acceptance of our business plan and initial results from our business operations. These factors may impact the timing, amount, terms or conditions of additional financing available to us. There is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us.





	Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion, meaning that there is substantial doubt if we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital. No substantial revenues are anticipated until we have completed the financing from this offering and implemented our plan of operations. Our only source for cash at this time is investments by others in this offering. We must raise cash to implement our strategy and stay in business. The amount of the offering will likely allow us to operate for at least one year and have the capital resources required to cover the material costs with becoming a publicly reporting. The Company anticipates over the next 12 months the cost of being a reporting public company will be approximately $10,000.











	17 |









	The Company will have to meet all the financial disclosure and reporting requirements associated with being a publicly reporting company. The Companys management will have to spend additional time on policies and procedures to make sure it is compliant with various regulatory requirements, especially that of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This additional corporate governance time required of management could limit the amount of time management has to implement is business plan and impede the speed of its operations.





	Should the Company fail to raise a minimum of $52,000 under this offering the Company would be forced to scale back or abandon the implementation of its 12-month plan of operations.












	DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS



	 


	The company sees its primary goal as to distribute electronic kids toys of various price categories to both small and medium-sized vendors, and individuals. Within the process of development changes in business strategy might occur, in order to provide better service, or make the business more profitable.





	Our principal office address is located at 201-5, Xin Jia Garden, Heng Qing Village, Zhuhai, China 519000. Our telephone number is +852-8191-5516. Our plan of operation is forward-looking and there is no assurance that we will ever reach profitable operations. We are a development stage company and have not earned any revenue. It is likely that we will not be able to achieve profitability and would be forced to cease operations due to the lack of funding.






	Main business concept






	The company intends to provide vending and shipping services of electronic toys of various kinds manufactured in the Republic of China.





	For our customers convenience we consider developing a website with functions of online store, which, we expect, can make ordering of goods easier and more enjoyable. We consider the Internet to be our main marketplace, all our advertising is likely to come online in a form of clickable ads (banners) placed on the websites related to kids merchandise. We intend to increase awareness of our company by placing our video commercials within the video-streaming services (YouTube, Vimeo, Hulu, Netflix and others) that provide video for children, thereby attracting attention of parents, whom we refer to as our potential clients.





	Once the company starts running, any to manufacturers is planned to be given an option to be displayed on the website, after lodging a proper corresponding request. We plan to charge manufacturers for occupying positions on our website, offering professionally produced ads and other displaying materials.





	The services regarding toys, are aimed at different kids categories, from toddlers to teenagers. We plan to offer the goods that might be interesting to kids of various ages:





	1) Electronic toys for boys, such as remotely controlled cars, planes, helicopters, robots etc.


	2) Electronic toys for girls, such as dancing or talking dolls or animals.


	3) Electronic music instruments for kids of both genders, such as synthesizers or guitars, toy replicas of phones, tablets or computers.


	4) Parts for DIY (Do-It-Yourself) toys.


	5) Spare parts, wear parts (such as batteries) and accessories.





	This is a preliminary list which might be prolonged or shortened, or re-sorted later depending on demand or on manufacturers ability to ship some certain items. Once the company starts working, the price of the service will depend only on the price imposed by the vendor.






	Clients






	Electronic toys market is a market of mass consumption. Therefore, electronic toys distribution business is characterized by stable demand. Primary consumers are trade companies specializing in realization of toys and products for kids, large store chains and hypermarkets, gift shops, wholesale warehouses of toys. Our potential customers are likely to be those who search for relatively cheap electronic toys for kids and other merchandise of a decent quality. We expect to get orders from small and medium sized retailers (to buy large shippings), toy retailing shops, entertaining agencies, as well as interested individuals (looking for a good present, for instance).





	Currently, two large markets have been selected: Europe and North America. These markets are viewed as major with high purchasing power. These market outlets are our top priority due to their geographic proximity to China, which will allow to significantly reduce the transportation costs and, subsequently, the cost of finished products.

	Marketing and advertising






	As the company is about to operate online, we see the Internet as our main marketing and advertising space. We plan to advertise our services and product on the following websites: www.alibaba.com, www.ebay.com, social networks such as www.facebook.com, and other specialized websites with using context ad. Our advertising budget will be spent on paying for any advertising, long distance phone calls, designing and printing of business catalogs, and traveling expenses. We plan to use internet catalogs and SEO in web search engines such as www.google.com (with using Google Adwords) and www.baidu.com. Also we are going to issue monthly printed catalog and send it to our clients. We will take part on the specialized forums and exhibitions to present our service to potential clients. Therefore, the primary steps to be taken look as follows:


	- Promotion via SEO (Search Engine optimisation) to bring the name to the top in search queries;


	- Video advertisements played before Youtube videos for kids.


	- Video commercials embedded or web banners on the websites related to toys or electronic goods;


	- Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram webpages to demonstrate the variety of goods a customer could choose from, as well as to keep loyal customers updated on the services and all the specter of goods.


	- In addition, as the part of customers support, we might set up a chat on popular messaging platforms (Telegam channels or Viber group chats), where up-to-date information might also be posted.








	Competition






	The electronic toys industry is intensely competitive. We will compete against a number of large well-established companies with greater name recognition, a more comprehensive offering of products, and with substantially larger resources than ours; including financial and marketing.  We believe that our narrow focus is one of our key factors to success. As the business grows we intend to expand influence in geographical terms, and we plan to expand to markets related childrens merchandise.






	Revenue






	We plan to generate our revenue by selling electronic toys. Our products will be offered at prices marked-up from 20% to 30% of our cost.

	 

	Our clients will be asked to 100% prepay for the products. Clients will choose any payment options they like. Clients will be responsible to cover the shipping costs. In case our customers would like to use our consulting service regarding to the shipping we will ask plus 3% additional to our price and will include a shipping company price and our service fees in a final bill.






	Insurance






	We do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are made a party of a products liability action, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation.

	CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS



	 


	Shuisheng Zhu will not be paid for any underwriting services that he performs on our behalf with respect to this offering.





	Other than Mr. Zhu purchase of founders shares from the Company as stated below, there is nothing of value (including money, property, contracts, options or rights of any kind), received or to be received, by Mr. Zhu, directly or indirectly, from the Company.





	On January 13, 2016, we issued 5,000,000 shares of restricted common stock to Shuisheng Zhu, our president, treasurer and director in consideration of $5,000 and on January 26, 2016, we issued 1,000,000 shares of restricted common stock to Aleksandr Deshin, our secretary in consideration of $1,000. Further, Mr. Zhu has advanced funds to us. As of January 31, 2016, Mr. Zhu has advanced to us $1,042. Mr. Zhu will not be repaid from the proceeds of this offering. There is no due date for the repayment of the funds advanced by Mr. Zhu. Mr. Zhu will be repaid from revenues of operations if and when we generate revenues to pay the obligation. There is no assurance that we will ever generate revenues from our operations. The obligation to Mr. Zhu does not bear interest. There is no written agreement evidencing the advancement of funds by Mr. Zhu or the repayment of the funds to Mr. Zhu. The entire transaction was oral. We have a verbal agreement with Mr. Zhu that, if necessary, he will loan the company funds to complete the registration process.

In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire the shares (for example, upon exercise of an option) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares outstanding is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person (and only such person) by reason of these acquisition rights. As of January 31, 2016, there were 6,000,000 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding.

	Future sales by existing stockholders






	5,000,000 shares of common stock were issued to our president, treasurer and director and 1,000,000 shares of common stock were issued to our secretary, all of which are restricted securities, as defined in Rule 144 of the Rules and Regulations of the SEC promulgated under the Securities Act. Under Rule 144, the shares can be publicly sold, subject to volume restrictions and restrictions on the manner of sale. Such shares can only be sold after six months provided that the issuer of the securities is, and has been for a period of at least 90 days immediately before the sale, subject to the reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Shares purchased in this offering, which will be immediately resalable, and sales of all of our other shares after applicable restrictions expire, could have a depressive effect on the market price, if any, of our common stock and the shares we are offering.





	There is no public trading market for our common stock. To be quoted on the OTCBB a market maker must file an application on our behalf to make a market for our common stock. As of the date of this Registration Statement, we have not engaged a market maker to file such an application, that there is no guarantee that a market marker will file an application on our behalf, and that even if an application is filed, there is no guarantee that we will be accepted for quotation.









	PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION



	 


	We are registering 6,000,000 shares of our common stock for sale at the price of $0.02 per share.





	This is a self-underwritten offering, and Mr. Zhu, our president, treasurer and director, will sell the shares directly to family, friends, business associates and acquaintances, with no commission or other remuneration payable to him for any shares they may sell. There are no plans or arrangements to enter into any contracts or agreements to sell the shares with a broker or dealer. In offering the securities on our behalf, he will rely on the safe harbor from broker dealer registration set out in Rule 3a4-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Mr. Zhu will not register as a broker-dealer pursuant to Section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in reliance upon Rule 3a4-1, which sets forth those conditions, as noted herein, under which a person associated with an Issuer may participate in the offering of the Issuers securities and not be deemed to be a broker-dealer:



	1.


	Our president, treasurer and director is not subject to a statutory disqualification, as that term is defined in Section 3(a)(39) of the Act, at the time of his participation; and,



	2.


	Our president, treasurer and director will not be compensated in connection with his participation by the payment of commissions or other remuneration based either directly or indirectly on transactions in securities; and



	3.


	Our president, treasurer and director is not, nor will he be at the time of his participation in the offering, an associated person of a broker-dealer; and



	4.


	Our president, treasurer and director meets the conditions of paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of Rule 3a4-1 of the Exchange Act, in that he (A) primarily perform, or intend primarily to perform at the end of the offering, substantial duties for or on behalf of our company, other than in connection with transactions in securities; and (B) he is not a broker or dealer, or been an associated person of a broker or dealer, within the preceding twelve months; and (C) has not participated in selling and offering securities for any issuer more than once every twelve months other than in reliance on Paragraphs (a)(4)(i) or (a)(4)(iii). Under Paragraph 3a4-1(a)(4)(iii), our president, treasurer and director must restricts his participation to any one or more of the following activities:



	A.


	Preparing any written communication or delivering such communication through the mails or other means that does not involve oral solicitation by his of a potential purchaser; provided, however, that the content of such communication is approved by our president, treasurer and director;



	B.


	Responding to inquiries of a potential purchaser in a communication initiated by the potential purchaser; provided, however, that the content of such responses are limited to information contained in a registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933 or other offering document; or



	C.


	Performing ministerial and clerical work involved in effecting any transaction.









	23 |









	Our president, treasurer and director does not intend to purchase any shares in this offering as well as our secretary.





	This offering is self-underwritten, which means that it does not involve the participation of an underwriter or broker, and as a result, no broker for the sale of our securities will be used. In the event a broker-dealer is retained by us to participate in the offering, we must file a post-effective amendment to the registration statement to disclose the arrangements with the broker-dealer, and that the broker-dealer will be acting as an underwriter and will be so named in the prospectus. Additionally, FINRA must approve the terms of the underwriting compensation before the broker-dealer may participate in the offering.





	To the extent required under the Securities Act, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement will be filed disclosing the name of any broker-dealers, the number of shares of common stock involved, the price at which the common stock is to be sold, the commissions paid or discounts or concessions allowed to such broker-dealers, where applicable, that such broker-dealers did not conduct any investigation to verify the information set out or incorporated by reference in this prospectus and other facts material to the transaction.





	We are subject to applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations under it, including, without limitation, Rule 10b-5 and a distribution participant under Regulation M. All of the foregoing may affect the marketability of the common stock.





	All expenses of the registration statement including, but not limited to, legal, accounting, printing and mailing fees are and will be borne by us. 






	Penny Stock Regulations






	You should note that our stock is a penny stock. The SEC has adopted Rule 15g-9 which generally defines "penny stock" to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and "accredited investors". The term "accredited investor" refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer's confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock.

	If you decide to subscribe for any shares in this offering, you must

	Under our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the corporation, we may indemnify an officer or director who is made a party to any proceeding, including a lawsuit, because of his position, if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in our best interest.

To the extent that the officer or director is successful on the merits in a proceeding as to which he is to be indemnified, we must indemnify him against all expenses incurred, including attorney's fees. With respect to a derivative action, indemnity may be made only for expenses actually and reasonably incurred in defending the proceeding, and if the officer or director is judged liable, only by a court order. The indemnification is intended to be to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the State of Nevada.


	Regarding indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, which may be permitted to directors or officers under Nevada law, we are informed that, in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, indemnification is against public policy, as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.

	We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Rizzen  Inc. (the Company) as of January 31, 2016, and the related statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the period October 21, 2015 (Inception) through January 31, 2016.

	Rizzen Inc.

	s management is responsible for these financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.




	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.




	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of

	Rizzen Inc.

	as of  January 31, 2016 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period from October 21, 2015 (Inception) through January 31, 2016 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.



	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements the Company  has suffered net losses and has had negative cash flows from operating activities during the period ended January 31, 2016.These matters raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans concerning these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

	RIZZEN INC.







	NOTES TO THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	FOR THE PERIOD FROM INCEPTION (OCTOBER 21, 2015) TO JANUARY 31, 2016






	NOTE 1  ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION


	 Organization and Description of Business


	RIZZEN INC.(the Company) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada, U.S. on October 21, 2015.  The Companys business is distribution of childrens toys from China.


	Since inception through January 31, 2016 the Company has not generated any revenue and has accumulated losses of $982.


	Basis of Presentation


	The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and are presented in US dollars. The Company has adopted a January 31 fiscal year end.


	NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



	Cash and Cash Equivalents



	The Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents to the extent the funds are not being held for investment purposes.


	The Company's bank accounts are deposited in insured institutions. The funds are insured up to $250,000. At January 31, 2016 the Company's bank deposits did not exceed the insured amounts.



	Basic Income (Loss) Per Share



	The Company computes loss per share in accordance with ASC-260, Earnings per Share which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period.  Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.



	Dividends



	The Company has not adopted any policy regarding payment of dividends. No dividends have been paid during any of the periods shown.





	F6






	32 |

	Page

















	Income Taxes



	The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes.  Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values and their respective income tax basis (temporary differences).  

	The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.



	Advertising Costs



	The Companys policy regarding advertising is to expense advertising when incurred. The Company incurred advertising expense of $0 during as at January 31, 2016.



	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets



	The Company continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances are present, the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell.



	Use of Estimates



	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.



	Stock-Based Compensation



	As of January 31, 2016 the Company has not issued any stock-based payments to its employees. Stock-based compensation is accounted for at fair value in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and 123(R) (ASC 718).  To date, the Company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options.



	Revenue Recognition



	The Company will recognize revenue when products are fully delivered or services have been provided and collection is reasonably assured.



	Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	The Company has reviewed all the recent accounting pronouncements issued to date of the issuance of these financial statements, and does not believe any of these pronouncements will have a material impact on the company.


	NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN


	The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future.  


	F-7






	33 |

	Page



















	The Company has incurred a loss since Inception (October 21, 2015) resulting in an accumulated deficit of $982 as of January 31, 2016 and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business.  Accordingly, there is substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.  


	The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand and loans from directors and/or private placement of common stock.  


	NOTE 4  CAPTIAL STOCK


	The Company has 75,000,000 shares of common stock authorized with a par value of $0.001 per share.


	On January 13, 2016 the Company issued 5,000,000 shares of its common stock at $0.001 per share for total proceeds of $5,000. On January 26, 2016 the Company issued 1,000,000 shares of its common stock at $0.001 per share for total proceeds of $1,000.


	As of January 31, 2016 the Company had 6,000,000 shares issued and outstanding.


	NOTE 5  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS


	 In support of the Companys efforts and cash requirements, it may rely on advances from related parties until such time that the Company can support its operations or attains adequate financing through sales of its equity or traditional debt financing. There is no formal written commitment for continued support by officers, directors, or shareholders. Amounts represent advances or amounts paid in satisfaction of liabilities. The advances are considered temporary in nature and have not been formalized by a promissory note.  


	Since October 21, 2015 (Inception) through January 31, 2016, the Companys sole officer and director loaned the Company $1,042 to pay for incorporation costs and operating expenses.  As of January 31, 2016, the amount outstanding was $1,042. The loan is non-interest bearing, due upon demand and unsecured.


	NOTE 6  INCOME TAX


	As of January 31, 2016 the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of $982 that may be available to reduce future years taxable income through 2036. Future tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have not been recognized in these financial statements, as their realization is determined not likely to occur and accordingly, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to these tax loss carry-forwards.


	NOTE 7  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS





	In accordance with ASC 855, the Company has analyzed its operations subsequent to January 31, 2016 through the date these financial statements were issued, and has determined that it does not have any material subsequent events to disclose in these financial statements.

	ITEM 17. UNDERTAKINGS



	 


	The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes:





	1)


	To file, during any period in which offers or sales of securities are being made, a post-    effective amendment to this registration statement to:





	(i)


	Include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;



	(ii)


	To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) (§230.424(b) of this chapter) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the Calculation of Registration Fee table in the effective registration statement.



	(iii)


	To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement;


	2)


	That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.





	3)


	To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering.





	4)


	That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser:





	(i)


	If the registrant is subject to Rule 430C, each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use.





	5)


	That, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities: The undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:


	 


	(i)


	Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424;


	 


	(ii)


	Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant;


	 


	(iii)


	The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or our securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and





	(iv)


	Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser.


	 


	Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 (the Act) may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the provisions above, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and is, therefore, unenforceable.


	 


	In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities, other than the payment by us of expenses incurred or paid by one of our directors, officers, or controlling persons in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding, is asserted by one of our directors, officers, or controlling persons in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and we will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

	     SECTION 1.

	Annual Meeting

	. An annual meeting of the stockholders of Rizzen Inc., a Nevada corporation (hereinafter, the Corporation) shall be held for the election of directors and for the transaction of such other proper business at such time, date and place, either within or without the State of Nevada, as shall be designated by resolution of the Board of Directors from time to time.





	     SECTION 2.

	Special Meetings

	. Special meetings of stockholders for any purpose or purposes may be called by the Board of Directors, or by a committee of the Board of Directors that has been designated by the Board of Directors and whose powers and authority, as expressly provided in a resolution of the Board of Directors, include the power to call such meetings, and shall be held at such time, date and place, either within or without the State of Nevada, as shall be designated by resolution of the Board of Directors or such committee. Special meetings of stockholders may not be called by any other person or persons.





	     SECTION 3.

	Notice of Meetings

	. Written notice of each meeting of the stockholders, which shall state the time, date and place of the meeting and in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which it is called, shall, unless otherwise provided by applicable law, the Articles of Incorporation or these bylaws, be given not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of such meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting, and, if mailed, it shall be deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at such stockholders address as it appears on the records of the Corporation. Whenever notice is required to be given, a written waiver thereof signed by the person entitled thereto, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.





	     SECTION 4.

	Adjournments

	. Any meeting of the stockholders may adjourn from time to time to reconvene at the same or some other place, and notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At any such adjourned meeting at which a quorum may be present, the Corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting.


	If the adjournment is for more than thirty days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.





	     SECTION 5.

	Quorum

	. Except as otherwise provided by Nevada law, the Articles of Incorporation or these bylaws, at any meeting of the stockholders the holders of a majority of the shares of stock, issued and outstanding and entitled to vote, shall be present in person or represented by proxy in order to constitute a quorum for the transaction of any business. In the absence of a quorum, the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote may adjourn the meeting from time to time in the manner described in Section 4 of this Article I.





	     SECTION 6.

	Organization

	. At each meeting of the stockholders, the Chairman of the Board, or in his absence or inability to act, the President or, in his absence or inability to act, a Vice President or, in the absence or inability to act of such persons, any person designated by the Board of Directors, or in the absence of such designation, any person chosen by a majority of those stockholders present in person or represented by proxy, shall act as chairman of the meeting. The Secretary or, in his absence or inability to act, any person appointed by the chairman of the meeting shall act as secretary of the meeting and keep the minutes thereof.





	     SECTION 7.

	Notice of Business

	. At any annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been brought before the meeting. To be properly brought before an annual meeting, such business must be (i) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors; (ii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors; or (iii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by any stockholder of the Corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time of giving of the notice provided for in this Section 7, who shall be entitled to vote at such meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 7. For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting of the stockholders by a stockholder, the stockholder shall have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a stockholders notice shall be delivered to or mailed and received by the Secretary at the principal executive office of the Corporation not less than 60 days nor more than 90 days prior to the annual meeting;

	provided

	,

	however

	, that in the event that less than 70 days notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting is given or made to stockholders, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such notice of the date of the meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made, whichever first occurs. Such stockholders notice to the Secretary of the Corporation shall set forth as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting (a) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting and, in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend any document, including these bylaws, the language of the proposed amendment, (b) the name and address, as they appear on the Corporations books, of the stockholder proposing such business, (c) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by such stockholder and (d) any material interest of such stockholder in such business. Notwithstanding anything in these bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be


	conducted at any annual meeting of the stockholders except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 7. The chairman of the annual meeting of the stockholders shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 7, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder with respect to matters set forth in this Section 7.





	     SECTION 8.

	Order of Business; Conduct of Meetings

	. The order of business at all meetings of the stockholders shall be as determined by the chairman of the meeting.





	     SECTION 9.

	Voting; Proxies

	. Unless otherwise provided by Nevada law or in the Articles of Incorporation, each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be entitled to one vote for each share of capital stock which has voting power upon the matter in question held by such stockholder either (i) on the date fixed pursuant to the provisions of Section 10 of Article I of these bylaws as the record date for the determination of the stockholders to be entitled to notice of or to vote at such meeting; or (ii) if no record date is fixed, then at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given. Each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of the stockholders may authorize another person or persons to act for him by proxy. Any such proxy shall be delivered to the secretary of such meeting at or prior to the time designated in the order of business for so delivering such proxies. At all meetings of the stockholders for the election of directors, a plurality of the votes cast shall be sufficient to elect. On all other matters, except as otherwise required by Nevada law or the Articles of Incorporation, a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of the stockholders shall be necessary to authorize any corporate action to be taken by vote of the stockholders. Unless required by Nevada law, or determined by the chairman of the meeting to be advisable, the vote on any question other than the election of directors need not be by written ballot. On a vote by written ballot, each written ballot shall be signed by the stockholder voting, or by his proxy if there be such proxy, and shall state the number of shares voted.





	     SECTION 10.

	Fixing of Record Date for Stockholder Meetings

	. In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall not be more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting;

	provided

	,

	however

	, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.







	     SECTION 11.

	Fixing a Record Date for Other Purposes

	. In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purposes of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall not be more than 60 days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.





	     SECTION 12.

	List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote

	. The officer of the Corporation who has charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation shall prepare and make, at least 10 days before every meeting of the stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder of the Corporation who is present.





	     SECTION 13.

	Inspectors

	. The Board of Directors may, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors to act at such meeting or any adjournment thereof. If the inspectors shall not be so appointed or if any of them shall fail to appear or act, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint inspectors. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector at such meeting with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The inspectors shall determine the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each, the number of shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, the validity and effect of proxies, and shall receive votes, ballots or consents, hear and determine all challenges and questions arising in connection with the right to vote, count and tabulate all votes, ballots or consents, determine the result, and do such acts as are proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all stockholders. On request of the chairman of the meeting or any stockholder entitled to vote thereat, the inspectors shall make a report in writing of any challenge, question or matter determined by them and shall execute a certificate of any fact found by them. No director or candidate for the office of director shall act as an inspector of an election of directors. Inspectors need not be stockholders.

A written waiver of notice, signed by the director entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Notice of any such meeting need not be given to any director who shall, either before or after the meeting, submit a signed waiver of notice or who shall attend such meeting without protesting, prior to or at its commencement, the lack of notice to him.





	     SECTION 10.

The Board of Directors may fill vacancies in, change the membership of, or dissolve any such committee. The Board of Directors may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member of the committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not he or they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board of Directors to act at the meeting in place of such absent or disqualified member. Any such committee, to the extent provided by Nevada law and to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors, shall have and may exercise the powers of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation, and may authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it.

	provided

	however

The Corporation shall be required to indemnify a person in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if the Proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

In any such action the Corporation shall have the burden of proving that the claimant was not entitled to the requested indemnification or payment of expenses under applicable Nevada law.





	     SECTION 4.

	Non-Exclusivity of Rights

	. The indemnification provided by this Article VII shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification may be entitled under these bylaws or any agreement or vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such persons official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.





	     SECTION 5.

	PROSPECTUS




	THE INFORMATION IN THIS PROSPECTUS MAY BE CHANGED. THESE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE SOLD UNTIL THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION IS EFFECTIVE. THIS PROSPECTUS IS NOT AN OFFER TO SELL THESE SECURITIES AND IT IS NOT SOLICITING AN OFFER TO BUY THESE SECURITIES IN ANY STATE WHERE THE OFFER OR SALE IS NOT PERMITTED. THERE IS NO MINIMUM PURCHASE REQUIREMENT FOR THE OFFERING TO PROCEED.



	 



	RIZZEN INC.




	6,000,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK




	$0.02 PER SHARE






	This is the initial offering of common stock of Rizzen Inc. and no public market currently exists for the securities being offered. We are registering for sale a total of 6,000,000 shares of common stock at a fixed price of $0.02 per share to the general public in best efforts offering. We estimate our total offering registration costs to be approximately $8,000. There is no minimum number of shares that must be sold by us for the offering to proceed, and we will retain the proceeds from the sale of any of the offered shares. We have not made any arrangements to place funds in an escrow, trust, or similar account and there is no effect on investors. We will have access to any proceeds from this offering immediately, and may use such proceeds in our discretion. The offering is being conducted on a self-underwritten, best efforts basis, which means our President, Shuisheng Zhu, will attempt to sell the shares. We are making this offering without the involvement of underwriters or broker-dealers.





	This Prospectus will permit our President to sell the shares directly to the public, with no commission or other remuneration payable to him for any shares he may sell. Mr. Zhu will sell all the shares registered herein. In offering the securities on our behalf, he will rely on the safe harbor from broker-dealer registration set out in Rule 3a4-1 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. The shares will be offered at a fixed price of $0.02 per share for a period of two hundred and forty (240) days from the effective date of this prospectus. The offering shall terminate on the earlier of (i) when the offering period ends (240 days from the effective date of this prospectus), (ii) the date when the sale of all 6,000,000 shares is completed, (iii) when the Board of Directors decides that it is in the best interest of the Company to terminate the offering prior the completion of the sale of all 6,000,000 shares registered under the Registration Statement of which this Prospectus is part. 







	Rizzen Inc. is a development stage company and has recently started its operations. To date we have been involved primarily in organizational activities. Any investment in the shares offered herein involves a high degree of risk. You should only purchase shares if you can afford the loss of your investment. Our independent registered public accountant has issued an audit opinion which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.





	There has been no market for our securities and a public market may never develop, or, if any market does develop, it may not be sustained. Our common stock is not traded on any exchange or on the over-the-counter market. After the effective date of the registration statement relating to this prospectus, we hope to have a market maker file an application with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) for our common stock to be eligible for trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. To be eligible for quotation, issuers must remain current in their quarterly and annual filings with the SEC. If we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board. We do not yet have a market maker who has agreed to file such application. There can be no assurance that our common stock will ever be quoted on a stock exchange or a quotation service or that any market for our stock will develop.





	The Company is not a Blank Check company. Its business plan has no indications to engage in a merger or acquisition with an unidentified company or companies, or other entity. Mr. Zhu, our president, director and treasurer, has not had any discussions with other entities regarding a possible acquisition or merger with another company or business.





	We are an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act).








	THE PURCHASE OF THE SECURITIES OFFERED THROUGH THIS PROSPECTUS INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY READ AND CONSIDER THE SECTION OF THIS PROSPECTUS ENTITLED RISK FACTORS ON PAGES 7 THROUGH 12 BEFORE BUYING ANY SHARES OF RIZZEN INC.S COMMON STOCK.









	NEITHER THE SEC NOR ANY STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION HAS APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED OF THESE SECURITIES OR PASSED UPON THE ADEQUACY OR ACCURACY OF THIS PROSPECTUS. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.







	THE INFORMATION IN THIS PROSPECTUS IS NOT COMPLETE AND MAY BE CHANGED. WE MAY NOT SELL THESE SECURITIES UNTIL THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION IS EFFECTIVE. THIS PROSPECTUS IS NOT AN OFFER TO SELL THESE SECURITIES AND IT IS NOT SOLICITING AN OFFER TO BUY THESE SECURITIES IN ANY STATE WHERE THE OFFER OR SALE IS NOT PERMITTED.

	Rizzen Inc. was incorporated in Nevada on October 21, 2015. We are development stage company and intends to provide vending and shipping services of electronic toys of various kinds manufactured in the Republic of China.

To implement our plan of operations we require a minimum of $52,000 for the next twelve months as described in our Plan of Operations. There is no assurance that we will generate


	significant


	revenue in the first 12 months after completion our offering or ever generate
	significant


	revenue.





	Being a development stage company, we have very limited operating history. If we do not generate


	sufficient revenue we may need a minimum of $10,000 of additional funding to pay for ongoing SEC filing requirements. We do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing. Our principal executive offices are located at 201-5, Xin Jia Garden, Heng Qing Village, Zhuhai, China 519000. Our phone number is +852-8191-5516.

Our financial statements from inception (October 21, 2015) through January 31, 2016, reports no revenue and a net loss of $982. Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit opinion for Rizzen Inc., which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. To date, we have developed our business plan. We signed agreement with Bolleot Schpile, LLC on March 11, 2016 and received $2,100 of revenue according to the agreement. On March 20, 2016, we signed the second agreement with CranKind Parrell, LLC and as


	a result of this agreement we  have generated revenue  of $3,000.
	On March 1, 2016 we entered into a Contract with our general supplier Kingshau Fingu Toys Co., Ltd.





	As of the date of this prospectus, there is no public trading market for our common stock and no assurance that a trading market for our securities will ever develop.





	Proceeds from this offering are required for us to proceed with your business plan over the next twelve months.

If we are unable to obtain minimum funding of approximately $52,000, our business may fail. Since we are presently in the development stage of our business, we can provide no assurance that we will successfully sell any products or services related to our planned activities.

	RISK FACTORS



	 



	AN INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE RISKS DESCRIBED BELOW AND THE OTHER INFORMATION IN THIS PROSPECTUS BEFORE INVESTING IN OUR COMMON STOCK. IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS OCCUR, OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE SERIOUSLY HARMED. THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK, WHEN AND IF WE TRADE AT A LATER DATE, COULD DECLINE DUE TO ANY OF THESE RISKS, AND YOU MAY LOSE ALL OR PART OF YOUR INVESTMENT.









	RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS









	BECAUSE OUR AUDITORS HAVE RAISED A GOING CONCERN, THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTY THAT WE WILL CONTINUE OPERATIONS IN WHICH CASE YOU COULD LOSE YOUR INVESTMENT.






	Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty about our ability to continue in business. As such we may have to cease operations and you could lose your investment.






	WE MAY CONTINUE TO LOSE MONEY, AND IF WE DO NOT ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE OUR BUSINESS.






	We are company with limited operations, have incurred expenses and have losses. In addition, we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses. As a result, we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability, which may not occur. We expect our operating expenses to increase as a result of our planned expansion. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may be unable to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. We expect to have quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in revenues, expenses, losses and cash flow, some of which could be significant. Results of operations will depend upon numerous factors, some beyond our control, including regulatory actions, market acceptance of our products and services, new products and service introductions, and competition.






	7 |
















	WE ARE SOLELY DEPENDENT UPON THE FUNDS TO BE RAISED IN THIS OFFERING TO START OUR BUSINESS, THE PROCEEDS OF WHICH MAY BE INSUFFICIENT TO ACHIEVE REVENUES AND PROFITABLE OPERATIONS. WE MAY NEED TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING WHICH MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE.



	 


	Our current operating funds are less than necessary to complete our intended operations. We need the proceeds from this offering to start our operations as described in the Plan of Operation section of this prospectus. As of January 31, 2016, we had cash in the amount of $6,060 and liabilities of $1,042. As of this date, we have no income and just recently started our operation. The proceeds of this offering may not be sufficient for us to achieve revenues and profitable operations. We need additional funds to achieve a sustainable sales level where ongoing operations can be funded out of revenues. There is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us.





	We require minimum funding of approximately $52,000 to conduct our proposed operations for a period of one year. If we are not able to raise this amount, or if we experience a shortage of funds prior to funding we may utilize funds from Shuisheng Zhu, our president, treasurer and director, who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for professional fees, including fees payable in connection with the filing of this registration statement and operation expenses. However, Mr. Zhu has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. After one year we may need additional financing. If we do not generate


	sufficient revenue we may need a minimum of $10,000 of additional funding to pay for ongoing SEC filing requirements. We do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing.


	 


	If we are successful in raising the funds from this offering, we plan to commence activities to continue our operations. We cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funds to continue our business plan according to our plan of operations.






	WE ARE A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY AND HAVE COMMENCED LIMITED OPERATIONS IN OUR BUSINESS. WE EXPECT TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT OPERATING LOSSES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

	 





	We were incorporated on October 21, 2015 and to date have been involved primarily in organizational activities. We have commenced limited business operations. Accordingly, we have no way to evaluate the likelihood that our business will be successful. Potential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by new companies and the high rate of failure of such enterprises. The likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays encountered in connection with the operations that we plan to undertake. These potential problems include, but are not limited to, unanticipated problems relating to the ability to generate sufficient cash flow to operate our business, and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates. 
	We anticipate that we will incur increased operating expenses without realizing


	sufficient revenues.


	We expect to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future. We recognize that if the effectiveness of our business plan is not forthcoming, we will not be able to continue business operations. There is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful, and it is doubtful that we will generate any operating revenues or ever achieve profitable operations. If we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks, our business will most likely fail.








	WE HAVE LIMITED SALES AND MARKETING EXPERIENCE, WHICH INCREASES THE RISK THAT OUR BUSINESS WILL FAIL.




	 



	We have no experience in the marketing of electronic toys distribution and have only nominal sales and marketing experience. Our future success will depend, among other factors, upon whether our services can be sold at a profitable price and the extent to which consumers acquire, adopt, and continue to use them. There can be no assurance that our business will gain wide acceptance in its targeted markets or that we will be able to effectively market our services.






	EVEN THOUGH WE ARE REQUIRED TO PURCHASE OUR PRODUCTS IN UNITED STATES DOLLARS, OUR BUSINESS CAN BE EFFECTED BY CURRENCY RATE FLUCTUATIONS AS OUR SUPPLIERS ARE A CHINESE COMPANIES AND ALL THEIR OPERATIONS ARE IN CHINESE YUAN.






	We are required to buy products in US Dollars, but all our suppliers operations are in Chinese Yuan, so we are affected by changes in foreign exchange rates. If we are not able to successfully protect ourselves against those currency rate fluctuations, then our profits on the products subject to those fluctuations would also fluctuate and could cause us to be less profitable or incur losses, even if our business is doing well.






	ALL OF OUR ELECTORNIC TOYS PURCHASES WILL BE MADE FROM A LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS.  IF THAT SUPPLIERS DECREASE OR TERMINATE THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH US OUR BUSINESS WOULD LIKELY FAIL IF WE ARE UNABLE TO FIND A SUBSTITUTE FOR THESE COMPANIES.






	As a result of being totally dependent on a limited number of wholesale suppliers located in China, we may be subject to certain risks, including changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs and other barriers, increased pressure, timing and availability of export licenses, the burden of complying with a variety of foreign laws and treaties, and uncertainties relative to regional, political and economic circumstances. If these companies decrease, modify or terminate its association with us for any other reason, we would suffer an interruption in our business unless and until we found a substitute for that suppliers. If we were unable to find a substitute for that suppliers, our business would likely fail. We cannot predict what the likelihood would be of finding an acceptable substitute suppliers.
	On March 1, 2016 we entered into a Contract with our general supplier Kingshau Fingu Toys Co., Ltd.

	WE ARE IN A COMPETITIVE MARKET WHICH COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO GAIN MARKET SHARE WHICH COULD HARM OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.





	 




	The business of niche of electronic toys distribution is very competitive. Barriers to entry are relatively low, and we face competitive pressures from companies anxious to join this niche. There are a number of successful entities operated by proven companies that offer similar niche services, which may prevent us from gaining enough market share to become successful.  These competitors have existing customers that may form a large part of our targeted client base, and such clients may be hesitant to switch over from already established competitors to our service.  If we cannot gain enough market share, our business and our financial performance will be adversely affected.






	SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS MAY BE ABLE TO USE THEIR FINANCIAL STRENGTH TO DOMINATE THE MARKET, WHICH MAY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUES.



	Some of our competitors may be much larger companies than us and very well capitalized. They could choose to use their greater resources to finance their continued participation and penetration of this market, which may impede our ability to generate sufficient revenue to cover our costs. Their better financial resources could allow them to significantly out spend us on research and development, as well as marketing and production. We might not be able to maintain our ability to compete in this circumstance.






	WE CANNOT GUARANTEE FUTURE CUSTOMERS. EVEN IF WE OBTAIN CUSTOMERS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO GENERATE A PROFIT. IF THAT OCCURS WE WILL HAVE TO CEASE OPERATIONS.






	We have not identified any customers and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to attract future customers. Even if we obtain new customers for our service, there is no guarantee that we will make a profit. If we are unable to attract enough customers to operate profitably, we will have to suspend or cease operations.






	BECAUSE WE ARE SMALL AND DO NOT HAVE MUCH CAPITAL, OUR MARKETING CAMPAIGN MAY NOT BE ENOUGH TO ATTRACT SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS TO OPERATE PROFITABLY. IF WE DO NOT MAKE A PROFIT, WE WILL SUSPEND OR CEASE OPERATIONS.






	Due to the fact we are small and do not have much capital, we must limit our marketing activities and may not be able to make our services known to potential customers. Because we will be limiting our marketing activities, we may not be able to attract enough customers to operate profitably. If we cannot operate profitably, we may have to suspend or cease operations.






	BECAUSE OUR OPERATIONS ARE CONCENTRATED IN CHINA THE STOCKHOLDERS WOULD FACE DIFFICULTY IN ENFORCING THEIR LEGAL RIGHTS UNDER UNITED STATES SECURITIES LAWS






	Our operations are concentrated in China and our stockholders would face difficulty in enforcing their legal rights under United States securities laws in light of our managements location outside of the United States. Legal protections and remedies available to the company for certain harmful action taken against it will be pursued within the Peoples Republic of China legal system, which differs from the U.S. legal system in significant ways. Because the company conducts operations outside of the U.S. it is difficult to pursue legal matters is subject to limitations imposed by other jurisdictions. It is limited ability for U.S. regulators to conduct investigations and inspections within China.  It may be restrictions on the transfer of cash into and out of China, as well as on the exchange of currency, may constrain the companys liquidity and impede its ability to use cash in its operations.






	BECAUSE OUR PRESIDENT, DIRECTOR AND TREASURER IS ENGAGED IN A SIMILAR BUSINESS TO US, THERE IS A POTENTIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST, INCLUDING THE AMOUNT OF TIME HE IS ABLE TO DEDICATE TO RIZZEN INC. AND ITS BUSINESS.






	Our sole officer and director is engaged in a similar business to us. Mr. Zhu is a self-employed and senior partner of Haunquoghang toy store in Zhuhai, China. Potential


	conflicts  of interest  may arise in future that may cause our business to fail,  including the amount of time he is able to dedicate to our business as well as additional  conflict of interests over  opportunities presented to our sole officer and director during the performance of his duties.  Rizzen Inc. does not currently have a right of first refusal pertaining to opportunities that come to managements attention where the opportunity may relate to our proposed business operations.
	In an effort to resolve such potential conflicts of interest, our officers and sole director have agreed that all conflicts will be resolved verbally in favor of the Rizzen Inc. We cannot provide assurances that our efforts to eliminate the potential impact of conflicts of interest will be effective.
	Moreover, we dont intend to negotiate any agreements with Haunquoghang as with potential customer because of Haunquoghang store specializes on the other types of toys.






	BECAUSE WE WILL PURCHASE OUR PRODUCTS FROM OVERSEAS, A DISRUPTION IN THE DELIVERY OF IMPORTED PRODUCTS MAY HAVE A GREATER EFFECT ON US.






	We will help to our potential clients to import our product from China to Europe and North America. Because our product will be imported and delivered directly to our customers, we believe that disruptions in shipping deliveries may have a greater material effect on us. Deliveries of our products may be disrupted through factors such as:





	     (1)  raw material shortages, work stoppages, strikes and political unrest;


	     (2)  problems with ocean shipping, including work stoppages and shipping


	          container shortages;


	     (3)  increased inspections of import shipments or other factors causing


	          delays in shipments; and


	     (4)  economic crises, international disputes and wars.





	If a transportation company unable to deliver products our reputation may be damaged and we may lose customers.






	IF WE ARE CONSIDERED A RESIDENT ENTERPRISE FOR PRC ENTERPRISE INCOME TAX PURPOSES, IT COULD RESULT IN UNFAVORABLE TAX CONSEQUENCES TO US AND OUR NON-PRC SHAREHOLDERS.






	Under Paragraph 2 of Article 2 of the Peoples Republic of China Corporate Income Tax Law (the Corporate Income Law), any foreign enterprise which shall constitute a resident enterprise shall meet both of the following requirements: (i) such enterprise was established under the laws of foreign countries or regions; and (ii) the actual management of such enterprise must be located within China. Further, under relevant provisions of the Circular of the State Administration of Taxation Regarding the Issues Relevant to the Identification of Chinese-controlled Enterprises Registered Abroad as Resident Enterprises by Actual Management (Guo Shui Fa [2009] No. 82, Circular No. 82) issued by the State Administration of Taxation on April 22, 2009 and based upon our no-name inquiry to the Peoples Republic of China State Administration for Taxation, any Chinese-controlled enterprise whose actual management is held to be located within China shall satisfy all of the following requirements: (i) the site, where the management of such enterprise responsible for the daily operation of such enterprise performs its duties, is located within China; (ii) the financial decisions (such as borrowings, extending loans, financing or financial risks management) and HR policies (such as appointment, dismissal or remunerations) shall be made or approved by the institution or personnel of such enterprise staying within China; (iii) 1/2 or more of the directors with voting rights or of the management of such enterprise live within China permanently; and (iv) the main assets, accounting books and stamps of and the minutes and files of the board of directors of and of shareholders meeting of such enterprise exist and will be maintained within China.





	We believe that we are not considered a resident enterprise for PRC enterprise income tax purposes. We have no subsidiaries within China. We have executive offices in China, which were unincorporated entities under Chinese laws, and all of our management is located within China. We make or approve the financial decisions (such as borrowing, extending loans, financing or financial risks management) and human resource policies (such as employees appointment, dismissal and remunerations) within China, and half or more of our directors with voting rights are also located within China. However, our main assets, accounting books, stamps and minutes of our directors board and of our shareholders meetings exist and will be maintained in the USA but not within China, so we are not consistent with Item (iv) of the above four requirements under Circular No. 82 although our present conditions satisfy Items (i) to (iii) of the above requirements under Circular No. 82. Therefore, even if we are an enterprise established under the laws Nevada, and our management team is located within China, we believe that we shall not be held to be a resident enterprise under the Corporate Income Tax Law.





	Nevertheless, we cannot fully exclude the possibility that there is a difference or discrepancy between the interpretation of the Chinese authorities and our understanding as set forth above, nor can we assure that the statements or interpretations of the Chinese government officials will remain unchanged. Furthermore, we cannot exclude the possibility that the Chinese government will promulgate any new laws, regulations or provisions that will be in conflict with our understanding. If so, we may be classified as a resident enterprise for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, which could result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC shareholders.


	 


	If the PRC tax authorities determine that we are a resident enterprise for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, we may be subject to the enterprise income tax at a rate of 25% on our worldwide taxable income, as well as PRC enterprise income tax reporting obligations.


	  


	If we are considered a resident enterprise, this could result in a situation in which a 10% withholding tax is imposed on dividends we pay to our non-PRC enterprise shareholders and with respect to gains derived by our non-PRC enterprise shareholders from transferring our shares and a 20% withholding tax on dividends we pay to our non-PRC individual stockholders and with respect to gains derived by our non-PRC individual stockholders from transferring our shares. If we are required under PRC law to withhold PRC income tax on dividends payable to our non-PRC investors or if you are required to pay PRC income tax on the transfer of our shares, the value of your investment in our shares may be materially and adversely affected.






	OUR OPERATIONS AND ASSETS IN CHINA ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES.






	Government policies are subject to rapid change and the government of the China may adopt policies which have the effect of hindering private economic activity and greater economic decentralization.  There is no assurance that the government of China will not significantly alter its policies from time to time without notice in a manner with reduces or eliminates any benefits from its present policies of economic reform.  In addition, a substantial portion of productive assets in China remains government-owned.  For instance, all lands are state owned and business entities or individuals are granted by government state-owned land use rights.  The granting process is typically based on government policies at the time of granting, which could be lengthy and complex. This process may adversely affect our business.  The government of China also exercises significant control over Chinas economic growth through the allocation of resources, controlling payment of foreign currency and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies.  Uncertainties may arise with changing of governmental policies and measures.  In addition, changes in laws and regulations, or their interpretation, or the imposition of confiscatory taxation, restrictions on currency conversion, imports and sources of supply, devaluations of currency, the nationalization or other expropriation of private enterprises, as well as adverse changes in the political, economic or social conditions in China, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.






	BECAUSE CHINESE LAW GOVERNS ALMOST ALL OF OUR MATERIAL AGREEMENTS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ENFORCE OUR LEGAL RIGHTS WITHIN CHINA OR ELSEWHERE, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF BUSINESS, BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, OR CAPITAL.




	 



	We have a supply agreement with Kingshau Fingu Toys Co., Ltd., a Chinese company. We cannot assure you that we will be able to enforce this agreement or any of our material agreements that we may enter into or that remedies will be available outside of China.  The system of laws and the enforcement of existing laws in China may not be as certain in implementation and interpretation as in the United States. The Chinese judiciary is relatively inexperienced in enforcing corporate and commercial law, leading to a higher than usual degree of uncertainty as to the outcome of any litigation.  The inability to enforce or obtain a remedy under any of our agreements could result in a significant loss of business, business opportunities or capital.






	IMPOSITION OF TRADE BARRIERS AND TAXES MAY REDUCE OUR ABILITY TO DO BUSINESS INTERNATIONALLY, AND THE RESULTING LOSS OF REVENUE COULD HARM OUR PROFITABILITY.




	 



	We may experience barriers to conducting business and trade in our targeted emerging markets in the form of delayed customs clearances, customs duties and tariffs.  In addition, we may be subject to repatriation taxes levied upon the exchange of income from local currency into foreign currency, substantial taxes of profits, revenues, assets and payroll, as well as value-added tax. The markets in which we plan to operate may impose onerous and unpredictable duties, tariffs and taxes on our business and products, and there can be no assurance that this will not reduce the level of sales that we achieve in such markets, which would reduce our revenues and profits.









	BECAUSE OUR PRESIDENT, TREASURER AND DIRECTOR, MR. ZHU,
	WILL


	OWN


	41.67


	%
	OR MORE
	OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK
	HE


	WILL BE ABLE TO


	MAKE AND CONTROL CORPORATE DECISIONS THAT MAY BE DISADVANTAGEOUS TO MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS.






	Mr. Zhu, our president, treasurer and director
	will


	own
	41.67


	% of the outstanding shares of our common stock in case if 100% of the shares sold or more than
	41.67


	%. Accordingly,
	he


	will have significant influence in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters, including the election of directors, mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and also the power to prevent or cause a change in control. The interests of Mr. Zhu


	may differ from the interests of the other stockholders and may result in corporate decisions that are disadvantageous to other shareholders.






	WE DEPEND TO A SIGNIFICANT EXTENT ON CERTAIN KEY PERSON, THE LOSS OF WHOM MAY MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COMPANY.






	Currently, we have only two employee, our president, treasurer, director, Mr. Shuisheng Zhu and Mr. Aleksandr Deshin, our secretary. We depend entirely on Shuisheng Zhu, our president, treasurer, director for all of our operations. The loss of Mr. Zhu would have a substantial negative effect on our company and may cause our business to fail. Mr. Zhu has not been compensated for his services since our incorporation, and it is highly unlikely that he will receive any compensation unless and until we generate substantial revenues. There is intense competition for skilled personnel and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel on acceptable terms. The loss of Mr. Zhus services could prevent us from completing the development of our plan of operation and our business. In the event of the loss of services of such personnel, no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain the services of adequate replacement personnel.





	We do not have any employment agreements or maintain key person life insurance policies on our officer and director. We do not anticipate entering into employment agreements with him or acquiring key man insurance in the foreseeable future.









	9 |










	BECAUSE OUR PRESIDENT, TREASURER AND DIRECTOR WILL ONLY BE DEVOTING LIMITED TIME TO OUR OPERATIONS, OUR OPERATIONS MAY BE SPORADIC WHICH MAY RESULT IN PERIODIC INTERRUPTIONS OR SUSPENSIONS OF OPERATIONS. THIS ACTIVITY COULD PREVENT US FROM ATTRACTING ENOUGH CUSTOMERS AND RESULT IN A LACK OF REVENUES WHICH MAY CAUSE US TO CEASE OPERATIONS.






	Shuisheng Zhu, our president, treasurer and director will only be devoting limited time to our operations. He will be devoting approximately 20 hours a week to our operations. Because our sole office and director will only be devoting limited time to our operations, our operations may be sporadic and occur at times which are convenient to him. As a result, operations may be periodically interrupted or suspended which could result in a lack of revenues and a possible cessation of operations.






	OUR PRESIDENT, TREASURER AND DIRECTOR HAS NO EXPERIENCE MANAGING A PUBLIC COMPANY WHICH IS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN DISCLOSURE CONTROL AND PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.






	We have never operated as a public company. Shuisheng Zhu, our president, treasurer and director has no experience managing a public company which is required to establish and maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. As a result, we may not be able to operate successfully as a public company, even if our operations are successful. We plan to comply with all of the various rules and regulations, which are required for a public company that is reporting company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. However, if we cannot operate successfully as a public company, your investment may be materially adversely affected.






	WE ARE AN EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY UNDER THE JOBS ACT, AND WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN IF THE REDUCED DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO EMERGING GROWTH COMPANIES WILL MAKE OUR COMMON STOCK LESS ATTRACTIVE TO INVESTORS.






	We qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to:





	-


	have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;


	-


	provide an auditor attestation with respect to managements report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting;


	-


	comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditors report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);


	-


	submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as say-on-pay and say-on-frequency; and


	-


	disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the Chief Executives compensation to median employee compensation.


	 


	In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.





	We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues is $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates is $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.





	Until such time, however, we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.

	RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS OFFERING









	BECAUSE THE OFFERING PRICE HAS BEEN ARBITRARILY SET BY THE COMPANY, YOU MAY NOT REALIZE A RETURN ON YOUR INVESTMENT UPON RESALE OF YOUR SHARES.



	 


	The offering price and other terms and conditions relative to the Companys shares have been arbitrarily determined by us and do not bear any relationship to assets, earnings, book value or any other objective financial criteria. Additionally, as the Company was formed on October 21, 2015, and has only a limited operating history with no earnings, the price of the offered shares is not based on its past earnings, and no investment banker, appraiser, or other independent third party, has been consulted concerning the offering price for the shares or the fairness of the offering price used for the shares, as such our stockholders may not be able to receive a return on their investment when they sell their shares of common stock.






	WE ARE SELLING THIS OFFERING WITHOUT AN UNDERWRITER AND MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL ANY SHARES.



	 


	This offering is self-underwritten, that is, we are not going to engage the services of an underwriter to sell the shares; we intend to sell our shares through our President, who will receive no commissions. There is no guarantee that he will be able to sell any of the shares. Unless he is successful in receiving the proceeds in the amount of $120,000 from this offering, we may have to seek alternative financing to implement our business plan.






	THE REGULATION OF PENNY STOCKS BY THE SEC AND FINRA MAY DISCOURAGE THE TRADABILITY OF THE COMPANY'S SECURITIES.



	 


	The shares being offered are defined as a penny stock under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and rules of the Commission. The Exchange Act and such penny stock rules generally impose additional sales practice and disclosure requirements on broker-dealers who sell our securities to persons other than certain accredited investors who are, generally, institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 ($300,000 jointly with spouse), or in transactions not recommended by the broker-dealer. For transactions covered by the penny stock rules, a broker dealer must make certain mandated disclosures in penny stock transactions, including the actual sale or purchase price and actual bid and offer quotations, the compensation to be received by the broker-dealer and certain associated persons, and deliver certain disclosures required by the Commission. Consequently, the penny stock rules may make it difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase, if at all.






	OUR PRESIDENT, MR. ZHU DOES NOT HAVE ANY PRIOR EXPERIENCE OFFERING AND SELLING SECURITIES , AND OUR OFFERING DOES NOT REQUIRE A MIMIMUM AMOUNT TO BE RAISED. AS A RESULT OF THIS WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RAISE ENOUGH FUNDS TO COMMENCE AND SUSTAIN OUR BUSINESS AND INVESTORS MAY LOSE THEIR ENTIRE INVESTMENT.






	Mr. Zhu does not have any experience conducting a securities offering. Consequently, we may not be able to raise any funds successfully. Also, the best effort offering does not require a minimum amount to be raised. If we are not able to raise sufficient funds, we may not be able to fund our operations as planned, and our business will suffer and your investment may be materially adversely affected. Our inability to successfully conduct a best-effort offering could be the basis of your losing your entire investment in us.








	DUE TO THE LACK OF A TRADING MARKET FOR OUR SECURITIES, YOU MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY SELLING ANY SHARES YOU PURCHASE IN THIS OFFERING.



	We are not registered on any market or public stock exchange. There is presently no demand for our common stock and no public market exists for the shares being offered in this prospectus. We plan to contact a market maker immediately following the completion of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board (OTCBB). The OTCBB is a regulated quotation service that displays real-time quotes, last sale prices and volume information in over-the-counter securities. The OTCBB is not an issuer listing service, market or exchange. Although the OTCBB does not have any listing requirements, to be eligible for quotation on the OTCBB, issuers must remain current in their filings with the SEC or applicable regulatory authority. If we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board. Market makers are not permitted to begin quotation of a security whose issuer does not meet this filing requirement. Securities already quoted on the OTCBB that become delinquent in their required filings will be removed following a 30 to 60 day grace period if they do not make their required filing during that time. We cannot guarantee that our application will be accepted or approved and our stock listed and quoted for sale. As of the date of this filing, there have been no discussions or understandings between Rizzen Inc. and anyone acting on our behalf, with any market maker regarding participation in a future trading market for our securities. If no market is ever developed for our common stock, it will be difficult for you to sell any shares you purchase in this offering. In such a case, you may find that you are unable to achieve any benefit from your investment or liquidate your shares without considerable delay, if at all. In addition, if we fail to have our common stock quoted on a public trading market, your common stock will not have a quantifiable value and it may be difficult, if not impossible, to ever resell your shares, resulting in an inability to realize any value from your investment.

	WE WILL INCUR ONGOING COSTS AND EXPENSES FOR SEC REPORTING AND COMPLIANCE. WITHOUT REVENUE WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE, MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR INVESTORS TO SELL THEIR SHARES, IF AT ALL.



	 


	The estimated cost of this registration statement is $8,000 which will be paid from offering proceeds. If the offering proceeds are less than registration cost, we will have to utilize funds from Shuisheng Zhu, our president, treasurer and director, who has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process. Mr. Zhus verbal agreement to provide us loans for registration costs is non- binding and discretionary. After the effective date of this prospectus, we will be required to file annual, quarterly and current reports, or other information with the SEC as provided by the Securities Exchange Act. We will voluntarily continue reporting in the absence of an SEC reporting obligation. We plan to contact a market maker immediately following the close of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board. To be eligible for quotation, issuers must remain current in their filings with the SEC. In order for us to remain in compliance we will require future revenues to cover the cost of these filings, which could comprise a substantial portion of our available cash resources. The costs associated with being a publicly traded company in the next 12 month will be approximately $10,000. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to remain in compliance it may be difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase, if at all. Also, if we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board.











	THE COMPANY'S INVESTORS MAY SUFFER FUTURE DILUTION DUE TO ISSUANCES OF SHARES FOR VARIOUS CONSIDERATIONS IN THE FUTURE.



	Our Articles of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of 75,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of which 6,000,000 shares are currently issued and outstanding. If we sell the 6,000,000 shares being offered in this offering, we would have 12,000,000 shares issued and outstanding. As discussed in the Dilution section below, the issuance of the shares of common stock described in this prospectus will result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common stock held by our existing shareholders. The issuance of common stock for future services or acquisitions or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by our investors, and might have an adverse effect on any trading market for our common stock.









	FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS



	 


	This prospectus contains forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. We use words such as anticipate, believe, plan, expect, future, intend, and similar expressions to identify such forward-looking statements. Investors should be aware that all forward-looking statements contained within this filing are good faith estimates of management as of the date of this filing. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the risks faced by us as described in the Risk Factors section and elsewhere in this prospectus.



	 







	USE OF PROCEEDS



	 


	Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten and best-efforts basis: no minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The offering price per share is $0.02. The following table sets forth the uses of proceeds assuming the sale of 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of the securities offered for sale by the Company. If we rise minimal amount of funds or we have not enough funds to follow our plan of operation we will need to loan the funds from our president, director and treasurer, Mr. Zhu, who has verbally agreed to loan the Company funds, or we will search for additional financing to implement our plan of operation. There is no assurance that we will raise the full $120,000 as anticipated and there is no guarantee that we will receive any proceeds from the offering.

	The above figures represent only estimated costs. The estimated cost of this registration statement is $8,000 which will be paid from offering proceeds. If the offering proceeds are less than registration costs, Shuisheng Zhu, our president and director, has verbally agreed to loan the Company funds to complete the registration process. Mr. Zhus verbal agreement to provide us loans for registration costs is non- binding and discretionary. Also, these loans would be necessary if the proceeds from this offering will not be sufficient to implement our business plan and maintain reporting status and quotation on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board when and if our common stocks become eligible for trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. Mr. Zhu will not be paid any compensation or anything from the proceeds of this offering. There is no due date for the repayment of the funds advanced by Mr. Zhu. Mr. Zhu will be repaid from revenues of operations if and when we generate revenues to pay the obligation.

	DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE



	 


	The offering price of the shares has been determined arbitrarily by us. The price does not bear any relationship to our assets, book value, earnings, or other established criteria for valuing a privately held company. In determining the number of shares to be offered and the offering price, we took into consideration our cash on hand and the amount of money we would need to implement our business plan. Accordingly, the offering price should not be considered an indication of the actual value of the securities.








	DILUTION



	 


	Dilution represents the difference between the Offering price and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of this Offering. Net tangible book value is the amount that results from subtracting total liabilities and from total assets. Dilution arises mainly as a result of our arbitrary determination of the Offering price of the shares being offered. Dilution of the value of the shares you purchase is also a result of the lower book value of the shares held by our existing stockholder.





	The historical net tangible book value as of January 31, 2016 was $5,018 or approximately $0.0008 per share. Historical net tangible book value per share of common stock is equal to our total tangible assets less total liabilities, divided by the number of shares of common stock outstanding as of January 31, 2016.





	The following table sets forth as of January 31, 2016, the number of shares of common stock purchased from us and the total consideration paid by our existing stockholders and by new investors in this offering if new investors purchase 50%, 75% or 100% of the offering, after deduction of offering expenses payable by us, assuming a purchase price in this offering of $0.02 per share of common stock.

	MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION



	You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this prospectus. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this prospectus, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the Risk Factors section of this prospectus for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.





	We qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to:


	 











	 




	




	 




	have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;
















	




	 




	provide an auditor attestation with respect to managements report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting;

















	 




	




	 




	comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditors report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);





	 











	 




	




	 




	submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as say-on-pay and say-on-frequency; and





	 











	 




	




	 




	disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEOs compensation to median employee compensation.





	 


	In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.





	We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues is $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates is $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.


	 


	Our cash balance was $6,060 as of January 31, 2016. We believe our cash balance is not sufficient to fund our operations for any period of time. We have been utilizing and may utilize funds from Shuisheng Zhu, our Chairman and President, who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for offering costs, filing fees, and professional fees. As of January 31, 2016, Mr. Zhu has advanced to us $1,042. Mr. Zhu, however, has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. In order to implement our plan of operations for the next twelve month period, we require a minimum of $52,000 of funding from this offering. Being a development stage company, we have very limited operating history we do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing. Our principal executive offices are located at 201-5, Xin Jia Garden, Heng Qing Village, Zhuhai, China 519000. Our phone number is +852-8191-5516.





	We are a development stage company
	that has generated limited revenue


	to date. Our full business plan entails activities described in the Plan of Operation section below. Long term financing beyond the maximum aggregate amount of this offering may be required to expand our business. The exact amount of funding will depend on the scale of our development and expansion. We do not currently have planned our expansion, and we have not decided yet on the scale of our development and expansion and on exact amount of funding needed for our long term financing. If we do not generate any
	additional
	revenue we may need a minimum of $10,000 of additional funding at the end of the twelve month period described in our Plan of Operation below to maintain a reporting status.









	14 |









	Our independent registered public accountant has issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. This is because we have not generated
	sufficient
	revenues and no
	significant
	revenues are anticipated until we complete our initial business development. There is no assurance we will ever reach that stage.





	To meet our need for cash we are attempting to raise money from this offering. If we are unable to successfully find customers we may quickly use up the proceeds from this offering and will need to find alternative sources. At the present time, we have not made any arrangements to raise additional cash, other than through this offering.





	If we need additional cash and cannot raise it, we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash, or cease operations entirely. Even if we raise $120,000 from this offering, we may need more funds for ongoing business operations after the first year, and would have to obtain additional funding.






	PLAN OF OPERATION






	We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 21, 2015. We have never declared bankruptcy, have never been in receivership, and have never been involved in any legal action or proceedings. Since incorporation, we have not made


	significant purchase or sale of assets. We are a development stage company
	that has generated limited revenue


	and just recently started our operations. If we are unable to successfully find clients who will use our service, we may quickly use up the proceeds from this offering.





	We intend to provide vending and shipping services of electronic toys of various kinds manufactured in the Republic of China. The company sees its primary goal as to distribute electronic kids toys of various price categories to both small and medium-sized vendors. We plan to supply our potential clients from our warehouse or from the manufacturer by attracting professional transportation companies in China. We expect that our revenues will be formed due sales and shipping consulting service to our potential clients (retailers and wholesalers) in Europe and North America.





	We intend to spend money on research and development when our business plan is complete in order to develop our business. We do not expect to purchase or sell plant or significant equipment. Further we do not expect significant changes in the number of employees.





	Our plan of operations is as follows:






	Complete Our Public Offering






	We expect to complete our public offering within 240 days after the effectiveness of our registration statement by the Securities and Exchange Commissions. We intend to concentrate our efforts on raising capital during this period. Our operations will be limited due to the limited amount of funds on hand. Upon completion of our public offering, our specific goal is to profitably sell our services. If we are unable to obtain minimum funding of approximately $52,000 (If 50% of the shares sold), our business may fail.





	Our plan of operations following the completion is as follows:








	Gathering of market information (1-2 months)





	No costs





	We are going to search for electronic kids toys plants around of China. We plan to study plants assortment and estimate quality and price range of electronic kids toys. We plan to find the optimal manufactures and negotiate agreements with them.








	Office and Warehouse (1st-3d months)





	$8,000-$12,000





	To successfully perform basic services it is estimated that our company would demand a PC to be connected to the Internet in order to exchange up-to-date information with toys manufacturers and their stock databases, concerning the goods. Laptops for the sales managers and a server to store our customers database and the information related to it would be another state of expenditure. The company would need an office customers and manufacturers might wish to contact to, if any information regarding services needed. We also plan to lease the small (about 1000 sq.ft) warehouse with prepared shelves to store the electronic toys for distribution. Provided that only 50% of shares are sold, the office might be equipped with simple and basic furniture, basic stationery, via phone, a fax, a printer, and two computers powerful enough to perform everyday operations, taking orders online, for instance. Provided that if 75% of shares are sold the company could consider buying better equipment. In case if 100% shares are sold, the company would consider renting an office big enough for the staff, buying all furniture needed, more powerful computers able to perform everyday operations, as well as website maintenance directly from the office.









	15 |












	Website (1st-6th months)





	$4,000-$5,000





	Once the company incorporated it is likely to need a website where all the goods are planned to be displayed. In case if 50% shares sold we would order a website of a simple design with the functions of a webstore. In case of more than 50% shares sold, we are likely to order a website designed according current trends, with embedded animation to advertise the goods. In case if 100% of shares sold, we are likely employ a multifunctional website with functions of a webstore, embedded animation and embedded video advertisements to promote either particular goods or particular vendors, with the built-in functions to order a call from the support centre, the website that would monitor the customer's activity, in order to offer them the goods they would likely need.








	Marketing (3th-12th months)





	$20,000-$65,000





	Primarily, we plan to use internet marketing tools in our marketing campaign. We plan to advertise our services and product on the following websites: www.alibaba.com, www.ebay.com, social networks such as www.facebook.com, and other specialized websites with using context ad. Our advertising budget will be spent on paying for any advertising, long distance phone calls, designing and printing of business catalogs, and traveling expenses. We plan to use internet catalogs and SEO in web search engines such as www.google.com (with using Google Adwords) and www.baidu.com. Also we are going to issue monthly printed catalog and send it to our clients. We will take part on the specialized forums and exhibitions to present our service to potential clients. We plan that it will cost at least $20,000 to start our marketing campaign. If we sell 75% of the shares offered we plan to spend approximately $42,500. In the event we sell all of the shares offered we plan to hire professional marketing agency to promote our service, therefore it will be approximately $65,000.








	Sales Manager (6th-12th months)





	$10,000-$20,000





	If we sell 50% of the shares offered we plan to hire a sales person to sell our service by calls and direct mails. The job of such sales person will be to find additional customers for us. If we sell 75% or 100% of the shares offered we are going to increase the quantity of sales associates to 2 and 3 accordingly.











	Estimated Expenses for the Next Twelve Month Period






	   The following provides an overview of our estimated expenses to fund our plan of operation over the next twelve months.

	OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS



	 


	We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

	LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY; NEED FOR ADDITIONAL CAPITAL



	 


	There is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in the start-up stage of operations and have not generated


	significant
	revenues. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products.


	We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholder.






	Results of operations








	From Inception on October 21, 2015 to January 31, 2016







	During the period we incorporated the company, prepared a business plan. Our loss since inception is $982. We have just recently started our business operations, however, will not start significant operations until we have completed this offering.


	 







	LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES



	 


	As of January 31, 2016, the Company had $6,060 cash and our liabilities were $1,042, comprising $1,042 owed to Shuisheng Zhu, our president, treasurer and director. As of January 31, 2016 our cash balance was $6,060. The available capital reserves of the Company are not sufficient for the Company to remain operational. We require minimum funding of approximately $52,000 to conduct our proposed operations and pay all expenses for a minimum period of one year including expenses associated with this offering and maintaining a reporting status with the SEC.





	As of April 7, 2016 we had $4,455 of cash and our current rate of negative cash flow per month is approximately $833 a month. The minimum period of time we will be able to conduct planned operations using currently-available capital resources is approximately five months.





	All our cash and cash equivalents generally consist of bank deposits in United States bank in US dollars. There are no restrictions on foreign exchange and our ability to transfer cash between entities.





	Since inception, we have sold 5,000,000 shares of common stocks to our president, treasurer and director, at a price of $0.001 per share, for net proceeds of $5,000 and 1,000,000 shares of common stocks to our secretary, at a price of $0.001 per share, for net proceeds of $1,000.





	We are attempting to raise funds to proceed with our plan of operations. We will have to utilize funds from Shuisheng Zhu, our president, treasurer and director, who has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process if offering proceeds are less than registration costs. However, Mr. Zhu has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. Mr. Zhus verbal agreement to provide us loans for registration costs is non- binding and discretionary. To proceed with our operations within 12 months, we need a minimum of $52,000. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to sell all the shares required to satisfy our 12 month financial requirements. If we are successful, any money raised will be applied to the items set forth in the Use of Proceeds section of this prospectus. We will attempt to raise at least the minimum funds necessary to proceed with our plan of operations. In the long term we may need additional financing. We do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing. Obtaining additional funding will be subject to a number of factors, including general market conditions, investor acceptance of our business plan and initial results from our business operations. These factors may impact the timing, amount, terms or conditions of additional financing available to us. There is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us.





	Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion, meaning that there is substantial doubt if we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital. No substantial revenues are anticipated until we have completed the financing from this offering and implemented our plan of operations. Our only source for cash at this time is investments by others in this offering. We must raise cash to implement our strategy and stay in business. The amount of the offering will likely allow us to operate for at least one year and have the capital resources required to cover the material costs with becoming a publicly reporting. The Company anticipates over the next 12 months the cost of being a reporting public company will be approximately $10,000.











	17 |









	The Company will have to meet all the financial disclosure and reporting requirements associated with being a publicly reporting company. The Companys management will have to spend additional time on policies and procedures to make sure it is compliant with various regulatory requirements, especially that of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This additional corporate governance time required of management could limit the amount of time management has to implement is business plan and impede the speed of its operations.





	Should the Company fail to raise a minimum of $52,000 under this offering the Company would be forced to scale back or abandon the implementation of its 12-month plan of operations.












	DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS



	 


	The company sees its primary goal as to distribute electronic kids toys of various price categories to both small and medium-sized vendors. Within the process of development changes in business strategy might occur, in order to provide better service, or make the business more profitable.





	Our principal office address is located at 201-5, Xin Jia Garden, Heng Qing Village, Zhuhai, China 519000. Our telephone number is +852-8191-5516. Our plan of operation is forward-looking and there is no assurance that we will ever reach profitable operations. We are a development stage company
	that has generated limited revenue


	. It is likely that we will not be able to achieve profitability and would be forced to cease operations due to the lack of funding.






	Main business concept






	The company intends to provide vending and shipping services of electronic toys of various kinds manufactured in the Republic of China.





	We are wholesale trade company. We plan to implement the distribution of electronic toys for children on the territory of Europe and North America. We act as an intermediary between our potential customers (retail stores or wholesalers) and manufacturers producing toys in China.





	We plan to provide shipping service on request of our potential customers. If our clients need shipping service we plan to act as mediator between shipping company and client. We plan to seek a transportation company that offer the best rates for shipping to our potential customer from our warehouse or from a warehouse of the supplier's or manufacturer.





	We plan to publish on our website all basic information about products and service we offer. We also plan to produce electronic catalogs in PDF format for our potential customers. We intend to search for suppliers and manufacturers of electronic toys for the children at the global trade platform in China - alibaba.com.





	For our customers convenience we consider developing a website with functions of online store, which, we expect, can make ordering of goods easier and more enjoyable. We consider the Internet to be our main marketplace, all our advertising is likely to come online in a form of clickable ads (banners) placed on the websites related to kids merchandise. We intend to increase awareness of our company by placing our video commercials within the video-streaming services (YouTube, Vimeo, Hulu, Netflix and others) that provide video for children, thereby attracting attention of parents, whom we refer to as our potential clients.





	Once the company starts running, any to manufacturers is planned to be given an option to be displayed on the website, after lodging a proper corresponding request. We plan to charge manufacturers for occupying positions on our website, offering professionally produced ads and other displaying materials.





	The services regarding toys, are aimed at different kids categories, from toddlers to teenagers. We plan to offer the goods that might be interesting to kids of various ages:





	1) Electronic toys for boys, such as remotely controlled cars, planes, helicopters, robots etc.


	2) Electronic toys for girls, such as dancing or talking dolls or animals.


	3) Electronic music instruments for kids of both genders, such as synthesizers or guitars, toy replicas of phones, tablets or computers.


	4) Parts for DIY (Do-It-Yourself) toys.


	5) Spare parts, wear parts (such as batteries) and accessories.





	This is a preliminary list which might be prolonged or shortened, or re-sorted later depending on demand or on manufacturers ability to ship some certain items. Once the company starts working, the price of the service will depend only on the price imposed by the vendor.









	Clients






	Electronic toys market is a market of mass consumption. Therefore, electronic toys distribution business is characterized by stable demand. Primary consumers are trade companies specializing in realization of toys and products for kids, large store chains and hypermarkets, gift shops, wholesale warehouses of toys. Our potential customers are likely to be those who search for relatively cheap electronic toys for kids and other merchandise of a decent quality. We expect to get orders from small and medium sized retailers (to buy large shippings), toy retailing shops, entertaining agencies.





	Currently, two large markets have been selected: Europe and North America. These markets are viewed as major with high purchasing power. These market outlets are our top priority due to their geographic proximity to China, which will allow to significantly reduce the transportation costs and, subsequently, the cost of finished products.

	Marketing and advertising






	As the company is about to operate online, we see the Internet as our main marketing and advertising space. We plan to advertise our services and product on the following websites: www.alibaba.com, www.ebay.com, social networks such as www.facebook.com, and other specialized websites with using context ad. Our advertising budget will be spent on paying for any advertising, long distance phone calls, designing and printing of business catalogs, and traveling expenses. We plan to use internet catalogs and SEO in web search engines such as www.google.com (with using Google Adwords) and www.baidu.com. Also we are going to issue monthly printed catalog and send it to our clients. We will take part on the specialized forums and exhibitions to present our service to potential clients. Therefore, the primary steps to be taken look as follows:


	- Promotion via SEO (Search Engine optimisation) to bring the name to the top in search queries;


	- Video advertisements played before Youtube videos for kids.


	- Video commercials embedded or web banners on the websites related to toys or electronic goods;


	- Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram webpages to demonstrate the variety of goods a customer could choose from, as well as to keep loyal customers updated on the services and all the specter of goods.


	- In addition, as the part of customers support, we might set up a chat on popular messaging platforms (Telegam channels or Viber group chats), where up-to-date information might also be posted.








	Competition






	The electronic toys industry is intensely competitive. We will compete against a number of large well-established companies with greater name recognition, a more comprehensive offering of products, and with substantially larger resources than ours; including financial and marketing.  We believe that our narrow focus is one of our key factors to success. As the business grows we intend to expand influence in geographical terms, and we plan to expand to markets related childrens merchandise.






	Revenue






	We plan to generate our revenue by selling electronic toys. We plan to supply our potential clients from our warehouse or from the manufacturer by attracting professional transportation companies in China. We expect that our revenues will be formed due to orders from retailers and wholesalers in Europe and North America. Our products will be offered at prices marked-up from 20% to 30% of our cost.

	 

	Our clients will be asked to 100% prepay for the products. Clients will choose any payment options they like. Clients will be responsible to cover the shipping costs. In case our customers would like to use our consulting service regarding to the shipping we will ask plus 3% additional to our price and will include a shipping company price and our service fees in a final bill.






	Insurance






	We do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are made a party of a products liability action, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease operations.






	Employees; Identification of Certain Significant Employees.






	We are a development stage company and currently have two employees. Shuisheng Zhu, our president, treasurer and director and Aleksandr Deshin, our secretary are a non-employee officers and director of the Company. We intend to hire employees on an as needed basis.

	Future sales by existing stockholders






	5,000,000 shares of common stock were issued to our president, treasurer and director and 1,000,000 shares of common stock were issued to our secretary, all of which are restricted securities, as defined in Rule 144 of the Rules and Regulations of the SEC promulgated under the Securities Act. Under Rule 144, the shares can be publicly sold, subject to volume restrictions and restrictions on the manner of sale. Such shares can only be sold after six months provided that the issuer of the securities is, and has been for a period of at least 90 days immediately before the sale, subject to the reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Shares purchased in this offering, which will be immediately resalable, and sales of all of our other shares after applicable restrictions expire, could have a depressive effect on the market price, if any, of our common stock and the shares we are offering.





	There is no public trading market for our common stock. To be quoted on the OTCBB a market maker must file an application on our behalf to make a market for our common stock. As of the date of this Registration Statement, we have not engaged a market maker to file such an application, that there is no guarantee that a market marker will file an application on our behalf, and that even if an application is filed, there is no guarantee that we will be accepted for quotation.









	PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION



	 


	We are registering 6,000,000 shares of our common stock for sale at the price of $0.02 per share.





	This is a self-underwritten offering, and Mr. Zhu, our president, treasurer and director, will sell the shares directly to family, friends, business associates and acquaintances, with no commission or other remuneration payable to him for any shares they may sell. There are no plans or arrangements to enter into any contracts or agreements to sell the shares with a broker or dealer. In offering the securities on our behalf, he will rely on the safe harbor from broker dealer registration set out in Rule 3a4-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Mr. Zhu will not register as a broker-dealer pursuant to Section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in reliance upon Rule 3a4-1, which sets forth those conditions, as noted herein, under which a person associated with an Issuer may participate in the offering of the Issuers securities and not be deemed to be a broker-dealer:



	1.


	Our president, treasurer and director is not subject to a statutory disqualification, as that term is defined in Section 3(a)(39) of the Act, at the time of his participation; and,



	2.


	Our president, treasurer and director will not be compensated in connection with his participation by the payment of commissions or other remuneration based either directly or indirectly on transactions in securities; and



	3.


	Our president, treasurer and director is not, nor will he be at the time of his participation in the offering, an associated person of a broker-dealer; and



	4.


	Our president, treasurer and director meets the conditions of paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of Rule 3a4-1 of the Exchange Act, in that he (A) primarily perform, or intend primarily to perform at the end of the offering, substantial duties for or on behalf of our company, other than in connection with transactions in securities; and (B) he is not a broker or dealer, or been an associated person of a broker or dealer, within the preceding twelve months; and (C) has not participated in selling and offering securities for any issuer more than once every twelve months other than in reliance on Paragraphs (a)(4)(i) or (a)(4)(iii). Under Paragraph 3a4-1(a)(4)(iii), our president, treasurer and director must restricts his participation to any one or more of the following activities:



	A.


	Preparing any written communication or delivering such communication through the mails or other means that does not involve oral solicitation by his of a potential purchaser; provided, however, that the content of such communication is approved by our president, treasurer and director;



	B.


	Responding to inquiries of a potential purchaser in a communication initiated by the potential purchaser; provided, however, that the content of such responses are limited to information contained in a registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933 or other offering document; or



	C.


	Performing ministerial and clerical work involved in effecting any transaction.









	23 |









	Our president, treasurer and director does not intend to purchase any shares in this offering as well as our secretary.





	This offering is self-underwritten, which means that it does not involve the participation of an underwriter or broker, and as a result, no broker for the sale of our securities will be used. In the event a broker-dealer is retained by us to participate in the offering, we must file a post-effective amendment to the registration statement to disclose the arrangements with the broker-dealer, and that the broker-dealer will be acting as an underwriter and will be so named in the prospectus. Additionally, FINRA must approve the terms of the underwriting compensation before the broker-dealer may participate in the offering.





	To the extent required under the Securities Act, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement will be filed disclosing the name of any broker-dealers, the number of shares of common stock involved, the price at which the common stock is to be sold, the commissions paid or discounts or concessions allowed to such broker-dealers, where applicable, that such broker-dealers did not conduct any investigation to verify the information set out or incorporated by reference in this prospectus and other facts material to the transaction.





	We are subject to applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations under it, including, without limitation, Rule 10b-5 and a distribution participant under Regulation M. All of the foregoing may affect the marketability of the common stock.





	All expenses of the registration statement including, but not limited to, legal, accounting, printing and mailing fees are and will be borne by us. 






	Penny Stock Regulations






	You should note that our stock is a penny stock. The SEC has adopted Rule 15g-9 which generally defines "penny stock" to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and "accredited investors". The term "accredited investor" refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer's confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock.

The indemnification is intended to be to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the State of Nevada.


	Regarding indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, which may be permitted to directors or officers under Nevada law, we are informed that, in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, indemnification is against public policy, as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM




	To the Board of Directors and stockholders of  Rizzen Inc.




	We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Rizzen  Inc. (the Company) as of January 31, 2016, and the related statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the period October 21, 2015 (Inception) through January 31, 2016.

	Rizzen Inc.

	s management is responsible for these financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.




	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.




	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of

	Rizzen Inc.

	as of  January 31, 2016 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period from October 21, 2015 (Inception) through January 31, 2016 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.



	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements the Company  has suffered net losses and has had negative cash flows from operating activities during the period ended January 31, 2016.These matters raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans concerning these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

	RIZZEN INC.







	NOTES TO THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	FOR THE PERIOD FROM INCEPTION (OCTOBER 21, 2015) TO JANUARY 31, 2016






	NOTE 1  ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION


	 Organization and Description of Business


	RIZZEN INC.(the Company) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada, U.S. on October 21, 2015.  The Companys business is distribution of childrens toys from China.


	Since inception through January 31, 2016 the Company has not generated any revenue and has accumulated losses of $982.


	Basis of Presentation


	The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and are presented in US dollars. The Company has adopted a January 31 fiscal year end.


	NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



	Cash and Cash Equivalents



	The Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents to the extent the funds are not being held for investment purposes.


	The Company's bank accounts are deposited in insured institutions. The funds are insured up to $250,000. At January 31, 2016 the Company's bank deposits did not exceed the insured amounts.



	Basic Income (Loss) Per Share



	The Company computes loss per share in accordance with ASC-260, Earnings per Share which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period.  Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.



	Dividends



	The Company has not adopted any policy regarding payment of dividends. No dividends have been paid during any of the periods shown.





	F6






	32 |

	Page

















	Income Taxes



	The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes.  Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values and their respective income tax basis (temporary differences).  

	The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.



	Advertising Costs



	The Companys policy regarding advertising is to expense advertising when incurred. The Company incurred advertising expense of $0 during as at January 31, 2016.



	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets



	The Company continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances are present, the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell.



	Use of Estimates



	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.



	Stock-Based Compensation



	As of January 31, 2016 the Company has not issued any stock-based payments to its employees. Stock-based compensation is accounted for at fair value in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and 123(R) (ASC 718).  To date, the Company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options.



	Revenue Recognition



	The Company will recognize revenue when products are fully delivered or services have been provided and collection is reasonably assured.



	Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	The Company has reviewed all the recent accounting pronouncements issued to date of the issuance of these financial statements, and does not believe any of these pronouncements will have a material impact on the company.


	NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN


	The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future.  


	F-7

	Page



















	The Company has incurred a loss since Inception (October 21, 2015) resulting in an accumulated deficit of $982 as of January 31, 2016 and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business.  Accordingly, there is substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.  


	The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand and loans from directors and/or private placement of common stock.  


	NOTE 4  CAPTIAL STOCK


	The Company has 75,000,000 shares of common stock authorized with a par value of $0.001 per share.


	On January 13, 2016 the Company issued 5,000,000 shares of its common stock at $0.001 per share for total proceeds of $5,000. On January 26, 2016 the Company issued 1,000,000 shares of its common stock at $0.001 per share for total proceeds of $1,000.


	As of January 31, 2016 the Company had 6,000,000 shares issued and outstanding.


	NOTE 5  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS


	 In support of the Companys efforts and cash requirements, it may rely on advances from related parties until such time that the Company can support its operations or attains adequate financing through sales of its equity or traditional debt financing. There is no formal written commitment for continued support by officers, directors, or shareholders. Amounts represent advances or amounts paid in satisfaction of liabilities. The advances are considered temporary in nature and have not been formalized by a promissory note.  


	Since October 21, 2015 (Inception) through January 31, 2016, the Companys sole officer and director loaned the Company $1,042 to pay for incorporation costs and operating expenses.  As of January 31, 2016, the amount outstanding was $1,042. The loan is non-interest bearing, due upon demand and unsecured.


	NOTE 6  INCOME TAX


	As of January 31, 2016 the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of $982 that may be available to reduce future years taxable income through 2036. Future tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have not been recognized in these financial statements, as their realization is determined not likely to occur and accordingly, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to these tax loss carry-forwards.


	NOTE 7  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS





	In accordance with ASC 855, the Company has analyzed its operations subsequent to January 31, 2016 through the date these financial statements were issued, and has determined that it does not have any material subsequent events to disclose in these financial statements.

	ITEM 17. UNDERTAKINGS



	 


	The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes:





	1)


	To file, during any period in which offers or sales of securities are being made, a post-    effective amendment to this registration statement to:





	(i)


	Include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;



	(ii)


	To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) (§230.424(b) of this chapter) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the Calculation of Registration Fee table in the effective registration statement.



	(iii)


	To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement;


	2)


	That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.





	3)


	To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering.





	4)


	That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser:





	(i)


	If the registrant is subject to Rule 430C, each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use.





	5)


	That, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities: The undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:


	 


	(i)


	Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424;


	 


	(ii)


	Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant;


	 


	(iii)


	The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or our securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and





	(iv)


	Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser.


	 


	Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 (the Act) may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the provisions above, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and is, therefore, unenforceable.


	 


	In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities, other than the payment by us of expenses incurred or paid by one of our directors, officers, or controlling persons in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding, is asserted by one of our directors, officers, or controlling persons in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and we will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

	Zhuhai, China 519000


	 



	RE: Legal Opinion Pursuant to SEC Form S-1 for Rizzen Inc.




	        Registration Statement-File No. 333-209900



	 


	Ladies and Gentlemen:


	We have acted as special counsel to Rizzen Inc., a Nevada corporation (the 

	Company

	), in connection with the filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the 

	Commission

	) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the 

	Act

	), of a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-209900), as amended (the 

	Registration Statement

	), relating to an initial public offering of 6,000,000 shares of the Companys Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the 

	Common Stock

	), to be sold by the Company.





	In rendering the opinion expressed below, we have (

	a

	) examined and relied on the originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such agreements, documents and records of the Company and such other instruments and certificates of public officials, officers and representatives of the Company and others as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purposes of such opinion,


	(b) examined and relied as to factual matters upon and have assumed the accuracy of, the statements made in the certificates of public officials, officers and representatives of the Company and others delivered to us and (

	c

	) made such investigations of law as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for such opinion. In rendering the opinion expressed below, we have assumed, with your permission, without independent investigation or inquiry, (

	i

	) the authenticity and completeness of all documents submitted to us as originals, (

	ii

	) the genuineness of all signatures on all documents that we examined, (

	iii

	) the conformity to authentic originals and completeness of documents submitted to us as certified, conformed or reproduction copies and (

	iv

	) the legal capacity of all natural persons executing documents.












	 




	 




	 




	 




	 





	 


	 Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we make the following opinion on the legality of the securities being registered. We are of the opinion that:


	 


	1. The Company has an authorized capitalization of 75,000,000 shares of Common Stock, $0.001 par value, and no shares of Preferred Stock.


	 


	2. The 6,000,000 shares of Common Stock are duly authorized for issuance by the Company and, when issued and paid for as described in the Registration Statement, will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.








	We express no opinion herein as to the laws of any state or jurisdiction other than the Nevada Revised Statutes as they apply to private corporations formed under the laws of the State of Nevada and the federal laws of the United States of America, as in effect on the date hereof.


	 


	We hereby consent to the use of our name under the heading Legal Matters in the Registration Statement to be filed by the Company with the Commission. We further consent to your filing a copy of this opinion as Exhibit 5.1 to the Registration Statement. In giving such permission, we do not admit hereby that we come within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act, or the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder. We disclaim any undertaking to advise you of any subsequent changes of the facts stated or assumed herein or any subsequent changes in applicable law.


	 





	 


	Very Truly Yours,

	6. Confidentiality






	Seller and Purchaser may have an opportunity to receive, directly or indirectly, Confidential Information, as defined below, of the other party. Seller and Purchaser, each as a receiving party, agree to keep all Confidential Information supplied to and/or learned by it in the strictest confidence. For purposes of this Agreement, Confidential Information shall mean any commercially sensitive information in its broadest context, and may include, by way of example but without limitation, products, specifications, formulae, equipment, business strategies, customer lists, know-how, drawings, pricing information, inventions, ideas, and other information, or its potential use, that is owned by or in possession of the disclosing party. Confidential Information shall not include that which: (a) is in the public domain prior to disclosure to the receiving party; (b) becomes part of the public domain, by publication or otherwise, through no unauthorized act or omission on the part of the receiving party; or (c) is lawfully in the receiving partys possession prior to disclosure hereunder.




	Proper and appropriate steps shall be taken and maintained by the receiving party to protect Confidential Information. Dissemination of Confidential Information shall be limited to employees or agents that are directly involved with performance under this Agreement, and even then only to such extent as is necessary and essential. The receiving party shall inform its employees and agents of the confidential nature of the information disclosed hereunder and cause all such employees and agents to abide by the terms of these provisions.




	The receiving party shall not disclose Confidential Information to any unauthorized party without prior express written consent of the disclosing party or unless required by law or court order. If the receiving party is required by law or court order to disclose Confidential Information, the receiving party shall provide the disclosing party with prompt written notice of such requirement so that an appropriate protective order or other relief may be sought. The obligations imposed by this Agreement, including but not limited to non-disclosure and non-use, however, shall endure so long as the Confidential Information does not become part of the public domain.




	Confidential Information will be used only in connection with performance of this Agreement; no other use of Confidential Information will be made by receiving party, it being recognized that disclosing party has reserved all rights to Confidential Information not expressly granted herein. All documents containing Confidential Information and provided by disclosing party shall remain the property of the disclosing party, and all such documents, and copies thereof, shall be returned or destroyed upon the request of the disclosing party. Documents prepared by the receiving party using Confidential Information, or derived therefrom, shall be destroyed upon request of the disclosing party, confirmation of which shall be provided in writing. However, the receiving party may keep one copy of any document requested to be returned or destroyed in the files of its legal department or outside counsel for record purposes only.






	7. Force Majeure






	a. Performance may be suspended, in whole or in part, by either party in the event of, and to the extent that, acts of God, war, riot, fire, explosion, accident, flood, sabotage, lack of adequate fuel, power, raw materials, labor, containers or transportation facilities, compliance with governmental laws or regulations (except as referred to in paragraph C of this Section), orders or action, breakage or failure of machinery or apparatus, national defense requirements, or any other event beyond the reasonable control of such party which prevents the manufacture, shipment, acceptance, or use of a shipment of any goods hereunder. Seller or Purchaser without liability may cancel deliveries so suspended and (a) Purchaser may obtain goods and/or services from any other source under such terms and conditions as may be necessary for securing replacement goods, and (b) Seller may sell goods and/or services from any other source under such terms and conditions as may be necessary to sell such goods and/or services. If, after Seller and Purchaser shall have consulted in advance, in good faith, with regard




	to the force majeure and the duration and the quantities involved, (a) in order to secure replacement goods and/or services it is necessary in good faith for Purchaser to enter into a contract for greater than a replacement quantity, or (b) in order to sell the goods and/or services it is necessary in good faith for Seller to enter into a contract for greater than a replacement quantity, then performance hereunder with respect to such goods and/or services shall be suspended until completion of such other contract.




	b. In the event of all such force majeure occurrences, including such other contracts, are not remedied within a period of one hundred eighty (180) days from occurrence, the parties shall meet, in good faith, to determine a mutually agreeable course of action, including renegotiation of this Agreement, if appropriate. If the parties are unable to reach agreement, either party, at its option, may terminate this contract upon sixty (60) days written notice.
