SEPARATION ANXIETY - $25

Over the years I have worked on and
developed many versions of the classic effect, OUT OF THIS WORLD. In fact, the
first effect I ever released was called COUPLES — a version of OOTW that, at
the time, Paul Curry stated was the best variation of his original that he had
seen, and offered to market it for me! It was a most encouraging start to what
has become a most interesting field of endeavor.

Now, these many years later, I’ve finally
developed an extremely straightforward, hands-off, two-phase routine that
utilizes deeply layered methods, befitting this classic effect of Mentalism. Watching
the impact it has on both laymen and Magicians/Mentalists alike has convinced
me it’s one of the most powerfully direct and clean presentations available. 
Via an ebooklet, with embedded videos,  you can also learn this most amazing
of effects that slayed them when premiered at the prestigious MEETING OF THE
MINDS and has fooled some of the best minds in the business.  

Here are a few unedited quotes:
Barrie Richardson:  Elegant. The trick of the year.

Doug Dyment: With Separation Anxiety, Bruce has taken a well-loved 
plot ('OOTW'), added a dollop of ideas from others, and then worked his 
well-known magic, streamlining the action, removing the dead time and false 
actions, clarifying the display, simplifying the mechanics, and topping the 
whole thing with a killer ending. A tiny, elegant masterpiece, and one of the 
few "card tricks" I perform.

Christopher Carter: When I
first saw Bruce Bernstein perform Separation Anxiety, I knew I had to learn
it.  It was the cleanest, most direct
handling of Out of This World I had seen. 
I didn’t see how it could be improved upon.  Then Bruce showed me the second phase, and it
was even more incredible than the first.”

Few creators understand
what mentalism should really look like in performance better than Bruce.   The first phase of Separation Anxiety is as
perfect as any mental card effect could be. 
Gone is the unusual procedure of most versions of Paul Curry’s classic
effect.   A spectator psychically
separates a small back of cards into reds and blacks.  That’s it! 
It’s that direct.  But Bruce
doesn’t stop there.  As soon as the
spectator has picked her jaw up from the floor, he has her do it again, but
this time with a twist so diabolical it just has to be seen to be believed.
I never thought I
needed  another card effect in my
repertoire until I saw Separation Anxiety. Now I know better. It’s definitely going into
my repertoire.
Matthew Field -THE MAGIC CIRCULAR: Paul
Curry’s “Out of This World” is, perhaps, the most
popular card trick ever.  A problem with it is, however, that it
is a tough sell to make it seem “psychic”.  Chicago
mentalist and magician Bruce Bernstein spent years trying to come with
a method which fit his persona, and “Separation Anxiety” is
it.

The spectator is handed a packet of 20 cards and told to deal them into
two fairly equal piles, but not haphazardly or simply alternating
piles; she is to “follow her intuition”.  The wizard
counts one of the piles and congratulates the spectator when the total
is seen to be 10 ‒ precisely half. The top card of one pile is turned
over ‒ it is red.  The top card of the other pile is black. 
Several more cards are turned over in pairs ‒ again, red in one pile,
black in the other. The remainders of both piles are turned over,
showing a perfect separation.

As a follow-up, the wonder worker removes an Ace of Spades from his
pocket and states that he will make the spectator treat this card as
red, as he openly inserts it into the packet of cards and mixes
them.  Again, the cards are dealt into two piles. One pile is
shown to consist entirely of black cards, the other of all red cards ‒
except for the Ace of Spades, seen in the centre of the
“red” pile.

As one would expect from Bruce Bernstein, this is devilishly
clever.  $25 might seem a bit expensive for a 16-page pdf, but the
price is for the years of thinking that went into the method, and the
fact that the working mentalist will get a lot of mileage out of
this.  Three brief videos are included illustrating a few of the
fine points.

Bob Farmer: Bruce
Bernstein, who has an honored place in my book, as one of the premier
Sultans of Swindle, was selling a new trick, "Separation Anxiety,"
which sounded--like a lot of Bruce's stuff--completely impossible. So I
figured--like a lot of Bruce's stuff--the method would be in the upper
echelons of deviousness--and I just had to know how it worked because
here's the effect:


You hand a spectator a small packet of ungaffed, face-down cards. You
tell her to follow her intuition and deal the packet into two piles on
the table--but she is to deal the cards completely at random (i.e., not
back and forth in a regular manner, but helter skelter).








She does so. When the two piles are checked:








1. There are exactly ten cards in each pile.








2. She has somehow divided the ten red cards from the ten black cards.








This is about as clean and fast an "Out of this World" effect as you
can get. Bruce also provides a second phase, different from the first,
which in effect is different enough to be interesting, and in method
relies on something the audience has understood from the first phase.








It's 16 pages of unmitigated sneakiness and I highly recommend it to one and all. 
Ross Johnson: Bruce Bernstein is in creative mode and has
traveled to a new solar system. On the heels of the ground breaking
"TABOO" comes a refined take on the always intriguing "Out of
this World". Only the mind of Bernstein can both simplify method and
expand impact at the same time. This is a routine not to be overlooked by any
worker who presents miracles of only the highest quality.

Alain Nu: Bruce Bernstein has been one of the most
clever creators in the field of psychic entertainment and a true inspiration
for many other artists such as myself. Bruce is like a scientist, whose clever
mind continues to search for the answers to the even greater mysteries behind
the already great mysteries which we cherish. In Bernstein's "Separation
Anxiety," you will find about the cleanest answer to Paul Curry's
"Out of This World" to date. Recently, while in Chicago, he showed it to me and it left me
speechless. It happens a LOT faster than you would expect! Now is your chance
to learn this quickly... either before he changes his mind, or I make him
change his mind!


Jheff’s Marketplace of the
Mind:
 This is a lean, direct, powerful,
and easy-to-do version of the classic Paul Curry effect.  And,
besides, if you've read his landmark book,  UNREAL, you know that
anything with Bruce Bernstein's name on it is,
sight  unseen, well-worth getting!
 Of course, the plot, which
you probably know already, involves the  participant amazingly separating red and
black cards.  This version, 
which only uses twenty cards, is based on ideas from Brad
Henderson and Jon  Armstrong, who, in turn, based their work on
ideas from Martin Gardner and  Paul Curry (though not all of
Gardner's and Curry's ideas are  in SEPARATION ANXIETY).  It starts and ends clean and most definitely  can be done with a borrowed deck of cards and
in impromptu situations.   In fact, it's probably best for that.
 Using twenty cards
certainly solves the controversial issue of the  effect being too long.  The entire stack is handed to the participant to  separate which makes this a very nice hands-off
presentation.  And the  clean-up is much cleaner and far less awkward than
the usual manner in which  it is done. For those familiar
with Jon Armstrong's "Out of This Blah Blah  Blah," know that this was certainly
Bernstein's










inspiration and
starting  point, but he has added some touches that take this
effect into an entirely  new and different level.
 I'll also note that
Bernstein includes a second variation which allows  for the effect to be repeated.  It is rather amazing as it features
a  powerful prediction that's quite a shocker to the layman.
 This is being sold as a 16
page downloadable PDF with some embedded  videos. I know that this should be obvious
but I'll say it anyway: this is  highly recommended.

UNREAL - $65.00

The manipulation of thought, memory and perception in psychic entertainment 

At
last, a three year effort at collecting, reorganizing, and
rewriting
all of my previously published works, (whether well known or highly
obscure),
has finally been completed. Whenever appropriate, the material has been
rewritten to make it even more accessible and clear to the reader. I've
added tips, touches, and updates to many of the effects, as well as
including ten new essays, specially created for this book. All of the
material has also
been reorganized by the type of effect being presented. 


Now,
gathered in 256 pages, bound in deluxe hardcover; all of my materials
published before 2012 have been newly edited and expanded, as well as being expertly illustrated
by Tony Dunn.


UNREAL
contains it all - from what I, and many others, believe is the most
commercial effect ever created, Eat at Joe's, to card miracles such
as Psych-Out, a revelatory improvement to the
10 Card Poker Deal concept, to must-learn techniques as
my Bernstein Center
Tear, and beyond. UNREAL covers territory essential to every wonder
worker's repertoire.





























































The book outlines mysteries with the most basic of objects: slips of
paper, cards, and money, as well as inexplicable feats of thought
reading: predictions, mind reading feats, psychometry, utility
techniques for obtaining secret information, cold reading scripts and
techniques, and more.

Barrie Richardson - "This is the most stimulating book on Mentalism or Magic I've read in years." 

Jeff McBride - "I've
just gone on tour and had 3 bliss filled days with your book
 UNREAL.  I love so many of the ideas too, and have already
started to work on a few!"

Jheff's Marketplace of the Mind -  "These
are the facts: Bruce Bernstein is one of the most creative thinkers in
mentalism. This book is a collection of most of his material. Also,
quite a bit of his material I have used, still use, or plan on using at
some point in the future. Most everything in this book is classic stuff
that professional mentalists the world over have been using for years,
such as "Eat at Joe's."




























"Really, besides what's already written in the blurb, is there anything
else that needs to be said? Oh, yeah, the book is gorgeous (real linen
hardcover; 7.5" x 10"; 242 pages). For those wondering what kind of
mentalism effects that Bernstein specializes in, I think I can safely
say that




























              if you like the work of Barrie Richardson, then you'll like this."




























"One more thing: I don't often say that something is a must-have, but
if anything released this year deserves that label, this is it."



David Britland - "Unreal 
contains nine chapters in all, the remainder covering routines with money, 
psychometry, 13 variations of a routine involving time travel, and a chapter on 
techniques that also details Bruce’s Centre Tear. Interspersed between the 
chapters are essays on various aspects of mentalism from presentation and 
exposure to getting caught and the basic skills that every mentalist should 
have. Bruce Bernstein is a clever fellow and it’s a pleasure to read the 
additions and twists he gives to many standard plots. The routines are very 
practical, inherently crafty, and incorporate the kind of psychological touches 
that are increasingly part of contemporary mentalism. The tricks have weathered 
the years well, possibly because Bruce was ahead of his time when he devised 
them. Taken together, the variety of 
presentations, methods, techniques, and good advice not only make the book a 
valuable source of ideas for the experienced performer but also a great first 
book for anyone who wants to try their hand at 
mentalism."
































TABOO - $100.00


TABOO
is the first offering in a series of restricted releases aimed at the
"inner-school" of Psychic Entertainers. These manuscripts will only be
available directly through me and will not be wholesaled to dealers. My
plan is to release materials over time that I've been holding back, or
that have been created recently that meet only the highest standards of
which I am capable.












































I'm proud to start these offerings with the release of TABOO, since I
feel it represents some of my finest thinking and blazes new ground in
Psychic Entertainment. The concepts explained in this book
will show you ways to reveal audience members' deepest, darkest
secrets, in an amazingly entertaining
manner.
Here's what I
wrote in the introduction - "TABOO is a unique melding of concepts
I’ve been working on for nearly a decade and is perhaps the most
advanced routine of Psychic Entertainment I’ve ever created.









It would be wrong to just call TABOO an effect, it’s so
much more than that. Let me also state as clearly as I can, that TABOO
is only suitable for the boldest and most charismatic of performers. This is
not something to be done casually for some friends or as a
demonstration of mental magic.









But that said, even if you never perform the effect, I believe
that you’ll find there is much to be gleaned from my thinking
about this presentation from the “cutting edge.”Another
point I should make clear at the start is that TABOO must be
personalized and custom tailored to the particular performer who is
brave and talented enough to tackle this presentation. To expect a
“one size fits all” script or approach is only asking for
failure. But with the techniques and variations I’ll be sharing
in the book, the right performer will have found his or her
miracle." 
Although,
I describe several variations on the theme in the book, including "THE
ULTIMATE TABOO, which I created for my own personal use,
here's the basic plot:














































Several
spectators are asked to join you onstage and are requested to think of
things they have done, or might do, that would be considered "Taboo" by
most people.














































You then start to read their thoughts all at the
same time, revealing facts and information in a way worthy of a soap
opera or reality show.














































Even though they are asked to keep a
"poker face" and not give you any hints about their secret
Taboo, you are able to "zero in" more and more on each of their
secret thoughts, until it
starts to become clear you're starting to figure out just which Taboo
each of them are thinking of.














































Then, in the most incredible of
climaxes, each of them individually acknowledges time and time again, 
just how how accurate you've been in discovering their most personal
of information.














































O.K. - Although that sounds incredible, I know
what you're thinking. 
Even if that were possible (which it is!), I'm
sure you're thinking that this routine could easily cause embarrassment
or discomfort to those participating. But, perhaps the most amazing
part of the routine are the many psychological subtleties and powerful gambits
I teach that will actually put them at ease and show them how to thoroughly
enjoy their roles as the "Stars" of the presentation.


Michael Weber - "I
believe two things about Taboo to be true: 1) Bruce has crafted a
routine which is both practical and powerful, and 2) 99.9% of the
mentalists I have seen don't have the balls to present it the way it
deserves to be performed."
Christopher Carter
- "Bruce Bernstein is a genius. This fact is accepted by everybody who
knows his work. Where others put out minor variations of popular and
frequently over used themes, Bruce’s published effects
consistently range from innovative to groundbreaking. It’s not
that he doesn’t draw inspiration from prior creators. All
creators do that. What makes Bruce’s work stand out are two
things. First, he sees the potential in ideas that the rest of us
breeze over without noticing. Second, he combines these ideas in such a
way that the result is vastly greater than the sum of the parts."



























"Taboo is a perfect product of Bruce’s devious mind. Within the
method, there are elements that we all will recognize but they are
applied, in combination, to a devastating effect."



























"And what is that effect? It’s practically the holy grail of
mentalism. When people find out that you’re a mind reader, they
worry that you’ll be able to divine their deepest, most intimate
secrets. Thanks to Taboo, you do exactly that. Amazingly, Bruce stages
things so that you reveal their secrets in such a way that they will
never be publicly embarrassed, and yet there is no doubt that you have
received impressions you really should not be able to know."



























"When Bruce first shared his idea with me a few years ago, I was
delighted with its boldness and simplicity, and I hoped to one day be
able to do it. Since that time he has refined the routine and added
subtleties that make it even stronger. It ranks, in my opinion, among
his best work."



























"I have one caveat about Taboo. The characteristic that makes
Bruce’s work stand out is that he understands the difference
between mentalism and magic. His best effects rely on subtle methods
that require a bold and confident performance to pull off. No sleights
are required, but you must be able to bluff with impunity. Because of
this, brilliance of Taboo will probably go unrecognized by the
beginning mentalist or mental magician. That’s bad news for Bruce
in terms of product sales, but great news for the rest of us. Those who
study and perform this will have a miracle that I predict very few
others will be doing." 

Jon Stetson - "Taboo is Too Good.  It's Bruce's greatest creation to date! 
At $100.00, this masterpiece is way underpriced. For me, it is worth 
thousands - I wish I could keep this one for myself. Thank goodness 
Bruce uses his power for good!"
"PS. For anyone wondering the difference between Mentalism and Mental Magic, buy 
Taboo and find out."

TABOO - Cover Art





WILL
POWER - $50

I sincerely
believe it to be original, dramatic and as close to an
actual demonstration of how material objects can be
physically controlled by the
power of the mind as may ever be developed. You receive a 12 page
booklet that breaks the routine down in detail along with those other
special "things" you'll need.

 

Banachek: "Every
mentalist or magician is looking for that Holy Grail
of effects. You know the one, the one that looks impromptu, the one
that can be performed anywhere anytime, close up, cabaret or stage, the
one that can be whipped out for a newspaper story and become the center
piece for the reporter to hang his words of astonishment upon."
 
"With Bruce
Bernstein's contribution of WILL POWER, that Grail
has been created for us.  Bruce
has fabricated a brilliant routine with props that fit in your change
pocket. It really is that tiny but the impact and reactions are
incredibly huge.  The
effect is non assuming yet grows with each stage of the routine. The
impossibilities stack up one on top of the other to create a
well-choreographed piece of theater that does not feel like theater, it
feels genuine.  This
is not mental magic, it can not even be described as mentalism as that
would not do it justice, it
appears to be a real feat of psychic power. 
But hey, what would you expect from the mind of Bruce
Bernstein, nothing less.  I
will carry this with me."

 Ken
Weber: "I
was asked which effect was the hit of the Psychic Entertainer's
Association's annual convention, the 'Meeting Of The Minds.' 
While I loved many routines, Bruce's WILL POWER stole the show. It is a
novel plot, it builds and builds in its impossibility, and it was
presented brilliantly. For me, in terms of seeing something new and
wonderful, THIS was the winner."

"Let me add that if you
simply read the description supplied on Bruce's website you will
understandably assume that this is strictly a close-up effect. It's
not. I watched Bruce perform the routine from many rows back and I can
tell you that although I could not see anything happening in terms of
the coins, the sounds of the coins spinning on the plates, as carried
over the sound system, lent this routine a dense layer of drama that
added immensely to its effectiveness. In other words, this can be
strong as a stage effect! And yes, it will be wonderful close-up as
well." 

Larry Becker: "I've
thoroughly enjoyed using Bruce Bernstein's "WILL POWER" since I
acquired it from Bruce. It's a spell binding close-up effect that plays
larger than life thanks to the intriguing musicality of the
spinning coins and Bruce's entertaining routine."


Ross Johnson:
"With WILL POWER, Bruce Bernstein has produced a complete
routine that
is practical and actually do-able as it stands. Not since Ned
Rutledge's "Minding the Store" has a performance piece been so
thoroughly explained and analyzed for maximum impact. Every nuance is
covered. It's impact is long lasting. Will Power has become one of
three Bruce Bernstein products that I will not leave home without."

PSI-DECK


My take on the famous “Tossed Out Deck”, but so
diabolically clever, it will fool anyone familiar with the original.

 



Max Maven: "If Machiavelli had wanted to do card mentalism,
he might
have come up with something like Bruce Bernstein's PSI-DECK -- but he
probably wouldn't have had the patience to make the gaffs."  


Larry Becker: "Unreservedly recommended. Outstanding...a
beautiful product."  

 

Craig Karges: "With a combination of principles and an
ingeniously
constructed deck, Bruce has put together a wonderful routine with
PSI-DECK. It is inexplicable and what mentalism with cards should look
like - simple, direct, and baffling." 

 

Ford Kross: "Regular readers of mine, are aware of my
antipathy to card
tricks. So, if I rave about one, I must really be impressed.
Such
is the case with Bruce Bernstein's PSI-DECK." 

 

"Dave Hoy's Tossed-Out deck is already a classic, but imagine this
improvement. A deck of cards is fanned and shown to appear normal.
Three participants are freely selected. As in Hoy's classic, a
rubberbanded deck of cards is given to #1, he looks at one card. The
same deck is given to #2, same procedure. You are able to name the
cards looked at and even tell who has which, unlike Hoy's effect, they
have different cards. With the third participant, you remove an
envelope and place it in sight, the slowly dealing from the same deck
on to the table, you ask them to tell you when to stop. After the
chosen card is shown, they open the envelope and reveal that you've
correctly predicted it." 

"As you might think, this is not an ordinary deck. Bruce has produced a
beautiful gimmicked deck that is extremely versatile." 

 

Richard Busch (author of Peek Performances): "PSI-DECK is
beyond my
inadequate words altogether. After two participants each hold the cards
themselves (!) and each peek a card, a card is CLEANLY dealt that
matches a premonition that was in plain view beforehand. You can
instantly name both peeked cards and hit on the premonition. No
switching, no switching predictions, no switching anything, I mean
nothing. If this isn't stunning and direct, then I don't know what is. Considering the incredible,
unbelievable, time consuming workmanship
involved in this creation, Bruce's decks are well worth the investment.

My version of what is perhaps the
greatest force deck of all times - the Monte Cristo Deck.  I
produced a small run of these at the same time PSI-DECKS were made. I
have never advertised or wholesaled these decks and will not be making
more when the stock is gone.They have the same Mermaid backs (only
available in blue) and are made from the same high quality casino card
stock. In addition to the deck itself, additional gimmicked cards are
supplied that will allow you to perform some powerful routines not
possible with the force deck alone. (Since it forces the 2 of Clubs, it is the perfect deck to use in my Bernstein's Bet routine, described in my book, UNREAL.)

LINKING PINS ROUTINE - $25 


An incredible four phase routine that you will use!


Includes the two, three inch safety pins, a DVD with the routine and
full explanation, and a 17" x 22" poster (no
page turning with props in hand) with seventeen line drawings to make
learning easy! 

All
Pins purchased directly from me are personally double checked and
tested before shipping.





Barrie Richardson:
Bruce Bernstein's Linking Pin Routine is one of the most astonishing
and entertaining effects on this planet - period!

 

Hank Moorehouse: From A to Z - the best linking pin routine
I've ever seen.


 Bruce Barnett: "I liked Bruce's Linking Pin
Routine. This is a
routine where large safety pins link and unlink in slow motion. There
is a finale, and at the end - the pins are passed out for examination.
(no switch!) Even when I knew the principle, he fooled me with it." 


Phil Wilmarth (Linking Ring): "Here is a superb four part
routine...
The final phase is a wonderful visual unlinking of a spectator's finger
ring from a pin as a separate pin immediately links to the very same
pin the ring just left. Bruce also explains how to pass the pins out
for examination, upon completion of the routine, without switches. It's
a fooler of a routine, yet is not that difficult to do..."

LECTURE INFORMATION








If you’re into Mentalism or Magic, then you’ve heard of
Bruce Bernstein. His products have gained great acclaim from around the
world, and his routines are used by many of today's top working pros.
Among his critically acclaimed creations are PSI-TECH, PSI-KICKS,
CLASSICS, PERCEPTION IS EVERYTHING, PSYCH-OUT, THE BERNSTEIN CENTER
TEAR, COUPLES, THREE, LINKING PINS, and PSI-DECK, of which Max Maven
said, "If Machiavelli had wanted to do Card Mentalism, he might of come
up with something like Bruce Bernstein's PSI-DECK.”





He “paid his dues” as demonstrator at Frances and Jay
Marshall’s famous Magic Inc. in Chicago for almost 17 years.
Bruce either lectured and/or performed at all of TONY ANDRUZZI’S
legendary “INVOCATIONALS”, and received the Psychic
Entertainer’s Association’s  “BLACKWOOD
AWARD” for OUTSTANDING CONTRIBUTIONS to the ART of MENTALISM as
well as the “LEDERMAN AWARD” for OUTSTANDING CREATIVITY.
His lectures on Magic and Mentalism have been critically acclaimed
throughout the country, and Bruce has lectured at the famed
“Magic Castle”, as well as being a featured
performer/lecturer at the “05 Abbott’s Close Up
Convention”, the “Magic In the Rockies”, and, of
course, the “Mindvention.” In addition to his onstage
appearances, he serves as a consultant and has developed material for
some of the biggest names in the field.





Here are a few quotes: 





Jeff McBride: “Your lectures are fabulous!”






Jon Stetson: Bruce Bernstein is a genius. He didn’t pay me to say this.  In fact, I paid him. After having had the opportunity to see Bruce lecture and reading his
wonderful books, I hired Bruce as a consultant. We have worked on
several projects, and will continue to work together as long as I have
a say in the matter! Anyone involved with any form of mystery entertainment, MUST spend an
evening at a Bruce Bernstein lecture.  Bruce is one clever fellow,
a tremendous teacher, and one heck of a great guy. No matter what type of magic/mentalism that may be your particular
field of interest there is much to be learned, and thoroughly enjoyed.
First of all Bruce will fool you, and you will like it! In a world
filled with magical pipedreams, Bruce’s presentations are
choc-full of sound, practical, doable, and dare I say commercial
ideas.  These time proven effects are taught with care and sound
advice.  Bruce has a fascinating background in Mystery
entertainment.  He has rubbed shoulders with the greats in the
industry.  Having spent years working with Jay Marshall at Magic
inc., hundreds of professional performances under his belt, and years
of study, writing, teaching and consulting.  When Bruce speaks,
“the boys” are all ears. Oh, and by the way, if you are in the position to book a Bruce Bernstein lecture, he will make you look like a genius!





Bob Sheets : “I am a fan, and after you have seen Bruce Bernstein, you will be one too!”





Eugene Burger: "Bruce Bernstein's lectures are super. I've attended
many of them. He always has clever, practical ideas for close up and
even palour and stage effects that will amaze our audiences. I perform
two Bernstein effects in my own repertoire and I never fail to astound
people with them. Don't pass up and opportunity to hear Bruce Bernstein
lecture." 





Max Maven: "Bruce starts with offbeat ideas, and then takes them further than you'd expect, with great results." 





Stephen Minch: "Bruce Bernstein has devised some of the most diabolical
conceits in modern Mentalism. When he talks I listen -- really
carefully." 





Luke Jermay: “Bruce is without a doubt one of mentalism’s
greatest thinkers.  He subtle attention to detail takes what in
others hands could have been mere tricks and turns them into fully
formed miracles. I only meet Bruce recently and yet I felt as if I had
known him for years. I think this may be down to the fact that Bruce
also excels at a skill many mentalists do not. In Bruce's writings you
find passion and soul. After reading his work I felt I "knew"
him.  His attention to detail does not go amiss in his writing
either. You can be sure when you buy a book with Bernstein on the cover
you are getting the complete and real work on the effects within. With
effects such as Perception is Everything, which I think is probably the
first application of its method in mentalism at such a high level and
has spurred on many including myself to create effects using its
conceptual teaching and The Ritual, which is probably as close to "mind
control" as any one could wish to get, his Emergency Mentalism shows
his ability to create material for the real worker and has personally
saved me on more than one occasion. I could cite material from Bruce's prolific output and explain exactly
why I love them so much - but would rather you begin your own journey
into this amazing mentalist’s mind and begin to ask yourself why
you love this material as much as me. And I have not even started on
his brilliant Centre Tear yet! I feel honoured to be asked to comment on material this good.  I
can only hope that I one day create something as brilliant as Bruce's
material.  Do yourself a favor and hand him a check for everything
he puts out and do not miss out on anything he writes.  You will
be sorry if you do."





John Luka: "Bruce lectured for our group at The Magic Shop in Garden
City, Michigan last night. The lecture was / he was MAGNIFICENT! This definitely ranks with the top lectures I have seen in the past
few years. Bruce obviously enjoys lecturing. It certainly showed. NO
ONE left the lecture dissatisfied.  If you have the opportunity to attend Bruce's lecture, be sure you do.
Or better yet, contact Bruce and arrange to have him lecture for your
group. You'll be glad you did." 

Bruce Barnett (Moderator of the E.G.): "There are 2 traits that I look
for: impact and entertainment. I look for material that allows me to
have fun with the audience. Last night I saw Bruce Bernstein's lecture.
Every routine I saw him perform has been added to my list. The nice
thing about his routines is the versatility. Take 'Psych-Out'. This can
be used by gamblers, mentalists, card experts, or bizzarrists. I'm
going to have fun with this routine. I liked Bruce's 'Linking Pins'
routine. Even when I knew the principle he fooled me with it. 'Couples'
is baffling to magicians and non magicians. This is a trait that most
of Bruce's routines have. Devious might be the better word. He fooled
me many times." 




"Every routine is well constructed, strong, baffling, and suitable to a wide variety of venues. Highly Recommended." 





Marc DeSouza: I just wanted to thank you for the incredible lecture you
gave at my home. Truly something for everyone. Your theories on
mentalism were "thought provoking" to say the least. The Center Tear is
one of the best, most practical handlings I have seen. I was only sorry
that you taught Psych-Out; it's too good and I wanted to keep it for
myself. It is certainly a routine to be added to my working repertoire.






Lee Earle: "There are very few lecturers who pack as much value into a
lecture as does Bruce Bernstein. This is a performer who knows what he
is talking about and is one of those rare individuals who thinks.
Anyone who attends his lecture and doesn't come away with a headfull of
clever, practical. no nonsense material just wasn't paying attention.
If you're booked to perform on the night Bruce is scheduled to lecture,
give the gig to your competition. You won't regret it." 





Gary Kurtz: "Bruce Bernstein, through his books on Mentalism, has long
been an inspiration to me. His lecture is filled with strong, usable
effects accomplished by devious 'working man' methods. Definitely see
his lecture if you have a chance." 






Bruce has two different lectures, and also offers an in-depth Mentalism
workshop, done in the traditional "Teach-In style" for a limited number
of attendees. 





Lee Marelli (President of the "Psi-Clones" and for the "Mile High
Magician's Society): " The attendees commented most favorably on your
lecture and would certainly recommend it to anyone who wants to host
your lecture." 






"As to the Mentalism Workshop, the Psi-Clone members who attended
immensely benefited from it. The Workshop was truly a working session
for those who are serious about Mentalism. In summary, both your
Lecture and Workshop is a tribute to your professionalism, creativity,
and ability to teach. There is no doubt you are a star in the world of
Mentalism."

WILL POWER Details










           


WILL POWER - The Effect in Detail






EFFECT: “I’ve often wondered if the future is something
that only can be sensed, or if, perhaps the future can somehow be
influenced by the Will. A few months ago, I stumbled upon an experiment
that has shaped my opinion on that very concept.”



You continue by explaining that coins were selected as the
“equipment” in the experiment, since they are easily
available, consistent from one to the next, and have a 50% – 50%
chance of being either “HEADS” or “TAILS.” You
proceed to describe the four ways a selection can be
made…”I realized that a coin can be either flipped, spun,
shaken, or deliberately turned over .”



PART 1: A wide shallow bowl (which may be opaque or clear) and a dinner
plate with a bunch of pocket change on it are introduced. The coins are
dumped out onto the table as you say, “When the idea first struck
me that it might actually be possible to affect the future, I decided
that a spinning coin would likely be one of the easiest things to
affect by the mind alone. At first I had some successes, but very minor
and, at best, statistical in nature. Then one day, I discovered the
following procedure, which I’m finding increasingly interesting
the more I try it.” 



As you slide two Nickels mid table, you continue, “I’d
place two coins in front of me, just like this… one coin
‘HEADS’ up, the other coin ‘TAILS’ up.” 



“Then I’d let my mind settle on one of them. (For example,
“HEADS”.) While keeping that image in my mind as best I
could, I’d take the other coin and give it a good spin inside of
a bowl… just like this.”



(The Nickel is held vertically with the first finger of one hand then flicked with the finger of the other hand.)



“If I felt the image fading at all, I’d look at the actual
coin on the table to help reinforce the visualization. I’ve found
that employing a firm and focused visualization to be a powerful aid in
helping to achieve the consistent results I’ve been able to
achieve in this experiment.”


When the coin comes to rest, it is seen to be “HEADS” up as
well. You remove the coin from the bowl and place it back as it
originally was, next to the “chosen” nickel. 



You explain that, “After much experimentation, I’ve found
that Nickels seem to work best for this, as they seem to be the most
balanced of all the various coins.”



The procedure is repeated, only this time with the other coin.



You then repeat the same procedure for a third time (with either coin),
only this time, you place the plate on top of the bowl while the coin
is spinning, so as to “eliminate any physical influence that you might be unwittingly exerting.” 



(Not only does this make sense as a way of “isolating” the
coin, but the drama garnered by hearing the coin spinning and then
slowly falling over is a highlight of this routine.)



When you hear the coin come to rest, the plate is removed, and again the coins match.



“So far, a coincidence at best, but still quite interesting...”



Now you ask an audience member to give it a go. Both Nickels are slid
back mid table. She is asked to let her mind settle on either the
“HEADS” up, or the “TAILS” up Nickel, and then
tell you her choice.



You ask her to concentrate on her choice, as you pick up the non-chosen Nickel, and give it a good spin in the bowl, as before. 



When the plate is removed, the coins are seen to match again.



After this is repeated once more, you state some people might think
that, “somehow I’m affecting the outcome in how I spin the
coin, since I’m are aware of her selection”, so you turn
your head, ask her to think of one of them, and then cover it with her
hand.



She is then to drop the other coin on your outstretched palm, while
your head is turned, so you can’t know if it was the
“HEADS” up or the “TAILS” up coin.



She is to concentrate on her “selection” without letting
anyone else see what it is, as you spin the coin she handed you in the
bowl. Only after you spin the coin is she to say if her selection was
“HEADS” or “TAILS.” 



Once more, when the plate is removed, the coins are seen to match.



Now she is to try it all on her own, without any help from you. This
time she is to be the only one who is to know what her choice is. She
is to remain silent until the Nickel that you spin in the bowl comes to
rest. 



You turn your head, ask her to think of one of them, and then cover it
with her hand. As before, she is to then drop the other coin on your
outstretched palm, while your head is turned, so you can’t know
if it was the “HEADS” up or “TAILS” up coin.



When the plate is removed, the coins are seen to match yet again.



Now that it’s becoming clear that something extraordinary is
happening you state, “perhaps someone here might be thinking that
somehow 


psychology may be affecting her choice of either ‘HEADS’ or ’TAILS’.” 



To totally disprove this idea, you ask the person to remove the coin
from the bowl and flip it into the air, apparently removing any
possible influence over the choice of either “HEADS” or
“TAILS”. 



(This is the “classic” thumb flip into the air, catching
the coin with the same hand that flipped it, which then places the coin
on the back of the other hand without looking, as in a sporting event.)



She is asked to reveal if the coin is “HEADS” or
“TAILS”. (For example, it’s “HEADS” up.)



You smile and say, “that’s what I hoped would
happen”, as you give the Nickel in front of you a spin in the
bowl. 



You quickly grab another Nickel from the pile of change, which you flip
into the air and catch with the same hand that flipped it. But instead
of placing it on to the back of your other hand, you slam your hand
palm down on the table, keeping the flipped Nickel concealed underneath
it, as the spinning coin comes to rest.



When the Nickel in the bowl falls over, it is seen to also be “HEADS” up.



You dramatically lift your hand from over the third Nickel, and it too is seen to have landed “HEADS” up!



PART 2: “Since we’ve just utilized the ‘spin’
and the ‘flip’, let’s try the ‘deliberate
selection’ technique, and we’ll see if we can somehow
influence the outcomes again.”



You slide a Penny, Nickel, Dime, and Quarter over to your participant.



You ask her to carefully follow the instructions you are about to give
her. She is instructed to turn one, and only one, coin over each time
you tell her to do so. She may change which coin she turns over each
time, or she may turn over the same coin repeatedly in any combination
she wishes. In other words, she has a completely free choice over which
coin she turns over and in what order the coins are chosen. You will
have her do this a number of times, so that the coins will end up in an
apparently random pattern of “HEADS” and
“TAILS”.



You then turn away, so that you can’t see what coins she is
turning over. You are seen to be “keeping track” of how
you’re trying to influence her choices using your own set of four
“invisible” coins, which you mime turning over one at a
time on the palm of your hand each time you instruct her to turn one of
her real coins over. 



Obviously no one could know which coins, or even how many there are
that are either “HEADS” up or “TAILS” up. She
is then to randomly cover any one of the coins with her hand,
concealing it from view.



You turn back around and, after “comparing the state of your
invisible coins” to the ones of hers that are still visible, you
state that if all went as you willed it to, the coin under her hand is
(for example) “TAILS” up… and it is! (You repeat
this sequence several times. Each time you vary the amount of coins she
is to turn over, yet you still correctly identify whether her concealed
coin is “HEADS” up or “TAILS” up.)



PART 3: “O.K., by now I hope I’m ‘warmed up’
enough for the most difficult process to affect of
all…’random shaking’.” 



She is asked to gather up her four coins, as you demonstrate using a
few of the remaining coins, how she is to hold and then shake the coins
between her cupped hands. At your request, she is to let the coins drop
on to the table, causing some to land “HEADS” up and some
to land “TAILS” up, in what would seem to be a totally random manner.



Once the procedure is understood, an envelope is shown and placed down in full view.



“In this envelope are a couple of seemingly random outcomes that I’m going to attempt to influence.”



You then ask her, “Which would you rather start with
‘HEADS’ or ‘TAILS’?” (For example, she
answers “TAILS”.)



You say, “O.K., we’ll work with ‘TAILS’ first and use ‘HEADS’ next time.” 



She is to pick up and shake her four coins then, when you say
“now”, drop them to the table, as previously instructed.
Since she selected “TAILS”, you instruct her to keep any
coins that land “TAILS” up, and push any coins that landed
“HEADS” up off to the side. She is then to pick up only the
coins that fell “TAILS” up and do the “shake and
drop” as before, again eliminating any coins that landed
“HEADS” up. This “shake and drop” procedure is
repeated until only one coin remains “TAILS” up.



Let’s say that her remaining coin was a Quarter. You request all
present to remember the last “TAILS” up coin was a Quarter.



You seem satisfied with the outcome, so as you say, “let’s
make it a bit harder this time”, you push a bunch more coins over
to her, with which she is to repeat the previous procedure. But this
time she is to keep any coins that land “HEADS” up, and
eliminate any coins that land “TAILS” up. As before, this
is repeated until only one coin remains.



The last remaining “HEADS” up coin is seen to be a Nickel.



You open the envelope and hand her the contents to read out loud. It
reads, “The last ‘TAILS’ up coin will be a Quarter
and the last ‘HEADS’ up coin will be a Nickel.”

SEPARATION ANXIETY - $25

Over the years I have worked on and
developed many versions of the classic effect, OUT OF THIS WORLD. In fact, the
first effect I ever released was called COUPLES — a version of OOTW that, at
the time, Paul Curry stated was the best variation of his original that he had
seen, and offered to market it for me! It was a most encouraging start to what
has become a most interesting field of endeavor.

Now, these many years later, I’ve finally
developed an extremely straightforward, hands-off, two-phase routine that
utilizes deeply layered methods, befitting this classic effect of Mentalism. Watching
the impact it has on both laymen and Magicians/Mentalists alike has convinced
me it’s one of the most powerfully direct and clean presentations available. 
Via an ebooklet, with embedded videos,  you can also learn this most amazing
of effects that slayed them when premiered at the prestigious MEETING OF THE
MINDS and has fooled some of the best minds in the business.  

Here are a few unedited quotes:
Barrie Richardson:  Elegant. The trick of the year.

Doug Dyment: With Separation Anxiety, Bruce has taken a well-loved 
plot ('OOTW'), added a dollop of ideas from others, and then worked his 
well-known magic, streamlining the action, removing the dead time and false 
actions, clarifying the display, simplifying the mechanics, and topping the 
whole thing with a killer ending. A tiny, elegant masterpiece, and one of the 
few "card tricks" I perform.

Christopher Carter: When I
first saw Bruce Bernstein perform Separation Anxiety, I knew I had to learn
it.  It was the cleanest, most direct
handling of Out of This World I had seen. 
I didn’t see how it could be improved upon.  Then Bruce showed me the second phase, and it
was even more incredible than the first.”

Few creators understand
what mentalism should really look like in performance better than Bruce.   The first phase of Separation Anxiety is as
perfect as any mental card effect could be. 
Gone is the unusual procedure of most versions of Paul Curry’s classic
effect.   A spectator psychically
separates a small back of cards into reds and blacks.  That’s it! 
It’s that direct.  But Bruce
doesn’t stop there.  As soon as the
spectator has picked her jaw up from the floor, he has her do it again, but
this time with a twist so diabolical it just has to be seen to be believed.
I never thought I
needed  another card effect in my
repertoire until I saw Separation Anxiety. Now I know better. It’s definitely going into
my repertoire.
Matthew Field -THE MAGIC CIRCULAR: Paul
Curry’s “Out of This World” is, perhaps, the most
popular card trick ever.  A problem with it is, however, that it
is a tough sell to make it seem “psychic”.  Chicago
mentalist and magician Bruce Bernstein spent years trying to come with
a method which fit his persona, and “Separation Anxiety” is
it.

The spectator is handed a packet of 20 cards and told to deal them into
two fairly equal piles, but not haphazardly or simply alternating
piles; she is to “follow her intuition”.  The wizard
counts one of the piles and congratulates the spectator when the total
is seen to be 10 ‒ precisely half. The top card of one pile is turned
over ‒ it is red.  The top card of the other pile is black. 
Several more cards are turned over in pairs ‒ again, red in one pile,
black in the other. The remainders of both piles are turned over,
showing a perfect separation.

As a follow-up, the wonder worker removes an Ace of Spades from his
pocket and states that he will make the spectator treat this card as
red, as he openly inserts it into the packet of cards and mixes
them.  Again, the cards are dealt into two piles. One pile is
shown to consist entirely of black cards, the other of all red cards ‒
except for the Ace of Spades, seen in the centre of the
“red” pile.

As one would expect from Bruce Bernstein, this is devilishly
clever.  $25 might seem a bit expensive for a 16-page pdf, but the
price is for the years of thinking that went into the method, and the
fact that the working mentalist will get a lot of mileage out of
this.  Three brief videos are included illustrating a few of the
fine points.

Bob Farmer: Bruce
Bernstein, who has an honored place in my book, as one of the premier
Sultans of Swindle, was selling a new trick, "Separation Anxiety,"
which sounded--like a lot of Bruce's stuff--completely impossible. So I
figured--like a lot of Bruce's stuff--the method would be in the upper
echelons of deviousness--and I just had to know how it worked because
here's the effect:


You hand a spectator a small packet of ungaffed, face-down cards. You
tell her to follow her intuition and deal the packet into two piles on
the table--but she is to deal the cards completely at random (i.e., not
back and forth in a regular manner, but helter skelter).








She does so. When the two piles are checked:








1. There are exactly ten cards in each pile.








2. She has somehow divided the ten red cards from the ten black cards.








This is about as clean and fast an "Out of this World" effect as you
can get. Bruce also provides a second phase, different from the first,
which in effect is different enough to be interesting, and in method
relies on something the audience has understood from the first phase.








It's 16 pages of unmitigated sneakiness and I highly recommend it to one and all. 
Ross Johnson: Bruce Bernstein is in creative mode and has
traveled to a new solar system. On the heels of the ground breaking
"TABOO" comes a refined take on the always intriguing "Out of
this World". Only the mind of Bernstein can both simplify method and
expand impact at the same time. This is a routine not to be overlooked by any
worker who presents miracles of only the highest quality.

Alain Nu: Bruce Bernstein has been one of the most
clever creators in the field of psychic entertainment and a true inspiration
for many other artists such as myself. Bruce is like a scientist, whose clever
mind continues to search for the answers to the even greater mysteries behind
the already great mysteries which we cherish. In Bernstein's "Separation
Anxiety," you will find about the cleanest answer to Paul Curry's
"Out of This World" to date. Recently, while in Chicago, he showed it to me and it left me
speechless. It happens a LOT faster than you would expect! Now is your chance
to learn this quickly... either before he changes his mind, or I make him
change his mind!


Jheff’s Marketplace of the
Mind:
 This is a lean, direct, powerful,
and easy-to-do version of the classic Paul Curry effect.  And,
besides, if you've read his landmark book,  UNREAL, you know that
anything with Bruce Bernstein's name on it is,
sight  unseen, well-worth getting!
 Of course, the plot, which
you probably know already, involves the  participant amazingly separating red and
black cards.  This version, 
which only uses twenty cards, is based on ideas from Brad
Henderson and Jon  Armstrong, who, in turn, based their work on
ideas from Martin Gardner and  Paul Curry (though not all of
Gardner's and Curry's ideas are  in SEPARATION ANXIETY).  It starts and ends clean and most definitely  can be done with a borrowed deck of cards and
in impromptu situations.   In fact, it's probably best for that.
 Using twenty cards
certainly solves the controversial issue of the  effect being too long.  The entire stack is handed to the participant to  separate which makes this a very nice hands-off
presentation.  And the  clean-up is much cleaner and far less awkward than
the usual manner in which  it is done. For those familiar
with Jon Armstrong's "Out of This Blah Blah  Blah," know that this was certainly
Bernstein's










inspiration and
starting  point, but he has added some touches that take this
effect into an entirely  new and different level.
 I'll also note that
Bernstein includes a second variation which allows  for the effect to be repeated.  It is rather amazing as it features
a  powerful prediction that's quite a shocker to the layman.
 This is being sold as a 16
page downloadable PDF with some embedded  videos. I know that this should be obvious
but I'll say it anyway: this is  highly recommended.

UNREAL - $65.00

The manipulation of thought, memory and perception in psychic entertainment 

At
last, a three year effort at collecting, reorganizing, and
rewriting
all of my previously published works, (whether well known or highly
obscure),
has finally been completed. Whenever appropriate, the material has been
rewritten to make it even more accessible and clear to the reader. I've
added tips, touches, and updates to many of the effects, as well as
including ten new essays, specially created for this book. All of the
material has also
been reorganized by the type of effect being presented. 


Now,
gathered in 256 pages, bound in deluxe hardcover; all of my materials
published before 2012 have been newly edited and expanded, as well as being expertly illustrated
by Tony Dunn.


UNREAL
contains it all - from what I, and many others, believe is the most
commercial effect ever created, Eat at Joe's, to card miracles such
as Psych-Out, a revelatory improvement to the
10 Card Poker Deal concept, to must-learn techniques as
my Bernstein Center
Tear, and beyond. UNREAL covers territory essential to every wonder
worker's repertoire.





























































The book outlines mysteries with the most basic of objects: slips of
paper, cards, and money, as well as inexplicable feats of thought
reading: predictions, mind reading feats, psychometry, utility
techniques for obtaining secret information, cold reading scripts and
techniques, and more.

Barrie Richardson - "This is the most stimulating book on Mentalism or Magic I've read in years." 

Jeff McBride - "I've
just gone on tour and had 3 bliss filled days with your book
 UNREAL.  I love so many of the ideas too, and have already
started to work on a few!"

Jheff's Marketplace of the Mind -  "These
are the facts: Bruce Bernstein is one of the most creative thinkers in
mentalism. This book is a collection of most of his material. Also,
quite a bit of his material I have used, still use, or plan on using at
some point in the future. Most everything in this book is classic stuff
that professional mentalists the world over have been using for years,
such as "Eat at Joe's."




























"Really, besides what's already written in the blurb, is there anything
else that needs to be said? Oh, yeah, the book is gorgeous (real linen
hardcover; 7.5" x 10"; 242 pages). For those wondering what kind of
mentalism effects that Bernstein specializes in, I think I can safely
say that




























              if you like the work of Barrie Richardson, then you'll like this."




























"One more thing: I don't often say that something is a must-have, but
if anything released this year deserves that label, this is it."



David Britland - "Unreal 
contains nine chapters in all, the remainder covering routines with money, 
psychometry, 13 variations of a routine involving time travel, and a chapter on 
techniques that also details Bruce’s Centre Tear. Interspersed between the 
chapters are essays on various aspects of mentalism from presentation and 
exposure to getting caught and the basic skills that every mentalist should 
have. Bruce Bernstein is a clever fellow and it’s a pleasure to read the 
additions and twists he gives to many standard plots. The routines are very 
practical, inherently crafty, and incorporate the kind of psychological touches 
that are increasingly part of contemporary mentalism. The tricks have weathered 
the years well, possibly because Bruce was ahead of his time when he devised 
them. Taken together, the variety of 
presentations, methods, techniques, and good advice not only make the book a 
valuable source of ideas for the experienced performer but also a great first 
book for anyone who wants to try their hand at 
mentalism."
































TABOO - $100.00


TABOO
is the first offering in a series of restricted releases aimed at the
"inner-school" of Psychic Entertainers. These manuscripts will only be
available directly through me and will not be wholesaled to dealers. My
plan is to release materials over time that I've been holding back, or
that have been created recently that meet only the highest standards of
which I am capable.












































I'm proud to start these offerings with the release of TABOO, since I
feel it represents some of my finest thinking and blazes new ground in
Psychic Entertainment. The concepts explained in this book
will show you ways to reveal audience members' deepest, darkest
secrets, in an amazingly entertaining
manner.
Here's what I
wrote in the introduction - "TABOO is a unique melding of concepts
I’ve been working on for nearly a decade and is perhaps the most
advanced routine of Psychic Entertainment I’ve ever created.









It would be wrong to just call TABOO an effect, it’s so
much more than that. Let me also state as clearly as I can, that TABOO
is only suitable for the boldest and most charismatic of performers. This is
not something to be done casually for some friends or as a
demonstration of mental magic.









But that said, even if you never perform the effect, I believe
that you’ll find there is much to be gleaned from my thinking
about this presentation from the “cutting edge.”Another
point I should make clear at the start is that TABOO must be
personalized and custom tailored to the particular performer who is
brave and talented enough to tackle this presentation. To expect a
“one size fits all” script or approach is only asking for
failure. But with the techniques and variations I’ll be sharing
in the book, the right performer will have found his or her
miracle." 
Although,
I describe several variations on the theme in the book, including "THE
ULTIMATE TABOO, which I created for my own personal use,
here's the basic plot:














































Several
spectators are asked to join you onstage and are requested to think of
things they have done, or might do, that would be considered "Taboo" by
most people.














































You then start to read their thoughts all at the
same time, revealing facts and information in a way worthy of a soap
opera or reality show.














































Even though they are asked to keep a
"poker face" and not give you any hints about their secret
Taboo, you are able to "zero in" more and more on each of their
secret thoughts, until it
starts to become clear you're starting to figure out just which Taboo
each of them are thinking of.














































Then, in the most incredible of
climaxes, each of them individually acknowledges time and time again, 
just how how accurate you've been in discovering their most personal
of information.














































O.K. - Although that sounds incredible, I know
what you're thinking. 
Even if that were possible (which it is!), I'm
sure you're thinking that this routine could easily cause embarrassment
or discomfort to those participating. But, perhaps the most amazing
part of the routine are the many psychological subtleties and powerful gambits
I teach that will actually put them at ease and show them how to thoroughly
enjoy their roles as the "Stars" of the presentation.


Michael Weber - "I
believe two things about Taboo to be true: 1) Bruce has crafted a
routine which is both practical and powerful, and 2) 99.9% of the
mentalists I have seen don't have the balls to present it the way it
deserves to be performed."
Christopher Carter
- "Bruce Bernstein is a genius. This fact is accepted by everybody who
knows his work. Where others put out minor variations of popular and
frequently over used themes, Bruce’s published effects
consistently range from innovative to groundbreaking. It’s not
that he doesn’t draw inspiration from prior creators. All
creators do that. What makes Bruce’s work stand out are two
things. First, he sees the potential in ideas that the rest of us
breeze over without noticing. Second, he combines these ideas in such a
way that the result is vastly greater than the sum of the parts."



























"Taboo is a perfect product of Bruce’s devious mind. Within the
method, there are elements that we all will recognize but they are
applied, in combination, to a devastating effect."



























"And what is that effect? It’s practically the holy grail of
mentalism. When people find out that you’re a mind reader, they
worry that you’ll be able to divine their deepest, most intimate
secrets. Thanks to Taboo, you do exactly that. Amazingly, Bruce stages
things so that you reveal their secrets in such a way that they will
never be publicly embarrassed, and yet there is no doubt that you have
received impressions you really should not be able to know."



























"When Bruce first shared his idea with me a few years ago, I was
delighted with its boldness and simplicity, and I hoped to one day be
able to do it. Since that time he has refined the routine and added
subtleties that make it even stronger. It ranks, in my opinion, among
his best work."



























"I have one caveat about Taboo. The characteristic that makes
Bruce’s work stand out is that he understands the difference
between mentalism and magic. His best effects rely on subtle methods
that require a bold and confident performance to pull off. No sleights
are required, but you must be able to bluff with impunity. Because of
this, brilliance of Taboo will probably go unrecognized by the
beginning mentalist or mental magician. That’s bad news for Bruce
in terms of product sales, but great news for the rest of us. Those who
study and perform this will have a miracle that I predict very few
others will be doing." 

Jon Stetson - "Taboo is Too Good.  It's Bruce's greatest creation to date! 
At $100.00, this masterpiece is way underpriced. For me, it is worth 
thousands - I wish I could keep this one for myself. Thank goodness 
Bruce uses his power for good!"
"PS. For anyone wondering the difference between Mentalism and Mental Magic, buy 
Taboo and find out."

TABOO - Cover Art





WILL
POWER - $50

I sincerely
believe it to be original, dramatic and as close to an
actual demonstration of how material objects can be
physically controlled by the
power of the mind as may ever be developed. You receive a 12 page
booklet that breaks the routine down in detail along with those other
special "things" you'll need.

 

Banachek: "Every
mentalist or magician is looking for that Holy Grail
of effects. You know the one, the one that looks impromptu, the one
that can be performed anywhere anytime, close up, cabaret or stage, the
one that can be whipped out for a newspaper story and become the center
piece for the reporter to hang his words of astonishment upon."
 
"With Bruce
Bernstein's contribution of WILL POWER, that Grail
has been created for us.  Bruce
has fabricated a brilliant routine with props that fit in your change
pocket. It really is that tiny but the impact and reactions are
incredibly huge.  The
effect is non assuming yet grows with each stage of the routine. The
impossibilities stack up one on top of the other to create a
well-choreographed piece of theater that does not feel like theater, it
feels genuine.  This
is not mental magic, it can not even be described as mentalism as that
would not do it justice, it
appears to be a real feat of psychic power. 
But hey, what would you expect from the mind of Bruce
Bernstein, nothing less.  I
will carry this with me."

 Ken
Weber: "I
was asked which effect was the hit of the Psychic Entertainer's
Association's annual convention, the 'Meeting Of The Minds.' 
While I loved many routines, Bruce's WILL POWER stole the show. It is a
novel plot, it builds and builds in its impossibility, and it was
presented brilliantly. For me, in terms of seeing something new and
wonderful, THIS was the winner."

"Let me add that if you
simply read the description supplied on Bruce's website you will
understandably assume that this is strictly a close-up effect. It's
not. I watched Bruce perform the routine from many rows back and I can
tell you that although I could not see anything happening in terms of
the coins, the sounds of the coins spinning on the plates, as carried
over the sound system, lent this routine a dense layer of drama that
added immensely to its effectiveness. In other words, this can be
strong as a stage effect! And yes, it will be wonderful close-up as
well." 

Larry Becker: "I've
thoroughly enjoyed using Bruce Bernstein's "WILL POWER" since I
acquired it from Bruce. It's a spell binding close-up effect that plays
larger than life thanks to the intriguing musicality of the
spinning coins and Bruce's entertaining routine."


Ross Johnson:
"With WILL POWER, Bruce Bernstein has produced a complete
routine that
is practical and actually do-able as it stands. Not since Ned
Rutledge's "Minding the Store" has a performance piece been so
thoroughly explained and analyzed for maximum impact. Every nuance is
covered. It's impact is long lasting. Will Power has become one of
three Bruce Bernstein products that I will not leave home without."

PSI-DECK


My take on the famous “Tossed Out Deck”, but so
diabolically clever, it will fool anyone familiar with the original.

 



Max Maven: "If Machiavelli had wanted to do card mentalism,
he might
have come up with something like Bruce Bernstein's PSI-DECK -- but he
probably wouldn't have had the patience to make the gaffs."  


Larry Becker: "Unreservedly recommended. Outstanding...a
beautiful product."  

 

Craig Karges: "With a combination of principles and an
ingeniously
constructed deck, Bruce has put together a wonderful routine with
PSI-DECK. It is inexplicable and what mentalism with cards should look
like - simple, direct, and baffling." 

 

Ford Kross: "Regular readers of mine, are aware of my
antipathy to card
tricks. So, if I rave about one, I must really be impressed.
Such
is the case with Bruce Bernstein's PSI-DECK." 

 

"Dave Hoy's Tossed-Out deck is already a classic, but imagine this
improvement. A deck of cards is fanned and shown to appear normal.
Three participants are freely selected. As in Hoy's classic, a
rubberbanded deck of cards is given to #1, he looks at one card. The
same deck is given to #2, same procedure. You are able to name the
cards looked at and even tell who has which, unlike Hoy's effect, they
have different cards. With the third participant, you remove an
envelope and place it in sight, the slowly dealing from the same deck
on to the table, you ask them to tell you when to stop. After the
chosen card is shown, they open the envelope and reveal that you've
correctly predicted it." 

"As you might think, this is not an ordinary deck. Bruce has produced a
beautiful gimmicked deck that is extremely versatile." 

 

Richard Busch (author of Peek Performances): "PSI-DECK is
beyond my
inadequate words altogether. After two participants each hold the cards
themselves (!) and each peek a card, a card is CLEANLY dealt that
matches a premonition that was in plain view beforehand. You can
instantly name both peeked cards and hit on the premonition. No
switching, no switching predictions, no switching anything, I mean
nothing. If this isn't stunning and direct, then I don't know what is. Considering the incredible,
unbelievable, time consuming workmanship
involved in this creation, Bruce's decks are well worth the investment.
More!" 



PSI-DECK is available in 2 different versions, so you may repeat the
effect for the same audience without the same selections being made.

ALTERED - $40

My version of what is perhaps the
greatest force deck of all times - the Monte Cristo Deck.  I
produced a small run of these at the same time PSI-DECKS were made. I
have never advertised or wholesaled these decks and will not be making
more when the stock is gone.They have the same Mermaid backs (only
available in blue) and are made from the same high quality casino card
stock. In addition to the deck itself, additional gimmicked cards are
supplied that will allow you to perform some powerful routines not
possible with the force deck alone. (Since it forces the 2 of Clubs, it is the perfect deck to use in my Bernstein's Bet routine, described in my book, UNREAL.)

BERNSTEIN
LINKING PINS ROUTINE - $25 


An incredible four phase routine that you will use!


Includes the two, three inch safety pins, a DVD with the routine and
full explanation, and a 17" x 22" poster (no
page turning with props in hand) with seventeen line drawings to make
learning easy! 

All
Pins purchased directly from me are personally double checked and
tested before shipping.





Barrie Richardson:
Bruce Bernstein's Linking Pin Routine is one of the most astonishing
and entertaining effects on this planet - period!

 

Hank Moorehouse: From A to Z - the best linking pin routine
I've ever seen.


 Bruce Barnett: "I liked Bruce's Linking Pin
Routine. This is a
routine where large safety pins link and unlink in slow motion. There
is a finale, and at the end - the pins are passed out for examination.
(no switch!) Even when I knew the principle, he fooled me with it." 


Phil Wilmarth (Linking Ring): "Here is a superb four part
routine...
The final phase is a wonderful visual unlinking of a spectator's finger
ring from a pin as a separate pin immediately links to the very same
pin the ring just left. Bruce also explains how to pass the pins out
for examination, upon completion of the routine, without switches. It's
a fooler of a routine, yet is not that difficult to do..."

He’s become a trusted, go-to source for many of the greatest mind readers of the last twenty years. He’s collected an enviable list of endorsements from nearly every great magician and thought reader of the last thirty years. And now he’s gathered together years of thought-provoking, engaging writing into a comprehensive hardbound collection that showcases his work in the finest possible light. It’s called Unreal.This new book contains Bernstein’s most baffling, amazing brainchildren. From commercial predictions (Eat at Joe’s), to mind-numbing card miracles (Psych-Out, a revelatory 10 Card Poker Deal), to must-learn techniques (Bernstein Center Tear), and beyond, Unreal covers territory essential to every wonder worker’s repertoire.The book outlines mysteries with the most basic of objects: slips of paper, cards, and money, as well as inexplicable feats of thought reading: predictions, mind reading feats, psychometry, utility techniques for obtaining secret information, cold reading scripts and techniques, and more.Ten new essays compliment the tricks themselves, each written specifically for this book. All of the miracles described in these pages are within the skill set of the average mentalist. No complicated sleight-of-hand or digital dexterity is required. That said, a healthy dose of chutzpah may be necessary in several instances.It’s all explained in a familiar, engaging style, expertly illustrated by Tony Dunn.

                           "First American Art: The Charles and Valerie Diker Collection of American Indian Art accompanies a major exhibition of more
                              than 200 Native American objects from the private collection of Charles and Valerie Diker. Like the exhibition, this illustrated
                              volume is organized around seven principles of an indigenous aesthetic - idea, emotion, intimacy, movement, integrity, vocabulary,
                              and composition - that are embodied in Native objects." "First American Art: The Charles and Valerie Diker Collection of American
                              Indian Art is the product of a collaboration among Native and non-Native curators, scholars, and artists who share a deep
                              commitment to articulating and heightening an understanding of American Indian aesthetics and to fostering an awareness of
                              the exceptional beauty of Native art. With this book and exhibition, they introduce a new paradigm for the publication and
                              display of Native American art - one in which its objects are appreciated as true works of art as well as significant cultural
                              artifacts."--Jacket

                           Each August, one hundred thousand people attend Indian Market in Santa Fe, New Mexico, the nation's largest and most anticipated
                              Native arts event. One thousand artists, representing 160 tribes, nations, and villages from the United States and Canada,
                              proudly display and sell their works of art, ranging from pottery and basketry to contemporary paintings and sculptures. The
                              history of Indian Market as related in this book is the story of Indian cultural arts in the twentieth century beginning with
                              Edgar L. Hewett and the founding of the Museum of New Mexico in Santa Fe in 1909. At the turn of the last century, the notion
                              of Indian art as art in its own right and not ethnography was a foreign concept. With the arrival of the railroad and tourism
                              in New Mexico, two thousand years of utilitarian Pueblo pottery tradition gave way to a curio trade intended for visitors
                              to the area. The curators and archaeologists at the Museum of New Mexico began to collect prehistoric and historic pottery
                              and encouraged potters to make pottery modeled on traditional ideas thought to represent authentic culture. Maria and Julian
                              Martinez countered the idea that art was a matter of studying the past when in 1922, at the first "Indian Fair", they introduced
                              their revolutionary Black-on-black pottery. The author links these early developments to Indian Market's ninety-year relationship
                              with Native arts, cultural movements, historical events, and the ever-evolving creativity of Native artists to shape their
                              market

This book should be standard reading for mentalists.  Bruce gives so much away, and so much of it can be used as parts of other routines.

His Georgia Magnet-type routine is gold as a quick example of mind control, leading into another routine.

Bruce has come up with things that work, not just ideas "not fully tested" in the real world.

This is a great book, and the $15.00 price tag is way too low.

Description



 
Honed to perfection over nearly three decades, the Bernstein Linking Pin Routine is as sharp and mystifying an effect as you will ever see. The magician links two large safety pins together, fairly and plainly. On his command, the pins visibly and slowly melt apart. The unlinking of the pins actually looks like trick photography. The effect is repeated – the pins unlink again – and the illusion looks just as baffling as it did the first time. The pins are then caused to magically link together in a seemingly impossible manner. One moment the two are separate, and the next, they are linked. Finally, an ungimmicked finger ring is legitimately locked onto one of the pins. Despite the fairness of the proceedings, the ring melts off of the pin it was locked on. At the same moment the two pins link together, in full view, inches from the spectators.At the conclusion of the routine, everything can be examined. There’s nothing to find!The Bernstein Linking Pin Routine requires no specially manufactured gaffs and no complicated sleight-of-hand. Nothing is switched in or out. All that’s required are the two pins and a finger ring. There are no external gimmicks. It’s ready any time. Included inside are all necessary props and media: two, specially selected and hand-adjusted three-inch safety pins, a broadcast-quality instructional DVD featuring Bernstein’s performance and explanation, and a 17″x22″ poster (no page turning required!) with clear line drawings to make learning easy.Words from those who know…..Hank Moorehouse: “From A to Z – the best linking pin routine I’ve ever seen.”Phil Wilmarth: “Here is a superb four-part routine… The final phase is a wonderful visual unlinking of a spectator’s finger ring from a pin as a separate pin immediately links to the very same pin the ring just left. Bruce also explains how to pass the pins out for examination, upon completion of the routine, without switches. It’s a fooler of a routine, yet is no that difficult to do.”Barrie Richardson: “Bruce Bernstein’s Linking Pin Routine is one of the most astonishing and entertaining effects on this planet – period!”
