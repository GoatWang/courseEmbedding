Important Information about Revenue Sharing Arrangements
U.S. Bancorp Investments (“USBI”) routinely receives compensation for the sale of financial products, including mutual funds, unit investment trusts (UITs), variable and fixed annuities, and variable and fixed life insurance.  The compensation provided to USBI depends upon the product.  In addition to sales loads, 12b-1 fees, networking and processing fees, USBI receives mutual fund support fees, which are sometimes referred to as “revenue sharing” payments, from the advisers or distributors of mutual funds that have access to USBI‘s investment professionals, as described below.  Similarly, in addition to the commissions paid to USBI in connection with the sales of annuities and life insurance, USBI receives support fees from certain insurance companies or distributors.  Again, these insurance companies and distributors (if applicable) have access to USBI‘s investment professionals, as described below.
Financial Revenue Sharing from Product Partners to USBI
Many financial products are made available in the marketplace.  To assist our clients in choosing the product that is right for them, USBI utilizes a formal due diligence process to evaluate firms who offer a broad array of financial products, selecting only those matching our required criteria.  Following this due diligence process, our investment professionals make recommendations from among this wide range of approved products based upon the specific investment objectives, risk tolerances, and time horizons of their clients and subject to broker-dealer suitability requirements.
USBI has entered into agreements through which certain firms (our “Product Partners”) provide financial contributions to USBI which are used to support the marketing of their products, training of our investment professionals, and for other purposes.  Product Partners may also reimburse USBI for expenses incurred during training and educational conferences and seminars, and for providing client accounting and administrative services for USBI‘s client accounts holding the products of the Product Partner.  In addition, USBI employees, including investment professionals, may receive promotional items, meals or entertainment, or other non-cash compensation from the Product Partners. 
In exchange for sharing revenue, these Product Partners are provided enhanced access to USBI‘s distribution network and greater opportunities to participate in marketing and training functions.  Investment professionals do not, however, receive any portion of, or any additional cash compensation as a result of these revenue and cost sharing arrangements.  It is important to note that not all product providers approved by USBI make financial contributions to USBI. 
All of the above-referenced financial contributions are in addition to any sales charges or commissions that may be disclosed in the fee tables found in the prospectuses and statements of additional information for the mutual fund or in your annuity or insurance contract.  
Mutual Funds - Revenue Sharing Payments
Financial contributions from USBI Mutual Fund Product Partners may include revenue-sharing arrangements.  The revenue sharing payments made to USBI by a Mutual Fund Product Partner may consist of: (1) an annual, lump-sum payment; (2) a percentage of the total amount of mutual fund sales made by USBI for that fund family ("mutual fund sales-based fee"); and/or (3) a percentage of the total net assets of the mutual fund shares of that fund family held by USBI customers ("mutual fund asset-based fee").
The amount and type of revenue sharing payments received from a Mutual Fund Product Partner may vary and is subject to negotiation.  Revenue sharing payments are generally in the following amounts: 


Mutual Fund Sales-Based Fee
Up to 0.25% (paid quarterly) on sales of mutual fund shares (e.g., $25 per $10,000 purchase).


Mutual Fund Asset-Based Fee
Up to 0.05% per year (calculated and paid quarterly) of the net assets of all mutual fund shares of a particular Product Partner held through USBI (e.g., $5 per $10,000 in net assets of shares).


Insurance/Annuities - Revenue Sharing Payments
Financial contributions from USBI Insurance or Annuity Product Partners may include revenue-sharing arrangements.  The revenue sharing payments made to USBI by an Insurance or Annuity Product Partner may consist of: (1) an annual, lump-sum payment; (2) a percentage of the total amount of gross insurance or annuity sales made by USBI for the insurance company ("annuity sales-based fee") and/or (3) a percentage of the aggregate value of insurance or annuity assets invested in contracts for which USBI is designated as the broker or agent of record by the insurance company or annuity provider ("annuity asset-based fee").
The amount and type of revenue sharing payments received from an Insurance or Annuity Product Partner may vary and is subject to negotiation.  Revenue sharing payments are generally in the following amounts: 


Insurance or Annuity Sales-Based Fee
Up to 0.21% (paid quarterly) on sales of insurance or annuities (e.g., $21 per $10,000 purchase).


Insurance or Annuity Asset-Based Fee
Up to 0.05% per year (calculated and paid quarterly) of the net assets of all insurance or annuity assets of a particular Product Partner where USBI is the broker or agent of record (e.g., $5 per $10,000 in net assets of shares).


Potential Conflicts of Interest from Financial Revenue Sharing 
A potential conflict of interest exists where USBI is paid more in revenue sharing if you purchase one type of product instead of another.  A potential conflict of interest may also exist if one Product Partner provides more in financial contributions over another.  USBI may offer products that USBI or its affiliates may underwrite, or may otherwise be financially interested in a primary or secondary distribution.  USBI may also offer products which involve entities with a relationship with USBI and/or its affiliates.  USBI may receive compensation or other benefits for selling such products.  
USBI is committed to serving our clients' interests first, so we have adopted policies reasonably designed to control and limit these potential conflicts of interest.  The policies require investment professionals to recommend products and services based only on their appropriateness in meeting your investment goals.  The policies prohibit the payment of any portion of revenue or cost sharing fees directly to investment professionals.  In addition, revenue-sharing payments must be made by the distributor or the product provider by wire transfer or check, and policies prohibit the acceptance of these payments in the form of direct or indirect investment portfolio commissions of the product sponsor.

Why Invest with U.S. Bank







U.S. Bank HomeInvestments and Wealth ManagementInvestment ManagementInvestment ManagementProfessionally managed options can open the investment world to you.OverviewIs It Right for Me?How to Get StartedFAQsToday's investment markets provide more opportunity than ever before, but the seemingly endless array of investment options can overwhelm individuals trying to make informed investment decisions on their own.
Financial professionals at U.S. Bank and U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc. offer a consultative approach to investment management. An advisor works as your partner in helping you understand the options available in today’s wide-ranging investment marketplace. Your advisor builds the investment process around you, your goals and individual circumstances that affect your approach to money management and investing.
By gaining a comprehensive understanding of you as an investor, your advisor is able to create a customized investment strategy that is consistent with your goals. The centerpiece of that plan is a personalized asset allocation strategy. You can choose from a variety of professionally managed investment programs.
Here’s an overview of each phase of the investment management cycle: See more
We start by creating your personal profile. This involves analyzing your financial needs and goals, considering your current situation and investment time frame, as well as your attitudes about investment risk.
Next, we develop your asset allocation strategy. We'll work together to develop an investment strategy, based on your profile, to allocate your assets. A well-diversified portfolio may combine different types of assets to attempt to achieve specific investment goals while potentially reducing overall portfolio risk.
Then we implement your portfolio. To set your plan in motion, we'll screen and recommend a combination of investment products based on how their performance and risk characteristics align with your circumstances and goals. You can choose from a full range of investment options, including:                

Stocks, bonds and mutual funds
Fixed- and variable-rate annuities
Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and Unit Investment Trusts (UITs)
Professionally-managed portfolios

Read about financial contributions from product partners for mutual funds, fixed annuities and variable annuities.

We manage your portfolio on an ongoing basis. Working with you, we'll continuously monitor your portfolio’s performance. Modifications, including rebalancing, can be made to the portfolio based on developments in the market.
We'll review progress regularly. You'll hear from your advisor on a regular basis throughout the year. You’ll also receive regular performance reports and information alerting you to changes in your portfolio and factors that may affect your financial goals and investment strategy.
 Like a good tax advisor or an attorney, a trusted financial professional can help you stay on track – and help simplify your life. Professionally managed investment portfolios take a disciplined approach to investing, but provide the flexibility to choose your level of involvement in the investment decision-making process.
By working with financial professionals at either U.S. Bank or U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc., you may benefit from:

Peace of mind in knowing that your investments are being managed and monitored by an experienced professional;
Investment strategies tailored to your specific goals and circumstances;
Ongoing support and monitoring of your investment progress;
The flexibility to modify your investment strategy as your needs and goals evolve; and
More time for you to spend on other aspects of your life.
To make informed decisions about your financial future, you need to understand your options. Knowledgeable professionals at U.S. Bank and U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc. can help simplify your financial life by creating a customized plan and monitoring its progress for you. What are the strategies for successful investing?It’s important to know who you are as an investor and what you want your portfolio to accomplish. The key steps include:

Identifying specific financial goals. These may include funding a child’s higher education, your own retirement, the purchase of a home, starting a business or other goals that are important to you.
Assessing the amount of time you have to achieve each goal. Setting time frames for each of your goals is key because it can help determine how long your money can keep working for you.
Understanding your own risk tolerance. Some investors are risk takers by nature while others are very conservative, but many fall somewhere in between. Age, personality, investment experience and financial circumstance can all affect your tolerance for risk.
Determining your asset allocation – in other words, the mix of assets you want to own across various classes of investments. Diversification may help reduce your overall risk. Your asset allocation strategy should support your goals while being consistent with your risk tolerance level.
Taking the time to review your overall portfolio performance, keeping your eye on the big picture. If your portfolio begins to drift from your asset allocation strategy, you may consider rebalancing your portfolio to maintain your long-term investment strategy.
Making adjustments to your portfolio if your needs and circumstances change.
Why do I need to diversify my portfolio?A diversified portfolio spreads investment dollars out over a variety of asset classes and/or different securities. The goal of diversification is to help protect the value of your overall portfolio against a decline of price in a single security and/or a market sector. For example, some investors own a mix of stocks and bonds, with the expectation that in times when stock markets decline, bonds will perform better, helping to minimize the volatility of the overall portfolio. The different asset classes may counterbalance one another to help reduce short-term fluctuation in the portfolio. Of course, asset allocation and diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.Why is it important to focus on asset allocation as part of the investment process?Studies show that asset allocation has the single largest impact on your account’s overall performance.  According to 1990 Nobel Prize winner Harry Markowitz’s “Modern Portfolio Theory”, almost 92% of investment returns are the result of how assets are allocated among different classes, while only 2% are due to the specific stocks and bonds you choose to buy within each asset class.  Asset allocation may have a more significant affect on performance returns than industry weighting, stock selection, market timing or any other portfolio management decision.How often should I make adjustments to my asset allocation?Your asset allocation should reflect your current investment objectives, but it is also a long-term commitment. If your objectives and investment timeframe have not changed, you may not want to make adjustments to your asset mix. This is true even if short-term developments in the market are not working to your benefit. But if things have changed, the investment mix that suited you when you began investing may not be appropriate today.  Major changes in your personal life, financial situation and time horizon can all be reasons to reconsider your asset allocation strategy.What does it mean to rebalance a portfolio and why is that important?Your asset allocation strategy is based on specific objectives for investment return consistent with your acceptable level of risk. If over time the performance of certain types of assets held in your portfolio dramatically stray from expected return levels, it’s possible that you may find that you are significantly over-invested or under-invested in specific asset classes. For example, if due to strong performance, a planned 15% weighting of international stocks in your portfolio grows to a 20% weighting, you may suddenly be taking on significantly more risk by owning more international stocks than your original allocation called for. If that occurs, you may consider rebalancing assets in your portfolio to the weighting specified in your original asset allocation strategy.Is there a cost to having my investments professionally managed?Yes. Your advisor will discuss the costs involved before you decide to become a client.What products are available within these managed accounts?Depending on your specific situation, portfolios may include all types of mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), individual stocks, bonds and other securities or other types of investments available on the open market. Part of the process of working with an investment advisor is to determine which products may fit your asset allocation strategy.
