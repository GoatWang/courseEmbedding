Company History















Pope Resources, Olympic Resource Management (ORM), and Olympic Property Group (OPG) benefit from a 150-year heritage of land and resource stewardship in the Pacific Northwest, stemming from our past linkage to Pope & Talbot, Inc.





 
Pope Resources was created in 1985 when Pope & Talbot spun off its timberland and development properties in Washington. Pope Resources’ solid base of land and timber value includes 70,000 acres of commercial timberland and development property located within 50 miles of Seattle (one of the fastest-growing metropolitan areas in North America), and another 43,000 acres of land and timber located in southwest Washington State (approximately 60 miles south of Mt. Rainier).
 







In 1997, ORM was launched to offer our expertise and services to clients interested in optimizing the value of their timberlands. OPG was formed in 1998 to manage and develop real estate properties. Today, Pope Resources owns 111,000 acres of timberland, approximately 3,240 acres of development property in Washington, and a minority interest in the 91,000 acres owned by our ORM Timber Funds in Washington and Oregon.

	NEWS RELEASE









	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE


	                             NASDAQ:POPE









	POULSBO, Wash.




	May 5, 2017











	POPE RESOURCES REPORTS FIRST QUARTER INCOME OF


	$3.4


	 MILLION









	Pope Resources (NASDAQ:POPE) reported net income attributable to unitholders of


	$3.4 million


	, or


	$0.77


	 per ownership unit, on revenue of


	$17.3 million


	 for the quarter ended


	March 31, 2017


	. This compares to net loss attributable to unitholders of


	$1.0 million


	, or


	$0.25


	 per ownership unit, on revenue of


	$11.1 million


	 for the first quarter of


	2016


	.









	Cash provided by operations for the quarter ended


	March 31, 2017


	 was


	$2.7 million


	, compared to cash used in operations of


	$2.0 million


	 for the


	first quarter


	 of


	2016


	.









	In January 2017, ORM Timber Fund II, Inc. (Fund II) sold a 6,500-acre parcel of timberland for $26.5 million, recognizing a gain on sale of $12.5 million, with $2.5 million of the gain attributable to Pope Resources’ unitholders based upon the Partnership’s 20% interest in Fund II.









	“Our overall average log price realizations improved slightly compared to the previous quarter, with lower-valued species mix masking improvements in the markets for Douglas-fir and whitewood sawlogs,” said Tom Ringo, President and CEO. “We trace this improvement in log markets to reductions in log supply caused by unusual amounts of rain and snow in our Pacific Northwest operating region, combined with incremental demand due to market expectations of pending duties on Canadian lumber imports.”









	First quarter


	 highlights


















	•






	Harvest volume was


	27.3 MMBF


	 in


	Q1




	2017


	 compared to


	15.6 MMBF


	 in


	Q1




	2016


	, a


	75%


	 increase. These harvest volume figures do not include timber deed sales of 0.3 MMBF in Q1 2017 sold by ORM Timber Fund III. The harvest volume and log price realization metrics cited below also exclude these timber deed sales, except as noted otherwise.
















	•






	Average realized log price per thousand board feet (MBF) was


	$596


	 in


	Q1




	2017


	 compared to


	$591


	 per MBF in


	Q1




	2016


	, a 1% increase.
















	•






	As a percentage of total harvest, volume sold to domestic markets in


	Q1




	2017


	 decreased to


	59%


	 from


	60%


	 in


	Q1




	2016


	, while the mix of volume sold to export markets was


	22%


	 in


	Q1




	2017


	 compared to


	18%


	 in


	Q1




	2016


	. Hardwood, cedar and pulpwood log sales make up the balance of harvest volume.
















	•






	Fund II recognized a gain of $12.5 million on the sale of one of its tree farms in January 2017. This sale generated a $5.5 million distribution to the Partnership.











	1































	•






	The Partnership acquired


	1,648


	 acres of timberland in western Washington for


	$5.0 million


	, or $3,004 per acre.












	First quarter


	 operating results









	Fee Timber:






	Fee Timber operating income for


	Q1




	2017


	 was


	$16.6 million


	 compared to


	$2.5 million


	 for


	Q1




	2016


	. Our Q1 2017 results reflect a $12.5 million gain on the sale of one of Fund II’s tree farms in northwestern Oregon, without which our Q1 2017 operating income would have been $4.1 million. Other than the gain on sale of the tree farm, the increase in operating income was driven primarily by the 75% increase in harvest volume as we had back-loaded our 2016 harvest to the fourth quarter during which we produced 44% of our annual harvest volume.









	Timberland Investment Management:




	Operating losses incurred by this segment for


	Q1




	2017


	 and


	Q1




	2016


	 totaled


	$966,000


	 and


	$666,000


	, respectively, after eliminating revenue earned from managing the Funds of


	$848,000


	 and


	$815,000


	 for


	Q1




	2017


	 and


	Q1




	2016


	, respectively. The increase in operating loss is primarily attributable to professional fees associated with the late 2016 launch of our fourth timber fund, as well as additional personnel costs to manage our expanding timber fund portfolio.




	Real Estate:




	Our Real Estate segment posted operating losses of


	$1.2 million


	 and


	$1.0 million


	 for


	Q1




	2017


	 and


	Q1




	2016


	, respectively. In


	Q1




	2016


	, we closed on the sale of nine single-family lots from our Harbor Hill development as opposed to no land sales in Q1 2017.









	General & Administrative (G&A):




	G&A expenses were


	$1.7 million


	 for


	Q1




	2017


	 and


	$1.6 million




	for Q1




	2016


	 with the increase primarily due to higher incentive compensation accruals driven by this year’s improvement in our unit trading price.









	Outlook









	Unlike 2016, our 2017 harvest volume should be distributed more evenly throughout the year. We expect our total 2017 harvest volume to be between 112 and 118 MMBF, including timber deed sales. In our Real Estate segment, we expect to close on the sale of up to 93 single-family lots from our Harbor Hill project, the majority of which we expect to occur in the fourth quarter, as well as a number of other potential land and conservation easement sales.









	The financial schedules accompanying this earnings release provide detail on individual segment results and operating statistics.









	About Pope Resources









	Pope Resources, a publicly traded limited partnership, and its subsidiaries Olympic Resource Management and Olympic Property Group, own or manage 210,000 acres of timberland and development property in Washington, Oregon, and California. We also manage, co-invest in, and consolidate three private equity timber funds, for which we earn management fees. These funds provide an efficient means of investing our own capital in Pacific Northwest timberland and earning fee revenue from managing the funds for third-party investors. The Partnership and its predecessor companies have owned and managed timberlands and development properties for over 160 years. Additional information on the company can be found at

	Forward Looking Statements









	This press release contains a number of projections and statements about our expected financial condition, operating results, business plans and objectives, and about management’s plans for future operations and strategies. These statements reflect management’s estimates based on current goals and its expectations about future developments. Because these statements describe our goals, objectives, and anticipated performance, they are inherently uncertain, and some or all of these statements may not come to pass. Accordingly, they should not be interpreted as promises of future management actions or financial performance. Our future actions and actual performance will vary from current expectations and under various circumstances the results of these variations may be material and adverse. Among those forward-looking statements contained in this report are statements about management’s expectations for future log prices, harvest volumes and markets, and statements about our expectations for future sales in our Real Estate segment. Readers, however, should note that all statements other than expressions of historical fact are forward-looking in nature. Some of the factors that may cause actual operating results and financial condition to fall short of expectations, or that may cause us to deviate from our current plans, include our ability to accurately predict fluctuations in log markets domestically and internationally, and to adjust our harvest volumes in a timely and appropriate manner; political sensitivities and events, including the reactions of foreign governments and international treaty organizations and similar bodies, that may affect the cost of competing products and demand for our products; our ability to anticipate and manage interest rate risk as it affects our borrowing costs; fluctuations in interest rates that affect the U.S. housing market and related demand for our products from that market; our ability to estimate the cost of ongoing and changing environmental remediation obligations, including our ability to anticipate and address the political and regulatory climate that impacts these obligations; our ability to consummate various pending and anticipated real estate transactions on the terms management expects; our ability to manage our timber funds and their assets in a manner that our investors consider acceptable, and to raise additional capital or establish new funds on terms that are advantageous to the Partnership; conditions in the housing construction and wood-products markets, both domestically and globally, that affect demand for our products; the effects of competition, particularly by larger and better-financed competitors; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that affect both competition for sales of our products and our customers’ demand for them; the effect of current and potential treaties and other international agreements that affect the supply of logs in the United States and demand for logs overseas; conditions affecting credit markets as they affect the availability of capital and costs of borrowing; labor, equipment and transportation costs that affect our net income; our ability to anticipate and mitigate potential impacts of our operations on adjacent properties; the impacts of natural disasters on our timberlands and on surrounding areas; and our ability to discover and to accurately estimate other liabilities associated with our assets. Other factors are set forth in that part of our Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled “Risk Factors.”









	Other issues that may have an adverse and material impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition include those risks and uncertainties discussed in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Forward-looking statements in this release are made only as of the date shown above, and we cannot undertake to update these statements.

years from over 500 units during the early part of this
decade– Much more market maker interest and tighter bid-ask
spreads• Significant change in institutional ownership over
past few years– Two largest institutional owners greatly
decreased their positions, putting downward pressure on unit price
– Modest increase in mutual fund and other institutional
ownership– Increases in ownership by retail investors,
management, and outside directors• Unit repurchase programs

Pope Resources Pope Resources - Summary of Investment Opportunity
Summary of Investment Opportunity• Deep discount to NAV–
Imputed value of all lands (fee timber, 20% of ORM Timber Fund I
& II, and real estate portfolio) is approximately $1,200 per
acre• Substantially below comparable timberland sales values
and less than half the price of recent Timber Fund
acquisitions– Current Unit price appears to place no value on
real estate portfolio, which is positioned to capitalize on
recovering west Puget Sound real estate market• If real estate
portfolio was only worth its book value of $27 million, the implied
value of timber portfolio would be approximately $1,000 per
acre• Highly tax-efficient vehicle for investing in timberland
asset class– Efficient flow-through tax treatment–
Competitive after-tax distribution yield relative to timber
REITs– Compelling diversification benefits of timberland
asset class• Adding value through use of free cash flow
– Co-investment in ORM Timber Funds– Periodic
repurchase of units• Improved alignment with increased insider
ownership in recent years  

 

 


  


 





Market Perceptions Contributing to High Discount to NAV Market
Perceptions Contributing to High Discount to NAV• Small
size– Enterprise value of peer companies substantially larger
than Pope Resources (Deltic 3x, Potlatch 8x, Rayonier 20x, Plum
Creek 42x larger as of YE 2009)• Very low liquidity–
Limited float with over one-quarter of the units essentially not
traded• K-1 tax

	Nasdaq:POPE









	POULSBO, Wash.




	May 30, 2017











	POPE RESOURCES ANNOUNCES UNIT REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION




	AND DISTRIBUTION REINVESTMENT PLAN




	Pope Resources (NASDAQ:POPE) announced today the adoption of a $1.2 million unit repurchase authorization, or “Authorization”, and separately, a distribution reinvestment plan, or “DRIP”. The Partnership believes that the Authorization will provide an attractive opportunity for allocating capital while also offsetting the dilution impact of the company’s equity compensation plans. The Authorization became effective on May 30, 2017 and will continue for one year or until the authorized funds of $1.2 million have been deployed, whichever is first. The DRIP will provide unitholders a convenient means with which to reinvest distribution proceeds. The DRIP became effective on May 30, 2017 with the Partnership’s filing of its Form S-3 registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), and will commence with the first quarterly distribution following the previously announced June 20, 2017 distribution.




	About the Unit Repurchase Authorization




	The Authorization permits the Partnership to repurchase limited partnership units having an aggregate value of not more than $1.2 million, subject to certain conditions and other contingencies established under the Authorization.




	The Authorization permits the Partnership to repurchase units pursuant to a programmed trading plan adopted in accordance with Securities Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1 (“Rule 10b5-1”), and includes provisions permitting the Partnership to enter into one or more programmed trading plans permitted under that rule. Any programmed trading plan would be initially implemented by the Partnership only at a time during which no restriction exists under such laws and while no blackout period is in effect. The Authorization anticipates that the Partnership will take measures management deems appropriate to comply with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that are applicable to issuer repurchases. Rule 10b5-1 allows an issuer to repurchase its securities at times when it otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. Separate from the Authorization, repurchases may also be made from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions, subject to general market conditions.




	The unit repurchase period will commence immediately and may continue for up to twelve months. While the aggregate maximum purchase price of units repurchased under the Authorization is $1.2 million, any repurchase as well as the actual price of any units repurchased under the Authorization is subject to








	1

















	management’s discretion and to the terms of any applicable Rule 10b5-1 plan. There is no guarantee as to the exact number of units that will be repurchased under the Authorization, and the Partnership may discontinue purchases at any time. Repurchased units will be redeemed and retired.




	About the Distribution Reinvestment Plan




	The DRIP permits registered unitholders to invest all or a portion of their cash distributions in the Partnership’s limited partnership units. The price for limited partnership units purchased in the DRIP will be the average of the high and low trading prices of the limited partnership units on the Nasdaq GlobalSelect Market for the five trading days immediately preceding the distribution date.




	Only registered unitholders may participate directly in the DRIP. Beneficial owners of limited partnership units that are registered in someone else’s name (such as a depositary or a bank, broker, trustee or nominee) can make arrangements with the registered holder to participate in the DRIP on their behalf, or can participate by withdrawing their limited partnership units from such person and registering the limited partnership units in the beneficial holder’s name. Beneficial owners of limited partnership units should contact their bank, broker or trustee directly with regard to participation in the DRIP, or they may contact our Managing General Partner. The Managing General Partner’s address is: Pope MGP, Inc., Attention: Investor Relations, 19950 Seventh Avenue NE, Poulsbo, Washington 98370, (360) 697-6626.




	Participation in the DRIP is voluntary, and if a unitholder elects to participate, the unitholder may terminate participation in the DRIP at any time (subject to restrictions following a relevant record date).




	The Partnership has appointed Computershare Trust Company, N.A., (the “Administrator”) to administer the DRIP. Unitholders can enroll online by following the enrollment procedures specified on the Administrator’s website at www.computershare.com/investor or by completing and signing an Enrollment Form and returning it to the Administrator.




	For transaction requests, please write to the Administrator at the following address: Computershare, P.O. Box 50500, Louisville, KY 40233-5000. In addition, you may call the Administrator at (877) 255-0989 or contact the Administrator via the Internet at www.computershare.com/investor.




	Unitholders should read carefully the prospectus describing the DRIP before deciding to participate in the Plan. A copy of this prospectus can be found on the Partnership’s website at www.poperesources.com/InvestorRelations.aspx. You also may obtain a copy of the prospectus by calling or writing our Managing General Partner at Attention: Investor Relations, 19950 Seventh Avenue NE, Poulsbo, Washington 98370, (360) 697-6626




	Notices




	This news release does not constitute an offer to purchase or sell, or a solicitation of an offer to sell or purchase, the limited partnership units described in this news release, nor shall there be any sale of these limited partnership units in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. The DRIP is being made only through an effective registration statement on Form S-3, including the prospectus contained therein, that was filed with the SEC on May 30, 2017, and became effective upon filing. The Authorization will be consummated, if at all, pursuant to valid exemptions from such registration.




	About Pope Resources




	Pope Resources, a publicly traded limited partnership, and its subsidiaries Olympic Resource Management and Olympic Property Group, own or manage more than 210,000 acres of timberland and development property in Washington and Oregon. In addition, we provide forestry consulting and timberland investment








	2

















	management services to third-party owners and managers of timberland in Washington, Oregon, and California. The company and its predecessor companies have owned and managed timberlands and development properties for more than 160 years. Additional information on the company can be found at www.poperesources.com. The contents of our website are not incorporated into this release, into the prospectus relating to the DRIP, or into any of our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.




	Forward-Looking Statements




	Our public announcements often contain projections and statements about our expected financial condition, operating results, business plans and objectives, and about management's plans for future operations and strategies. These statements reflect management's estimates based on current goals and its expectations about future developments. Those included in this release are statements that affect our expectations for completion of the unit repurchase program and statements about our intentions in adopting the DRIP and managing these two initiatives simultaneously. Because these statements describe our goals, objectives, and anticipated performance, they are inherently uncertain, and some or all of these statements may not come to pass. Accordingly, they should not be interpreted as promises of future management actions or financial performance. Our future actions and actual performance will vary from current expectations and under various circumstances the results of these variations may be material and adverse. Readers should note that all statements other than expressions of historical fact are forward-looking in nature. Some of the factors that may cause actual results to fall short of expectations, or that may cause us to deviate from our current plans, include investor response to each of these two programs and to the operation of both initiatives simultaneously, as well as factors that affect the liquidity and the market price of our limited partner units. These outcomes are influenced, among other things, by our operating results and our financial conditions, which in turn are affected by our ability to accurately predict fluctuations in log markets domestically and internationally, and to adjust our harvest volumes in a timely and appropriate manner; political sensitivities and events, including the reactions of foreign governments and international treaty organizations and similar bodies, that may affect the cost of competing products and demand for our products; our ability to anticipate and manage interest rate risk as it affects our borrowing costs; fluctuations in interest rates that affect the U.S. housing market and related demand for our products from that market; our ability to estimate the cost of ongoing and changing environmental remediation obligations, including our ability to anticipate and address the political and regulatory climate that impacts these obligations; our ability to consummate various pending and anticipated real estate transactions on the terms management expects; our ability to manage our timber funds and their assets in a manner that our investors consider acceptable, and to raise additional capital or establish new funds on terms that are advantageous to the Partnership; conditions in the housing construction and wood-products markets, both domestically and globally, that affect demand for our products; the effects of competition, particularly by larger and better-financed competitors; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that affect both competition for sales of our products and our customers' demand for them; the effect of current and potential treaties and other international agreements that affect the supply of logs in the United States and demand for logs overseas; conditions affecting credit markets as they affect the availability of capital and costs of borrowing; labor, equipment and transportation costs that affect our net income; our ability to anticipate and mitigate potential impacts of our operations on adjacent properties; the impacts of natural disasters on our timberlands and on surrounding areas; and our ability to discover and to accurately estimate other liabilities associated with our assets. Other factors that may affect our limited partner units are set forth in that part of our Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled "Risk Factors."




	Other issues that may have an adverse and material impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition include those risks and uncertainties discussed in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Forward-looking statements in this release are made only as of the date shown above, and we cannot undertake to update these statements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


(Unaudited)


September 30, 1997


1.     The consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the
Partnership without an audit and are subject to year-end adjustments.
Certain information and footnote disclosures in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to
the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. In
the opinion of the Partnership, the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets as of September 30, 1997 and December 31, 1996 and the
consolidated statements of income for the three months and nine months
ending September 30, 1997 and 1996 and cash flows for the nine months
ending September 30, 1997 and 1996 contain all adjustments necessary to
present fairly the financial statements referred to above. The results of
operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the
results to be expected for the full year.


2.     The financial statements in the Partnership's 1996 annual report on Form
10-K include a summary of significant accounting policies of the
Partnership and should be read in conjunction with this Form 10-Q.


3.     Net income per unit is based on 903,894 units.


4.     Supplemental disclosure of cash flow information: Interest paid amounted
to approximately $1,065,000 and $1,080,000 for the nine months ended
September 30, 1997 and 1996, respectively.


5.     Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 128, "Earnings per
Share," was recently issued and is effective for the Partnership's fiscal
year ending December 31, 1997. This statement requires a change in the
presentation of earnings per share. Early adoption of this statement is
not permitted. Management believes that the impact of the adoption of
this statement on the financial statements, taken as a whole, will not be
material.


SFAS No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income", and SFAS No. 131,
"Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,"
were also recently issued and are effective for the Partnership's fiscal
year ending December 31, 1998. The Partnership is currently evaluating
the effects of these standards; however, management believes the impact
of adoption will not be material to the financial statements, taken as a
whole.

Timber log sale revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 1997 and 1996
was $15,510,000 and $18,300,000, respectively.


During the first three quarters of 1997 the export log market experienced a
steady price decline. In response, the Partnership deferred a portion of its
anticipated first-half log production with the intent of balancing out the
annual harvest with increased production in the third and fourth quarters. While
third quarter production was accelerated, year-to-date log volumes still lag
1996 levels by 9%. The Partnership also shifted a significant amount of
production mix away from the highest-valued, large-diameter export market
segment to the lower-valued domestic and small-diameter export market segments.
This was intended to allow the excessive west coast export log inventories
within the large-diameter export market segment to draw down. This product mix
shift has resulted in a 24% decrease in export production and a 26% increase in
domestic production over 1996 year-to-date levels. The combination of the
decline in export prices, along with the lower year-to-date volumes and shifts
in product mix, account for the decrease in 1997 timber revenues.


Domestic log prices during the first three quarters of 1997 have remained
relatively fairly similar to the prior year, despite increases in the supply of
domestic logs entering this segment in reaction to the declining export market.
There has been a 37% increase in price of domestic Western Red Cedar over 1996
which has been a contributing factor in this trend, even though cedar is limited
to 7% of this year's domestic production to date. The average prices per MBF of
domestic logs realized were $633 and $619 for 1997 and 1996, respectively. Pulp
and hardwood log prices in 1997 are on average slightly higher than 1996 prices,
but 1997 prices experienced more volatility with first quarter declines being
offset by higher second and third quarter prices.


The Partnership sells its logs and trees in two major markets: export and
domestic markets. Indirect sales to the export market totaled 52% and 66% of
total timber revenues for the nine month periods ending September 30, 1997 and
1996, respectively. The export demand for logs is directly affected by the
demand from Asian countries. Since the Partnership's export logs are sold
primarily in the Japanese log market, the strength of the Japanese housing
industry and the relative strength of the United States dollar directly affect
the demand for export logs. The export market weakened in the first three
quarters due to high Japanese and west coast log inventory levels, a relatively
strong dollar and increased competition from lower-quality, lower-priced species
and an increase in the supply of sawed lumber versus logs into Japan.

TIMBERLAND RESOURCES CONTINUED



The domestic demand for logs is directly affected by the level of new home
construction and repair and remodeling business activity. Changes in general
economic and demographic factors have historically caused fluctuations in
housing starts. This in turn affects demand for lumber and commodity wood prices
which drives the demand for logs. Throughout the U.S., lumber manufacturing
capacity continues to be rationalized and consolidated into larger facilities.
This trend holds true for the Partnership's operating region as the lumber
manufacturing capacity is rationalized and consolidated into larger facilities.
As the number of sawmills has declined, the Partnership has thus far been
successful in finding replacement outlets for its domestic logs. Since surviving
sawmills are larger in scale, the Partnership does not believe the decline in
the number of domestic sawmills will materially impact its near-term operations.



PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT



Property development revenues for the periods ended September 30, 1997 and 1996
were $7,627,000 and $8,385,000, respectively. Such revenues are derived from
residential development and income-producing properties. Residential development
consists of the sale of single-family homes, finished lots and undeveloped
acreage. Income-producing properties consist of providing water and sewer
services to properties in the Port Ludlow area; a marina, golf course,
commercial center and RV park operated by the Partnership; the Port Gamble
townsite and millsite; and a restaurant/lounge and related facilities leased to
Village Resorts, Inc. and operated by Derrig Hobart Enterprises, Inc..


Revenue from residential development totaled $3,766,000 and $4,739,000 through
the three quarters ended September 30, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Recognition
of deferred revenue of $544,000 related primarily to the pay off of a contract
on a large parcel, was included in the three quarters ended September 30, 1996.
The Partnership's largest development is in Port Ludlow, Washington. During the
first three quarters of 1997, the Partnership's development at Port Ludlow
generated revenues of $3,191,000 through the sale of 13 developed lots and 9
homes. This compares to the prior year's comparable period sales of $3,164,000
of 6 developed lots, and 10 homes. The revenue per sale depends on the quality
and size of the home, the subdivision, and the location of the lot. Current
year-to-date sales have been favorably affected by the continuing strength of
the Puget Sound economy and favorable interest rate environment.


The Port Ludlow Planning Forum process has continued to produce positive
results. The outstanding level of participation and enthusiasm among residents
of this special community was encouraging. In the next phase of the process, the
Partnership will seek to obtain the following approvals from residents:


-     Unify numerous homeowner associations under one newly-formed
self-governance entity

-     Consolidate association "clubhouse" amenities into one facility instead of
the current two

-     Define the future development in the key resort/commercial area.


The successful culmination of this process should position us to complete the
amenity infrastructure of Port Ludlow and thereby realize the vision of making
this a "hallmark development." Port Ludlow was selected as one of the top 20
retirement communities in the U.S. by New Choices, a magazine serving the
over-50 audience.


The Partnership's property development inventory includes a number of
residential subdivisions encompassing a broad spectrum of prices in several
locales. The Partnership continues to be in the planning and entitlement phases
for several developments located in the West Puget Sound region. The City of
Bremerton approved the Partnership's request for preliminary planned unit
development status on a 270 acre property, and increased the industrial portion
to 60 acres. Construction of the off-site sewer at this site is completed and
the Partnership is focusing on its marketing plan. With respect to other
properties, the Partnership continues to work with officials in Gig Harbor
regarding the possible development of its parcels in Gig Harbor. The Kingston
residential development, consisting of 750 acres and 765 units awaits
entitlements and sewage infrastructure. On September 8, 1997, the Growth
Management Act hearing board again invalidated Kitsap County's comprehensive
plan, where Bremerton and Kingston are located. The Partnership will participate
with other members of the County to revise the plan for resubmission to the
state hearing board.

PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT CONTINUED



Revenue from income-producing properties totaled $3,861,000 and $3,646,000 for
the periods ending September 30, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Operations were
fairly consistent for the periods ending September 30, 1997 and 1996 and
management expects future revenues to continue to increase. As of January 1,
1996, the Partnership assumed responsibility for managing the Port Gamble
townsite from Pope & Talbot, Inc. Management is presently studying how to
capitalize on the values of Port Gamble's historic core and its attendant area
of approximately 4,000 acres.



OTHER



The Partnership is a 50% joint venture partner in a 36-room inn at Port Ludlow.
For the first three quarters of 1997 the inn showed an increase in occupancy
over the first three quarters of 1996, but nevertheless performed below
expectations. Management of the joint venture continues to focus on the
development of revenue-raising strategies. The Partnership's share of joint
venture losses were $209,000 and $259,000 for the first three quarters of 1997
and 1996, respectively.


On March 14, 1997, the Partnership's unitholders authorized the Partnership's
launch of a new strategic initiative called the Investor Portfolio Management
Business (IPMB). The vehicle for this initiative will be Olympic Resource
Management LLC (ORMLLC) which will seek investors interested in developing
risk-diversified portfolios of timber and land. This business venture is
expected to generate fee income through ORMLLC's services to large investors in
acquiring, managing, and disposing of timberland investments.


Selling, general and administrative expenses were $8,384,000 and $6,067,000 for
the nine months ending September 30, 1997 and 1996, respectively. The increase
in expenses is primarily due to the following: payroll and employee-related
costs such as education, insurance, travel and entertainment; professional
services related to computer technology to enhance our internal systems to
remain competitive; expenses related to the proxy statement and unitholder
holder vote held on March 14, 1997; and costs associated with the
above-mentioned strategic initiative.


The Partnership remains focused on pursuing timberland acquisition opportunities
through our newly-formed investment portfolio management business. ORMLLC
participated in recent timberland offerings in each of the three major
geographic regions of the U.S., the northwest, southeast, and northeast.
Although not successful in these bids, we are encouraged by a number of factors.
The Partnership is making great strides in streamlining our process for
assessing potential timberland acquisitions. Olympic Resource Management is
starting to make a name for itself among competing timberland investment
management organizations (TIMO's) through our collective experience, acquisition
discipline, and stewardship values. As a result, more major landowners are
approaching ORMLLC with investment opportunities.


On October 9, 1997, Pope Resources authorized the first-ever split of its
partnership units. Unitholders of record as of October 31, 1997 will receive an
additional 4 units for each unit then held. The split is intended to bring the
units to a price level where they can be more easily traded in the marketplace,
and to meet new Nasdaq listing requirements.



LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES



Funds generated internally through operations and externally through financing
will provide the required resources for the Partnership's real estate
development and capital expenditures. Management considers its capital resources
to be adequate for its real estate development plans, both in the near-term and
on a long-term basis. At September 30, 1997, the Partnership had available an
unused $20 million bank loan commitment.


Management has considerable discretion to increase or decrease the level of logs
cut and thereby may increase or decrease net income and cash flow assuming, of
course, log prices and demand remain stable. Management's current plan is to
harvest approximately 32 million board feet of timber in 1997 which compares to
32 million board feet in 1996. Since harvest plans are based on demand, price
and cash needs, actual harvesting may vary subject to management's on-going
review.


9






LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CONTINUED



Cash provided by operating activities generated $4,822,000 for the three
quarters of 1997, and overall cash and cash equivalents decreased by $248,000.
The cash generated was primarily used for repayments of long-term debt of
$256,000 and capital expenditures of $2,733,000, related to roads,
reforestation, infrastructure, and equipment.


The Partnership declared a quarterly cash distribution of $.55 per unit payable
on September 26, 1997 to unitholders of record as of September 15, 1997. The
practice of the Partnership has been to make cash distributions only for the
purpose of defraying estimated federal and state tax liability of unitholders on
their flow-through share of the Partnership's net income and as approved from
time to time by management. The recently enacted reduction in the federal
capital gains rate factored into the third quarter distribution. Thus far in
1997, the Partnership has made three cash distributions totaling $1.95 per unit,
coinciding with tax payment due dates.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  This report contains a number of projections and statements about our expected financial condition, operating results, and business plans and objectives. These statements reflect management's estimates based upon our current goals, in light of management's knowledge of existing circumstances and expectations about future developments. Statements about expectations and future performance are "forward looking statements" within the meaning of applicable securities laws, which describe our goals, objectives and anticipated performance. These statements can be identified by words such as "anticipate," "believe," "expect," "intend" and similar expressions. These statements are inherently uncertain, and some or all of these statements may not come to pass. Accordingly, you should not interpret these statements as promises that we will perform at a given level or that we will take any or all of the actions we currently expect to take. Our future actions, as well as our actual performance, will vary from our current expectations, and under various circumstances these variations may be material and adverse. Some of the factors that may cause our actual operating results and financial condition to fall short of our expectations are set forth in the part of this report entitled "Risk Factors" in Part II, Item 1A below. Some of the issues that may have an adverse and material impact on our business, operating results and financial condition include economic conditions that affect consumer demand for our products and the prices we receive for them both domestically and overseas, particularly in certain parts of Asia; government regulation that affects our ability to access our timberlands and harvest logs from those lands; factors that affect the timing and amounts realized from the sales, if any, of our real estate holdings; the implications of significant indirect sales to overseas customers, including regulatory and tax matters; the effect of financial market conditions on our investment portfolio and related liquidity; the effects of competition, especially from larger, better-financed competitors; environmental and land use regulations that limit our ability to harvest timber and develop property; access to debt financing by our customers as well as ourselves; the impacts of climate change and natural disasters on our timberlands and on surrounding areas; factors that affect our ability to estimate accurately the extent of our environmental liabilities and the cost of remediating the known areas of exposure; and the potential impacts of fluctuations in foreign currency rates as they affect demand for our products. From time to time we identify other risks and uncertainties in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The forward-looking statements in this report reflect our estimates and expectations as of the date of the report, and unless required by law, we do not undertake to update these statements as our business operations and environment change.  This discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included with this report.  EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW  Pope Resources, A Delaware Limited Partnership ("we" or the "Partnership"), is engaged in three primary businesses. The first, and by far most significant segment in terms of owned assets and operations, is the Fee Timber segment. This segment includes timberlands owned directly by the Partnership and the three private equity funds ("Fund I", "Fund II", and "Fund III", collectively, the "Funds"). Fund I's assets were sold in 2014, and the fund is expected to terminate in 2015. When we refer to the timberland owned by the Partnership, we describe it as the Partnership's tree farms. We refer to timberland owned by the Funds as the Funds' tree farms. When referring collectively to the Partnership's and Funds' timberlands we will refer to them as the Combined tree farms. Operations in this segment consist of growing timber to be harvested as logs for sale to domestic manufacturers and export brokers. The second most significant business in terms of total assets owned is the development and sale of real estate. Real Estate activities primarily take the form of securing permits, entitlements, and, in some cases, installing infrastructure for raw land development and then realizing that land's value by selling larger parcels to buyers who will take the land further up the value chain, either to home buyers or to developers and lessors of commercial property. Since these projects span multiple years, the Real Estate segment may incur losses for multiple years while a project is developed, and will not recognize operating income until that project is sold. In addition, within this segment we sometimes negotiate and sell development rights in the form of conservation easements (CE's) on Fee Timber properties to preclude future development. Our third business, which we refer to as Timberland Management, is engaged in organizing and managing private equity timber funds using capital invested by third parties and the Partnership.  Our current strategy for adding timberland acreage is centered on our private equity timber fund business model. We have closed and invested capital from three timber funds, with assets under management totaling approximately $312 million as of June 30, 2015 based on the most recent appraisals. Our 20% co-investments in Funds I and II, and our 5% co-investment in Fund III, which collectively totaled $35 million at time of acquisition, afford us a share of the Funds' operating cash flows  while also allowing us to earn asset management and timberland management fees, as well as potential future incentive fees, based upon the overall success of each fund. We also believe that this strategy allows us to maintain sophisticated expertise in timberland acquisition, valuation, and management more cost-effectively than we could maintain for the Partnership's timberlands alone. We believe our co-investment strategy also enhances our credibility with existing and prospective investors by demonstrating that we have both an operational and a financial commitment to the Funds' success.  The Funds are consolidated into our financial statements, but then income or loss attributable to equity owned by third parties is removed from consolidated results in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income under the caption "Net (income) loss attributable to non-controlling interests-ORM Timber Funds" to arrive at comprehensive income attributable to unitholders of the Partnership.  The challenge for our Real Estate segment centers around how and when to "harvest" parcels of our 2,500-acre portfolio in western Washington to optimize value realization by selling the property, balancing the long-term risks and costs of carrying and developing a property against the potential for income and positive cash flows upon sale.  Second quarter highlights   Harvest volume was 15 million board feet (MMBF) in Q2 2015 compared to 26 MMBF in Q2 2014, a 42% decrease. Harvest volume for the first six months of 2015 was 40 MMBF compared to 56 MMBF for 2014, a 29% decrease. These harvest volume figures do not include timber deed sales of 0.6 MMBF sold by Fund III in Q1 2015. The harvest volume and log price realization metrics cited below also exclude these timber deed sales.   Average realized log price per thousand board feet (MBF) was $562 in Q2 2015 compared to $630 per MBF in Q2 2014, an 11% decrease. For the first six months of 2015, the average realized log price was $591 per MBF compared to $668 per MBF for 2014, a 12% decrease.   Fund properties contributed 52% of Q2 2015 harvest volume, compared to 51% in Q2 2014. For the first six months of 2015, Fund properties contributed 50% of harvest volume, compared to 52% for 2014.   As a percentage of total harvest, volume sold to export markets in Q2 2015 decreased to 14% from 33% in Q2 2014, with a correspondingly larger increase in the mix of volume sold to domestic markets to 68% in Q2 2015 from 51% in Q2 2014. For the first six months of 2015, the relative percentages of volume sold to export and domestic markets were 17% and 61%, respectively, compared to 38% and 46%, respectively, in 2014. Hardwood and pulpwood log sales make up the balance of total harvest volume.   The percentage of total harvest comprised of Douglas-fir sawlogs increased to 52% in Q2 2015 from 42% in Q2 2014, with a corresponding decrease in the whitewood sawlog component to 20% in Q2 2015 from 37% in Q2 2014. For the first six months of 2015, the relative mix of Douglas-fir and whitewood sawlogs was 48% and 23%, respectively, compared to 51% and 29%, respectively, for 2014.   During Q2 2015 we closed on the sale of 33 residential lots from our Harbor Hill project in Gig Harbor, Washington, for $3.3 million as well as a 175-acre conservation land sale for $920,000.  Outlook  Log prices for 2015 reached what we expect to be their lowest point in the second quarter. Due to this weaker pricing environment, we have deferred a portion of our harvest and expect total annual log harvest and stumpage sale volume of between 85 and 90 MMBF for 2015. The majority of this reduction is attributable to tree farms owned by the Funds that are located in areas more strongly influenced by the export market. We expect that log markets will continue to be volatile over the next several quarters, with a strengthening trend overall. This volatility will influence our harvest decisions as the year unfolds.  We expect additional land sales from our Real Estate segment over the remainder of 2015, although the timing of these transactions could be impacted by permitting or other delays.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following table reconciles and compares key revenue and cost elements that impacted our net income for the respective quarters and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014. The explanatory text that follows the table describes in detail certain of these changes by business segment.   Six Months Quarter Ended Ended (in thousands) June 30, June 30, Net income attributable to Pope Resources' unitholders: 2015 period $ 289 $ 8,098 2014 period 1,846 14,087 Variance $ (1,557 ) $ (5,989 ) Detail of variance: Fee Timber Log volumes (A) $ (6,930 ) $ (10,955 ) Log price realizations (B) (1,027 ) (3,049 ) Timber deed sales 19 230 Production costs 3,140 4,416 Depletion 1,357 1,583 Other Fee Timber (20 ) (47 ) Timberland Management (275 ) (394 ) Real Estate Land sales 1,644 (4,482 ) Conservation easement sales - 4,311 Timber depletion on land sale 194 (139 ) Other Real Estate (311 ) 10 General & administrative costs (748 ) (616 ) Net interest expense (148 ) (319 ) Income taxes 41 (142 ) Noncontrolling interests 1,507 3,604 Total variances $ (1,557 ) $ (5,989 )  (A) Volume variance calculated by extending change in sales volume by the average log sales price for the comparison period.  (B) Price variance calculated by extending the change in average realized price by current period sales volume.  Fee Timber  Fee Timber results include operations on 111,000 acres of timberland owned by the Partnership and 80,000 acres of timberland owned by the Funds. Fee Timber revenue is earned primarily from the harvest and sale of logs from these timberlands which are located in western Washington, northwestern Oregon, and northern California. This revenue source is driven primarily by the volume of timber harvested and the average log price realized on the sale of that timber. Our harvest volume is based typically on manufactured log sales to domestic mills and log export brokers. We also occasionally sell rights to harvest timber (timber deed sale) from the Combined tree farms. The metrics used to calculate volumes sold and average price realized during the reporting periods exclude the timber deed sales, except where stated otherwise. Harvest volumes are generally expressed in million board feet (MMBF) increments while harvest revenue and related costs are generally expressed in terms of revenue or cost per thousand board feet (MBF). Fee Timber revenue is also derived from commercial thinning operations, ground leases for cellular communication towers, and royalties from gravel mines and quarries, all of which, along with timber deed sales, are included in other revenue below. Commercial thinning consists of the selective cutting of timber stands not yet of optimal harvest age. However, they do have some commercial value, thus allowing us to earn revenue while at the same time improving the growth characteristics of the remaining stand of timber.  Revenue and operating income for the Fee Timber segment for the quarters ended June 30, 2015, March 31, 2015, and June 30, 2014 were as follows:   Timber Total Fee Harvest Deed Sale (in millions) Log Sale Other Timber Operating Volume Volume Quarter ended Revenue Revenue Revenue Income (MMBF) (MMBF) Partnership $ 4.1 $ 0.7 $ 4.8 $ 1.3 7.2 - Funds 4.3 0.2 4.5 0.3 7.9 - Total June 2015 $ 8.4 $ 0.9 $ 9.3 $ 1.6 15.1 - Partnership $ 8.3 $ 0.5 $ 8.8 $ 4.1 12.5 - Funds 6.7 0.4 7.1 0.8 12.0 0.6 Total March 2015 $ 15.0 $ 0.9 $ 15.9 $ 4.9 24.5 0.6 Partnership $ 7.9 $ 0.8 $ 8.7 $ 3.0 12.7 - Funds 8.5 0.3 8.8 2.0 13.4 - Total June 2014 $ 16.4 $ 1.1 $ 17.5 $ 5.0 26.1 -  Operating Income  Comparing Q2 2015 to Q1 2015. Operating income decreased $3.3 million, or 67%, from $4.9 million in Q1 2015 to $1.6 million in Q2 2015 as a result of a 38% decrease in harvest volume, an 8% decrease in average realized log prices, and a $362,000 increase in operating expenses. Offsetting a portion of the decrease in harvest volume and prices was a 39% reduction in cost of sales due to the decline in harvest volume.  Comparing Q2 2015 to Q2 2014. Operating income decreased $3.4 million, or 68%, from $5.0 million in Q2 2014 to $1.6 million in Q2 2015, primarily as a result of a 42% decrease in harvest volume and an 11% decrease in average realized log prices. This was offset partially by a 44% decrease in cost of sales and a $265,000 decrease in operating expenses due primarily to the decline in harvest volume.  Revenue  Comparing Q2 2015 to Q1 2015. Log sale revenue in Q2 2015 decreased $6.6 million, or 44%, from $15.0 million in Q1 2015 to $8.4 million in Q2 2015. Trends that developed during Q1 2015 continued to dampen log prices during Q2 2015 and we responded by decreasing our harvest volume 38% from Q1 2015 to Q2 2015. Demand from the export market remained weak due to the strength of the U.S. dollar, as well as competition in Japan from European-sourced products and the continued effects in China of reduced credit availability and high log inventories at its ports. Logs that have recently been directed to the export market were diverted to the domestic market, which itself was already well-supplied due to the unseasonably mild weather in the Pacific Northwest during the first half of the year. These regional weather conditions afforded timberland owners excellent access to timber not typically available in the first half of the year. An ongoing, lackluster recovery in the U.S. housing market added further downside price pressure due to weak demand for lumber, which in turn reduced the price that mills were willing to pay for logs. In response to these market conditions, we decided to defer harvest volume to future periods when log prices improve.  Comparing Q2 2015 to Q2 2014. Log sale revenue in Q2 2015 decreased $8.0 million, or 49%, from $16.4 million in Q2 2014 to $8.4 million in Q2 2015, primarily as a result of a 42% decrease in harvest volume and an 11% decrease in average realized log prices. Factors affecting the log market during Q2 2015, as described in the above paragraph, were in stark contrast to the strong log markets we experienced during Q2 2014 which followed a multi-year cyclical high during the first quarter of 2014. The decrease in other revenue from Q2 2014 to Q2 2015 was primarily attributable to a $260,000 reduction in commercial thinning activity.  Revenue and operating income for the Fee Timber segment for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:   Timber (in millions) Harvest Deed Sale Six Months Total Fee Timber Volume Volume Ended Log Sale Revenue Other Revenue Revenue Operating Income (MMBF) (MMBF) Partnership $ 12.4 $ 1.2 $ 13.6 $ 5.4 19.7 - Funds 11.0 0.6 11.6 1.1 19.9 0.6 Total June 2015 $ 23.4 $ 1.8 $ 25.2 $ 6.5 39.6 0.6 Partnership $ 18.1 $ 1.8 $ 19.9 $ 9.2 26.7 - Funds 19.3 0.4 19.7 5.1 29.3 - Total June 2014 $ 37.4 $ 2.2 $ 39.6 $ 14.3 56.0 -  Operating Income  Comparing YTD 2015 to YTD 2014. Operating income decreased by $7.8 million, or 55%, from $14.3 million in the first six months of 2014 to $6.5 million in the first six months of 2015, primarily as a result of a 29% decrease in harvest volume, a 12% decrease in average realized log prices, and a $436,000 decrease in other revenue attributable to reduced commercial thinning activity. This was offset partially by a 28% decrease in cost of sales and a $565,000 decrease in operating expenses due primarily to the decline in harvest volume.  Revenue  Comparing YTD 2015 to YTD 2014. Log sale revenue decreased $14.0 million, or 37%, from $37.4 million in first half of 2014 to $23.4 million in the first half of 2015. The reduction in revenue was the result of a 29% decrease in harvest volume and a 12% decrease in average realized log prices. Log markets during the first half of 2014, particularly in the first quarter, were at a multi-year cyclical high due to strong demand from the export market to Asia, combined with a slowly strengthening domestic market as U.S. housing starts rose to a rate of 1 million units per year. In contrast, export markets in the first half of 2015 have been impacted negatively by unfavorable currency exchange rates, tight credit conditions in China, and high log inventories at Asian ports. These factors combined to drive down export demand and prices. Domestic markets have been affected by unseasonably mild weather in the Pacific Northwest, high log and lumber inventories, and sluggish lumber prices. The $436,000 decrease in other revenue in 2015 compared to 2014 was due primarily to a reduction in commercial thinning revenue.  Log Volume We harvested the following log volumes by species from the Combined tree farms, exclusive of timber deed sales, for the quarters ended June 30, 2015, June 30, 2014, and March 31, 2015: Volume (in MMBF) Quarter Ended Jun-15 % Total Mar-15 % Total Jun-14 % Total Sawlogs Douglas-fir 7.8 52 % 11.3 46 % 10.9 42 % Whitewood 3.0 20 % 6.0 25 % 9.6 37 % Pine 1.1 7 % - - % 0.5 2 % Cedar 0.5 3 % 1.3 5 % 0.8 3 % Hardwood 0.4 3 % 1.5 6 % 0.5 2 % Pulpwood All Species 2.3 15 % 4.4 18 % 3.8 14 % Total 15.1 100 % 24.5 100 % 26.1 100 %  Comparing Q2 2015 to Q1 2015. Harvest volume decreased 9.4 MMBF, or 38%, from  quarter when winter weather limits access to higher elevation timberlands. Our abundance of lower elevation timberlands affords us this opportunity. This year, however, the Pacific Northwest experienced unseasonably mild weather conditions, largely removing this seasonal opportunity. Looking forward to the balance of the year, these same lower elevation timberlands may allow us to harvest later in the year when harvest activities are curtailed due to extreme fire conditions on higher elevation properties. Lower elevation timberlands subject to marine influence are often able to be harvested in hot, dry conditions when log prices may be elevated due to restricted log supply.  Douglas-fir harvest volume, as a percent of overall harvest, increased from 46% in Q1 2015 to 52% in Q2 2015. Conversely, the component of whitewood harvest volume decreased from 25% in Q1 2015 to 20% in Q2 2015. This shift in species mix was partly attributable to better market demand for Douglas-fir and to mitigate the effect of a weak whitewood market. Pine harvest volume, as a percent of overall harvest, increased from 0% in Q1 2015 to 7% in Q2 2015. The pine volume in Q2 2015 originated almost exclusively from Fund III's northern California tree farm.  Comparing Q2 2015 to Q2 2014. Harvest volume decreased 11 MMBF, or 42%, from  We harvested the following log volumes by species from the Combined tree farms, exclusive of the aforementioned timber deed sales, for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014:  Volume (in MMBF) Six Months Ended Jun-15 % Total Jun-14 % Total Sawlogs: Douglas-fir 19.1 48 % 28.9 51 % Whitewood 9.0 23 % 16.3 29 % Pine 1.1 3 % 0.5 1 % Cedar 1.8 4 % 1.5 3 % Hardwood 1.9 5 % 1.5 3 % Pulpwood: All Species 6.7 17 % 7.3 13 % Total 39.6 100 % 56.0 100 %  Comparing YTD 2015 to YTD 2014. Harvest volume decreased 16.4 MMBF, or 29%, from  Log Prices  Logs from the Combined tree farms serve a number of different domestic and export markets, with domestic mills historically representing our largest market destination.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  This report contains a number of projections and statements about our expected financial condition, operating results, and business plans and objectives. These statements reflect management's estimates based upon our current goals, in light of management's knowledge of existing circumstances and expectations about future developments. Statements about expectations and future performance are "forward looking statements" within the meaning of applicable securities laws, which describe our goals, objectives and anticipated performance. These statements can be identified by words such as "anticipate," "believe," "expect," "intend" and similar expressions. These statements are inherently uncertain, and some or all of these statements may not come to pass. Accordingly, you should not interpret these statements as promises that we will perform at a given level or that we will take any or all of the actions we currently expect to take. Our future actions, as well as our actual performance, will vary from our current expectations, and under various circumstances these variations may be material and adverse. Some of the factors that may cause our actual operating results and financial condition to fall short of our expectations are set forth in the part of this report entitled "Risk Factors" in Part II, Item 1A below. Some of the issues that may have an adverse and material impact on our business, operating results and financial condition include economic conditions that affect consumer demand for our products and the prices we receive for them both domestically and overseas, particularly in certain parts of Asia; government regulation that affects our ability to access our timberlands and harvest logs from those lands; factors that affect the timing and amounts realized from the sales, if any, of our real estate holdings; the implications of significant indirect sales to overseas customers, including regulatory and tax matters; the effect of financial market conditions on our investment portfolio and related liquidity; the effects of competition, especially from larger, better-financed competitors; environmental and land use regulations that limit our ability to harvest timber and develop property; access to debt financing by our customers as well as ourselves; the impacts of climate change and natural disasters on our timberlands and on surrounding areas; and the potential impacts of fluctuations in foreign currency rates as they affect demand for our products. From time to time we identify other risks and uncertainties in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The forward-looking statements in this report reflect our estimates and expectations as of the date of the report, and unless required by law, we do not undertake to update these statements as our business operations and environment change.  This discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included with this report.  EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW  Pope Resources, A Delaware Limited Partnership ("we" or the "Partnership"), is engaged in three primary businesses. The first, and by far most significant segment in terms of owned assets and operations, is the Fee Timber segment. This segment includes timberlands owned directly by the Partnership and operations of the three private equity funds ("Fund I", "Fund II", and "Fund III", collectively, the "Funds"). When we refer to the timberland owned by the Partnership, we describe it as the Partnership's tree farms. We refer to timberland owned by the Funds as the Funds' tree farms. When referring collectively to the Partnership's and Funds' timberlands we will refer to them as the Combined tree farms. Operations in this segment consist of growing timber to be harvested as logs for sale to export brokers and domestic manufacturers. The second most significant business in terms of total assets owned is the development and sale of real estate. Real Estate activities primarily take the form of securing permits, entitlements, and, in some cases, installing infrastructure for raw land development and then realizing that land's value by selling larger parcels to buyers who will take the land further up the value chain, either to home buyers or to developers and lessors of commercial property. Since these projects span multiple years, the Real Estate segment may incur losses for multiple years while a project is developed, and will not recognize operating income until that project is sold. In addition, within this segment we sometimes negotiate and sell development rights in the form of conservation easements (CE's) on Fee Timber properties to preclude future development. Our third business, which we refer to as Timberland Management, is engaged in organizing and managing private equity timber funds using capital invested by third parties and the Partnership.  Our current strategy for adding timberland acreage is centered on our private equity timber fund business model. We have closed and invested capital from three timber funds, with assets under management totaling approximately $262 million as of September 30, 2014 based on the most recent appraisals. Our 20% co-investments in Funds I and II, and our 5% co-investment in Fund III, which collectively totaled $32 million at time of acquisition, afford us a share of the Funds' operating cash flows while also allowing us to earn asset management and timberland management fees, as well as potential future incentive fees, based upon the overall success of each fund. We also believe that this strategy allows us to maintain sophisticated expertise in timberland acquisition, valuation, and management more cost-effectively than we could maintain for the Partnership's timberlands alone. We believe our co-investment strategy also enhances our credibility with existing and prospective investors by demonstrating that we have both an operational and a financial commitment to the Funds' success.  The Funds are consolidated into our financial statements, but then income or loss attributable to equity owned by third parties is removed from consolidated results in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income under the caption "Net (income) loss attributable to non-controlling interests-ORM Timber Funds" to arrive at comprehensive income attributable to unitholders of the Partnership.  The challenge for our Real Estate segment centers around how and when to "harvest" parcels of our 2,900-acre portfolio in western Washington to optimize value realization by selling the property, balancing the long-term risks and costs of carrying and developing a property against the potential for income and positive cash flows upon sale.  Third quarter highlights  ? Harvest volume was 19 million board feet (MMBF) in Q3 2014 compared to 16 MMBF in Q3 2013, an 18% increase. Harvest volume for the first nine months of 2014 was 75 MMBF compared to 69 MMBF for the first nine months of 2013, an 8% increase.  ? Average realized log price per thousand board feet (MBF) was $568 in Q3 2014 compared to $591 per MBF in Q3 2013, a 4% decrease. For the first nine months of 2014, the average realized log price per MBF was $643 compared to $609 per MBF for the first nine months of 2013, a 6% increase.  ? Fund properties contributed 50% of Q3 2014 harvest volume, compared to 53% in Q3 2013. For the first nine months of 2014, Fund properties contributed 52% of harvest volume, compared to 46% for the first nine months of 2013.  ? As a percentage of total harvest, softwood sawlog volume sold to export markets in Q3 2014 was 28%, down from 45% in Q3 2013, while the mix of softwood sawlog volume sold to domestic markets increased correspondingly to 56% in Q3 2014 from 36% in Q3 2013. For the first nine months of the year, the relative percentages of softwood sawlog volume sold to export and domestic markets were 35% and 49%, respectively, compared to 33% and 49% in 2013.  ? The percentage of total harvest comprised of Douglas-fir sawlogs dropped to 37% in Q3 2014 from 50% in Q3 2013, with a corresponding increase in the whitewood component to 39% in Q3 2014 from 27% in Q3 2013. Paralleling this species pattern shift, for the first nine months of 2014, the relative mix of Douglas-fir and whitewood was 48% and 32%, respectively, compared to 61% and 20% for the first nine months of 2013.  ? Our Fund I sold its Green River tree farm for $39.0 million, recognizing a gain on the sale of $9.2 million, with $1.8 million attributable to Pope Resources' unitholders.  ? We closed on 10 single-family residential lots in Gig Harbor for a total sales price of $900,000 during Q3 2014, while in Q3 2013 we had no closings but did recognize $1.0 million of previously deferred land sale revenue.  Outlook  We expect our harvest volume for the full year 2014 to be between 95 and 98 MMBF, including timber deed sales, with the final total depending on log market conditions for the balance of the year  In the first nine months of 2014, we closed on the sale of a number of Real Estate properties and although we expect to close on several more during the fourth quarter, some of these transactions may not occur until early 2015 due to permitting or other delays.  In October 2014, Fund I sold its remaining tree farm for $31.5 million and Fund III acquired a 13,000-acre tree farm in northwestern Oregon for $72.0 million.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following table reconciles and compares key revenue and cost elements that impacted our net income for the respective quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013. The explanatory text that follows the table describes in detail certain of these changes by business segment.   Nine Months Quarter Ended Ended (in thousands) September 30, September 30, Net income (loss) attributable to Pope Resources' unitholders: 2014 period $ 1,500 $ 15,587 2013 period (75 ) 9,537 Variance $ 1,575 $ 6,050 Detail of variance: Fee Timber Log volumes (A) $ 1,719 $ 3,372 Log price realizations (B) (437 ) 2,548 Gain on sale of timberland 9,188 9,188 Timber deed sales 522 404 Production costs (518 ) (3,172 ) Depletion (677 ) (682 ) Other Fee Timber (56 ) 791 Timberland Management (66 ) (177 ) Real Estate Land sales 584 3,894 Timber depletion on land sale - 376 Other Real Estate (599 ) (773 ) General & administrative costs 61 720 Net interest expense (274 ) (779 ) Income taxes (461 ) (703 ) Noncontrolling interests (7,411 ) (8,957 ) Total variances $ 1,575 $ 6,050  (A) Volume variance calculated by extending change in sales volume by the average log sales price for the comparison period.  Fee Timber  Fee Timber results include operations from 110,000 acres of timberland owned by the Partnership and 75,000 acres of timberland owned by the Funds. Fee Timber revenue is earned primarily from the harvest and sale of logs from these timberlands which are located in western Washington, northwestern Oregon, and northern California. This revenue source is driven primarily by the volume of timber harvested and the average log price realized on the sale of that timber. Our volume harvested is typically based on manufactured log sales to domestic mills or log export brokers. We also occasionally sell rights to harvest timber (timber deed sale) from the Combined tree farms. During Q2 2013, Q3 2013, and Q3 2014, we sold volume under timber deed sales from Fund III's timberland. The metrics used to calculate volumes sold and average price realized during the reporting periods exclude the timber deed sales, except where stated otherwise. Harvest volumes are generally expressed in million board feet (MMBF) increments while harvest revenue and related costs are generally expressed in terms of revenue or cost per thousand board feet (MBF). Fee Timber revenue is also derived from commercial thinning operations, ground leases for cellular communication towers, and royalties from gravel mines and quarries, all of which, along with timber deed sales, are included in Other Revenue below.  On September 30, 2014, Fund I sold the 16,000-acre Green River tree farm in western Washington for $39.0 million and recorded a gain of $9.2 million.  Revenue and operating income for the Fee Timber segment for the quarters ended September 30, 2014, June 30, 2014, and September 30, 2013 were as follows:   Total Fee Gain on Harvest (in millions) Log Sale Other Timber Sale of Operating Volume Quarter ended Revenue Revenue Revenue Timberland Income (MMBF) Partnership tree farms $ 5.4 $ 0.7 $ 6.1 $ - $ 1.6 9.5 Funds' tree farms 5.3 1.0 6.3 9.2 9.7 9.5 Total Fee Timber September 30, 2014 $ 10.7 $ 1.7 $ 12.4 $ 9.2 $ 11.3 19.0 Partnership tree farms $ 7.9 $ 0.8 $ 8.7 $ - $ 3.0 12.7 Funds' tree farms 8.5 0.3 8.8 - 2.0 13.4 Total Fee Timber June 30, 2014 $ 16.4 $ 1.1 $ 17.5 $ - $ 5.0 26.1 Partnership tree farms $ 4.6 $ 0.4 $ 5.0 $ - $ 1.4 7.6 Funds' tree farms 4.8 0.5 5.3 - 0.1 8.5 Total Fee Timber September 30, 2013 $ 9.4 $ 0.9 $ 10.3 $ - $ 1.5 16.1  Operating Income  Comparing Q3 2014 to Q2 2014. Operating income increased $6.3 million, or 126%, from $5.0 million in Q2 2014 to $11.3 million in Q3 2014 primarily as a result of a $9.2 million gain on the sale of our Funds' Green River tree farm. This was offset partially by a 20% decrease in harvest volume, including timber deed sales, 10% decrease in average realized log prices, and a $144,000 increase in operating expenses.  Comparing Q3 2014 to Q3 2013. Operating income increased $9.8 million, from $1.5 million in Q3 2013 to $11.3 million in Q3 2014 primarily as a result of a $9.2 million gain on the sale of our Funds' Green River tree farm, and the 22% increase in harvest volume, including timber deed sales. This was offset partially by a 4% decrease in average realized log prices and a $334,000 increase in operating expenses.  Revenue  Comparing Q3 2014 to Q2 2014. Log sale revenue in Q3 2014 decreased $5.7 million, or 35%, from $16.4 million in Q2 2014 to $10.7 million in Q3 2014. Weaker log prices in both the domestic and export log markets caused a 10% decrease in average realized price while a seasonal slowdown in our harvest volume resulted in a 27% reduction in harvest volume during the current quarter. The market price for logs typically declines during the summer months when favorable weather conditions bring increased supply to the market, resulting in weaker prices. We often plan our annual harvest with the expectation that we will throttle back our harvest levels during the third quarter, saving the volume for seasonally stronger markets during other times of the year. In addition, log inventories continued to expand at Asian ports as end-user demand for logs failed to keep pace with log imports. Without the price support in the export market, prices in the domestic market fell as well, with only minimal support from the very slow housing market recovery.  The increase in Other Revenue generated in Q3 2014 compared to Q2 2014 consisted primarily of a timber deed sale by Fund III of $775,000 representing 1.9 MMBF of timber, offset partially by less commercial thinning revenue on the Combined tree farms. Commercial thinning consists of the selective cutting of timber stands not yet of optimal harvest age. However, they do have some commercial value, thus allowing us to earn revenue while at the same time improving the growth characteristics of the remaining stand.  Comparing Q3 2014 to Q3 2013. Log sale revenue in Q3 2014 increased $1.3 million, or 14%, from $9.4 million in Q3 2013 to $10.7 million in Q3 2014. The improved log revenue was attributable to an 18% increase in harvest volume, partially offset by a 4% decrease in average realized log prices. The increase in volume is attributable to harvest operations on Fund III's northern California tree farm whereas during Q3 2013 this tree farm's only revenue came from a timber deed sale that is included in Other Revenue.  The increase in Other Revenue from Q3 2013 to Q3 2014 consisted primarily of increases in Fund III's timber deed sale revenue and commercial thinning revenue from the Combined tree farms.  Revenue and operating income for the Fee Timber segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013 were as follows:   Total Fee Gain on Harvest (in millions) Log Sale Other Timber Sale of Operating Volume Nine Months Ended Revenue Revenue Revenue Timberland Income (MMBF) Partnership tree farms $ 23.5 $ 2.4 $ 25.9 $ - $ 10.7 36.2 Funds' tree farms $ 24.6 $ 1.5 $ 26.1 9.2 $ 14.8 38.8 Total Fee Timber September 30, 2014 $ 48.1 $ 3.9 $ 52.0 $ 9.2 $ 25.5 75.0 Partnership tree farms $ 23.5 $ 1.0 $ 24.5 $ - $ 10.7 37.4 Funds' tree farms 18.8 0.6 19.4 - 2.4 32.0 Total Fee Timber September 30, 2013 $ 42.3 $ 1.6 $ 43.9 $ - $ 13.1 69.4  Operating Income  Comparing YTD 2014 to YTD 2013. Operating income increased by $12.4 million, or 95%, from $13.1 million in the first nine months of 2013 to $25.5 million in the first nine months of 2014 primarily as a result of: the $9.2 million gain on the sale of our Funds' Green River tree farm; an 8% increase in harvest volume, including timber deed sales; and a 6% increase in average realized log prices. This was offset partially by a $1.1 million increase in operating expenses.  Revenue  Comparing YTD 2014 to YTD 2013. Log sale revenue increased $5.8 million, or 14%, from $42.3 million in 2013 to $48.1 million in 2014. The improvement was due to an 8% increase in harvest volume and 6% higher average realized log prices. The increases in both harvest volume and average log prices resulted from stronger demand from both domestic and export markets compared to a year ago. The increase in Other Revenue in 2014 compared to 2013 was due primarily to an increase in commercial thinning activity.  Log Volume We harvested the following log volumes by species from the Combined tree farms, exclusive of timber deed sales, for the quarters ended September 30, 2014, June 30, 2014, and September 30, 2013: Volume (in MMBF) Quarter Ended Sawlogs Sep-14 % Total Jun-14 % Total Sep-13 % Total Douglas-fir 7.0 37 % 10.9 42 % 8.1 50 % Whitewood 7.5 39 % 9.6 37 % 4.4 27 % Pine 1.3 7 % 0.5 2 % - 0 % Cedar 0.2 1 % 0.8 3 % 0.5 3 % Hardwood 0.4 2 % 0.5 2 % 0.6 4 % Pulpwood All Species 2.6 14 % 3.8 14 % 2.5 16 % Total 19.0 100 % 26.1 100 % 16.1 100 %  Comparing Q3 2014 to Q2 2014.

Export customers consist of log brokers who sell the logs primarily to Japan, China and, to a lesser degree, Korea.
