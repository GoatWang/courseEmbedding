Since Week 14 of the 2015 regular season, much has been made about New York Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. and how emotional he is about the game of football.

RelatedPsychologist on Giants' Odell Beckham Jr.: 'He’s not getting the help he needs'
That debate came to a head last week when Beckham Jr. threw a sideline tirade for the ages, slamming his head into the medical supply cart and going a few rounds with the kicking net.
In the aftermath of that spectacle, the debate has raged: is OBJ just that passionate about winning or is there a much larger issue at play?
Those who weigh in predominantly feel like Beckham Jr. is becoming a distraction to his teammates and is in need of some psychological help. But is that just merely a product of the times?
Beckham Jr. raised that question on Saturday evening when he posted an Instagram video comparing his actions and emotions to those of Lawrence Taylor, who was praised as a “passionate madman” and an “emotional leader” during his glory days with the Giants.





 My imperfections are what make me Me. Blessed to be chosen.
A post shared by Odell Beckham Jr (@obj) on Oct 1, 2016 at 1:09pm PDT


Is it in Beckham Jr.’s best interest to compare himself to a man who was admittedly doing hard drugs and sleeping with prostitutes at the time? Probably not, but it’s also clear that’s not what the 2014 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year was alluding to.
On the field and with his teammates, Taylor was a loose cannon who exploded with alarming frequency. And yet, unlike Beckham Jr., he was praised for it. It became an identity for Taylor and sparked fear in his opponents; it wasn’t only welcomed, but encouraged.

RelatedRandy Moss defends Odell Beckham Jr.'s blow-ups: 'That's passion, man'
Say what you will about Beckham Jr., but the kid has a point. He is treated substantially different than Taylor ever was for the exact same thing (minus the drugs and prostitutes). And while society and its views change over time, there’s really nothing wrong with an emotional player on the football field who keeps those same emotions in check off of the field.
Maybe it is time we all back off of Beckham Jr. a bit.
