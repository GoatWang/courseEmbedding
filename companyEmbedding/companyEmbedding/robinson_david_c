Architect C. David Robinson dies


By Carl Nolte


        Published 4:00 am, Tuesday, February 5, 2008
    
































































C. David Robinson, an architect who left his mark all over Bay Area with buildings he designed, died at his Sausalito home Saturday from the complications of ALS, a debilitating illness also called Lou Gehrig's disease.
Mr. Robinson was 72. 
Services will be Wednesday. 
 Mr. Robinson worked for several San Francisco architectural firms and among his achievements are museums and private residences, including the Center for the Arts in San Francisco's Yerba Buena Gardens, the Charles M. Schulz Museum in Santa Rosa, and major renovations of Temple Emanu-el and the landmark Cliff House in San Francisco.
His restoration of the soaring, domed Temple Emanu-el was described as "flawless" by the late Chronicle architectural critic Allan Temko.

David Williams, who knew Mr. Robinson for 44 years and was his partner for 14 of them, said Mr. Robinson had "very, very high standards in terms of quality and design. He was hard to please, but generous and selfless in supporting the work and accomplishments of others."
Mr. Robinson was also active in cultural affairs and was on the boards of the San Francisco Art Institute, the University Art Museum at UC Berkeley, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the California College of the Arts, and the San Francisco Planning and Urban Research Association. He received SPUR's Silver Spur award for public service.
Chalfant David Robinson was born in New York in 1936, and graduated with honors from Princeton University with a degree in art history in 1957. 
 He then served as a Marine Corps officer for three years. He received a master of architecture degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1965 and began his architectural career in San Francisco with Skidmore, Owings and Merrill.
 In 1970, he was one of the co-founders of Robinson, Mills & Williams, which grew to be one of the five largest architectural firms in San Francisco. He joined Polshek and Partners as partner in charge of the San Francisco office, and in 1997 he founded C. David Robinson Architects.
He was a man of many parts - he and his wife, Mary, had a significant collection of contemporary art and photographs. Their collection of 19th century photographs is part of the collection of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. 
 Mr. Robinson was also a star athlete in college, where he was captain of Princeton's ice hockey team and its crew teams. His family noted that he was good enough to participate in the crew trials for the 1960 Olympics. He also played rugby both in Pennsylvania and for the San Francisco Olympic Club.
 He is survived by Mary Robinson, his wife of 43 years; a daughter, Annie Robinson Woods of San Francisco; two sons , Ward Robinson of Los Angeles, and Steven Robinson of New York; two brothers, Hamilton Robinson of New York, and Will Robinson of Maryland; and three sisters, Sandy Righter of Boston, Marshall Bickel of Frederick, Md., and Randle Bitnar of Bozeman, Mont. He is also survived by three grandchildren.
 A service will be held Wednesday at 1 p.m. at the Temple Emanu-el, at Arguello Boulevard and Lake Street in San Francisco. 
The family prefers donations to the C. David Robinson Endowment Fund at the Bay Area Chapter of the ALS Association, 565 Commercial St., San Francisco, CA 94111.

                                10-position all-numeric identification number assigned by the NPS to uniquely identify a health care provider.

                                Code describing the type of health care provider that is being assigned an NPI. Codes are:

1 = (Person): individual human being who furnishes health care;
2 = (Non-person): entity other than an individual human being that furnishes health care (for example, hospital, SNF, hospital subunit, pharmacy, or HMO).





                                Is Organization Subpart
                            

                                N
                            

                                The "Is the organization a subpart?" question must be answered. If the organization is a subpart, the Parent Organization Legal Business Name (LBN) and Parent Organization Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) fields must be completed. The Parent Organization LBN and TIN fields can only be completed if the answer to the subpart question is Yes.
Many organization health care providers who apply for NPIs are not legal entities themselves but are parts of other organization health care providers that are legal entities (the "parents"). 
Here are three examples of organization health care providers that may be considered subparts and may apply for NPIs if so directed by their "parents": 
(1) The psychiatric unit in a hospital is not a legal entity but is part of the hospital (the "parent"), which is a legal entity. The legal entity must obtain an NPI. The psychiatric unit is an example of a subpart that could have its own NPI if the hospital determines that it should. 
(2) A group practice that is not a sole proprietorship has a main location and could have other offices in different locations, but each office is not a separate legal entity; instead, each office is part of the corporation (the "parent") which is a legal entity. The offices are examples of subparts that could have their own NPIs if the main location determines that they should. 
(3) A pharmacy fills prescriptions for patients whose physicians have prescribed medications for them and may also rent or sell durable medical equipment to patients whose physicians have ordered such equipment for them. Neither the pharmacy line of business nor the DME line of business represent legal entities; instead, both lines of business are part of an organization (the "parent") that is a legal entity. Each line of business represents a different Healthcare Provider Taxonomy or area of specialization that often submits its own electronic claims to health plans. 
The "parent"-we don't know who the parent is in this example-must ensure that each subpart that submits its own claims to health plans has its own NPI.

Role: Director & Advisor



Nanosynth Materials and Sensors (Director & Advisor), Nanosynth has developed an innovative Point of Care (POC) screening and/or diagnostic platform for active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) that combines a highly sensitive nanotechnology-based sensor with real-time disease mapping and analytics capabilities (Data Mural – above). The sensor utilizes titanium dioxide nanotube technology that detects volatile biomarkers in the breath that are uniquely associated with Mycobacterium tuberculosis to generate a screening result in under 10 minutes. This test is non-invasive and very low cost to produce — under $2 per sensor. Perhaps even more important for a screening test, the portability of the device (the size of a smartphone) and ease of use for community health workers will allow for widespread adoption including in rural communities and in resource limited settings.

Role: Commercialization Partner




uBiota – Microbes surround us, interact with us and affect our lives every minute of the day. The foods we eat, our cars and bikes, our friends and pets and family all serve as points where we share microbes with each other. Bacteria are the most abundant cellular organisms in the world and they enable life on the planet by balancing the chemistry where they live. These microbes that are an essential part of our lives are called the microbiota.
They enable agriculture. They clean the water. They live inside animals, transforming indigestible material into food for their hosts, and they live on the surface of plants and the products of bacterial metabolism enter the plants through the leaves. uBiota’s mission is to help scientists of all kinds (including citizen scientists) use cutting-edge approaches to explore bacterial communities in all these environments.

Role: Director & Advisor



iVeena is a bioerodible dexamethasone implant (BDI) that enables drop-free cataract surgery by delivering dexamethasone to the front of the eye (treating post-surgical inflammation) and the back of the eye (preventing the complication of cystoid macular edema, which occurs in about 8.2% of patients undergoing routine cataract surgery). The BDI drug delivery device is implanted in the lens capsule at the time of surgery (a few seconds required for implantation; no additional procedure required) and releases dexamethasone either over 2 weeks (for routine cases) or 6 weeks (for complex cases, such as patients with diabetes or pre-existing inflammation). Its PLGA matrix degrades by hydrolysis shortly thereafter and does not alter the transparency of the intraocular lens as it is peripheral to the lens and does not migrate in the rest of the eye as the capsule envelops it. It is the only drug delivery device to rest within the lens capsule of the eye and it is the only drug delivery device capable of bidirectional drug delivery to both the front and back segments of the eye.

Product Description▼▲
"For many days we had been tempest-tossed.the raging storm increased in fury until on the seventh day all hope was lost." From these dire opening lines, a timeless story of adventure begins. One family will emerge alive from this terrible storm: the Robinsons-a Swiss pastor, his wife, and four sons, plus two dogs and a shipload of livestock. Inspired by Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, this heartwarming tale portrays a family's struggle to create a new life on a strange and fantastic tropical island. There each boy must learn to utilize his own unique nature as their adventures lead to difficult challenges and amazing discoveries, including a puzzling message tied to an albatross's leg. But it is in the ingenuity and authenticity of the family itself, and the natural wonders of this exotic land that have made The Swiss Family Robinson, first published at the beginning of the nineteenth century, one of the most enduring and imitated stories of shipwreck and survival.

Author Bio▼▲
Johann David Wyss (1743-1818) was a clergyman in Berne, Switzerland. A former military chaplain, Wyss spoke four languages, loved nature, and was deeply involved in the raising of his four boys, reading to them and taking them on hikes and hunting trips. To teach them moral lessons and entertain them, he read them a story he had written about a family just like theirs (each boy in the story is based on one of Wyss’s four sons), who had been shipwrecked on a tropical island. This handwritten manuscript was more than eight hundred pages long and one of his sons, Johann Emmanuel, helped him illustrate it. Years later another son, Johann Rudolf, by then a professor at the Berne Academy, found his fathers manuscript, edited it, and published it in 1812-1813 as The Swiss Family Robinson. The first English translation appeared in 1814, and there have since been nearly two hundred versions of this novel, as well as two films and a television movie.From the Paperback edition.
