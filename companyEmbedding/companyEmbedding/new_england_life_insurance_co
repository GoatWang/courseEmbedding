Car Insurance
Car insurance covers you in case of an accident or theft. Save with an employee or association discount! For service, please call 1-800-422-4272 (individual policies) or 1-800-438-6381 (group customers).








Car Insurance



When you're in the driver's seat, keep your car, yourself, and your family protected with quality car insurance from MetLife Auto & Home®.
Why choose car insurance from MetLife Auto & Home?

Great savings. Save hundreds with discounts for good drivers and savings for every year you drive claim-free.1
Quality coverage. MetLife Auto & Home offers comprehensive and collision coverage and options to suit your needs. Many of our policies offer new car replacement, special parts replacement, enhanced rental car damage coverage and identity theft protection at no extra cost.2
Convenience. You decide: you can call to get personalized customer service and enhanced coverage, then choose between multiple payment options and schedules. With this option, you can access your policy information by phone, online or through our mobile app, anytime, anywhere. Or, you can quickly enter your information, get a quote, buy and manage your policy entirely online with MetLife Auto & Home MyDirectSM (not available in all states).

Group Car Insurance



If your employer offers MetLife Auto & Home's group car insurance program as part of your employee benefits, you could receive special savings. Some membership associations have discounts, too.

 Find out if you're eligible:


 GO 







Group discounts. Most people saved an average of $536 per year!3 We can offer these savings because your employer provides you access to a group insurance program with special low rates as part of your employee benefits.
Coverage that stays with you. If you retire, leave your company or go on leave, you can still continue your coverage without interruption or change.
Great features. Even though the policy's cheaper, you'll still have access to all our policy benefits. These include replacement coverage for total loss, rewards for good driving, enhanced rental car damage coverage, identify theft protection and more.2

MetLife Auto & Home®: Auto Safety Features




        FAQs 
      




 What types of basic auto insurance coverage does MetLife Auto & Home offer?








MetLife Auto & Home® offers a wide variety of coverage options, including:

Liability protection, which pays claims if you're responsible for an accident that causes bodily injuries and property damage.
Collision and comprehensive coverage, which pays for damage to your car if it hit another vehicle or object, no matter who caused the accident.4 It also pays for damage to your car caused by events like theft, vandalism, fire, flood, and hail.
Personal injury protection, which covers the costs of doctors, hospitals, and funeral expenses for you, members of your household, and/or your passengers, if a covered accident occurs, no matter who was at fault. You'll also be protected when you drive another person's car (with permission) or if a vehicle hits you or a family member as pedestrians.4
Uninsured motorists coverage, which pays the cost of damages and injuries resulting from being hit by an uninsured or hit-and-run driver. Coverage for both you and your passengers includes medical expenses, lost wages, and other injury-related losses.4
Underinsured motorists coverage, which pays for damages if you're injured in an accident caused by someone who doesn't have enough insurance to cover your medical expenses.





What other types of coverage are available?








MetLife Auto & Home® offers a wide variety of coverage options, including:

Rental car coverage. This will pay costs to the rental agency if you have an accident driving a rental car.
New car replacement. If you total your new car within one year of purchase or during the first 15,000 miles—whichever comes first—you get it repaired or it will be replaced with a new car with no deduction for depreciation.5
Special parts replacement. We'll pay to replace certain major parts—like tire, brakes and batteries--no matter what their wear-and-tear/depreciated value at the time of the accident.6
Glass repairs without a deductible. If your windshield is chipped or cracked, we'll repair it and waive your deductible.
Towing and roadside assistance and labor cost coverage. If your car breaks down while traveling, this can help reimburse you for towing and other roadside-assistance expenses.
Legal defense costs. If you're sued, we'll cover your legal fees. We'll also reimburse you for up to $200 per day for lost wages, if you attend a hearing or trial at our request.
Lease/loan gap coverage. Your vehicle's lease or loan will be paid off if your vehicle is a total loss due to an accident, even if the amount exceeds the value of your vehicle.





 What types of car insurance discounts and rewards does MetLife Auto & Home offer?









Deductible Savings Benefit. Automatically earn $50 every year you don't make a claim (to a maximum of $250) that may be used toward your deductible, if you have a covered loss.1
Defensive Driver Discount. Earn up to a 7% discount by completing a qualifying driver training course, like the one on the National Safety Council website.7
Superior Driver Discounts and MetRewards. Earn up to a 12% Superior Driver Discount if all of the drivers in your household have outstanding driving records, or up to 20% off your policy through the MetRewards program, if you are claim and violation-free for 5 years.8
Bundle and save. Save up to 10% with our multi-product and multi-policy discounts for having home as well as auto insurance with us. Check out our Bundle and Save page for more details! Sample multi-policy discounts:
          
Auto/Home multi-policy discount: 10%
Auto/Life multi-policy discount: 5% 9
 
Good Student Discount. Your star high school or college student could earn you a 15% discount if he or she qualifies.





 If I have a group policy, what happens if I retire, go on leave or change companies?








No worries! Your policy and coverage will continue without interruption, subject to policy terms and conditions. You'd be able to pay your insurance premiums through our EFT payment plan, by credit or debit card, through bills received by mail, or, in some cases, by pension deduction. If your premium is currently deducted from your paycheck and you go on short-term disability, like parental leave, your coverage stays in effect throughout your leave (subject to policy terms). If you were on payroll deduction and you're not receiving a regular paycheck from your employer, you'll receive a bill directly by mail.10




 What's the process for reporting an accident and filing a claim?








To file a claim with MetLife Auto & Home, call 1-800-854-6011—we're open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. If you need to file a claim against another driver, you'll need to contact that person's insurance company or agent and give the other company your insurance information. If you purchased collision coverage, you won't have to wait for the other driver to pay for damages: we will pay for damage to your car minus your deductible, regardless of who is at fault. Depending on the claim, you may be assigned a primary adjuster who conducts a thorough investigation of the accident, a field adjuster who appraises your car vehicle, a total loss specialist who finalizes the vehicle value, and a medical payments/personal injury protection adjuster who handles medical bills, like emergency room visits. If your repair shop finds additional damage that wasn't included in the original estimate, your repair shop will advise the appraiser, who will then write up a supplemental estimate that includes the additional damage. A second check is issued for the additional damage.         




My lienholder is showing up on the claim I've reported and/or the claim check. What should I do?








If you've paid off your auto loan but your lienholder is showing up on the claim reported, contact your primary claim adjuster right away. You will be asked to mail or fax a copy of your vehicle's title with the stamp indicating that the lien was discharged. The claim adjuster will forward the copy of the title to our service center, which will update your policy automatically. If you lease your vehicle or if you are still making loan payments, the leasing company or lienholder must be listed on the claim check. To cash the check, simply contact your lienholder's or leasing company's customer service department to find out how it will arrange to endorse the check. Once it has been endorsed, you may deposit it into your bank account.

What is life insurance and why do I need it?








A death in the family is not only emotionally devastating, it can also take a tremendous toll on the future financial security of a family. Suddenly, without the deceased’s income, paying the mortgage or providing for a child's college education may become much more difficult.   
Those who buy life insurance do so to help ensure their loved ones are taken care of financially. Life insurance is a promise by an insurance company to pay those who depend on you a sum of money upon your death. In return, you make periodic payments called premiums. Premiums can be based on factors such as age, gender, medical history and the dollar amount of the life insurance you purchase.
In the event of your passing, life insurance provides money directly to the individuals you select, your beneficiaries, who can use the money as they see fit, including:

Replacing lost income
Covering basic living expenses
Paying household debts, estate taxes and funeral expenses
Funding a child’s education
Supplementing retirement savings





What kinds of life insurance can I get at work?








Life insurance comes in two main types – term and permanent – which may both be available through your workplace.
Term life insurance pays a specific lump sum to your loved ones for a specified period of time – usually from one to 20 years. If you stop paying premiums, the insurance stops. Term policies pay benefits if you die during the period covered by the policy, but they do not build cash value. They may also give you the option to port. That is, you can take the coverage with you if you leave your company.
Generally, you should consider a term life insurance policy to:

Get valuable coverage at an affordable price
Help cover specific financial responsibilities like a mortgage or college expenses
Supplement a permanent policy

 Permanent life insurance policies do not expire. They are intended to protect your loved ones permanently, as long as you pay your premiums. Some permanent life insurance policies accumulate cash value. That means, the value of the policy will grow each year, tax-deferred, until it matches the face value of the policy. The cash can generally be accessed via loans or withdrawals, and can be used for a variety of purposes. This type of plan is typically portable so coverage can continue if employment terminates. 
Consider a permanent insurance policy if you want:

Protection for life
Payments that stay the same each year
To put additional money into the policy on a tax-favored basis
Cash value you can use while you are living





What are the advantages of purchasing life insurance through work?








Getting life insurance through work can be an easy way to protect your family. If your employer offers a group plan, consider signing up for advantages that may include:

Competitive group rates
Guaranteed issue, meaning you can get a certain amount of coverage without answering health questions or taking a medical exam
Convenient payroll deductions
Easy access to enrollment and educational tools that can help you make the right decisions about the type and amount of insurance that’s right for you
The confidence of knowing that your employer has reviewed and selected the plan

 All you have to do is sign up, and sometimes enrollment is automatic.




How much life insurance do I need?








While you won’t be able to pinpoint the amount you’ll need to the penny, you can make a sound estimate.  Your goal should be to develop a life insurance plan that, following your death, will allow your family to live comfortably without your economic contribution. Also consider the effect of inflation over time. The amount needed for retirement or college 20 years from now is likely to be significantly higher than today.
To estimate the amount of life insurance your family would need, first calculate everything you now provide for your family including:

Salary
Benefits/health insurance
401(k) and retirement savings
Personal services you perform for your family, such as child care, cooking, home maintenance, etc.

 Then, subtract your personal expenses including:

Annual spending on personal needs, such as food, clothing, entertainment, etc.





How much does life insurance cost?








Life insurance through your workplace may be more affordable than you think. In fact, many people can get term life insurance coverage from a quality company for a surprisingly low price.1
Premiums are typically based on factors such as:

Age, sex, height and weight
Health status, including whether or not you smoke
Participation in high-risk occupations

 Life insurance gets more expensive as you get older, and the type of coverage you choose will also affect your premium. Rates for term insurance are typically lower, while rates for permanent policies are typically higher.




Does MetLife offer an individual one year term life insurance product?








Yes.  MetLife’s one year term products offer affordable protection when you require insurance for the short term. These products are designed to provide the right amount of protection when it’s needed most, or to supplement a policy you already have. Premium rates can be found here. For more information contact MetLife's Specialized Benefit Resources at 877-638-3932, and press 2 for New Business.




What are the tax advantages of life insurance?








Death benefits are generally received income tax-free by your beneficiaries. In the case of permanent life insurance policies, cash values accumulate on an income tax-deferred basis. That means you would not have to pay income tax on any of the policy’s earnings as long as the policy remains in effect. In addition, most policy loans and withdrawals are not taxable (although withdrawals and loans will reduce the cash value and death benefit).2

MetLife, Inc. is the holding corporation for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MLIC),[4] better known as MetLife, and its affiliates. MetLife is among the largest global providers of insurance, annuities, and employee benefit programs, with 90 million customers in over 60 countries.[3][5] The firm was founded on March 24, 1868.[6]
On January 6, 1915, MetLife completed the mutualization process, changing from a stock life insurance company owned by individuals to a mutual company operating without external shareholders and for the benefit of policyholders.[7] The company went public in 2000.[8] Through its subsidiaries and affiliates, MetLife holds leading market positions in the United States, Japan, Latin America, Asia’s Pacific region, Europe, and the Middle East.[9] MetLife serves 90 of the largest Fortune 500 companies.[10] The company’s principal offices are located at 200 Park Avenue, New York City in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, though it retains some executive offices and its boardroom in the MetLife Building, located at 200 Park Avenue, New York City, which it sold in 2005.[11]
In January 2016, the company announced that it would spin off U.S. Retail business, including individual life insurance and annuities for the retail market, in a separate company called Brighthouse Financial.[12] They will maintain the MetLife name on MetLife Stadium.[13] On March 6, 2017, the separated U.S. Retail business launched Brighthouse Financial – an independent company focused on life insurance and annuities.

In 2015, MetLife hired Hugh Dineen to fill the new role of chief marketing officer within the US Business Unit.[17]
As in many large, public corporations, MetLife has a compensation committee which establishes compensation levels for the company's senior executives; MetLife compensation emphasizes "variable performance-based compensation over fixed or guaranteed pay".[2]

History[edit]
Early years[edit]




Home office of the New England Mutual Life Insurance Co. one of the predecessor companies of MetLife. see [30]


The predecessor company to MetLife began in 1863 when a group of New York City businessmen raised $100,000 to found the National Union Life and Limb Insurance Company. The company insured Civil War sailors and soldiers against disabilities due to wartime wounds, accidents, and sickness. On March 24, 1868, it became known as Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and shifted its focus to the life insurance business.[31][32]




The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower, which previously served as company headquarters, was featured in its advertising for many years.


A severe business depression that began with the Panic of 1873 forced the company to contract, until it reached its lowest point in the late 1870s. After observing the insurance industry in Great Britain in 1879, MetLife President Joseph F. Knapp brought “industrial” or “workingmen’s” insurance programs to the United States – insurance issued in small amounts on which premiums were collected weekly or monthly at the policyholder’s home. By 1880, sales had exceeded a quarter million of such policies, resulting in nearly $1 million in revenue from premiums. In 1909, MetLife had become the nation’s largest life insurer in the United States, as measured by life insurance in force (the total value of life insurance policies issued).[31][33]
In 1907, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower was commissioned to serve as MetLife’s 23rd Street headquarters in Lower Manhattan. Completed two years later, the building was the world's tallest until 1913 and remained the company's headquarters until 2005. For many years, an illustration of the building (with light emanating from the tip of its spire and the slogan, "The Light That Never Fails") featured prominently in MetLife’s advertising.[34] By 1930, MetLife insured every fifth man, woman, and child in the United States and Canada.[35] During the 1930s, it also began to diversify its portfolio by reducing the percentage of individual mortgages in favor of public utility bonds, investments in government securities, and loans for commercial real estate.[35] The company financed the construction of the Empire State Building in 1929 as well as provided capital to build Rockefeller Center in 1931. During World War II, MetLife placed more than 51 percent of its total assets in war bonds, and was the largest single private contributor to the Allied cause.[35]
Postwar[edit]

During the postwar era, the company expanded its suburban presence, decentralized operations, and refocused its career agency system to serve all market segments. It also began to market group insurance products to employers and institutions. By 1979, operations were segmented into four primary businesses: group insurance, personal insurance, pensions, and investments.[35] In 1981, MetLife purchased what became known as the MetLife building for $400 million from a group that included Pan American World Airways.[36][37]

De-mutualization and IPO[edit]
In 2000, MetLife converted from a mutual insurance company operated for the benefit of its policyholders to a for-profit public company. The de-mutualization process allowed MetLife to enter unrelated insurance businesses and increase executive compensation.
Policyholders received some stock in the new company in this process.[38] MetLife was accused of breaching federal securities laws by misrepresenting and omitting information in materials given to policyholders during this process, resulting in years of litigation ending with a $50 million settlement in 2009.[39]
Acquisitions, sales, and major deals[edit]

1992 - merged with United Mutual Life Insurance Company, the only African-American life insurer in New York, in 1992.[40]
1992 - [41] acquired Executive Life's single premium deferred annuity business, which was worth approximately $1.2 billion. MetLife also acquired the firm's life insurance business, valued at about $260 million.[42]
1995 - purchased New England Mutual Life Insurance Company.[43]
1997 - acquired Security First Group in 1997 for $377 million.[44][45]
1999 - acquired Lincoln National Corporation's individual disability income unit.[46]
1999 - bought out reinsurance provider GenAmerica Corporation for $1.2 billion, as well as its subsidiaries, Reinsurance Group of America and Conning Corporation.[47][48] That year, the company had grown to serve 7 million policyholders.[49]
2000 - de-mutualization and IPO.[50][51] The initial public offering was valued at $6.5 billion, which was the largest IPO to that date in United States financial history.[50][51] MetLife policyholders were asked to choose a cash or stock stake. This IPO made MetLife the most widely owned stock in the United States, and it raised MetLife's value to over $4 billion.[52][53] By 2000, MetLife's reported number of policyholders had risen to 11 million,[53] and that year it had become the United States' number one life insurer, surpassing Prudential, according to The New York Times.[54]
2000 - $470 million voice and data network management deal with AT&T Solutions.[55]
2001 - acquired Grand Bank of Kingston, New Jersey, which was renamed MetLife Bank.[56][57]
2001 - invested $1 billion in the United States stock market during 2001, immediately after the September 11th terrorist attacks.[58]
2005 - acquired Citigroup’s Travelers Life & Annuity and all of Citigroup’s international insurance businesses for $11.8 billion.[59][60] At the time of the deal, which was completed on July 1, 2005, the Travelers acquisition made MetLife the largest individual life insurer in North America based on sales.[61]
2006 - opened joint-venture insurance company in Shanghai, in May 2006.[62][63]
2006 - sold Peter Cooper Village, or Stuyvesant Town, the largest apartment complexes in New York City at the time, for $5.4 billion.[64][65] MetLife had developed the apartment complexes between 1945 and 1947, to house veterans returning home from serving in World War II.[66]
2010 - bought American Life Insurance Company from AIG for US$15,500,000,000.[59]
2011 - sold MetLife bank to GE Capital, exiting banking business.[67]

Current era[edit]
From 2004 to 2011, MetLife continued to hold its position as the largest life insurer in the United States.[16][68] The company had $2.5 trillion in policies written, $350 billion in assets under management, over 12 million customers in the United States, 8 million customers outside the United States, and a net income in 2003 of $2.2 billion.[68] That year, Barron's reported that 13 million American households owned at least one product from MetLife.[69]
MetLife named Robert H. Benmosche as chairman and CEO in July 1999. Benmosche occupied the position until 2006, when he was replaced by C. Robert Henrikson.[16][70][71]
The company's sales grew 11.5% between 2008 and 2009, despite the national recession.[72] In 2011, CEO Robert Henrikson was replaced by Steven A. Kandarian, who had overseen the company's "US$450,000,000,000 investment portfolio" as chief investment officer.[16] Henrikson remained the company's chairman to the end of 2011, at which point he reached the company's mandatory retirement age.[16]
In 2015, MetLife was ranked as number one on Fortune magazine's list of World's Most Admired Companies in the Insurance: Life and Health category.[73]
In the summer of 2017, MetLife plans to add a third office building of 255,000 square feet at its Cary, North Carolina Global Technology Campus, giving the company a total of 655,000 square feet at a location which has over 1,000 employees in such areas as engineering, software and technology. This plan was the result of North Carolina awarding the company $94 million in incentives in 2013 for creating over 2,600 jobs, half in Cary and half in Charlotte.[74]
"Too big to fail"[edit]
In 2012, MetLife failed the Federal Reserve’s (the Fed's) Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review stress test, intended to predict the potential failure of the company in a recession. The Fed stated that the minimum total risk-based capital ratio should be 8% and it estimated MetLife's ratio at 6%. The company had requested approval for a US$2,000,000,000 share repurchase to prop up the stock price, along with an increased dividend.[75] Because MetLife owned MetLife Bank, it was subject to stricter financial regulation. To escape that level of regulation, MetLife announced the sale of its banking unit to GE Capital.[76][77] On November 2, 2012, MetLife said it was selling its US$70,000,000,000 mortgage servicing business to JPMorgan Chase for an undisclosed amount.[78] Both sales were part of its strategy to focus on the insurance side of its business.
The attempt to escape "too big to fail" regulation was not successful. In September 2014, the United States government observed the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law by proposing the application of an official label to MetLife as "systemically important" to the American economy.[79] If implemented, MetLife would be subject to different sets of rules and regulations, with increased oversight from the Federal Reserve.[79][80] The company appealed this proposal in November 2014.[81] In December 2014, federal regulators decided that MetLife required the special regulations reserved for financial companies and organizations deemed "systemically important," or "too big to fail".[82] MetLife announced in January 2015 that it would file a lawsuit against the District of Columbia to overturn the federal regulators' decision,[79] thus becoming the first nonbank to challenge such a decision.[83] Three other nonbank companies have been designated as "systemically important": AIG, General Electric and Prudential.[82][83] MetLife continued to litigate this issue as of mid-2015, with the US Department of Justice asking that their challenge be dismissed.[83]
Fines[edit]
On August 7, 2012, it was announced that MetLife will pay $3.2 million in fines after the Federal Reserve charged it used unsafe and unsound practices in handling its mortgage servicing and foreclosure operations.[84]
In 2014, MetLife paid $23 million to settle multiple lawsuits over junk fax operations used to generate leads for life insurance sales.[85]


"MetLife Bank took advantage of the FHA insurance program by knowingly turning a blind eye to mortgage loans that did not meet basic underwriting requirements, and stuck the FHA and taxpayers with the bill when those mortgages defaulted."

U.S. Attorney John Walsh
In 2015, MetLife Home Loans LLC paid $123.5 million to the United States Department of Justice to resolve allegations it knowingly made mortgages insured by the United States government that didn’t meet federal underwriting requirements.[86]

MetLife Hall of Records, Yonkers, New York.


As of 2010[update], MetLife had a "diverse product mix" which included insurance (home, car and life), variable life annuities and structured settlements, commercial mortgages and securities backed by commercial mortgages, and sovereign debt.[15]
Life insurance[edit]
MetLife’s individual life insurance products and services comprise term life insurance and several types of permanent life insurance, including whole life, universal life, and final expense whole life insurance.[87][88] These services vary in regards to the duration and amount of coverage available and whether a medical exam is required for coverage. The company also offers group life insurance, provided through employers, which consists of term life, permanent life, and accidental death and dismemberment coverage.[89][90] MetLife is the largest life insurer in the United States, based on life insurance in-force.[10][15]
Dental[edit]
MetLife offers group dental benefit plans for individuals, employees, retirees and their families and provides dental plan administration for over 20 million people.[91][92] Plans include MetLife’s Preferred Dentist Program (PPO) and the SafeGuard DHMO (available for both individuals and employees in CA, FL, TX, NJ and NY.). As of May 2010, MetLife’s dental PPO network included over 135,000 participating dentist locations nationwide while the dental HMO network included more than 13,000 participating dentist locations in California, Florida and Texas.[93] MetLife also administers dental continuing education program for dentists and allied health care professionals, which are recognized by the American Dental Association (ADA) and the Academy of General Dentistry (AGD).[94]
Disability[edit]
MetLife provides disability products for individuals as well as employee and association groups who receive them through their employer.[14][95] For individuals, the company’s individual disability income insurance can replace a portion of lost income if an individual is unable to work due to sickness or injury.[96] MetLife offers several individual disability income policies, including MetLife Income Guard, OMNI Advantage, OMNI Essential, Business Overhead Expense, and Buy-Sell.[97] The policy options provided by the company vary in terms of eligibility and the provided coverage. For groups, MetLife offers short term disability insurance and long term disability insurance.[98] Short term disability insurance is structured to replace a portion of an individual’s income during the initial weeks of a disabling illness or accident.[99] Long term disability Insurance serves to replace a portion of an individual’s income during an extended period of a disabling illness or accident.[100][101] The company also maintains an absence management product which allows employers to track and manage both planned and unplanned employee absences. The product, which MetLife calls MetLife Total Absence Management, is structured for businesses with 1,000 or more employees.[102]
Annuities[edit]
MetLife is among the largest providers of annuities in the world, recording $22.4 billion in sales during 2009.[103] MetLife offers annuities which consist of fixed annuities, variable annuities, deferred annuities and immediate annuities.[104] In 1921, MetLife was the first company to issue a group annuity contract.[105] More recently in 2004, it was the first insurer to introduce a longevity insurance product.[106] As of December 31, 2009, MetLife globally managed group annuity assets of $60 billion with $34 billion of transferred pension liabilities and provided benefit payments to over 600,000 annuitants per month.[107]
Auto & Home[edit]
MetLife Auto & Home is the brand name for MetLife’s nine affiliate personal lines insurance companies.[108] Collectively these companies offer personal lines property and casualty insurance policies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.[109] The flagship company in the MetLife Auto & Home group, Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company, was founded in 1972.[108] MetLife Auto & Home companies presently have over 2.7 million active policies and service 58 of the Fortune 100 companies.[110][111]
MetLife's home insurance solutions include homeowners insurance, condo insurance, renters insurance, insurance for landlords, and mobile home insurance.[112][113] The available policies for MetLife's home insurance provide coverage for possessions, property damage from natural disaster or theft, and various legal expenses incurred resulting from injuries sustained on an individual's property.[114] The companies also sell RV, ATV, boat, mobile home, collectible vehicle, and motorcycle policies[115] and offers flood insurance policies as a participant in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is managed by the federal government.[116][117] MetLife's various types of coverage for auto insurance include liability protection, collision and comprehensive coverage, personal injury protection, rental car coverage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists coverage.[118][119] Through an arrangement with Hyatt Legal Plans, a subsidiary of MetLife, MetLife Auto & Home underwrites group legal plans in many states.[18]
It was the first national insurer in the United States to offer identity-theft resolution services at no extra premium and as of 2012 continues to do so today in most United States states.[120][121] In 2010, MetLife Auto & Home began offering their GrandProtect plan in most states. This GrandProtect policy simplifies complex insurance needs by combining a client's home, valuable items, autos, RVs, and boats into one comprehensive policy package. The ultimate benefits to the consumer are having one bill, only one deductible, comprehensive coverage, and typically lower rates than trying to get each policy individually.[122]

MetLife’s products also include critical illness insurance.[123] Financial services include fee-based financial planning, retirement planning, wealth management, 529 Plans, banking, and commercial and residential mortgages.[124] The company also provides retirement plan and other financial services to healthcare, education, and not-for-profit organizations.[125] The MetLife Center for Special Needs Planning is a group of planners which serve families and individuals with special needs.[126] In 2014, MetLife launched MetLife Defender, a digital identity theft protection product.[127]
International presence[edit]
Outside of the United States, MetLife operates in Latin America, Europe, Asia’s Pacific region, and the Middle East, with leading market positions in Mexico, Japan, South Korea and Chile.[9]
On March 8, 2010, MetLife announced its intent to purchase the international leader life-insurance business, American Life Insurance Company (Alico), from American International Group (AIG). MetLife, which completed the deal on November 1, 2010, paid approximately $7.2 billion in cash and $9.0 billion in MetLife equity and other securities.[128][129] The securities portion of the deal consisted of 78.2 million shares of MetLife common stock, 6.9 million shares of contingent convertible preferred stock and 40 million equity units.[130] The values of the common and preferred stock were based on the closing price of MetLife’s common stock on October 29.[130] Upon completion of the purchase, MetLife became a leading competitor in Japan, the world’s second-largest life insurance market, and moved into a top 5 market position in many high growth emerging markets in Central and Eastern Europe, such as Romania, the Middle East and Latin America.[131] The deal added 20 million customers to MetLife’s 70 million and according to Barron's more than doubled the percentage of operating profits that MetLife gets abroad to 40%.[15]
In India MetLife has an affiliate company India Insurance Company Limited (MetLife) which has operated in India since 2001. This company has its headquarters in Bangalore and Gurgaon and was jointly owned by MetLife and a few local Indian financial companies. In 2012 an agreement was made with local Indian bank, the Punjab National Bank to establish a strategic alliance and for it to take a 30% share in MetLife India.[132] The state owned bank would in return sell MetLife insurance products in its branches
As of 2015, Julio Garcia-Villalon leads the Middle East & Africa regional business, which is headquartered in the Dubai International Financial Centre and has operated in the region since the 1950s.[133]
MetLife Foundation[edit]
MetLife Foundation is MetLife's independent charitable and grant-awarding foundation. It was founded in 1976[134] and had provided over $650 million in grants by January 2015.[134] The foundation has partnered with and donated to a variety of organizations, including Habitat for Humanity since 2010[135] and the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial Project Foundation since 2008.[136][137] In 2013, the MetLife Foundation announced a new focus on financial inclusion,[138] including educational programs on basic financial planning for disadvantaged children[139][140] and financial services aimed at low-income communities.[140][141][142]
Relationship with Peanuts[edit]
MetLife's use of comic strip characters, according to chief marketing officer Esther Lee, was intended "to make our company more friendly and approachable during a time when insurance companies were seen as cold and distant."[143]
MetLife licensed Snoopy and other Peanuts characters for promotional purposes from the Iconix Brand Group, which owns the promotional rights to the works of Charles M. Schulz. In 2010, Iconix formed a joint venture with Schulz’s heirs, buying out E. W. Scripps Co. and United Features Syndicate for $175 million. MetLife is reported to pay $12 million per year to Iconix for licensing rights.[144] Prior to the Iconix deal, MetLife had licensed the characters from other rights-holders.
The Peanuts-based campaign was developed by the advertising agency Young & Rubicam. MetLife also has used Foote Cone & Belding to develop Peanuts-related promotions.[145][146]
MetLife announced the end of its 31-year relationship with Peanuts on October 20, 2016. This decision resulted from the company's sale of its life insurance business to concentrate on corporate clients.[143] MetLife's new blue and green logo was criticized for being a knock-off of comparison website Diffen.[147][148]
Blimp and sports sponsorship[edit]




The Metlife 'Snoopy Two' blimp.


The MetLife blimp program began in 1987 with the “Snoopy 1” airship and, in 1994, expanded to include the “Snoopy 2” airship.[149] The program provides aerial coverage to over 80 major sporting events every year and is currently the official aerial coverage provider of the PGA Tour.[150] “Snoopy 1” and “Snoopy 2” also provide overhead television coverage for the NFL, CBS College Football, the LPGA, the NBA Finals, Copa Chile, the Preakness Stakes, and the Kentucky Derby.[150][151][152][153] On August 23, 2011, MetLife agreed to a 25-year sponsorship deal to rename New Meadowlands Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, home of the NFL's New York Giants and New York Jets to MetLife Stadium.[154]
MetLife and the “Ideal weight”[edit]
In 1959, The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (as it was known at the time) released tables of the best weight for each height for longevity, based on their collected insurance data. These tables showed the “desirable weights”. In 1983, they released tables showing the “ideal” weights for greatest longevity; this information was based on data collected in the Build Study of 1979 collected by the Society of Actuaries. This data followed patients for 18 years (from 1954-1972) and was collected from 25 life insurance companies in Canada and the United States, representing 4.2 million people. These “ideal” weights were higher than the prior “desirable” weights, this was attributed to an increase in muscle mass due to improved fitness levels among the population. This study is still the largest available pool of data for this purpose. It was noticed that the average weights in the population are higher than the ideal weights for survival. The ‘’’Metropolitan Tables’’’ included ‘’small’’, ‘’medium’’ and ‘’large’’ frames, based on elbow-girth measured using calipers, as the elbows do not develop adipose tissue. They presented weight ranges for height, sex and body frame (again associated with the lowest mortality) The mid-point of the ideal weight for the medium frames for each height was selected as the “ideal” weight used for calculations of “excess weight” (initial weight-ideal weight). This led to a formula to calculate the ideal weight used by bariatric surgeons, but it had lost considerable accuracy by 2007, again due to improvements in medical care and in public health.[155]

MetLife, Inc. is the holding corporation for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MLIC),[4] better known as MetLife, and its affiliates. MetLife is among the largest global providers of insurance, annuities, and employee benefit programs, with 90 million customers in over 60 countries.[3][5] The firm was founded on March 24, 1868.[6]
On January 6, 1915, MetLife completed the mutualization process, changing from a stock life insurance company owned by individuals to a mutual company operating without external shareholders and for the benefit of policyholders.[7] The company went public in 2000.[8] Through its subsidiaries and affiliates, MetLife holds leading market positions in the United States, Japan, Latin America, Asia’s Pacific region, Europe, and the Middle East.[9] MetLife serves 90 of the largest Fortune 500 companies.[10] The company’s principal offices are located at 200 Park Avenue, New York City in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, though it retains some executive offices and its boardroom in the MetLife Building, located at 200 Park Avenue, New York City, which it sold in 2005.[11]
In January 2016, the company announced that it would spin off U.S. Retail business, including individual life insurance and annuities for the retail market, in a separate company called Brighthouse Financial.[12] They will maintain the MetLife name on MetLife Stadium.[13] On March 6, 2017, the separated U.S. Retail business launched Brighthouse Financial – an independent company focused on life insurance and annuities.

History[edit]
Early years[edit]




Home office of the New England Mutual Life Insurance Co. one of the predecessor companies of MetLife. see [30]


The predecessor company to MetLife began in 1863 when a group of New York City businessmen raised $100,000 to found the National Union Life and Limb Insurance Company. The company insured Civil War sailors and soldiers against disabilities due to wartime wounds, accidents, and sickness. On March 24, 1868, it became known as Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and shifted its focus to the life insurance business.[31][32]




The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower, which previously served as company headquarters, was featured in its advertising for many years.


A severe business depression that began with the Panic of 1873 forced the company to contract, until it reached its lowest point in the late 1870s. After observing the insurance industry in Great Britain in 1879, MetLife President Joseph F. Knapp brought “industrial” or “workingmen’s” insurance programs to the United States – insurance issued in small amounts on which premiums were collected weekly or monthly at the policyholder’s home. By 1880, sales had exceeded a quarter million of such policies, resulting in nearly $1 million in revenue from premiums. In 1909, MetLife had become the nation’s largest life insurer in the United States, as measured by life insurance in force (the total value of life insurance policies issued).[31][33]
In 1907, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower was commissioned to serve as MetLife’s 23rd Street headquarters in Lower Manhattan. Completed two years later, the building was the world's tallest until 1913 and remained the company's headquarters until 2005. For many years, an illustration of the building (with light emanating from the tip of its spire and the slogan, "The Light That Never Fails") featured prominently in MetLife’s advertising.[34] By 1930, MetLife insured every fifth man, woman, and child in the United States and Canada.[35] During the 1930s, it also began to diversify its portfolio by reducing the percentage of individual mortgages in favor of public utility bonds, investments in government securities, and loans for commercial real estate.[35] The company financed the construction of the Empire State Building in 1929 as well as provided capital to build Rockefeller Center in 1931. During World War II, MetLife placed more than 51 percent of its total assets in war bonds, and was the largest single private contributor to the Allied cause.[35]
Postwar[edit]

During the postwar era, the company expanded its suburban presence, decentralized operations, and refocused its career agency system to serve all market segments. It also began to market group insurance products to employers and institutions. By 1979, operations were segmented into four primary businesses: group insurance, personal insurance, pensions, and investments.[35] In 1981, MetLife purchased what became known as the MetLife building for $400 million from a group that included Pan American World Airways.[36][37]

De-mutualization and IPO[edit]
In 2000, MetLife converted from a mutual insurance company operated for the benefit of its policyholders to a for-profit public company. The de-mutualization process allowed MetLife to enter unrelated insurance businesses and increase executive compensation.
Policyholders received some stock in the new company in this process.[38] MetLife was accused of breaching federal securities laws by misrepresenting and omitting information in materials given to policyholders during this process, resulting in years of litigation ending with a $50 million settlement in 2009.[39]
Acquisitions, sales, and major deals[edit]

1992 - merged with United Mutual Life Insurance Company, the only African-American life insurer in New York, in 1992.[40]
1992 - [41] acquired Executive Life's single premium deferred annuity business, which was worth approximately $1.2 billion. MetLife also acquired the firm's life insurance business, valued at about $260 million.[42]
1995 - purchased New England Mutual Life Insurance Company.[43]
1997 - acquired Security First Group in 1997 for $377 million.[44][45]
1999 - acquired Lincoln National Corporation's individual disability income unit.[46]
1999 - bought out reinsurance provider GenAmerica Corporation for $1.2 billion, as well as its subsidiaries, Reinsurance Group of America and Conning Corporation.[47][48] That year, the company had grown to serve 7 million policyholders.[49]
2000 - de-mutualization and IPO.[50][51] The initial public offering was valued at $6.5 billion, which was the largest IPO to that date in United States financial history.[50][51] MetLife policyholders were asked to choose a cash or stock stake. This IPO made MetLife the most widely owned stock in the United States, and it raised MetLife's value to over $4 billion.[52][53] By 2000, MetLife's reported number of policyholders had risen to 11 million,[53] and that year it had become the United States' number one life insurer, surpassing Prudential, according to The New York Times.[54]
2000 - $470 million voice and data network management deal with AT&T Solutions.[55]
2001 - acquired Grand Bank of Kingston, New Jersey, which was renamed MetLife Bank.[56][57]
2001 - invested $1 billion in the United States stock market during 2001, immediately after the September 11th terrorist attacks.[58]
2005 - acquired Citigroup’s Travelers Life & Annuity and all of Citigroup’s international insurance businesses for $11.8 billion.[59][60] At the time of the deal, which was completed on July 1, 2005, the Travelers acquisition made MetLife the largest individual life insurer in North America based on sales.[61]
2006 - opened joint-venture insurance company in Shanghai, in May 2006.[62][63]
2006 - sold Peter Cooper Village, or Stuyvesant Town, the largest apartment complexes in New York City at the time, for $5.4 billion.[64][65] MetLife had developed the apartment complexes between 1945 and 1947, to house veterans returning home from serving in World War II.[66]
2010 - bought American Life Insurance Company from AIG for US$15,500,000,000.[59]
2011 - sold MetLife bank to GE Capital, exiting banking business.[67]

Current era[edit]
From 2004 to 2011, MetLife continued to hold its position as the largest life insurer in the United States.[16][68] The company had $2.5 trillion in policies written, $350 billion in assets under management, over 12 million customers in the United States, 8 million customers outside the United States, and a net income in 2003 of $2.2 billion.[68] That year, Barron's reported that 13 million American households owned at least one product from MetLife.[69]
MetLife named Robert H. Benmosche as chairman and CEO in July 1999. Benmosche occupied the position until 2006, when he was replaced by C. Robert Henrikson.[16][70][71]
The company's sales grew 11.5% between 2008 and 2009, despite the national recession.[72] In 2011, CEO Robert Henrikson was replaced by Steven A. Kandarian, who had overseen the company's "US$450,000,000,000 investment portfolio" as chief investment officer.[16] Henrikson remained the company's chairman to the end of 2011, at which point he reached the company's mandatory retirement age.[16]
In 2015, MetLife was ranked as number one on Fortune magazine's list of World's Most Admired Companies in the Insurance: Life and Health category.[73]
In the summer of 2017, MetLife plans to add a third office building of 255,000 square feet at its Cary, North Carolina Global Technology Campus, giving the company a total of 655,000 square feet at a location which has over 1,000 employees in such areas as engineering, software and technology. This plan was the result of North Carolina awarding the company $94 million in incentives in 2013 for creating over 2,600 jobs, half in Cary and half in Charlotte.[74]
"Too big to fail"[edit]
In 2012, MetLife failed the Federal Reserve’s (the Fed's) Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review stress test, intended to predict the potential failure of the company in a recession. The Fed stated that the minimum total risk-based capital ratio should be 8% and it estimated MetLife's ratio at 6%. The company had requested approval for a US$2,000,000,000 share repurchase to prop up the stock price, along with an increased dividend.[75] Because MetLife owned MetLife Bank, it was subject to stricter financial regulation. To escape that level of regulation, MetLife announced the sale of its banking unit to GE Capital.[76][77] On November 2, 2012, MetLife said it was selling its US$70,000,000,000 mortgage servicing business to JPMorgan Chase for an undisclosed amount.[78] Both sales were part of its strategy to focus on the insurance side of its business.
The attempt to escape "too big to fail" regulation was not successful. In September 2014, the United States government observed the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law by proposing the application of an official label to MetLife as "systemically important" to the American economy.[79] If implemented, MetLife would be subject to different sets of rules and regulations, with increased oversight from the Federal Reserve.[79][80] The company appealed this proposal in November 2014.[81] In December 2014, federal regulators decided that MetLife required the special regulations reserved for financial companies and organizations deemed "systemically important," or "too big to fail".[82] MetLife announced in January 2015 that it would file a lawsuit against the District of Columbia to overturn the federal regulators' decision,[79] thus becoming the first nonbank to challenge such a decision.[83] Three other nonbank companies have been designated as "systemically important": AIG, General Electric and Prudential.[82][83] MetLife continued to litigate this issue as of mid-2015, with the US Department of Justice asking that their challenge be dismissed.[83]
Fines[edit]
On August 7, 2012, it was announced that MetLife will pay $3.2 million in fines after the Federal Reserve charged it used unsafe and unsound practices in handling its mortgage servicing and foreclosure operations.[84]
In 2014, MetLife paid $23 million to settle multiple lawsuits over junk fax operations used to generate leads for life insurance sales.[85]


"MetLife Bank took advantage of the FHA insurance program by knowingly turning a blind eye to mortgage loans that did not meet basic underwriting requirements, and stuck the FHA and taxpayers with the bill when those mortgages defaulted."

U.S. Attorney John Walsh
In 2015, MetLife Home Loans LLC paid $123.5 million to the United States Department of Justice to resolve allegations it knowingly made mortgages insured by the United States government that didn’t meet federal underwriting requirements.[86]

MetLife Hall of Records, Yonkers, New York.


As of 2010[update], MetLife had a "diverse product mix" which included insurance (home, car and life), variable life annuities and structured settlements, commercial mortgages and securities backed by commercial mortgages, and sovereign debt.[15]
Life insurance[edit]
MetLife’s individual life insurance products and services comprise term life insurance and several types of permanent life insurance, including whole life, universal life, and final expense whole life insurance.[87][88] These services vary in regards to the duration and amount of coverage available and whether a medical exam is required for coverage. The company also offers group life insurance, provided through employers, which consists of term life, permanent life, and accidental death and dismemberment coverage.[89][90] MetLife is the largest life insurer in the United States, based on life insurance in-force.[10][15]
Dental[edit]
MetLife offers group dental benefit plans for individuals, employees, retirees and their families and provides dental plan administration for over 20 million people.[91][92] Plans include MetLife’s Preferred Dentist Program (PPO) and the SafeGuard DHMO (available for both individuals and employees in CA, FL, TX, NJ and NY.). As of May 2010, MetLife’s dental PPO network included over 135,000 participating dentist locations nationwide while the dental HMO network included more than 13,000 participating dentist locations in California, Florida and Texas.[93] MetLife also administers dental continuing education program for dentists and allied health care professionals, which are recognized by the American Dental Association (ADA) and the Academy of General Dentistry (AGD).[94]
Disability[edit]
MetLife provides disability products for individuals as well as employee and association groups who receive them through their employer.[14][95] For individuals, the company’s individual disability income insurance can replace a portion of lost income if an individual is unable to work due to sickness or injury.[96] MetLife offers several individual disability income policies, including MetLife Income Guard, OMNI Advantage, OMNI Essential, Business Overhead Expense, and Buy-Sell.[97] The policy options provided by the company vary in terms of eligibility and the provided coverage. For groups, MetLife offers short term disability insurance and long term disability insurance.[98] Short term disability insurance is structured to replace a portion of an individual’s income during the initial weeks of a disabling illness or accident.[99] Long term disability Insurance serves to replace a portion of an individual’s income during an extended period of a disabling illness or accident.[100][101] The company also maintains an absence management product which allows employers to track and manage both planned and unplanned employee absences. The product, which MetLife calls MetLife Total Absence Management, is structured for businesses with 1,000 or more employees.[102]
Annuities[edit]
MetLife is among the largest providers of annuities in the world, recording $22.4 billion in sales during 2009.[103] MetLife offers annuities which consist of fixed annuities, variable annuities, deferred annuities and immediate annuities.[104] In 1921, MetLife was the first company to issue a group annuity contract.[105] More recently in 2004, it was the first insurer to introduce a longevity insurance product.[106] As of December 31, 2009, MetLife globally managed group annuity assets of $60 billion with $34 billion of transferred pension liabilities and provided benefit payments to over 600,000 annuitants per month.[107]
Auto & Home[edit]
MetLife Auto & Home is the brand name for MetLife’s nine affiliate personal lines insurance companies.[108] Collectively these companies offer personal lines property and casualty insurance policies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.[109] The flagship company in the MetLife Auto & Home group, Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company, was founded in 1972.[108] MetLife Auto & Home companies presently have over 2.7 million active policies and service 58 of the Fortune 100 companies.[110][111]
MetLife's home insurance solutions include homeowners insurance, condo insurance, renters insurance, insurance for landlords, and mobile home insurance.[112][113] The available policies for MetLife's home insurance provide coverage for possessions, property damage from natural disaster or theft, and various legal expenses incurred resulting from injuries sustained on an individual's property.[114] The companies also sell RV, ATV, boat, mobile home, collectible vehicle, and motorcycle policies[115] and offers flood insurance policies as a participant in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is managed by the federal government.[116][117] MetLife's various types of coverage for auto insurance include liability protection, collision and comprehensive coverage, personal injury protection, rental car coverage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists coverage.[118][119] Through an arrangement with Hyatt Legal Plans, a subsidiary of MetLife, MetLife Auto & Home underwrites group legal plans in many states.[18]
It was the first national insurer in the United States to offer identity-theft resolution services at no extra premium and as of 2012 continues to do so today in most United States states.[120][121] In 2010, MetLife Auto & Home began offering their GrandProtect plan in most states. This GrandProtect policy simplifies complex insurance needs by combining a client's home, valuable items, autos, RVs, and boats into one comprehensive policy package. The ultimate benefits to the consumer are having one bill, only one deductible, comprehensive coverage, and typically lower rates than trying to get each policy individually.[122]
Other products[edit]
MetLife’s products also include critical illness insurance.[123] Financial services include fee-based financial planning, retirement planning, wealth management, 529 Plans, banking, and commercial and residential mortgages.[124] The company also provides retirement plan and other financial services to healthcare, education, and not-for-profit organizations.[125] The MetLife Center for Special Needs Planning is a group of planners which serve families and individuals with special needs.[126] In 2014, MetLife launched MetLife Defender, a digital identity theft protection product.[127]
International presence[edit]
Outside of the United States, MetLife operates in Latin America, Europe, Asia’s Pacific region, and the Middle East, with leading market positions in Mexico, Japan, South Korea and Chile.[9]
On March 8, 2010, MetLife announced its intent to purchase the international leader life-insurance business, American Life Insurance Company (Alico), from American International Group (AIG). MetLife, which completed the deal on November 1, 2010, paid approximately $7.2 billion in cash and $9.0 billion in MetLife equity and other securities.[128][129] The securities portion of the deal consisted of 78.2 million shares of MetLife common stock, 6.9 million shares of contingent convertible preferred stock and 40 million equity units.[130] The values of the common and preferred stock were based on the closing price of MetLife’s common stock on October 29.[130] Upon completion of the purchase, MetLife became a leading competitor in Japan, the world’s second-largest life insurance market, and moved into a top 5 market position in many high growth emerging markets in Central and Eastern Europe, such as Romania, the Middle East and Latin America.[131] The deal added 20 million customers to MetLife’s 70 million and according to Barron's more than doubled the percentage of operating profits that MetLife gets abroad to 40%.[15]
In India MetLife has an affiliate company India Insurance Company Limited (MetLife) which has operated in India since 2001. This company has its headquarters in Bangalore and Gurgaon and was jointly owned by MetLife and a few local Indian financial companies. In 2012 an agreement was made with local Indian bank, the Punjab National Bank to establish a strategic alliance and for it to take a 30% share in MetLife India.[132] The state owned bank would in return sell MetLife insurance products in its branches
As of 2015, Julio Garcia-Villalon leads the Middle East & Africa regional business, which is headquartered in the Dubai International Financial Centre and has operated in the region since the 1950s.[133]
MetLife Foundation[edit]
MetLife Foundation is MetLife's independent charitable and grant-awarding foundation. It was founded in 1976[134] and had provided over $650 million in grants by January 2015.[134] The foundation has partnered with and donated to a variety of organizations, including Habitat for Humanity since 2010[135] and the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial Project Foundation since 2008.[136][137] In 2013, the MetLife Foundation announced a new focus on financial inclusion,[138] including educational programs on basic financial planning for disadvantaged children[139][140] and financial services aimed at low-income communities.[140][141][142]
Relationship with Peanuts[edit]
MetLife's use of comic strip characters, according to chief marketing officer Esther Lee, was intended "to make our company more friendly and approachable during a time when insurance companies were seen as cold and distant."[143]
MetLife licensed Snoopy and other Peanuts characters for promotional purposes from the Iconix Brand Group, which owns the promotional rights to the works of Charles M. Schulz. In 2010, Iconix formed a joint venture with Schulz’s heirs, buying out E. W. Scripps Co. and United Features Syndicate for $175 million. MetLife is reported to pay $12 million per year to Iconix for licensing rights.[144] Prior to the Iconix deal, MetLife had licensed the characters from other rights-holders.
The Peanuts-based campaign was developed by the advertising agency Young & Rubicam. MetLife also has used Foote Cone & Belding to develop Peanuts-related promotions.[145][146]
MetLife announced the end of its 31-year relationship with Peanuts on October 20, 2016. This decision resulted from the company's sale of its life insurance business to concentrate on corporate clients.[143] MetLife's new blue and green logo was criticized for being a knock-off of comparison website Diffen.[147][148]
Blimp and sports sponsorship[edit]




The Metlife 'Snoopy Two' blimp.


The MetLife blimp program began in 1987 with the “Snoopy 1” airship and, in 1994, expanded to include the “Snoopy 2” airship.[149] The program provides aerial coverage to over 80 major sporting events every year and is currently the official aerial coverage provider of the PGA Tour.[150] “Snoopy 1” and “Snoopy 2” also provide overhead television coverage for the NFL, CBS College Football, the LPGA, the NBA Finals, Copa Chile, the Preakness Stakes, and the Kentucky Derby.[150][151][152][153] On August 23, 2011, MetLife agreed to a 25-year sponsorship deal to rename New Meadowlands Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, home of the NFL's New York Giants and New York Jets to MetLife Stadium.[154]
MetLife and the “Ideal weight”[edit]
In 1959, The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (as it was known at the time) released tables of the best weight for each height for longevity, based on their collected insurance data. These tables showed the “desirable weights”. In 1983, they released tables showing the “ideal” weights for greatest longevity; this information was based on data collected in the Build Study of 1979 collected by the Society of Actuaries. This data followed patients for 18 years (from 1954-1972) and was collected from 25 life insurance companies in Canada and the United States, representing 4.2 million people. These “ideal” weights were higher than the prior “desirable” weights, this was attributed to an increase in muscle mass due to improved fitness levels among the population. This study is still the largest available pool of data for this purpose. It was noticed that the average weights in the population are higher than the ideal weights for survival. The ‘’’Metropolitan Tables’’’ included ‘’small’’, ‘’medium’’ and ‘’large’’ frames, based on elbow-girth measured using calipers, as the elbows do not develop adipose tissue. They presented weight ranges for height, sex and body frame (again associated with the lowest mortality) The mid-point of the ideal weight for the medium frames for each height was selected as the “ideal” weight used for calculations of “excess weight” (initial weight-ideal weight). This led to a formula to calculate the ideal weight used by bariatric surgeons, but it had lost considerable accuracy by 2007, again due to improvements in medical care and in public health.[155]

MetLife, Inc. is the holding corporation for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MLIC),[4] better known as MetLife, and its affiliates. MetLife is among the largest global providers of insurance, annuities, and employee benefit programs, with 90 million customers in over 60 countries.[3][5] The firm was founded on March 24, 1868.[6]
On January 6, 1915, MetLife completed the mutualization process, changing from a stock life insurance company owned by individuals to a mutual company operating without external shareholders and for the benefit of policyholders.[7] The company went public in 2000.[8] Through its subsidiaries and affiliates, MetLife holds leading market positions in the United States, Japan, Latin America, Asia’s Pacific region, Europe, and the Middle East.[9] MetLife serves 90 of the largest Fortune 500 companies.[10] The company’s principal offices are located at 200 Park Avenue, New York City in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, though it retains some executive offices and its boardroom in the MetLife Building, located at 200 Park Avenue, New York City, which it sold in 2005.[11]
In January 2016, the company announced that it would spin off U.S. Retail business, including individual life insurance and annuities for the retail market, in a separate company called Brighthouse Financial.[12] They will maintain the MetLife name on MetLife Stadium.[13] On March 6, 2017, the separated U.S. Retail business launched Brighthouse Financial – an independent company focused on life insurance and annuities.

History[edit]
Early years[edit]




Home office of the New England Mutual Life Insurance Co. one of the predecessor companies of MetLife. see [30]


The predecessor company to MetLife began in 1863 when a group of New York City businessmen raised $100,000 to found the National Union Life and Limb Insurance Company. The company insured Civil War sailors and soldiers against disabilities due to wartime wounds, accidents, and sickness. On March 24, 1868, it became known as Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and shifted its focus to the life insurance business.[31][32]




The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower, which previously served as company headquarters, was featured in its advertising for many years.


A severe business depression that began with the Panic of 1873 forced the company to contract, until it reached its lowest point in the late 1870s. After observing the insurance industry in Great Britain in 1879, MetLife President Joseph F. Knapp brought “industrial” or “workingmen’s” insurance programs to the United States – insurance issued in small amounts on which premiums were collected weekly or monthly at the policyholder’s home. By 1880, sales had exceeded a quarter million of such policies, resulting in nearly $1 million in revenue from premiums. In 1909, MetLife had become the nation’s largest life insurer in the United States, as measured by life insurance in force (the total value of life insurance policies issued).[31][33]
In 1907, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower was commissioned to serve as MetLife’s 23rd Street headquarters in Lower Manhattan. Completed two years later, the building was the world's tallest until 1913 and remained the company's headquarters until 2005. For many years, an illustration of the building (with light emanating from the tip of its spire and the slogan, "The Light That Never Fails") featured prominently in MetLife’s advertising.[34] By 1930, MetLife insured every fifth man, woman, and child in the United States and Canada.[35] During the 1930s, it also began to diversify its portfolio by reducing the percentage of individual mortgages in favor of public utility bonds, investments in government securities, and loans for commercial real estate.[35] The company financed the construction of the Empire State Building in 1929 as well as provided capital to build Rockefeller Center in 1931. During World War II, MetLife placed more than 51 percent of its total assets in war bonds, and was the largest single private contributor to the Allied cause.[35]
Postwar[edit]

During the postwar era, the company expanded its suburban presence, decentralized operations, and refocused its career agency system to serve all market segments. It also began to market group insurance products to employers and institutions. By 1979, operations were segmented into four primary businesses: group insurance, personal insurance, pensions, and investments.[35] In 1981, MetLife purchased what became known as the MetLife building for $400 million from a group that included Pan American World Airways.[36][37]

De-mutualization and IPO[edit]
In 2000, MetLife converted from a mutual insurance company operated for the benefit of its policyholders to a for-profit public company. The de-mutualization process allowed MetLife to enter unrelated insurance businesses and increase executive compensation.
Policyholders received some stock in the new company in this process.[38] MetLife was accused of breaching federal securities laws by misrepresenting and omitting information in materials given to policyholders during this process, resulting in years of litigation ending with a $50 million settlement in 2009.[39]
Acquisitions, sales, and major deals[edit]

1992 - merged with United Mutual Life Insurance Company, the only African-American life insurer in New York, in 1992.[40]
1992 - [41] acquired Executive Life's single premium deferred annuity business, which was worth approximately $1.2 billion. MetLife also acquired the firm's life insurance business, valued at about $260 million.[42]
1995 - purchased New England Mutual Life Insurance Company.[43]
1997 - acquired Security First Group in 1997 for $377 million.[44][45]
1999 - acquired Lincoln National Corporation's individual disability income unit.[46]
1999 - bought out reinsurance provider GenAmerica Corporation for $1.2 billion, as well as its subsidiaries, Reinsurance Group of America and Conning Corporation.[47][48] That year, the company had grown to serve 7 million policyholders.[49]
2000 - de-mutualization and IPO.[50][51] The initial public offering was valued at $6.5 billion, which was the largest IPO to that date in United States financial history.[50][51] MetLife policyholders were asked to choose a cash or stock stake. This IPO made MetLife the most widely owned stock in the United States, and it raised MetLife's value to over $4 billion.[52][53] By 2000, MetLife's reported number of policyholders had risen to 11 million,[53] and that year it had become the United States' number one life insurer, surpassing Prudential, according to The New York Times.[54]
2000 - $470 million voice and data network management deal with AT&T Solutions.[55]
2001 - acquired Grand Bank of Kingston, New Jersey, which was renamed MetLife Bank.[56][57]
2001 - invested $1 billion in the United States stock market during 2001, immediately after the September 11th terrorist attacks.[58]
2005 - acquired Citigroup’s Travelers Life & Annuity and all of Citigroup’s international insurance businesses for $11.8 billion.[59][60] At the time of the deal, which was completed on July 1, 2005, the Travelers acquisition made MetLife the largest individual life insurer in North America based on sales.[61]
2006 - opened joint-venture insurance company in Shanghai, in May 2006.[62][63]
2006 - sold Peter Cooper Village, or Stuyvesant Town, the largest apartment complexes in New York City at the time, for $5.4 billion.[64][65] MetLife had developed the apartment complexes between 1945 and 1947, to house veterans returning home from serving in World War II.[66]
2010 - bought American Life Insurance Company from AIG for US$15,500,000,000.[59]
2011 - sold MetLife bank to GE Capital, exiting banking business.[67]

Current era[edit]
From 2004 to 2011, MetLife continued to hold its position as the largest life insurer in the United States.[16][68] The company had $2.5 trillion in policies written, $350 billion in assets under management, over 12 million customers in the United States, 8 million customers outside the United States, and a net income in 2003 of $2.2 billion.[68] That year, Barron's reported that 13 million American households owned at least one product from MetLife.[69]
MetLife named Robert H. Benmosche as chairman and CEO in July 1999. Benmosche occupied the position until 2006, when he was replaced by C. Robert Henrikson.[16][70][71]
The company's sales grew 11.5% between 2008 and 2009, despite the national recession.[72] In 2011, CEO Robert Henrikson was replaced by Steven A. Kandarian, who had overseen the company's "US$450,000,000,000 investment portfolio" as chief investment officer.[16] Henrikson remained the company's chairman to the end of 2011, at which point he reached the company's mandatory retirement age.[16]
In 2015, MetLife was ranked as number one on Fortune magazine's list of World's Most Admired Companies in the Insurance: Life and Health category.[73]
In the summer of 2017, MetLife plans to add a third office building of 255,000 square feet at its Cary, North Carolina Global Technology Campus, giving the company a total of 655,000 square feet at a location which has over 1,000 employees in such areas as engineering, software and technology. This plan was the result of North Carolina awarding the company $94 million in incentives in 2013 for creating over 2,600 jobs, half in Cary and half in Charlotte.[74]
"Too big to fail"[edit]
In 2012, MetLife failed the Federal Reserve’s (the Fed's) Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review stress test, intended to predict the potential failure of the company in a recession. The Fed stated that the minimum total risk-based capital ratio should be 8% and it estimated MetLife's ratio at 6%. The company had requested approval for a US$2,000,000,000 share repurchase to prop up the stock price, along with an increased dividend.[75] Because MetLife owned MetLife Bank, it was subject to stricter financial regulation. To escape that level of regulation, MetLife announced the sale of its banking unit to GE Capital.[76][77] On November 2, 2012, MetLife said it was selling its US$70,000,000,000 mortgage servicing business to JPMorgan Chase for an undisclosed amount.[78] Both sales were part of its strategy to focus on the insurance side of its business.
The attempt to escape "too big to fail" regulation was not successful. In September 2014, the United States government observed the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law by proposing the application of an official label to MetLife as "systemically important" to the American economy.[79] If implemented, MetLife would be subject to different sets of rules and regulations, with increased oversight from the Federal Reserve.[79][80] The company appealed this proposal in November 2014.[81] In December 2014, federal regulators decided that MetLife required the special regulations reserved for financial companies and organizations deemed "systemically important," or "too big to fail".[82] MetLife announced in January 2015 that it would file a lawsuit against the District of Columbia to overturn the federal regulators' decision,[79] thus becoming the first nonbank to challenge such a decision.[83] Three other nonbank companies have been designated as "systemically important": AIG, General Electric and Prudential.[82][83] MetLife continued to litigate this issue as of mid-2015, with the US Department of Justice asking that their challenge be dismissed.[83]
Fines[edit]
On August 7, 2012, it was announced that MetLife will pay $3.2 million in fines after the Federal Reserve charged it used unsafe and unsound practices in handling its mortgage servicing and foreclosure operations.[84]
In 2014, MetLife paid $23 million to settle multiple lawsuits over junk fax operations used to generate leads for life insurance sales.[85]


"MetLife Bank took advantage of the FHA insurance program by knowingly turning a blind eye to mortgage loans that did not meet basic underwriting requirements, and stuck the FHA and taxpayers with the bill when those mortgages defaulted."

U.S. Attorney John Walsh
In 2015, MetLife Home Loans LLC paid $123.5 million to the United States Department of Justice to resolve allegations it knowingly made mortgages insured by the United States government that didn’t meet federal underwriting requirements.[86]

As of 2010[update], MetLife had a "diverse product mix" which included insurance (home, car and life), variable life annuities and structured settlements, commercial mortgages and securities backed by commercial mortgages, and sovereign debt.[15]
Life insurance[edit]
MetLife’s individual life insurance products and services comprise term life insurance and several types of permanent life insurance, including whole life, universal life, and final expense whole life insurance.[87][88] These services vary in regards to the duration and amount of coverage available and whether a medical exam is required for coverage. The company also offers group life insurance, provided through employers, which consists of term life, permanent life, and accidental death and dismemberment coverage.[89][90] MetLife is the largest life insurer in the United States, based on life insurance in-force.[10][15]
Dental[edit]
MetLife offers group dental benefit plans for individuals, employees, retirees and their families and provides dental plan administration for over 20 million people.[91][92] Plans include MetLife’s Preferred Dentist Program (PPO) and the SafeGuard DHMO (available for both individuals and employees in CA, FL, TX, NJ and NY.). As of May 2010, MetLife’s dental PPO network included over 135,000 participating dentist locations nationwide while the dental HMO network included more than 13,000 participating dentist locations in California, Florida and Texas.[93] MetLife also administers dental continuing education program for dentists and allied health care professionals, which are recognized by the American Dental Association (ADA) and the Academy of General Dentistry (AGD).[94]
Disability[edit]
MetLife provides disability products for individuals as well as employee and association groups who receive them through their employer.[14][95] For individuals, the company’s individual disability income insurance can replace a portion of lost income if an individual is unable to work due to sickness or injury.[96] MetLife offers several individual disability income policies, including MetLife Income Guard, OMNI Advantage, OMNI Essential, Business Overhead Expense, and Buy-Sell.[97] The policy options provided by the company vary in terms of eligibility and the provided coverage. For groups, MetLife offers short term disability insurance and long term disability insurance.[98] Short term disability insurance is structured to replace a portion of an individual’s income during the initial weeks of a disabling illness or accident.[99] Long term disability Insurance serves to replace a portion of an individual’s income during an extended period of a disabling illness or accident.[100][101] The company also maintains an absence management product which allows employers to track and manage both planned and unplanned employee absences. The product, which MetLife calls MetLife Total Absence Management, is structured for businesses with 1,000 or more employees.[102]
Annuities[edit]
MetLife is among the largest providers of annuities in the world, recording $22.4 billion in sales during 2009.[103] MetLife offers annuities which consist of fixed annuities, variable annuities, deferred annuities and immediate annuities.[104] In 1921, MetLife was the first company to issue a group annuity contract.[105] More recently in 2004, it was the first insurer to introduce a longevity insurance product.[106] As of December 31, 2009, MetLife globally managed group annuity assets of $60 billion with $34 billion of transferred pension liabilities and provided benefit payments to over 600,000 annuitants per month.[107]
Auto & Home[edit]
MetLife Auto & Home is the brand name for MetLife’s nine affiliate personal lines insurance companies.[108] Collectively these companies offer personal lines property and casualty insurance policies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.[109] The flagship company in the MetLife Auto & Home group, Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company, was founded in 1972.[108] MetLife Auto & Home companies presently have over 2.7 million active policies and service 58 of the Fortune 100 companies.[110][111]
MetLife's home insurance solutions include homeowners insurance, condo insurance, renters insurance, insurance for landlords, and mobile home insurance.[112][113] The available policies for MetLife's home insurance provide coverage for possessions, property damage from natural disaster or theft, and various legal expenses incurred resulting from injuries sustained on an individual's property.[114] The companies also sell RV, ATV, boat, mobile home, collectible vehicle, and motorcycle policies[115] and offers flood insurance policies as a participant in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is managed by the federal government.[116][117] MetLife's various types of coverage for auto insurance include liability protection, collision and comprehensive coverage, personal injury protection, rental car coverage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists coverage.[118][119] Through an arrangement with Hyatt Legal Plans, a subsidiary of MetLife, MetLife Auto & Home underwrites group legal plans in many states.[18]
It was the first national insurer in the United States to offer identity-theft resolution services at no extra premium and as of 2012 continues to do so today in most United States states.[120][121] In 2010, MetLife Auto & Home began offering their GrandProtect plan in most states. This GrandProtect policy simplifies complex insurance needs by combining a client's home, valuable items, autos, RVs, and boats into one comprehensive policy package. The ultimate benefits to the consumer are having one bill, only one deductible, comprehensive coverage, and typically lower rates than trying to get each policy individually.[122]
Other products[edit]
MetLife’s products also include critical illness insurance.[123] Financial services include fee-based financial planning, retirement planning, wealth management, 529 Plans, banking, and commercial and residential mortgages.[124] The company also provides retirement plan and other financial services to healthcare, education, and not-for-profit organizations.[125] The MetLife Center for Special Needs Planning is a group of planners which serve families and individuals with special needs.[126] In 2014, MetLife launched MetLife Defender, a digital identity theft protection product.[127]
International presence[edit]
Outside of the United States, MetLife operates in Latin America, Europe, Asia’s Pacific region, and the Middle East, with leading market positions in Mexico, Japan, South Korea and Chile.[9]
On March 8, 2010, MetLife announced its intent to purchase the international leader life-insurance business, American Life Insurance Company (Alico), from American International Group (AIG). MetLife, which completed the deal on November 1, 2010, paid approximately $7.2 billion in cash and $9.0 billion in MetLife equity and other securities.[128][129] The securities portion of the deal consisted of 78.2 million shares of MetLife common stock, 6.9 million shares of contingent convertible preferred stock and 40 million equity units.[130] The values of the common and preferred stock were based on the closing price of MetLife’s common stock on October 29.[130] Upon completion of the purchase, MetLife became a leading competitor in Japan, the world’s second-largest life insurance market, and moved into a top 5 market position in many high growth emerging markets in Central and Eastern Europe, such as Romania, the Middle East and Latin America.[131] The deal added 20 million customers to MetLife’s 70 million and according to Barron's more than doubled the percentage of operating profits that MetLife gets abroad to 40%.[15]
In India MetLife has an affiliate company India Insurance Company Limited (MetLife) which has operated in India since 2001. This company has its headquarters in Bangalore and Gurgaon and was jointly owned by MetLife and a few local Indian financial companies. In 2012 an agreement was made with local Indian bank, the Punjab National Bank to establish a strategic alliance and for it to take a 30% share in MetLife India.[132] The state owned bank would in return sell MetLife insurance products in its branches
As of 2015, Julio Garcia-Villalon leads the Middle East & Africa regional business, which is headquartered in the Dubai International Financial Centre and has operated in the region since the 1950s.[133]
MetLife Foundation[edit]
MetLife Foundation is MetLife's independent charitable and grant-awarding foundation. It was founded in 1976[134] and had provided over $650 million in grants by January 2015.[134] The foundation has partnered with and donated to a variety of organizations, including Habitat for Humanity since 2010[135] and the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial Project Foundation since 2008.[136][137] In 2013, the MetLife Foundation announced a new focus on financial inclusion,[138] including educational programs on basic financial planning for disadvantaged children[139][140] and financial services aimed at low-income communities.[140][141][142]
Relationship with Peanuts[edit]
MetLife's use of comic strip characters, according to chief marketing officer Esther Lee, was intended "to make our company more friendly and approachable during a time when insurance companies were seen as cold and distant."[143]
MetLife licensed Snoopy and other Peanuts characters for promotional purposes from the Iconix Brand Group, which owns the promotional rights to the works of Charles M. Schulz. In 2010, Iconix formed a joint venture with Schulz’s heirs, buying out E. W. Scripps Co. and United Features Syndicate for $175 million. MetLife is reported to pay $12 million per year to Iconix for licensing rights.[144] Prior to the Iconix deal, MetLife had licensed the characters from other rights-holders.
The Peanuts-based campaign was developed by the advertising agency Young & Rubicam. MetLife also has used Foote Cone & Belding to develop Peanuts-related promotions.[145][146]
MetLife announced the end of its 31-year relationship with Peanuts on October 20, 2016. This decision resulted from the company's sale of its life insurance business to concentrate on corporate clients.[143] MetLife's new blue and green logo was criticized for being a knock-off of comparison website Diffen.[147][148]
Blimp and sports sponsorship[edit]




The Metlife 'Snoopy Two' blimp.


The MetLife blimp program began in 1987 with the “Snoopy 1” airship and, in 1994, expanded to include the “Snoopy 2” airship.[149] The program provides aerial coverage to over 80 major sporting events every year and is currently the official aerial coverage provider of the PGA Tour.[150] “Snoopy 1” and “Snoopy 2” also provide overhead television coverage for the NFL, CBS College Football, the LPGA, the NBA Finals, Copa Chile, the Preakness Stakes, and the Kentucky Derby.[150][151][152][153] On August 23, 2011, MetLife agreed to a 25-year sponsorship deal to rename New Meadowlands Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, home of the NFL's New York Giants and New York Jets to MetLife Stadium.[154]
MetLife and the “Ideal weight”[edit]
In 1959, The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (as it was known at the time) released tables of the best weight for each height for longevity, based on their collected insurance data. These tables showed the “desirable weights”. In 1983, they released tables showing the “ideal” weights for greatest longevity; this information was based on data collected in the Build Study of 1979 collected by the Society of Actuaries. This data followed patients for 18 years (from 1954-1972) and was collected from 25 life insurance companies in Canada and the United States, representing 4.2 million people. These “ideal” weights were higher than the prior “desirable” weights, this was attributed to an increase in muscle mass due to improved fitness levels among the population. This study is still the largest available pool of data for this purpose. It was noticed that the average weights in the population are higher than the ideal weights for survival. The ‘’’Metropolitan Tables’’’ included ‘’small’’, ‘’medium’’ and ‘’large’’ frames, based on elbow-girth measured using calipers, as the elbows do not develop adipose tissue. They presented weight ranges for height, sex and body frame (again associated with the lowest mortality) The mid-point of the ideal weight for the medium frames for each height was selected as the “ideal” weight used for calculations of “excess weight” (initial weight-ideal weight). This led to a formula to calculate the ideal weight used by bariatric surgeons, but it had lost considerable accuracy by 2007, again due to improvements in medical care and in public health.[155]

MetLife, Inc. is the holding corporation for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MLIC),[4] better known as MetLife, and its affiliates. MetLife is among the largest global providers of insurance, annuities, and employee benefit programs, with 90 million customers in over 60 countries.[3][5] The firm was founded on March 24, 1868.[6]
On January 6, 1915, MetLife completed the mutualization process, changing from a stock life insurance company owned by individuals to a mutual company operating without external shareholders and for the benefit of policyholders.[7] The company went public in 2000.[8] Through its subsidiaries and affiliates, MetLife holds leading market positions in the United States, Japan, Latin America, Asia’s Pacific region, Europe, and the Middle East.[9] MetLife serves 90 of the largest Fortune 500 companies.[10] The company’s principal offices are located at 200 Park Avenue, New York City in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, though it retains some executive offices and its boardroom in the MetLife Building, located at 200 Park Avenue, New York City, which it sold in 2005.[11]
In January 2016, the company announced that it would spin off U.S. Retail business, including individual life insurance and annuities for the retail market, in a separate company called Brighthouse Financial.[12] They will maintain the MetLife name on MetLife Stadium.[13] On March 6, 2017, the separated U.S. Retail business launched Brighthouse Financial – an independent company focused on life insurance and annuities.

History[edit]
Early years[edit]




Home office of the New England Mutual Life Insurance Co. one of the predecessor companies of MetLife. see [30]


The predecessor company to MetLife began in 1863 when a group of New York City businessmen raised $100,000 to found the National Union Life and Limb Insurance Company. The company insured Civil War sailors and soldiers against disabilities due to wartime wounds, accidents, and sickness. On March 24, 1868, it became known as Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and shifted its focus to the life insurance business.[31][32]




The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower, which previously served as company headquarters, was featured in its advertising for many years.


A severe business depression that began with the Panic of 1873 forced the company to contract, until it reached its lowest point in the late 1870s. After observing the insurance industry in Great Britain in 1879, MetLife President Joseph F. Knapp brought “industrial” or “workingmen’s” insurance programs to the United States – insurance issued in small amounts on which premiums were collected weekly or monthly at the policyholder’s home. By 1880, sales had exceeded a quarter million of such policies, resulting in nearly $1 million in revenue from premiums. In 1909, MetLife had become the nation’s largest life insurer in the United States, as measured by life insurance in force (the total value of life insurance policies issued).[31][33]
In 1907, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower was commissioned to serve as MetLife’s 23rd Street headquarters in Lower Manhattan. Completed two years later, the building was the world's tallest until 1913 and remained the company's headquarters until 2005. For many years, an illustration of the building (with light emanating from the tip of its spire and the slogan, "The Light That Never Fails") featured prominently in MetLife’s advertising.[34] By 1930, MetLife insured every fifth man, woman, and child in the United States and Canada.[35] During the 1930s, it also began to diversify its portfolio by reducing the percentage of individual mortgages in favor of public utility bonds, investments in government securities, and loans for commercial real estate.[35] The company financed the construction of the Empire State Building in 1929 as well as provided capital to build Rockefeller Center in 1931. During World War II, MetLife placed more than 51 percent of its total assets in war bonds, and was the largest single private contributor to the Allied cause.[35]
Postwar[edit]

During the postwar era, the company expanded its suburban presence, decentralized operations, and refocused its career agency system to serve all market segments. It also began to market group insurance products to employers and institutions. By 1979, operations were segmented into four primary businesses: group insurance, personal insurance, pensions, and investments.[35] In 1981, MetLife purchased what became known as the MetLife building for $400 million from a group that included Pan American World Airways.[36][37]

De-mutualization and IPO[edit]
In 2000, MetLife converted from a mutual insurance company operated for the benefit of its policyholders to a for-profit public company. The de-mutualization process allowed MetLife to enter unrelated insurance businesses and increase executive compensation.
Policyholders received some stock in the new company in this process.[38] MetLife was accused of breaching federal securities laws by misrepresenting and omitting information in materials given to policyholders during this process, resulting in years of litigation ending with a $50 million settlement in 2009.[39]
Acquisitions, sales, and major deals[edit]

1992 - merged with United Mutual Life Insurance Company, the only African-American life insurer in New York, in 1992.[40]
1992 - [41] acquired Executive Life's single premium deferred annuity business, which was worth approximately $1.2 billion. MetLife also acquired the firm's life insurance business, valued at about $260 million.[42]
1995 - purchased New England Mutual Life Insurance Company.[43]
1997 - acquired Security First Group in 1997 for $377 million.[44][45]
1999 - acquired Lincoln National Corporation's individual disability income unit.[46]
1999 - bought out reinsurance provider GenAmerica Corporation for $1.2 billion, as well as its subsidiaries, Reinsurance Group of America and Conning Corporation.[47][48] That year, the company had grown to serve 7 million policyholders.[49]
2000 - de-mutualization and IPO.[50][51] The initial public offering was valued at $6.5 billion, which was the largest IPO to that date in United States financial history.[50][51] MetLife policyholders were asked to choose a cash or stock stake. This IPO made MetLife the most widely owned stock in the United States, and it raised MetLife's value to over $4 billion.[52][53] By 2000, MetLife's reported number of policyholders had risen to 11 million,[53] and that year it had become the United States' number one life insurer, surpassing Prudential, according to The New York Times.[54]
2000 - $470 million voice and data network management deal with AT&T Solutions.[55]
2001 - acquired Grand Bank of Kingston, New Jersey, which was renamed MetLife Bank.[56][57]
2001 - invested $1 billion in the United States stock market during 2001, immediately after the September 11th terrorist attacks.[58]
2005 - acquired Citigroup’s Travelers Life & Annuity and all of Citigroup’s international insurance businesses for $11.8 billion.[59][60] At the time of the deal, which was completed on July 1, 2005, the Travelers acquisition made MetLife the largest individual life insurer in North America based on sales.[61]
2006 - opened joint-venture insurance company in Shanghai, in May 2006.[62][63]
2006 - sold Peter Cooper Village, or Stuyvesant Town, the largest apartment complexes in New York City at the time, for $5.4 billion.[64][65] MetLife had developed the apartment complexes between 1945 and 1947, to house veterans returning home from serving in World War II.[66]
2010 - bought American Life Insurance Company from AIG for US$15,500,000,000.[59]
2011 - sold MetLife bank to GE Capital, exiting banking business.[67]

Current era[edit]
From 2004 to 2011, MetLife continued to hold its position as the largest life insurer in the United States.[16][68] The company had $2.5 trillion in policies written, $350 billion in assets under management, over 12 million customers in the United States, 8 million customers outside the United States, and a net income in 2003 of $2.2 billion.[68] That year, Barron's reported that 13 million American households owned at least one product from MetLife.[69]
MetLife named Robert H. Benmosche as chairman and CEO in July 1999. Benmosche occupied the position until 2006, when he was replaced by C. Robert Henrikson.[16][70][71]
The company's sales grew 11.5% between 2008 and 2009, despite the national recession.[72] In 2011, CEO Robert Henrikson was replaced by Steven A. Kandarian, who had overseen the company's "US$450,000,000,000 investment portfolio" as chief investment officer.[16] Henrikson remained the company's chairman to the end of 2011, at which point he reached the company's mandatory retirement age.[16]
In 2015, MetLife was ranked as number one on Fortune magazine's list of World's Most Admired Companies in the Insurance: Life and Health category.[73]
In the summer of 2017, MetLife plans to add a third office building of 255,000 square feet at its Cary, North Carolina Global Technology Campus, giving the company a total of 655,000 square feet at a location which has over 1,000 employees in such areas as engineering, software and technology. This plan was the result of North Carolina awarding the company $94 million in incentives in 2013 for creating over 2,600 jobs, half in Cary and half in Charlotte.[74]
"Too big to fail"[edit]
In 2012, MetLife failed the Federal Reserve’s (the Fed's) Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review stress test, intended to predict the potential failure of the company in a recession. The Fed stated that the minimum total risk-based capital ratio should be 8% and it estimated MetLife's ratio at 6%. The company had requested approval for a US$2,000,000,000 share repurchase to prop up the stock price, along with an increased dividend.[75] Because MetLife owned MetLife Bank, it was subject to stricter financial regulation. To escape that level of regulation, MetLife announced the sale of its banking unit to GE Capital.[76][77] On November 2, 2012, MetLife said it was selling its US$70,000,000,000 mortgage servicing business to JPMorgan Chase for an undisclosed amount.[78] Both sales were part of its strategy to focus on the insurance side of its business.
The attempt to escape "too big to fail" regulation was not successful. In September 2014, the United States government observed the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law by proposing the application of an official label to MetLife as "systemically important" to the American economy.[79] If implemented, MetLife would be subject to different sets of rules and regulations, with increased oversight from the Federal Reserve.[79][80] The company appealed this proposal in November 2014.[81] In December 2014, federal regulators decided that MetLife required the special regulations reserved for financial companies and organizations deemed "systemically important," or "too big to fail".[82] MetLife announced in January 2015 that it would file a lawsuit against the District of Columbia to overturn the federal regulators' decision,[79] thus becoming the first nonbank to challenge such a decision.[83] Three other nonbank companies have been designated as "systemically important": AIG, General Electric and Prudential.[82][83] MetLife continued to litigate this issue as of mid-2015, with the US Department of Justice asking that their challenge be dismissed.[83]
Fines[edit]
On August 7, 2012, it was announced that MetLife will pay $3.2 million in fines after the Federal Reserve charged it used unsafe and unsound practices in handling its mortgage servicing and foreclosure operations.[84]
In 2014, MetLife paid $23 million to settle multiple lawsuits over junk fax operations used to generate leads for life insurance sales.[85]


"MetLife Bank took advantage of the FHA insurance program by knowingly turning a blind eye to mortgage loans that did not meet basic underwriting requirements, and stuck the FHA and taxpayers with the bill when those mortgages defaulted."

U.S. Attorney John Walsh
In 2015, MetLife Home Loans LLC paid $123.5 million to the United States Department of Justice to resolve allegations it knowingly made mortgages insured by the United States government that didn’t meet federal underwriting requirements.[86]

MetLife Hall of Records, Yonkers, New York.


As of 2010[update], MetLife had a "diverse product mix" which included insurance (home, car and life), variable life annuities and structured settlements, commercial mortgages and securities backed by commercial mortgages, and sovereign debt.[15]
Life insurance[edit]
MetLife’s individual life insurance products and services comprise term life insurance and several types of permanent life insurance, including whole life, universal life, and final expense whole life insurance.[87][88] These services vary in regards to the duration and amount of coverage available and whether a medical exam is required for coverage. The company also offers group life insurance, provided through employers, which consists of term life, permanent life, and accidental death and dismemberment coverage.[89][90] MetLife is the largest life insurer in the United States, based on life insurance in-force.[10][15]
Dental[edit]
MetLife offers group dental benefit plans for individuals, employees, retirees and their families and provides dental plan administration for over 20 million people.[91][92] Plans include MetLife’s Preferred Dentist Program (PPO) and the SafeGuard DHMO (available for both individuals and employees in CA, FL, TX, NJ and NY.). As of May 2010, MetLife’s dental PPO network included over 135,000 participating dentist locations nationwide while the dental HMO network included more than 13,000 participating dentist locations in California, Florida and Texas.[93] MetLife also administers dental continuing education program for dentists and allied health care professionals, which are recognized by the American Dental Association (ADA) and the Academy of General Dentistry (AGD).[94]
Disability[edit]
MetLife provides disability products for individuals as well as employee and association groups who receive them through their employer.[14][95] For individuals, the company’s individual disability income insurance can replace a portion of lost income if an individual is unable to work due to sickness or injury.[96] MetLife offers several individual disability income policies, including MetLife Income Guard, OMNI Advantage, OMNI Essential, Business Overhead Expense, and Buy-Sell.[97] The policy options provided by the company vary in terms of eligibility and the provided coverage. For groups, MetLife offers short term disability insurance and long term disability insurance.[98] Short term disability insurance is structured to replace a portion of an individual’s income during the initial weeks of a disabling illness or accident.[99] Long term disability Insurance serves to replace a portion of an individual’s income during an extended period of a disabling illness or accident.[100][101] The company also maintains an absence management product which allows employers to track and manage both planned and unplanned employee absences. The product, which MetLife calls MetLife Total Absence Management, is structured for businesses with 1,000 or more employees.[102]
Annuities[edit]
MetLife is among the largest providers of annuities in the world, recording $22.4 billion in sales during 2009.[103] MetLife offers annuities which consist of fixed annuities, variable annuities, deferred annuities and immediate annuities.[104] In 1921, MetLife was the first company to issue a group annuity contract.[105] More recently in 2004, it was the first insurer to introduce a longevity insurance product.[106] As of December 31, 2009, MetLife globally managed group annuity assets of $60 billion with $34 billion of transferred pension liabilities and provided benefit payments to over 600,000 annuitants per month.[107]
Auto & Home[edit]
MetLife Auto & Home is the brand name for MetLife’s nine affiliate personal lines insurance companies.[108] Collectively these companies offer personal lines property and casualty insurance policies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.[109] The flagship company in the MetLife Auto & Home group, Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company, was founded in 1972.[108] MetLife Auto & Home companies presently have over 2.7 million active policies and service 58 of the Fortune 100 companies.[110][111]
MetLife's home insurance solutions include homeowners insurance, condo insurance, renters insurance, insurance for landlords, and mobile home insurance.[112][113] The available policies for MetLife's home insurance provide coverage for possessions, property damage from natural disaster or theft, and various legal expenses incurred resulting from injuries sustained on an individual's property.[114] The companies also sell RV, ATV, boat, mobile home, collectible vehicle, and motorcycle policies[115] and offers flood insurance policies as a participant in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is managed by the federal government.[116][117] MetLife's various types of coverage for auto insurance include liability protection, collision and comprehensive coverage, personal injury protection, rental car coverage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists coverage.[118][119] Through an arrangement with Hyatt Legal Plans, a subsidiary of MetLife, MetLife Auto & Home underwrites group legal plans in many states.[18]
It was the first national insurer in the United States to offer identity-theft resolution services at no extra premium and as of 2012 continues to do so today in most United States states.[120][121] In 2010, MetLife Auto & Home began offering their GrandProtect plan in most states. This GrandProtect policy simplifies complex insurance needs by combining a client's home, valuable items, autos, RVs, and boats into one comprehensive policy package. The ultimate benefits to the consumer are having one bill, only one deductible, comprehensive coverage, and typically lower rates than trying to get each policy individually.[122]
Other products[edit]
MetLife’s products also include critical illness insurance.[123] Financial services include fee-based financial planning, retirement planning, wealth management, 529 Plans, banking, and commercial and residential mortgages.[124] The company also provides retirement plan and other financial services to healthcare, education, and not-for-profit organizations.[125] The MetLife Center for Special Needs Planning is a group of planners which serve families and individuals with special needs.[126] In 2014, MetLife launched MetLife Defender, a digital identity theft protection product.[127]
International presence[edit]
Outside of the United States, MetLife operates in Latin America, Europe, Asia’s Pacific region, and the Middle East, with leading market positions in Mexico, Japan, South Korea and Chile.[9]
On March 8, 2010, MetLife announced its intent to purchase the international leader life-insurance business, American Life Insurance Company (Alico), from American International Group (AIG). MetLife, which completed the deal on November 1, 2010, paid approximately $7.2 billion in cash and $9.0 billion in MetLife equity and other securities.[128][129] The securities portion of the deal consisted of 78.2 million shares of MetLife common stock, 6.9 million shares of contingent convertible preferred stock and 40 million equity units.[130] The values of the common and preferred stock were based on the closing price of MetLife’s common stock on October 29.[130] Upon completion of the purchase, MetLife became a leading competitor in Japan, the world’s second-largest life insurance market, and moved into a top 5 market position in many high growth emerging markets in Central and Eastern Europe, such as Romania, the Middle East and Latin America.[131] The deal added 20 million customers to MetLife’s 70 million and according to Barron's more than doubled the percentage of operating profits that MetLife gets abroad to 40%.[15]
In India MetLife has an affiliate company India Insurance Company Limited (MetLife) which has operated in India since 2001. This company has its headquarters in Bangalore and Gurgaon and was jointly owned by MetLife and a few local Indian financial companies. In 2012 an agreement was made with local Indian bank, the Punjab National Bank to establish a strategic alliance and for it to take a 30% share in MetLife India.[132] The state owned bank would in return sell MetLife insurance products in its branches
As of 2015, Julio Garcia-Villalon leads the Middle East & Africa regional business, which is headquartered in the Dubai International Financial Centre and has operated in the region since the 1950s.[133]
MetLife Foundation[edit]
MetLife Foundation is MetLife's independent charitable and grant-awarding foundation. It was founded in 1976[134] and had provided over $650 million in grants by January 2015.[134] The foundation has partnered with and donated to a variety of organizations, including Habitat for Humanity since 2010[135] and the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial Project Foundation since 2008.[136][137] In 2013, the MetLife Foundation announced a new focus on financial inclusion,[138] including educational programs on basic financial planning for disadvantaged children[139][140] and financial services aimed at low-income communities.[140][141][142]
Relationship with Peanuts[edit]
MetLife's use of comic strip characters, according to chief marketing officer Esther Lee, was intended "to make our company more friendly and approachable during a time when insurance companies were seen as cold and distant."[143]
MetLife licensed Snoopy and other Peanuts characters for promotional purposes from the Iconix Brand Group, which owns the promotional rights to the works of Charles M. Schulz. In 2010, Iconix formed a joint venture with Schulz’s heirs, buying out E. W. Scripps Co. and United Features Syndicate for $175 million. MetLife is reported to pay $12 million per year to Iconix for licensing rights.[144] Prior to the Iconix deal, MetLife had licensed the characters from other rights-holders.
The Peanuts-based campaign was developed by the advertising agency Young & Rubicam. MetLife also has used Foote Cone & Belding to develop Peanuts-related promotions.[145][146]
MetLife announced the end of its 31-year relationship with Peanuts on October 20, 2016. This decision resulted from the company's sale of its life insurance business to concentrate on corporate clients.[143] MetLife's new blue and green logo was criticized for being a knock-off of comparison website Diffen.[147][148]
Blimp and sports sponsorship[edit]




The Metlife 'Snoopy Two' blimp.


The MetLife blimp program began in 1987 with the “Snoopy 1” airship and, in 1994, expanded to include the “Snoopy 2” airship.[149] The program provides aerial coverage to over 80 major sporting events every year and is currently the official aerial coverage provider of the PGA Tour.[150] “Snoopy 1” and “Snoopy 2” also provide overhead television coverage for the NFL, CBS College Football, the LPGA, the NBA Finals, Copa Chile, the Preakness Stakes, and the Kentucky Derby.[150][151][152][153] On August 23, 2011, MetLife agreed to a 25-year sponsorship deal to rename New Meadowlands Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, home of the NFL's New York Giants and New York Jets to MetLife Stadium.[154]
MetLife and the “Ideal weight”[edit]
In 1959, The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (as it was known at the time) released tables of the best weight for each height for longevity, based on their collected insurance data. These tables showed the “desirable weights”. In 1983, they released tables showing the “ideal” weights for greatest longevity; this information was based on data collected in the Build Study of 1979 collected by the Society of Actuaries. This data followed patients for 18 years (from 1954-1972) and was collected from 25 life insurance companies in Canada and the United States, representing 4.2 million people. These “ideal” weights were higher than the prior “desirable” weights, this was attributed to an increase in muscle mass due to improved fitness levels among the population. This study is still the largest available pool of data for this purpose. It was noticed that the average weights in the population are higher than the ideal weights for survival. The ‘’’Metropolitan Tables’’’ included ‘’small’’, ‘’medium’’ and ‘’large’’ frames, based on elbow-girth measured using calipers, as the elbows do not develop adipose tissue. They presented weight ranges for height, sex and body frame (again associated with the lowest mortality) The mid-point of the ideal weight for the medium frames for each height was selected as the “ideal” weight used for calculations of “excess weight” (initial weight-ideal weight). This led to a formula to calculate the ideal weight used by bariatric surgeons, but it had lost considerable accuracy by 2007, again due to improvements in medical care and in public health.[155]

History[edit]
Early years[edit]




Home office of the New England Mutual Life Insurance Co. one of the predecessor companies of MetLife. see [30]


The predecessor company to MetLife began in 1863 when a group of New York City businessmen raised $100,000 to found the National Union Life and Limb Insurance Company. The company insured Civil War sailors and soldiers against disabilities due to wartime wounds, accidents, and sickness. On March 24, 1868, it became known as Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and shifted its focus to the life insurance business.[31][32]




The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower, which previously served as company headquarters, was featured in its advertising for many years.


A severe business depression that began with the Panic of 1873 forced the company to contract, until it reached its lowest point in the late 1870s. After observing the insurance industry in Great Britain in 1879, MetLife President Joseph F. Knapp brought “industrial” or “workingmen’s” insurance programs to the United States – insurance issued in small amounts on which premiums were collected weekly or monthly at the policyholder’s home. By 1880, sales had exceeded a quarter million of such policies, resulting in nearly $1 million in revenue from premiums. In 1909, MetLife had become the nation’s largest life insurer in the United States, as measured by life insurance in force (the total value of life insurance policies issued).[31][33]
In 1907, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower was commissioned to serve as MetLife’s 23rd Street headquarters in Lower Manhattan. Completed two years later, the building was the world's tallest until 1913 and remained the company's headquarters until 2005. For many years, an illustration of the building (with light emanating from the tip of its spire and the slogan, "The Light That Never Fails") featured prominently in MetLife’s advertising.[34] By 1930, MetLife insured every fifth man, woman, and child in the United States and Canada.[35] During the 1930s, it also began to diversify its portfolio by reducing the percentage of individual mortgages in favor of public utility bonds, investments in government securities, and loans for commercial real estate.[35] The company financed the construction of the Empire State Building in 1929 as well as provided capital to build Rockefeller Center in 1931. During World War II, MetLife placed more than 51 percent of its total assets in war bonds, and was the largest single private contributor to the Allied cause.[35]
Postwar[edit]

During the postwar era, the company expanded its suburban presence, decentralized operations, and refocused its career agency system to serve all market segments. It also began to market group insurance products to employers and institutions. By 1979, operations were segmented into four primary businesses: group insurance, personal insurance, pensions, and investments.[35] In 1981, MetLife purchased what became known as the MetLife building for $400 million from a group that included Pan American World Airways.[36][37]

De-mutualization and IPO[edit]
In 2000, MetLife converted from a mutual insurance company operated for the benefit of its policyholders to a for-profit public company. The de-mutualization process allowed MetLife to enter unrelated insurance businesses and increase executive compensation.
Policyholders received some stock in the new company in this process.[38] MetLife was accused of breaching federal securities laws by misrepresenting and omitting information in materials given to policyholders during this process, resulting in years of litigation ending with a $50 million settlement in 2009.[39]
Acquisitions, sales, and major deals[edit]

1992 - merged with United Mutual Life Insurance Company, the only African-American life insurer in New York, in 1992.[40]
1992 - [41] acquired Executive Life's single premium deferred annuity business, which was worth approximately $1.2 billion. MetLife also acquired the firm's life insurance business, valued at about $260 million.[42]
1995 - purchased New England Mutual Life Insurance Company.[43]
1997 - acquired Security First Group in 1997 for $377 million.[44][45]
1999 - acquired Lincoln National Corporation's individual disability income unit.[46]
1999 - bought out reinsurance provider GenAmerica Corporation for $1.2 billion, as well as its subsidiaries, Reinsurance Group of America and Conning Corporation.[47][48] That year, the company had grown to serve 7 million policyholders.[49]
2000 - de-mutualization and IPO.[50][51] The initial public offering was valued at $6.5 billion, which was the largest IPO to that date in United States financial history.[50][51] MetLife policyholders were asked to choose a cash or stock stake. This IPO made MetLife the most widely owned stock in the United States, and it raised MetLife's value to over $4 billion.[52][53] By 2000, MetLife's reported number of policyholders had risen to 11 million,[53] and that year it had become the United States' number one life insurer, surpassing Prudential, according to The New York Times.[54]
2000 - $470 million voice and data network management deal with AT&T Solutions.[55]
2001 - acquired Grand Bank of Kingston, New Jersey, which was renamed MetLife Bank.[56][57]
2001 - invested $1 billion in the United States stock market during 2001, immediately after the September 11th terrorist attacks.[58]
2005 - acquired Citigroup’s Travelers Life & Annuity and all of Citigroup’s international insurance businesses for $11.8 billion.[59][60] At the time of the deal, which was completed on July 1, 2005, the Travelers acquisition made MetLife the largest individual life insurer in North America based on sales.[61]
2006 - opened joint-venture insurance company in Shanghai, in May 2006.[62][63]
2006 - sold Peter Cooper Village, or Stuyvesant Town, the largest apartment complexes in New York City at the time, for $5.4 billion.[64][65] MetLife had developed the apartment complexes between 1945 and 1947, to house veterans returning home from serving in World War II.[66]
2010 - bought American Life Insurance Company from AIG for US$15,500,000,000.[59]
2011 - sold MetLife bank to GE Capital, exiting banking business.[67]

Current era[edit]
From 2004 to 2011, MetLife continued to hold its position as the largest life insurer in the United States.[16][68] The company had $2.5 trillion in policies written, $350 billion in assets under management, over 12 million customers in the United States, 8 million customers outside the United States, and a net income in 2003 of $2.2 billion.[68] That year, Barron's reported that 13 million American households owned at least one product from MetLife.[69]
MetLife named Robert H. Benmosche as chairman and CEO in July 1999. Benmosche occupied the position until 2006, when he was replaced by C. Robert Henrikson.[16][70][71]
The company's sales grew 11.5% between 2008 and 2009, despite the national recession.[72] In 2011, CEO Robert Henrikson was replaced by Steven A. Kandarian, who had overseen the company's "US$450,000,000,000 investment portfolio" as chief investment officer.[16] Henrikson remained the company's chairman to the end of 2011, at which point he reached the company's mandatory retirement age.[16]
In 2015, MetLife was ranked as number one on Fortune magazine's list of World's Most Admired Companies in the Insurance: Life and Health category.[73]
In the summer of 2017, MetLife plans to add a third office building of 255,000 square feet at its Cary, North Carolina Global Technology Campus, giving the company a total of 655,000 square feet at a location which has over 1,000 employees in such areas as engineering, software and technology. This plan was the result of North Carolina awarding the company $94 million in incentives in 2013 for creating over 2,600 jobs, half in Cary and half in Charlotte.[74]
"Too big to fail"[edit]
In 2012, MetLife failed the Federal Reserve’s (the Fed's) Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review stress test, intended to predict the potential failure of the company in a recession. The Fed stated that the minimum total risk-based capital ratio should be 8% and it estimated MetLife's ratio at 6%. The company had requested approval for a US$2,000,000,000 share repurchase to prop up the stock price, along with an increased dividend.[75] Because MetLife owned MetLife Bank, it was subject to stricter financial regulation. To escape that level of regulation, MetLife announced the sale of its banking unit to GE Capital.[76][77] On November 2, 2012, MetLife said it was selling its US$70,000,000,000 mortgage servicing business to JPMorgan Chase for an undisclosed amount.[78] Both sales were part of its strategy to focus on the insurance side of its business.
The attempt to escape "too big to fail" regulation was not successful. In September 2014, the United States government observed the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law by proposing the application of an official label to MetLife as "systemically important" to the American economy.[79] If implemented, MetLife would be subject to different sets of rules and regulations, with increased oversight from the Federal Reserve.[79][80] The company appealed this proposal in November 2014.[81] In December 2014, federal regulators decided that MetLife required the special regulations reserved for financial companies and organizations deemed "systemically important," or "too big to fail".[82] MetLife announced in January 2015 that it would file a lawsuit against the District of Columbia to overturn the federal regulators' decision,[79] thus becoming the first nonbank to challenge such a decision.[83] Three other nonbank companies have been designated as "systemically important": AIG, General Electric and Prudential.[82][83] MetLife continued to litigate this issue as of mid-2015, with the US Department of Justice asking that their challenge be dismissed.[83]
Fines[edit]
On August 7, 2012, it was announced that MetLife will pay $3.2 million in fines after the Federal Reserve charged it used unsafe and unsound practices in handling its mortgage servicing and foreclosure operations.[84]
In 2014, MetLife paid $23 million to settle multiple lawsuits over junk fax operations used to generate leads for life insurance sales.[85]


"MetLife Bank took advantage of the FHA insurance program by knowingly turning a blind eye to mortgage loans that did not meet basic underwriting requirements, and stuck the FHA and taxpayers with the bill when those mortgages defaulted."

U.S. Attorney John Walsh
In 2015, MetLife Home Loans LLC paid $123.5 million to the United States Department of Justice to resolve allegations it knowingly made mortgages insured by the United States government that didn’t meet federal underwriting requirements.[86]

MetLife Hall of Records, Yonkers, New York.


As of 2010[update], MetLife had a "diverse product mix" which included insurance (home, car and life), variable life annuities and structured settlements, commercial mortgages and securities backed by commercial mortgages, and sovereign debt.[15]
Life insurance[edit]
MetLife’s individual life insurance products and services comprise term life insurance and several types of permanent life insurance, including whole life, universal life, and final expense whole life insurance.[87][88] These services vary in regards to the duration and amount of coverage available and whether a medical exam is required for coverage. The company also offers group life insurance, provided through employers, which consists of term life, permanent life, and accidental death and dismemberment coverage.[89][90] MetLife is the largest life insurer in the United States, based on life insurance in-force.[10][15]
Dental[edit]
MetLife offers group dental benefit plans for individuals, employees, retirees and their families and provides dental plan administration for over 20 million people.[91][92] Plans include MetLife’s Preferred Dentist Program (PPO) and the SafeGuard DHMO (available for both individuals and employees in CA, FL, TX, NJ and NY.). As of May 2010, MetLife’s dental PPO network included over 135,000 participating dentist locations nationwide while the dental HMO network included more than 13,000 participating dentist locations in California, Florida and Texas.[93] MetLife also administers dental continuing education program for dentists and allied health care professionals, which are recognized by the American Dental Association (ADA) and the Academy of General Dentistry (AGD).[94]
Disability[edit]
MetLife provides disability products for individuals as well as employee and association groups who receive them through their employer.[14][95] For individuals, the company’s individual disability income insurance can replace a portion of lost income if an individual is unable to work due to sickness or injury.[96] MetLife offers several individual disability income policies, including MetLife Income Guard, OMNI Advantage, OMNI Essential, Business Overhead Expense, and Buy-Sell.[97] The policy options provided by the company vary in terms of eligibility and the provided coverage. For groups, MetLife offers short term disability insurance and long term disability insurance.[98] Short term disability insurance is structured to replace a portion of an individual’s income during the initial weeks of a disabling illness or accident.[99] Long term disability Insurance serves to replace a portion of an individual’s income during an extended period of a disabling illness or accident.[100][101] The company also maintains an absence management product which allows employers to track and manage both planned and unplanned employee absences. The product, which MetLife calls MetLife Total Absence Management, is structured for businesses with 1,000 or more employees.[102]
Annuities[edit]
MetLife is among the largest providers of annuities in the world, recording $22.4 billion in sales during 2009.[103] MetLife offers annuities which consist of fixed annuities, variable annuities, deferred annuities and immediate annuities.[104] In 1921, MetLife was the first company to issue a group annuity contract.[105] More recently in 2004, it was the first insurer to introduce a longevity insurance product.[106] As of December 31, 2009, MetLife globally managed group annuity assets of $60 billion with $34 billion of transferred pension liabilities and provided benefit payments to over 600,000 annuitants per month.[107]
Auto & Home[edit]
MetLife Auto & Home is the brand name for MetLife’s nine affiliate personal lines insurance companies.[108] Collectively these companies offer personal lines property and casualty insurance policies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.[109] The flagship company in the MetLife Auto & Home group, Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company, was founded in 1972.[108] MetLife Auto & Home companies presently have over 2.7 million active policies and service 58 of the Fortune 100 companies.[110][111]
MetLife's home insurance solutions include homeowners insurance, condo insurance, renters insurance, insurance for landlords, and mobile home insurance.[112][113] The available policies for MetLife's home insurance provide coverage for possessions, property damage from natural disaster or theft, and various legal expenses incurred resulting from injuries sustained on an individual's property.[114] The companies also sell RV, ATV, boat, mobile home, collectible vehicle, and motorcycle policies[115] and offers flood insurance policies as a participant in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is managed by the federal government.[116][117] MetLife's various types of coverage for auto insurance include liability protection, collision and comprehensive coverage, personal injury protection, rental car coverage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists coverage.[118][119] Through an arrangement with Hyatt Legal Plans, a subsidiary of MetLife, MetLife Auto & Home underwrites group legal plans in many states.[18]
It was the first national insurer in the United States to offer identity-theft resolution services at no extra premium and as of 2012 continues to do so today in most United States states.[120][121] In 2010, MetLife Auto & Home began offering their GrandProtect plan in most states. This GrandProtect policy simplifies complex insurance needs by combining a client's home, valuable items, autos, RVs, and boats into one comprehensive policy package. The ultimate benefits to the consumer are having one bill, only one deductible, comprehensive coverage, and typically lower rates than trying to get each policy individually.[122]
Other products[edit]
MetLife’s products also include critical illness insurance.[123] Financial services include fee-based financial planning, retirement planning, wealth management, 529 Plans, banking, and commercial and residential mortgages.[124] The company also provides retirement plan and other financial services to healthcare, education, and not-for-profit organizations.[125] The MetLife Center for Special Needs Planning is a group of planners which serve families and individuals with special needs.[126] In 2014, MetLife launched MetLife Defender, a digital identity theft protection product.[127]
International presence[edit]
Outside of the United States, MetLife operates in Latin America, Europe, Asia’s Pacific region, and the Middle East, with leading market positions in Mexico, Japan, South Korea and Chile.[9]
On March 8, 2010, MetLife announced its intent to purchase the international leader life-insurance business, American Life Insurance Company (Alico), from American International Group (AIG). MetLife, which completed the deal on November 1, 2010, paid approximately $7.2 billion in cash and $9.0 billion in MetLife equity and other securities.[128][129] The securities portion of the deal consisted of 78.2 million shares of MetLife common stock, 6.9 million shares of contingent convertible preferred stock and 40 million equity units.[130] The values of the common and preferred stock were based on the closing price of MetLife’s common stock on October 29.[130] Upon completion of the purchase, MetLife became a leading competitor in Japan, the world’s second-largest life insurance market, and moved into a top 5 market position in many high growth emerging markets in Central and Eastern Europe, such as Romania, the Middle East and Latin America.[131] The deal added 20 million customers to MetLife’s 70 million and according to Barron's more than doubled the percentage of operating profits that MetLife gets abroad to 40%.[15]
In India MetLife has an affiliate company India Insurance Company Limited (MetLife) which has operated in India since 2001. This company has its headquarters in Bangalore and Gurgaon and was jointly owned by MetLife and a few local Indian financial companies. In 2012 an agreement was made with local Indian bank, the Punjab National Bank to establish a strategic alliance and for it to take a 30% share in MetLife India.[132] The state owned bank would in return sell MetLife insurance products in its branches
As of 2015, Julio Garcia-Villalon leads the Middle East & Africa regional business, which is headquartered in the Dubai International Financial Centre and has operated in the region since the 1950s.[133]
MetLife Foundation[edit]
MetLife Foundation is MetLife's independent charitable and grant-awarding foundation. It was founded in 1976[134] and had provided over $650 million in grants by January 2015.[134] The foundation has partnered with and donated to a variety of organizations, including Habitat for Humanity since 2010[135] and the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial Project Foundation since 2008.[136][137] In 2013, the MetLife Foundation announced a new focus on financial inclusion,[138] including educational programs on basic financial planning for disadvantaged children[139][140] and financial services aimed at low-income communities.[140][141][142]
Relationship with Peanuts[edit]
MetLife's use of comic strip characters, according to chief marketing officer Esther Lee, was intended "to make our company more friendly and approachable during a time when insurance companies were seen as cold and distant."[143]
MetLife licensed Snoopy and other Peanuts characters for promotional purposes from the Iconix Brand Group, which owns the promotional rights to the works of Charles M. Schulz. In 2010, Iconix formed a joint venture with Schulz’s heirs, buying out E. W. Scripps Co. and United Features Syndicate for $175 million. MetLife is reported to pay $12 million per year to Iconix for licensing rights.[144] Prior to the Iconix deal, MetLife had licensed the characters from other rights-holders.
The Peanuts-based campaign was developed by the advertising agency Young & Rubicam. MetLife also has used Foote Cone & Belding to develop Peanuts-related promotions.[145][146]
MetLife announced the end of its 31-year relationship with Peanuts on October 20, 2016. This decision resulted from the company's sale of its life insurance business to concentrate on corporate clients.[143] MetLife's new blue and green logo was criticized for being a knock-off of comparison website Diffen.[147][148]
Blimp and sports sponsorship[edit]




The Metlife 'Snoopy Two' blimp.


The MetLife blimp program began in 1987 with the “Snoopy 1” airship and, in 1994, expanded to include the “Snoopy 2” airship.[149] The program provides aerial coverage to over 80 major sporting events every year and is currently the official aerial coverage provider of the PGA Tour.[150] “Snoopy 1” and “Snoopy 2” also provide overhead television coverage for the NFL, CBS College Football, the LPGA, the NBA Finals, Copa Chile, the Preakness Stakes, and the Kentucky Derby.[150][151][152][153] On August 23, 2011, MetLife agreed to a 25-year sponsorship deal to rename New Meadowlands Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, home of the NFL's New York Giants and New York Jets to MetLife Stadium.[154]
MetLife and the “Ideal weight”[edit]
In 1959, The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (as it was known at the time) released tables of the best weight for each height for longevity, based on their collected insurance data. These tables showed the “desirable weights”. In 1983, they released tables showing the “ideal” weights for greatest longevity; this information was based on data collected in the Build Study of 1979 collected by the Society of Actuaries. This data followed patients for 18 years (from 1954-1972) and was collected from 25 life insurance companies in Canada and the United States, representing 4.2 million people. These “ideal” weights were higher than the prior “desirable” weights, this was attributed to an increase in muscle mass due to improved fitness levels among the population. This study is still the largest available pool of data for this purpose. It was noticed that the average weights in the population are higher than the ideal weights for survival. The ‘’’Metropolitan Tables’’’ included ‘’small’’, ‘’medium’’ and ‘’large’’ frames, based on elbow-girth measured using calipers, as the elbows do not develop adipose tissue. They presented weight ranges for height, sex and body frame (again associated with the lowest mortality) The mid-point of the ideal weight for the medium frames for each height was selected as the “ideal” weight used for calculations of “excess weight” (initial weight-ideal weight). This led to a formula to calculate the ideal weight used by bariatric surgeons, but it had lost considerable accuracy by 2007, again due to improvements in medical care and in public health.[155]

New England And Met Life Agree to Merge Operations


By MICHAEL QUINT


Published: August 17, 1995









                    The boards of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and the New England Mutual Life Insurance Company agreed yesterday to merge, combining the financial strength of Met Life with New England Mutual's affluent customer base.        

                    With the merger, the assets of Met Life, the nation's second-largest insurance company, would grow to $146.9 billion -- not enough to dislodge the Prudential Insurance Company of America, which has $167.3 billion in assets, from first place. New England, which is based in Boston, is ranked No. 27.        

                    Because both Met Life, based in New York, and New England are mutual companies, owned by their policyholders, the merger would not entail any cash payment or issuance of new shares as in mergers of stockholder-owned companies. Instead, New England's 560,000 policyholders, who own a company with $1 billion of capital, would become part-owners of an enlarged Metlife with $8.3 billion of capital and 40 million customers, including those with employer-sponsored group policies.        

                    The merger is subject to approval of policyholders of both companies.        

                    Sales in the upscale market have grown much more rapidly than sales to middle-income households that are the mainstay at Met Life. However, New England's ratings have fallen in recent years because of real estate losses, and the merger is expected to give the company financial strength and higher ratings that should help it expand its sales. All new and existing New England policies will be backed by Met Life.        

                    Under the terms, both companies would continue selling insurance under their own names, but their finances would be combined under the stronger Met Life umbrella.        

                    The insurance industry, including many giant mutual companies owned by their policyholders, has been in flux. Weak profits combined with faltering sales from traditional networks of agents and the loss of business to alternative investments like mutual funds have spurred many companies to push for change by selling nonessential businesses, merging and cutting costs.        

                    Another big merger announcement of mutual insurance companies is expected in the middle of September, when directors of Massachusetts Mutual of Springfield, Mass., and Connecticut Mutual, which is based in Hartford, are expected to approve a merger that could create one of the country's 10 largest insurers. Executives at both companies previously announced they were in merger talks and said they expected a merger would strengthen the financial standing of Connecticut Mutual and allow for cost-cutting by eliminating many duplications.        

                    "The insurance industry as a whole faces big challenges to bring down their costs and increase revenues, and the Met Life and New England Mutual merger just raises the hurdle a bit higher for other companies," said Larry Mayewski, head life insurance company analyst at the A. M. Best Company, an Oldwick, N.J., ratings firm. The greatest growth opportunity for insurers, he said, is in the market niche served by New England -- high-income individuals in the 45 to 59 age group who need advice about retirement savings and estate planning.        

                    "Customer preferences have changed, with less interest in insurance as protection against disaster and more of a focus on insurance as a product for retirement planning," Mr. Mayeweski said. That means companies like Met Life need better trained sales agents who can sell more sophisticated products, not just the usual products sold in the past.        

                    "I expect that mergers like this will tend to be much more frequent," said Robert W. Stein, head of the insurance group at Ernst & Young, the accounting firm. "A lot of companies may not have the stomach for it because of inertia and the strains it puts on management," he said, "but most mutual companies will need more capital to grow."        

                    A key way to acquire more capital, Mr. Stein said, is to arrange mergers that broaden an insurer's business into more attractive markets, as in the case of Met Life and New England, or by cutting costs by eliminating duplicated jobs.        

                    In the Met Life-New England merger, however, cost cutting is not a major issue. Harry P. Kamen, Met Life's chief executive, said the $30 million annual savings that might be achieved in the next few years was much less than the savings he expected to squeeze out of Met Life, even without a merger. Met Life's business plan calls for profits to grow to $1.7 billion in 1997 from nearly $1 billion last year, with less than half of the $700 million improvement coming from cost cutting.        

                    Met Life executives said they were eager to make use of New England's more sophisticated computer system, which will eliminate the need for Met Life to spend $30 million to $50 million to improve its own system. The New England system, created with needs of wealthy customers in mind, can immediately produce updated account statements and projections that would have to be produced slowly at Met Life, one at a time.        

                    Met Life's 400 to 500 agents who sell to the same sort of customers as New England's 3,000 agents would continue with the Met Life name, but would rely on the products and service provided by New England. In addition, all policies of more than $250,000 sold by Met Life's main force of 8,700 agents would be issued by New England Mutual.        

                    Rating agencies, in general, gave the merger favorable reviews, saying that New England's ratings might be raised, while holding Met Life's ratings constant.        

                    At A. M. Best, New England's rating is A-, the fourth highest, while Met Life was A+, the second highest. The only dissenter from that pattern was Moody's Investors Service, which said it continued to review Met Life's current Aa-1 rating, the second highest, for possible downgrading.        

                    The merger with New England is the latest in a series of deals by Mr. Kamen, a slightly built, sometimes self-effacing lawyer who became Met Life's chief executive in early 1993. He still takes the subway to work sometimes. Before the agreement on the New England merger, the largest ever among mutual life insurers, Mr. Kamen sold Met Life's health care and health insurance businesses for stock and cash that could eventually total $1.3 billion and give it 5 percent ownership of United Healthcare of Minnetonka, Minn., one of the nation's largest health insurers and operators of health maintenance organizations. He collected an additional $365 million this year by selling Met Life's home mortgage and Century 21 real estate brokerage subsidiaries.        

                    Mr. Kamen said he was interested in converting to a stockholder-owned company at this time "because we don't need the additional capital." He noted that Met Life now had other options to raise capital and could, for example, issue new stock of the New England Investment Companies, a publicly traded subsidiary of New England Mutual, which manages $68 billion of assets.        

                    The deal with New Engalnd was born last December, when Terry Lennon, a former senior official in the New York State Insurance Department who joined Met Life a year earlier as a strategic planner, paid a visit to the office of Robert A. Safto, the 59-year-old chief executive at New England.        

                    "Terry asked if I would consider a merger where we would retain our name, our headquarters and independent operations, but gain from the Metropolitan Life's stronger finances," Mr. Safto said yesterday. "I said, 'That sounds pretty good.' "
