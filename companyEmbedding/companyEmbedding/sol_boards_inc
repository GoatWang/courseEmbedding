GOLFBOARDING APPEALS TO EVERYONEThis extraordinary new way to experience the course is sure to entice almost everyone to play more golf, plus at the same time attract a whole new generation of golfers. The GolfBoard provides players the same independence and freedom as walking, but with much greater speed and excitement.GOLFBOARD BENEFITSDramatically increases the pace-of-play leading to more frequency of rounds played. Two rounds on the GolfBoard can be played under 5 hours! Reduces course wear-and-tear: Weighing 115 lbs., the GolfBoard delivers 30% less impact on your turf than a single golf cart. GolfBoard was designed with turf sustainability in mind. Incorporating 4WD technology to evenly distribute power to the GolfBoard's 11" by 4" turf tires, virtually eliminates ‘tire-spin’ and damaged turf - even on dewy mornings or damp conditions.The GolfBoard requires minimal maintenance. Utilizing the latest in lithium-ion battery technology, there is absolutely no battery servicing required.  The modular design of the GolfBoard allows for easy and quick replacement of worn parts, resulting in minimal down time, and maximum board productivity.

SAFE & EASY TO USE...
































 









The GolfBoard comes with many built-in safety features, including an automatic parking brake that activates when a golfer steps off the board, and a fully enclosed drivetrain that protects hands and fingers from moving parts. Being such a new idea to the world of golf, we realize that safety and liability will be a concern for many golf courses. The GolfBoard has been designed to optimize safety and ease of use. After extensive field testing, and verification of our quality control and testing procedures, GolfBoard has obtained general liability insurance from The Hartford and excess liability coverage from AIG. Additionally, with the assistance of KPD Insurance, our clients have been able to secure general liability insurance for their course or resort which includes GolfBoarding through Philadelphia Insurance and other insurance providers for a low additional premium. GolfBoard also provides comprehensive new user on-boarding procedures, a detailed safety video, plus free access to its waiver & release data capture system to help golf courses implement a safe and popular GolfBoarding program.Join courses across the country in leveraging the GolfBoard to increase consumer interest and revenue. Contact us to learn more about our attractive lease packages and available financing.










FAQS
 
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS 






FAQS
 
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS 





















































FAQsQ: What about insurance?A: General liability Insurance is something that most golf courses already have, and GolfBoarding should be added to your policy. The GolfBoard should be treated very similar to golf carts by most insurance providers. SolBoards Inc. has already secured a $2M general liability policy from Hartford, and a $10M excess liability policy from AIG. We have developed a detailed safety training video, which all new riders watch prior to operating a GolfBoard. After viewing the safety video, new users are also required to sign a liability release acknowledging that they understand the operation and safety principles.Q: Why should I replace my carts with a fleet of GolfBoards if so much of our membership is older?A: GolfBoards are a supplement to your golf carts, and will provide your club with an opportunity to bring in new membership and give you a competitive advantage over neighboring facilities. The GolfBoard is nothing like a traditional skateboard or snowboard. It is easy and intuitive to operate, and a lot more stable than first time riders might expect. We have seen older players who have no riding experience try the GolfBoard, and end up riding comfortably after just a few minutes of practice. GolfBoards also take up less space in between use, charge faster, and greatly reduce the maintenance costs compared to regular golf carts.Q: Won't GolfBoards tear up the grass?A: Not at all! GolfBoards use the same turf tires found on standard golf course maintenance equipment. The combined weight of the rider and GolfBoard is approximately 800 pounds less than that of a golf cart, greatly reducing soil compaction and turf stress. Our boards use a proprietary 4 wheel-drive system allowing power to be distributed to all 4 wheels equally, reducing turf wear. The board’s smooth acceleration ensures a fluid increase in speed that won’t cause turf-damaging burnouts.Q: What if a golfer has never ridden a skate/snow/surfboard before; will they be able to use the GolfBoard?A: Absolutely! The beauty of the GolfBoard is that it was designed to be a high performance machine that is easy enough for anyone to use. Once riders position themselves on the board, they use the bar-mounted thumb throttle to control the acceleration and braking, and by simply leaning side to side, they control the turning of the GolfBoard. The GolfBoard controls feature a low/high speed switch, allowing beginner riders to practice and increase their confidence riding while in the low speed mode, traveling at a maximum of 6 mph. The stability bar/bag holder provides an added point of control that provides confidence and security to even the most inexperienced riders.Q: What type of terrain/surfaces can these boards handle? A: One of the great things about the GolfBoard is that is was designed to handle every type of terrain and surface you can throw under it! From steep grassy slopes and paved trails, to soft turf terrain and loose gravel. Not only will these boards handle these terrains, but their large turf tires will keep all of them in beautiful condition.Q: How are the boards powered and charged?A: The boards are powered by a compact 50.4 volt lithium battery pack, built into the base of the board. The lithium batteries used in GolfBoards are lighter, more powerful, and last much longer than lead acid batteries and require zero maintenance. Charging the boards takes approximately 2.2 hours, allowing the boards to spend more time out on the course. The cost for a full recharge is around $ 0.10. The batteries can be cycled (fully drained and charged) 1,000 times, giving the battery packs a life of approximately 3,500 rounds of golf!Q: What are the financing and leasing options for GolfBoards?A: We want to give all courses big and small alike a chance to carry our boards, which is why we offer a large variety of purchasing and leasing options, with financing available for most. If purchasing a fleet of GolfBoards isn’t for you, our leasing options may be what you need to get started with a GolfBoard fleet. Our packages are catered to the specific needs of each golf course, so please contact us with your requirements and we can build a package just for you!

SURF THE EARTH TODAYON OVER 250 COURSES WORLDWIDEClick HERE to Find Out Where To Ride! 





SURF THE EARTH ON THE GOLFBOARDWATCH THE GOLFBOARD IN ACTIONThe greatest invention in golf since the graphite shaft, the GolfBoard is forever changing the way golfers experience the game. Powered by an environmentally friendly lithium-ion battery, the GolfBoard is an easy-to-ride fully electric vehicle that adds a whole new level of fun and excitement. Golfers of all ages can now "Surf the Earth" from shot-to-shot in a way that feels like snowboarding or surfing. We call it "GolfBoarding."MAINTAINS THE TRADITIONS OF THE GAMEGolfBoarding changes the golfing experience, without changing the spirit and traditions of the game. With over 200 courses now offering GolfBoard rentals, and hundreds of thousands of GolfBoarding rounds played, the GolfBoard has a proven ability to attract new players and energize the sport. FAREWELL TO THE 5 HOUR ROUNDSThe GolfBoard dramatically increases the pace-of-play. After conducting extensive time trials—the average round on the GolfBoard is 2:37! Making it possible to play 36 holes in 5 hours.Click Here to read the news from Today's Golfer about their comprehensive speed test comparison. They timed the same 4 golfers walking, using golf carts, and GolfBoarding. With each GolfBoarder going directly to their own ball at up to 10 MPH, it should be no surprise GolfBoard significantly speeds up the game.






"Our winner in the New Age category is Golfboard, a combination of electronic snowboard and golf cart that allows you to traverse the course by maneuvering the device while standing on it, with your clubs right in front of you. Golfboard is fun, and it provides a bit of a workout for those feeling guilty about not walking."— Golf Digest

Unique Design
 
developed  specifically for golf course use










GolfBoard's unique and proprietary features make it    best-in-classAutomatic BrakingEase of use and safety is optimized by an on-board computer that monitors speed and controls braking.   The rider simply releases the thumb throttle, and the board immediately decelerates and comes to a complete stop. Then an automatic rear axle parking brake locks the board in position even on the steepest terrain.  This provides you a stable structure to step off, and won't allow the GolfBoard to roll away even if you come to a stop at a tricky sidehill shot.Commercial Rental and Personal Use OptionsGolfBoard riders have the ability to select either high speed or low speed modes of operation. For the Commercial Use Board, low speed is a gentle 5 mph, allowing first time users the ability to practice turning and operating the board with security and confidence. Once new users have perfected their GolfBoarding skills, they can advance to a maximum speed of 10 mph.For personal use, GolfBoard offers an optional high performance package with low speed of 7 mph, and a maximum high speed of 12.5 mph on flat terrain, plus up to 14 mph down hill. This 25% to 40% increase in maximum speed also provides faster acceleration for those riders looking for a more adventuresome experience.       4 Wheel Drive Posi-Traction SystemThe GolfBoard is driven by front and back gear boxes providing power to all four wheels. This proprietary 4 wheel Posi-Traction feature provides solid climbing ability even on the steepest hills while simultaneously reducing turf wear.Intuitive Controls The GolfBoard is primarily controlled using an ergonomically designed one-touch thumb throttle which allows the user to smoothly accelerate and decelerate, plus turn on and off the board. The throttle mechanism also features an intelligent LED battery charge level indicator.  A Hi / low speed option mounted on the Stability Bar allows the user to set their maximum speed preference, along with a forward / reverse function that provides optimal maneuverability.Industrial Strength Motors & Enclosed DrivetrainThe GolfBoard uses the highest quality industrial grade electric motors and fully enclosed drivetrain to ensure reliability and low maintenance.  Built to handle high-power industrial applications, the GolfBoard's motors are expected to be maintenance free for several years before requiring a simple and low coast replacement of the motor's brushes.  4" By 11" Turf TiresThe GolfBoard utilizes tires specifically made for golf course use. Produced by the world's leading manufacturer of turf equipment tires, GolfBoard's gentle-on-the-turf 4" by 11" tires provide maximum traction while minimizing turf wear. With the GolfBoards low weight of only 125 pounds distributed over the same surface area as much heavier equipment, there is substantially less impact and pressure on the turf than a fully loaded golf cart.

Smooth Ride and          Ideal HandlingThe GolfBoard is the only board available with our proprietary "Spring Deck” technology utilizing a flexible spring plates. This Spring Deck technology gives the GolfBoard amazing suspension and flex, while still allowing for a secure and rigid mounting location for our durable non-skid rhino liner deck.The GolfBoard's highly effective and adjustable shock absorber system provides an extremely smooth ride. The Golfboard's suspension system can be quickly and easily adjusted to the performance preference and weight of each rider. Designed to have the lowest possible center of gravity, the GolfBoard is extremely stable and provides a truly surf like experience.  The low center of gravity allows the rider to feel like they are in contact with the terrain, plus makes it easy to step on the board at each shot. BatteriesPower for the GolfBoard is provided by the same lithium batteries found in the latest luxury electric automobiles. Manufactured by a world leader in intelligent lithium battery design, the GolfBoard’s battery management system is leading edge.  Lightweight, long lasting and encased in a protective metal casing, the GolfBoard's lithium-ion battery technology and safety features are best-in-class.Providing sufficient power to easily complete 18-holes on a single charge, the GolfBoard’s battery also allows for fast recharging times between rounds. After going 18 holes, most GolfBoards can be recharged and back on the course for another 18-holes in two hours or less.In contrast to lead acid batteries in regular golf carts that require tedious maintenance and long recharge times, the GolfBoard’s lithium battery requires zero maintenance, lasts longer, and is far lighter.Depending on conditions, such as rider weight, turf conditions and grade, a GolfBoard can go up to 18 miles on a single charge. The battery powerhouse is designed to give users the power to complete the longest and steepest courses with plenty of energy to spare. Watch GolfBoard's suspension at work...

Reduces Turf wear 





The GolfBoard is     Turf FriendlyEvery golfer loves playing on turf that is healthy and beautifully manicured. Day in and day out Golf Course Superintendents everywhere do battle with the forces that try to undermine their ability to produce these desired pristine playing conditions.Ironically, it’s the action of the golfers themselves that frequently causes the most amount of turf damage. Foot traﬃc and golf cart wear are the greatest contributing causes of damage to fairways.Out of strict concern for minimizing injury to turf, the GolfBoard has been engineered to make the smallest possible degree of turf impact. With approximately the same PSI as a golf cart (6lbs per square inch), but only 25% of the footprint, the GolfBoard can reduce turf wear by as much as 75%.The psi of a person walking is far greater than the psi of a golf cart or a GolfBoard. But psi alone is not the main cause of turf damage, it's redundant golf cart traﬃc patterns. The GolfBoard is much smaller and more maneuverable than a golf cart, which eliminates damaging recurrent traffic patterns, which helps keep grass healthier and superintendents happier.To read more about the GolfBoard's reduced effect on turf, please click HERE.















GolfBoard's smaller footprint allows two GolfBoards to  deliver 30% less impact on turf than one golf cart.

Handmade Cutting Boards in California


















Home


Welcome to Sol Boards!
We create beautiful cutting boards using exquisite hardwoods from around the world.  We hand select and mill each piece of wood, and hand assemble each board to showcase the optimum contrast in colors and grains.  This process also ensures their individual uniqueness… no mass production here!  Which is exactly why a Sol Board makes the perfect gift.

 
We use only the finest hardwoods available.  The vibrant colors are the natural woods; there are no dyes or stains involved.
We use only food grade wood glue and a pure mineral oil finish.

We offer two sizes:  10″ x 12″ and 10″ x 16″.  However, if your desire is to have a different size, we are able to accommodate custom orders.  Just contact us!

Sol Boards
Handmade Cutting Boards in California

















About Us 

Sol Boards is co-owned by Doug and Tana Tolson and was started out of their shop in December 2010.  As a general contractor and do-it-yourselfer, Doug decided to make Christmas gifts for family members.  Always creative with wood, he came up with the idea of making cutting boards using scrap wood from other projects. After he completed them, he posted pictures of his creations on his Face Book page.
That’s all it took… what began as a gift, soon grew into several requests from friends and family. After taking a few orders and hearing rave reviews, he and Tana decided to take it a step further.  It always amazes them to hear people respond with such positive words.  They are extremely appreciative and feel blessed to be able to share their talent with others.
Catch Doug doing home and yard improvements on the DIY Network’s Yardcore and all of the Crashers series!
Doug and Tana live in California with their three kids.

Many of GolfBoard’s® social media videos have gone viral, generating over 35 million views globally.  The industry’s most recognized influencers, including the world’s top golf professional, have also jumped on-board by providing unsolicited praise about how incredibly “cool” it is to ride a GolfBoard® (google The ‘Rider Cup’ Desert Challenge 2016).The true validation of a product’s potential is its ability to drive demand by end users. In this regard, GolfBoard® has energized the game of golf by attracting a whole new audience of young millennials. In addition, GolfBoard® has been strongly embraced by both the x-generation and baby boomers, who have now collectively played hundreds of thousands of rounds on a GolfBoard®. Safe, fun, easy to use, and embraced by all ages and athletic abilities, Golfboard® appeals to everyone.Increasing pace of play, boosting rounds played and providing valuable new revenue streams for golf course operators, it should be no surprise that GolfBoarding has already made its way to over 200 golf courses worldwide. With an extensive U.S. GolfBoard® Rep network, plus international GolfBoard® distribution in the U.K., Switzerland, Canada, Australia, and Indonesia, GolfBoard® is perfectly positioned to penetrate the more than 15,000 US golf courses, and 34,000 courses worldwide.Providing limitless growth potential, the GolfBoard® has broad applications beyond golf. After enhancing the golfer experience, increasing rounds played and improving course profitability, Sol Boards, Inc. now sets its sights on other markets, with plans to leverage the company’s proprietary technology to expand into high potential new markets such as resorts, industrial, and all-terrain applications.If you find what we have just shared about GolfBoard® compelling, we invite you to read on to learn the specific details about the GolfBoard® revolution, and Sol Boards’ vision for expanding its products beyond Golf to larger market opportunities.    While golf is already enjoyed by millions worldwide, GolfBoarding attracts a whole new audience of thrill seeking millennials by reshaping the way players experience the game. GolfBoarding brings a much needed element of fun and physical engagement to a sport that will now be able to attract a whole new user group. Golf is no longer the game of our grandfathers, it is fitter, the players are healthier, and more athletic. The GolfBoard® resonates perfectly with this new age player.  By adding a new twist to a sport with time-honored traditions, the fun and excitement of GolfBoard® is exactly what golf needs.Entrepreneurial course operators have sought out the GolfBoard® to grow revenue, and to differentiate their golf offering in a highly competitive marketplace. This phenomenon is spreading at an exponential pace as the word is getting out regarding how effective the GolfBoard® is at driving profits and favorably impacting the bottom line. GolfBoard® is a proven solution for course managers seeking ways to increase the number of rounds played, and to bring in new players to the game.    A key factor in improving the popularity of golf is increasing pace of play!The National Golf Federation has conducted extensive research on the growth of the game, and has concluded that one of the largest challenges golf faces today is pace of play. An average round of golf requires 5 hours to complete an 18-hole round. Compared to carts or walking, GolfBoard® dramatically increases the pace-of-play, which typically means a round being played in 3 hours or less!The outlook of golf is bright, as industry source are predicting an increase in rounds played in 2016 and beyond as more baby boomers retire.  Interestingly enough, baby boomers represent one of GolfBoards® largest user groups.The PGA, view GolfBoards® as a perfect pace-of-play solution… “GolfBoard® is the future of getting around a course.”  – PGA.com“Not only does the GolfBoard® increase the pace-of-play, it is also attracting a younger demographic to the sport. We are so happy with this product and how it is going to change the game.” – Luan Pham, Head of Marketing, Golf Digest    It’s Fun!GolfBoard® was designed to mirror the experience of riding a surfboard or snowboard. Golfers can now experience the terrain in a whole new way, making golf even more fun (google #golfboard)  Great ExerciseSince a GolfBoard® is steered by riders shifting their body weight from side-to-side, GolfBoarding is much more physically active than riding in a golf cart. GolfBoarding provides a great core and leg workout, which is considered a strong added benefit by most players.Beta test surveys indicate GolfBoard® repeat use and customer satisfaction is over 90%. Happy members and guests makes course management love the GolfBoard® too.    (Source: Maderas Golf Club, San Diego, CA)Increased speed of play drives a greater number of rounds played, especially during twilight rounds and non-peak hours. 4 GolfBoarders can cut an hour off a round, and 5 (or 6) GolfBoarders can play as fast, if not faster, than a foursome using 2 golf carts. Moreover, GolfBoard® rental fees are usually $5 to $10 more than a golf cart. Additional green fees, combined with higher GolfBoard rental rates offers enhanced profit opportunities for courses.Golf course superintendents are highly in favor of GolfBoard® due to the combination of 4-wheel drive and automatic braking, 75% less total weight, plus skid-proof / turf-friendly tires prevents costly damage to fairways caused by golf carts. 4WD technology evenly distributes power to the tires, virtually eliminating ‘tire-spin’ and torn up turf — even on dewy mornings or damp conditions. Weighing only 125 pounds, two GolfBoard® delivers 30% less impact on turf than a standard golf cart.The GolfBoard® has been specifically designed and engineered for daily commercial rental use, with military grade manufacturing. Its ruggedized modular design allows for routine maintenance and repairs to be quickly and easily performed by in-field maintenance personnel.  Lithium-ion batteries charge quickly, allowing for multiple rounds in a single day.With hundreds of thousands of rounds played on a GolfBoard®, golf courses have not had a single reported insurance claim for rider injury on a GolfBoard® since we launched over two years ago. This zero incident rate is in sharp contrast to the estimated 15,000+ emergency room visits reported each year related to golf cart injuries.Single-rider, reduced weight, automatic braking, and greater stability are four of the most significant contributing factors to the zero claims history of GolfBoard® compared to much higher injury frequency rate of golf carts.  GolfBoard® has initially obtained $2M in general liability insurance from The Hartford and $10M excess liability coverage from AIG, and has been contacted by other best-in-class insurance providers looking to provide GolfBoard® coverage. Additionally, GolfBoard’s® clients have been able to secure general liability insurance for their course or resort which includes GolfBoards® at low to no additional premium.GolfBoard® provides its clients access to an online a liability waiver system, requiring all new riders to watch a detailed instructional video plus execute a liability release acknowledging that they understand the operation and safety principles prior to operating a GolfBoard®.    Sol Boards, Inc. sells fleets of GolfBoards® primarily to golf courses and larger golf management companies. For example, Maderas Golf Club operated by Troon, and Tetherow in Bend, Oregon.The Maderas Golf Course, located in Poway, CA, (just east of San Diego) has a fleet of 8 GolfBoards® renting for $25 extra per round vs a golf cart. Like most courses offering GolfBoarding, since jumping on board, Maderas has seen a strong boost in business. More than 50% of GolfBoard® rounds played are reported to be coming specifically to Maderas Golf Club because they want to ride the GolfBoard®.At Tetherow, their fleet of more than 30 GolfBoards® contributed to a 35%+ increase in rounds played year over year during their first year after introducing GolfBoard®. With the popularity of GolfBoarding continuing to grow, GolfBoard® rentals at Tetherow often exceed golf cart rentals.    We introduced GolfBoard® in 2014 at the PGA Merchandise Show where we immediately proceeded to win Best New Product. In the two years since, GolfBoard has won the 2016 Golf Digest Best Club Transport Award and has seen growing acceptance among PGA tour members and golf course managers. Initially sold just in the US, we have now expanded to 5 countries and over 200 golf courses worldwide. International demand is getting stronger every day, with international purchases having the potential to eventually match US sales.Examples of key customers include:Billy Casper Golf Management Company, one of the nation’s largest golf management companies, who owns over 50 courses and manages another 90. They have purchased over 100 boards for placement on over 20 courses.Troon Golf, which manages over 200 course worldwide initially launched a 2 course GolfBoard trial, and has since placed 20 boards on 6 courses under their management, with plans to grow their GolfBoard offering exponentially.Tetherow Golf Course, a single-owner course with an active golf community, was an early adapter that has now built their fleet to 33 boards.Peter Hill, Chairman & CEO, Billy Casper Golf, after several comprehensive beta tests labeled GolfBoard® “exactly what our Billy Casper Golf Ventures initiative seeks: a contemporary, exciting and differentiating identity to attract and retain players. Not only is ‘GolfBoarding’ a thrilling and quick way to get around the course, its turf friendly and delivers ROI to our operation”Kris Strauss, VP Sales & Marketing for Troon Golf has reported that on their early adopter courses,“We’ve seen the success of GolfBoard® at the handful of Troon courses who already have them, including the Westin Kierland Resort and Spa in Scottsdale, Makai Golf Course on Kauai and World Golf Village, and we’re excited to extend further adoption at Troon destinations around the world. Offering GolfBoards® is a great way to bring new people to golf, it makes rounds faster and it creates great buzz. Frankly they’re just a blast, and golfers of all ages can use them.”Golfboard® has benefited extensively from a broad scope of national media coverage including, the Golf Channel, Wall Street Journal, CBS This Morning, Fox Business News, CNBC, and CNN’s Living Golf, just to name a few. Visitgolfboard.com/golfboardtv.The combination of favorable feedback from key clients, user testimonials and ongoing media attention confirms the GolfBoard® has been a huge success, which is why we’re so excited about the growth potential of GolfBoard® as well as our upcoming launch of new board models for non-golf applications.    With the path already paved, we see a much more robust future in the works at Sol Board, Inc. beyond the GolfBoard®. Later this year, we will release our street-ready ResortBoard, with taller and wider wheels, higher maximum speed, greater curb clearance, versatile carry basket, plus lighting and reflector package. Our ResortBoard is designed primarily for commercial use such as factories and warehouses, plus recreational use at resorts and sightseeing destinations.Going forward, we have plans for a high performance BeachBoard that has a sand compatible tread pattern and more rugged suspension settings for off road use.  With the Beach Board, you can extreme off-road ride, surf sand dunes, or just take a relaxing ride down the beach at sunset.

These custom features include higher speed sports performance option, custom fenders and tires, brand enhancing decals, tablet and smart-phone mounting brackets, wireless speakers and more. It is anticipated that affluent buyers will strongly embrace the option to create their perfect board, driving incremental growth of direct to consumer sales.    The GolfBoard® was invented by co-founders Don Wildman and Laird Hamilton. As a means to get Laird (and his fellow surfers) to play more golf, the two longtime friends brainstormed about ways to make the game of golf more fun. The idea of GolfBoarding was born.While Laird is famous for chasing big waves and the many innovations he’s introduced to the world of surfing, Don is revered for redefining active aging, longevity, and healthy living, as well as what it means to be a serial entrepreneur. Having previously created the fitness company that would go on to become the wildly successful Bally Total Fitness, Don is still a world class athlete in several sports, and attributes constant fitness and exercise to his youthful spirit.The Sol Board, Inc. management team also consists of:John Wildman, Chairman & CEOPrior to joining the GolfBoard® team, John was with Bally Total Fitness for over 25 years in various sales and marketing positions, including Chief Marketing Officer and Chief Operating Officer.
