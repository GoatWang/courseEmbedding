History[edit]
Alliant Energy Corporation is a public utility holding company headquartered in Madison, Wisconsin. Alliant Energy's two regulated utilities include Interstate Power and Light Company (IPL) and Wisconsin Power and Light Company (WPL). IPL started in 1925 as the Interstate Power Company (IPC) and which was a consolidation of several small utility companies scattered across northern Iowa and southern Minnesota. IPC merged or consolidated with several other Iowa-based utilities before forming IPL, which was later merged with WPL.
IPC expanded greatly in the late 1920s to include operations in Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota, North and South Dakota, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Manitoba (Canada). One of the largest purchases in the late 1920s was the purchase of what became its northern Minnesota territory from the Wilbur Foshay interests. Also was widely carried along CSX Rail lines.
In the 1930s and 1940s, the effects of the Depression and passage of laws to regulate utility operations at the state and federal level had an effect on IPC as well as its neighbors. In Iowa, the legislature passed laws making it easier for cities to establish municipal utilities (and indeed, there are over 100 municipal utilities in Iowa today). By 1940, the state of Nebraska had passed laws that forced all investor-owned utilities in that state to sell their operations to one of several "public power districts" operating in that state.
During the 1940s, IPC divested itself of all its operations that were not part of its main territory in southern MN / northern Iowa. The largest chunk of territory was that operating in northeast ND / northern MN / Emerson, Manitoba which was sold in summer 1943 and fall 1944. The SD properties (around Winner) were sold in 1946. It would not be until 1956 when the last isolated district — the area around Waconia, MN — was sold to Northern States Power.
As IPC sold its properties that were isolated from the main system, it picked up others that were adjacent to its system and more easily interconnected: the Eastern Iowa Power system, and the Iowa / Minnesota properties of the Central States Power and Light Corporation.
The Wisconsin operations were sold to Wisconsin Power and Light (ironically, now the eastern half of Alliant's operations).
The other part of IPL — IES Utilities — incorporated in Iowa in 1925 as the Iowa Railway and Light Corporation and was later known as Iowa Electric Light and Power Company. IES expanded across that part of Iowa south of IPC's territory, eventually acquiring the Iowa operations of the Union Electric Company of St. Louis, MO.
IES and IPC merged in the mid-1990s to form IPL.[5] Today, IPL provides electricity and gas to communities in Iowa and southern Minnesota; while WPL serves southern and central Wisconsin.[4] In late 2007, Alliant Energy received final approval to sell their utility services in Illinois to Jo-Carroll Energy.
In 2000, the utility purchased the naming rights to the campus of the Dane County Expo Center just southwest of downtown Madison, including the county-owned arena, which were all renamed the Alliant Energy Center.
In the 1970s IES constructed the Duane Arnold Energy Center, a 615 MW nuclear plant in Palo, Iowa. In 2006, Alliant closed a deal with FPL Energy to sell their stake in the plant.[6]
Alliant Energy also provides several non-regulated services, including ground transportation and energy engineering (such as wind and geothermal energy).
In 2007 it acquired 200 MW Buffalo Creek Wind Farm at Hampton, Iowa from Wind Capital Group.[7]
Alliant Energy sold to ITC Holdings their transmission system( 34.5kV, 69kV, 115kV, 161kV and 345kV) in Iowa and Minnesota in 2007.
In 2015, the company finalized the sale of its Minnesota territory to a consortium of 12 electric cooperatives operating in that state.
Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 Alliant Energy shares are mainly held by institutional investors (Vanguard group, BlackRock, State Street Corporation, and others[8])

History[edit]
Alliant Energy Corporation is a public utility holding company headquartered in Madison, Wisconsin. Alliant Energy's two regulated utilities include Interstate Power and Light Company (IPL) and Wisconsin Power and Light Company (WPL). IPL started in 1925 as the Interstate Power Company (IPC) and which was a consolidation of several small utility companies scattered across northern Iowa and southern Minnesota. IPC merged or consolidated with several other Iowa-based utilities before forming IPL, which was later merged with WPL.
IPC expanded greatly in the late 1920s to include operations in Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota, North and South Dakota, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Manitoba (Canada). One of the largest purchases in the late 1920s was the purchase of what became its northern Minnesota territory from the Wilbur Foshay interests. Also was widely carried along CSX Rail lines.
In the 1930s and 1940s, the effects of the Depression and passage of laws to regulate utility operations at the state and federal level had an effect on IPC as well as its neighbors. In Iowa, the legislature passed laws making it easier for cities to establish municipal utilities (and indeed, there are over 100 municipal utilities in Iowa today). By 1940, the state of Nebraska had passed laws that forced all investor-owned utilities in that state to sell their operations to one of several "public power districts" operating in that state.
During the 1940s, IPC divested itself of all its operations that were not part of its main territory in southern MN / northern Iowa. The largest chunk of territory was that operating in northeast ND / northern MN / Emerson, Manitoba which was sold in summer 1943 and fall 1944. The SD properties (around Winner) were sold in 1946. It would not be until 1956 when the last isolated district — the area around Waconia, MN — was sold to Northern States Power.
As IPC sold its properties that were isolated from the main system, it picked up others that were adjacent to its system and more easily interconnected: the Eastern Iowa Power system, and the Iowa / Minnesota properties of the Central States Power and Light Corporation.
The Wisconsin operations were sold to Wisconsin Power and Light (ironically, now the eastern half of Alliant's operations).
The other part of IPL — IES Utilities — incorporated in Iowa in 1925 as the Iowa Railway and Light Corporation and was later known as Iowa Electric Light and Power Company. IES expanded across that part of Iowa south of IPC's territory, eventually acquiring the Iowa operations of the Union Electric Company of St. Louis, MO.
IES and IPC merged in the mid-1990s to form IPL.[5] Today, IPL provides electricity and gas to communities in Iowa and southern Minnesota; while WPL serves southern and central Wisconsin.[4] In late 2007, Alliant Energy received final approval to sell their utility services in Illinois to Jo-Carroll Energy.
In 2000, the utility purchased the naming rights to the campus of the Dane County Expo Center just southwest of downtown Madison, including the county-owned arena, which were all renamed the Alliant Energy Center.
In the 1970s IES constructed the Duane Arnold Energy Center, a 615 MW nuclear plant in Palo, Iowa. In 2006, Alliant closed a deal with FPL Energy to sell their stake in the plant.[6]
Alliant Energy also provides several non-regulated services, including ground transportation and energy engineering (such as wind and geothermal energy).
In 2007 it acquired 200 MW Buffalo Creek Wind Farm at Hampton, Iowa from Wind Capital Group.[7]
Alliant Energy sold to ITC Holdings their transmission system( 34.5kV, 69kV, 115kV, 161kV and 345kV) in Iowa and Minnesota in 2007.
In 2015, the company finalized the sale of its Minnesota territory to a consortium of 12 electric cooperatives operating in that state.
Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 Alliant Energy shares are mainly held by institutional investors (Vanguard group, BlackRock, State Street Corporation, and others[8])

How we restore your power






We're proud of our record of service. In recent years, nearly 75 percent of all power outages in our service territory have been repaired in two hours or less.
Assessing the situation
Every call helps our crews and operators. It helps us figure out how large the outage is and the cause of the outage.

Once an outage has been diagnosed, our Distribution Dispatch Center sends crews to repair any damaged equipment and get the power flowing again.
Outage protocols
Alliant Energy and other utility companies follow a standard protocol for restoring power quickly and safely:

Make sure police and fire departments and hospitals have power.
Check generation facilities to determine if the original power source is still operating.
Repair transmission lines that carry electricity from the generation stations to substations.
Repair substations where high-voltage power from the transmission lines is reduced for home usage.
Repair distribution lines that carry electricity from substations to each neighborhood.
Repair the tap lines that serve anywhere from 20-300 homes and businesses.
Reconnect lines to individual customers - this is the most difficult and time-consuming step in the restoration process.

When this process is complete, your home may still be without power. That means there is damage to your home's electrical system and a licensed electrician will be needed to complete the work.






Power blinks and power surges






Power blinks 
Have you ever come home to find your digital clocks flashing "12:00"? It's caused by a power blink - a brief interruption that's designed to prevent a longer power outage.

Blinks occur when an obstruction, like a tree limb, comes into contact with a power line or transformer. To prevent damage to the utility system or your home, a circuit breaker interrupts the electricity for a fraction of a second.

If the limb remains on the line, the breaker opens and tries to close again. If the obstruction is still on the line after the third try, the breaker opens and does not close automatically.

At this point, a utility worker must be dispatched to remove the obstruction and manually reset the breaker.

Power blinks rarely cause damage to equipment. Older digital clocks and other devices are the most vulnerable to blinks; newer models are designed to ride out these small voltage fluctuations.
Power surges
A power surge is a variation in electrical voltage. Power surges last less than 1/100th of a second and range in intensity depending on the situation.

Up to 80 percent of all power surges originate within the home - when devices with motors shut off or start up, diverting energy to and from other appliances. Common culprits of internal surges are power tools, refrigerators, printers and hair dryers. Smaller "everyday" surges can slowly destroy your expensive electric appliances - a process called "electronic rust."

External power surges are generally caused by uncontrollable events, such as lightning strikes, animals interfering with electrical equipment, and vehicle accidents with utility poles. Large power surges, such as lightning, can instantly ruin your TV, computer and other electronics. 
Is Alliant Energy responsible for power surges?
Alliant Energy is responsible only for surges that occur due to negligence of our personnel. Most surges are caused by factors outside of the control of telephone, cable and electric utilities.

We are not responsible for surges caused by lightning, animals, tree limbs, faulty wiring or surges created within your home or beyond control of Alliant Energy.
How can I protect my home electronics from power surges?
The best way to prevent damage from power surges is to invest in high-quality surge protectors. All programmable appliances should be connected to a surge protector, including home entertainment systems, computer equipment and other digital devices.

Also remember that power surges can come into your home through other utility lines as well as electrical, so be sure to connect incoming cable and satellite TV lines, and all telephone lines, including fax and modem.

Interstate Power and Light Company Clean Air Act Settlement





(Washington, DC – July 15, 2015) The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) today announced a global Clean Air Act settlement with Interstate Power and Light Company, (IPL) that will cover seven coal-fired power plants located in Allamakee, Clinton, Des Moines, Dubuque, Linn, Marshall, and Wapello counties in Iowa. IPL approached the EPA in late 2011 to explore a voluntary system-wide Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) settlement at its Iowa units. IPL operates the plants in Iowa that are covered by the settlement. The State of Iowa, the County of Linn, Iowa, and the Sierra Club are co-plaintiffs to the settlement. IPL has agreed to invest more than $620 million in pollution control technology that will protect public health and resolve violations of the Clean Air Act. The settlement will require that IPL spend $6 million on environmental mitigation projects and pay a civil penalty of $1.1 million.

Overview of Company
The IPL plants serve approximately 530,000 electric customers in residential, agricultural, industrial, and commercial markets in Iowa. IPL operates the seven coal-fired power plants, all located in Iowa, with a total capacity of 1,900 megawatts (MW). The Burlington Plant consists of one coal-fired electric utility steam generating unit identified as Unit 1, with a rated capacity of 212 MW.  The Dubuque Plant consists of three coal-fired electric utility steam generating unit identified as Units 1, 5, and 6, with a rated capacity of 38 MW, 29 MW, and 15 MW, respectively. The Lansing Plant consists of one coal-fired electric utility steam generating unit identified as Unit 4, with a rated capacity of 275 MW. The ML Kapp Plant consists of one coal-fired electric utility steam generating unit identified as Unit 2, with a rated capacity of 219 MW.  The Ottumwa Plant consists of one coal-fired electric utility steam generating units identified as Unit 1, with a rated capacity of 726 MW. The Prairie Creek Plant consists of four coal-fired electric utility steam generating units identified as Units 1, 2, 3 and 4, with a rated capacity of  heat input of 245 million British Thermal Units per hour (mmBTU/hr), a heat input of 304 mmBTU/hr, 50 MW, and 149 MW, respectively. The Sutherland Plant consists of two coal-fired electric utility steam generating units identified as Units 1 and 3, with a rated capacity of 38 MW and 82 MW, respectively.
Top of Page
Violations
The EPA determined that IPL commenced construction of one or more major modifications, as defined in the CAA and implementing regulations, at the Lansing and Ottumwa plants, in violation of PSD. Such modifications resulted in significant net emissions increases, as defined by the relevant PSD regulations, of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and/or sulfur dioxide (SO2). IPL approached the EPA in late 2011 to explore a system-wide PSD settlement at its Iowa units. The parties initiated settlement discussions in November 2011.
Top of Page
Injunctive Relief
The consent decree secures injunctive relief from all of IPL’s coal-fired power units.  Compliance with the settlement will reduce SO2, NOx, and particulate matter (PM) emissions by approximately 36,300 tons per year from 2011 levels.  The EPA estimates that the cost of the injunctive relief will be more than $620 million. 
The settlement includes:
Retirement of Lansing Unit 1, Lansing Unit 2, Lansing Unit 3, M.L. Kapp Unit 1, Sutherland Unit 2, Sixth Street Unit 1, Sixth Street Unit 2, Sixth Street Unit 3, Sixth Street Unit 4, and Sixth Street Unit 5 upon entry of the consent decree.
Retirement or repowering of Dubuque Unit 1, Dubuque Unit 5, Dubuque Unit 6, Sutherland Unit 1, and Sutherland Unit 3 by June 1, 2019.
Retirement or refueling of M.L. Kapp Unit 2 by June 1, 2015, of Burlington Unit 1 and Prairie Creek Unit 4 by December 31, 2020, and of Prairie Creek boiler 1, Prairie Creek boiler 2, and Prairie Creek Unit 3 by December 31, 2025.
Continuous operation of selective catalytic reduction at Lansing Unit 4, and compliance with a 30-day rolling average emission rate for NOx of no greater than 0.090 lb/mmBTU (by January 31, 2015) and a 30-day rolling average emission rate for NOx of no greater than 0.080 lb/mmBTU (by December 31, 2015).
Continuous operation of a low NOx combustion system at Ottumwa Unit 1 and compliance with (a) a 30-day rolling average emission rate for NOx of no greater than 0.210 lb/mmBTU, and (b) a 12-month rolling average emission rate for NOx of no greater than 0.160 lb/mmBTU, by no later than 60 days upon entry of the consent decree.
Installation and continuous operation of selective catalytic reduction (or alternate equivalent NOx control technology approved pursuant to the consent decree) at Ottumwa Unit 1 by December 31, 2019, and compliance with a 30-day rolling average emission rate for NOx of no greater than 0.080 lb/mmBTU.
Installation and continuous operation of dry flue gas desulfurization at Ottumwa Unit 1 (by December 31, 2015) and at Lansing Unit 4 (by December 31, 2016), and compliance with a 30-day rolling average SO2 emission rate of no greater than 0.075 lb/mmBTU.
Compliance with annual system--and for Prairie Creek plant--tonnage limitations for NOx and SO2.
Annual surrender of any excess SO2 and NOx allowances resulting from actions taken under the consent decree. 
Top of Page
Pollutant Reductions
As compared to IPL’s 2011 emissions, EPA expects the following emission reductions to result from this settlement:
SO2 about 32,500 tons per year
NOx about 3,800 tons per year
Top of Page
Health Effects and Environmental Benefits
The pollutants reduced under this settlement have numerous adverse environmental and health effects. Sulfur dioxides and nitrogen oxides can be converted to fine particulate matter once in the air.  Fine particulates can be breathed in and lodged deep in the lungs, leading to a variety of health problems and even premature death. Other health and environmental impacts from the pollutants addressed in this settlement include the following: 
Sulfur dioxide – High concentrations of SO2 affect breathing and may aggravate existing respiratory and cardiovascular disease. Sensitive populations include asthmatics, individuals with bronchitis or emphysema, children, and the elderly. Sulfur dioxide is also a primary contributor to acid deposition, or acid rain.
Particulate matter – Short term exposure to particulate matter can aggravate lung disease, cause asthma attacks and acute bronchitis, may increase susceptibility to respiratory infections and has been linked to heart attacks.
Nitrogen oxides – Nitrogen oxides can cause ground-level ozone, acid rain, particulate matter, global warming, water quality deterioration, and visual impairment. Nitrogen oxides play a major role, with volatile organic chemicals, in the atmospheric reactions that produce ozone. Children, people with lung diseases such as asthma, and people who work or exercise outside are susceptible to adverse effects such as damage to lung tissue and reduction in lung function
Top of Page
Environmental Mitigation Projects
The proposed consent decree requires the IPL defendants to spend not less than $6 million on environmental mitigation projects.
Major solar photovoltaic development project
The major solar photovoltaic development power purchase agreement project allows IPL to elect to submit a plan to spend up to $3,000,000 to execute a long term PPA with one or more third-party project developers who will then develop new solar PV installations to be located in Iowa. The agreement will include a term of at least 10 years for which IPL commits to purchase the power generated and, if generated, acquire associated renewable energy credits (RECs) from the solar PV installations. IPL is not allowed to use, and must retire, all RECs generated during the first 10 years of performance and must identify these RECs as retired in a tracking system designated as acceptable by the program recognizing the RECs. The proposed consent decree prohibits IPL from using the RECs generated during the initial 10 years of the agreement(s) for compliance with any renewable portfolio standard or for any other compliance purpose during or after the initial 10 years. The project is expected to promote the development of solar energy.
Anaerobic digestion installation project
The anaerobic digestion installation project allows IPL to elect to submit a plan to spend up to $3,000,000 to develop a new or expand an existing anaerobic digester with nutrient recovery or nutrient removal at one or more farms or other agricultural facilities, properties, or operations in Iowa (i.e., project beneficiaries). IPL will fund one or more service contracts for the benefit of the project beneficiary that provides for operation and maintenance of the projects for 20 years from the date of operation. The project service contracts will provide for annual system checkups and for normal component maintenance and replacements, including installation of new system components as needed to ensure the ongoing maintenance and performance of the system for no less than 20 years.

Coal-fired boiler replacement in schools
The coal-fired boiler replacement project allows IPL to elect to submit a plan to fund up to $1,500,000 to use in the replacement (including design, equipment purchase, installation, and project start up) of one or more coal-fired boilers utilized by public schools located in Iowa through installation of a natural gas boiler or geothermal technologies. In awarding funding, IPL shall consider the following factors: (1) capability of the school to participate in, complete, and operate a replacement project; (2) proximity of the school to the Defendant’s facilities in the state of Iowa; (3) emissions reductions that will result from the Project; and (4) experience and demonstrated interest of applicant.
Compressed natural gas or alternative fuel fleet replacement project
The compressed natural gas (CNG) or alternative fuel fleet replacement project allows IPL to submit a plan to spend up to $500,000 to replace gasoline and diesel powered fleet vehicles located in IPL’s service territory (passenger cars, light trucks, and heavy duty service vehicles) with newly manufactured alternative fuels vehicles and/or CNG vehicles. Alternative fuel vehicles include hybrid vehicles, plug-in hybrid vehicles, plug-in battery vehicles, or electric vehicles. Upgraded fleet vehicles may be owned by IPL or may be publicly-owned motor vehicles. IPL shall only receive credit toward project dollars for the incremental cost of qualifying vehicles as compared to the cost of a newly manufactured, similar motor vehicle powered by conventional diesel or gasoline engines. The replacement of gasoline and diesel vehicles with alternative fuels vehicles or CNG vehicles will reduce emissions of NOx, PM, volatile organic compounds, and other air pollutants.
Residential woodstove/fireplace change-out project
The residential woodstove/fireplace change-out project allows IPL to propose a plan to spend up to $1.5 million to sponsor a wood-burning appliance change out and retrofit project in Linn County and IPL’s extended service territories in Iowa. The air pollutant reductions shall be obtained by replacing, retrofitting, or upgrading inefficient, higher polluting wood burning appliances, including fireplaces, with cleaner burning appliances and technologies, such as: (1) retrofitting older hydronic heaters (aka outdoor wood boilers) to meet EPA Phase II hydronic heater standards; (2) replacing older hydronic heaters with EPA Phase II hydronic heaters, or replacing EPA-certified woodstoves with other cleaner burning, more energy efficient hearth appliances (e.g., wood pellet, gas or propane appliances), or EPA Energy Star qualified heating appliances; (3) replacing non EPA-certified woodstoves with EPA-certified woodstoves or cleaner burning, more energy-efficient hearth appliances; (4) replacing spent catalysts in EPA-certified woodstoves; and (5) replacing/retrofitting wood burning fireplaces with EPA Phase II qualified retrofit devices or cleaner burning natural gas fireplaces. To qualify for replacement, retrofitting, or upgrading, the wood burning appliance/fireplace must be in regular use in a primary residence during the home-heating season, and preference shall be given to replacement, retrofitting, or upgrading wood burning appliances/fireplaces that are a primary or significant source of residential heat. The intent of the projects would be to reduce fine particle pollution and hazardous air pollutants in areas.

CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa, Nov. 14, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Interstate Power and Light Company (IPL), a subsidiary of Alliant Energy Corporation, (NYSE:   LNT), filed today with the Iowa Utilities Board (IUB) two applications seeking regulatory approval for construction of the proposed Marshalltown Generating Station (MGS) in Marshalltown, Iowa. 
(Logo:  http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20020405/LNTLOGO)
"Regulatory approval is the next step in the process to construct MGS," says Tom Aller, President - IPL. "The applications filed today demonstrate the need for MGS and how the proposed natural gas-fired generating station contributes to IPL's long-term energy resource plan. The energy resources plan balances the company's supply of energy resources, provides safe and reliable service and maintains competitive costs for the benefit of customers."
The complete filings are available on the IUB's electronic filing system. The filings are docket numbers GCU-2012-0001 and RPU-2012-0003.
IPL's application for generation siting certification (siting certification) must demonstrate that construction and operation of the MGS reasonably utilizes the state's land, air and water resources. Also, operation of the MGS must be consistent with the reliable electric operations of the utility and the Iowa Legislature's intent to spur Iowa's economic development. 
The IUB's decision to grant a certificate for construction of the proposed MGS is contingent upon IPL receiving all necessary permits and regulatory approvals related to the proposed project. 
IPL is also required to seek IUB approval of proposed ratemaking principles prior to investing in the project. Ratemaking principles are fixed for the life of the facility.
IPL expects to receive an IUB decision on its application for the siting certification and the ratemaking principles in the fourth quarter 2013.
IPL also expects to make related filings with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission in the next 30 days. 
In August 2012, IPL announced its long-term energy resources plan. The plan further balances IPL's supply of generating resources:

Approximate $440 million in investments to reduce emissions and increase efficiency of IPL's existing coal-fired generating units 
Execution of a new nuclear purchase power agreement to purchase 431 megawatts of capacity and energy from Duane Arnold Energy Center 
Approximate $650-$750 million investment, excluding AFUDC and transmission upgrades, for construction of the combined-cycle, natural gas-fired Marshalltown Generating Station 
Continued commitment to renewable resources and energy efficiency. 
More information about IPL's energy resource plan is available at www.alliantenergy.com.
