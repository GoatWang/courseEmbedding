FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

TEEKAY MARINE MARKETS - TANKER UPDATE










Monthly Tanker Insights
In 2016, earnings across the tanker sector did average lower than 2015 – yet still met the 10 year average. 2017 is expected to continue to be a challenging year for tanker earnings but we think that the bottom might be reached in 2018. Given our outlook on supply and demand, our prospects from 2018 onwards are much brighter and we would expect a pretty strong tanker market to emerge towards the end of the decade.

Reports First Quarter 2017 ResultsMarketwiredMay 18, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareHAMILTON, BERMUDA--(Marketwired - May 18, 2017) -HighlightsReported GAAP net income of $2.8 million, or $0.02 per share, and adjusted net income(1) of $7.0 million, or $0.04 per share, in the first quarter of 2017. Generated free cash flow(1) of $34.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. Declared cash dividend of $0.03 per share for the first quarter of 2017, representing the minimum quarterly dividend. In April 2017, Teekay Tankers signed a term sheet for a sale-leaseback financing for four of its modern Suezmax tankers, which is expected to increase liquidity by approximately $30 million. Completed the sale of two older Suezmax tankers in January and March 2017 and agreed to sell an older Aframax tanker, the Kyeema Spirit, which is scheduled to deliver in the second quarter of 2017. Teekay Tankers Ltd. (Teekay Tankers or the Company) (TNK) today reported the Company's results for the quarter ended March 31, 2017:    Three Months Ended   (in thousands of U.S. dollars, except per share data) March 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 March 31, 2016   GAAP FINANCIAL COMPARISON         Total revenues 125,096 117,704 164,950   Income from vessel operations 9,012 5,660 53,838   Net income 2,828 6,846 38,980   Earnings per share 0.02 0.04 0.25   Weighted-average number of common shares - basic 164,352,065 156,712,832 156,083,657   NON-GAAP FINANCIAL COMPARISON         Adjusted net income (1) 7,028 5,104 45,958   Adjusted net income per share (1) 0.04 0.03 0.29   Total cash flow from vessel operations (1) 42,471 43,134 86,225   Free cash flow (1) 34,358 34,207 66,218              (1) These are non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to "Definitions and Non-GAAP Financial Measures" and the Appendices to this release for definitions of these terms and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures as used in this release to the most directly comparable financial measures under United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  GAAP net income and adjusted net income were affected by lower spot tanker rates in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period of the prior year. GAAP net income was also affected by losses on the sales of two Suezmax tankers and two Medium Range (MR) tankers, which were sold in the first quarter of 2017 and the second half of 2016, respectively.GAAP net income and adjusted net income were positively impacted by higher spot tanker rates in the Company's Aframax and LR2 product tanker fleets in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, as well as lower freight tax accruals. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 was also affected by lower unrealized gains on derivative instruments, partially offset by lower losses on vessel sales.CEO Commentary "During the first quarter of 2017, we generated cash flow from operations of $34.4 million, and paid a quarterly dividend of 3 cents per share," commented Kevin Mackay, Teekay Tankers' President and Chief Executive Officer. "While spot tanker rates were largely in-line with those for the fourth quarter of 2016, the tanker market experienced downward pressure over the course of the recent quarter, primarily due to heavy refinery maintenance, OPEC supply cuts and higher tanker fleet growth. Overall, we anticipate the tanker market to weaken into 2017 as a result of ongoing OPEC supply cuts and higher tanker fleet growth; however, robust global oil demand growth and changing trading patterns due to OPEC supply cuts are expected to provide support to mid-size tanker demand as more crude oil moves long-haul from the Atlantic basin to Asia. Looking ahead to 2018, we anticipate a renewed market upturn driven by a lack of new tanker ordering, increased scrapping due to regulatory changes, and a more balanced oil market.""In addition to completing the sale and delivery of our older tonnage and generating strong cash flow from operations during the quarter, we are continuing to focus on further strengthening our balance sheet," commented Mr. Mackay. "We have recently signed a term sheet on a 12-year sale-leaseback financing transaction for four of our modern Suezmax tankers. Once finalized, this transaction is expected to increase our liquidity position by approximately $30 million and strengthen our financial position to manage the current spot market weakness, while maintaining our exposure to what we anticipate will be a renewed tanker market upturn in 2018."Summary of Recent DevelopmentsSale-Leaseback Financing TransactionIn April 2017, Teekay Tankers signed a term sheet for a $153 million, 12-year sale-leaseback financing relating to four of its modern Suezmax tankers. The transaction, once completed, is expected to further strengthen the Company's balance sheet and increase the Company's liquidity position by approximately $30 million. The transaction, which is subject to final lessor approval and customary closing conditions, is expected to be completed in mid-2017.Sale of an Older Aframax TankerIn March 2017, Teekay Tankers agreed to sell a 1999-built Aframax tanker, the Kyeema Spirit, to a third party for proceeds of approximately $7.5 million, which is scheduled to deliver in the second quarter of 2017.Secured Additional Fixed-Rate CharterSince February 2017, Teekay Tankers entered into a time charter-out contract for one Suezmax tanker at a rate of approximately $21,000 per day and a firm period of one year, plus an extension option, which commenced in early-April 2017.Tanker Market Although the Company recorded stronger average spot tanker rates for its Aframax and LR2 Product tanker fleets and rates similar for its Suezmax tanker in the first quarter of 2017, compared with rates for the fourth quarter 2016, the tanker market experienced downward pressure over the course of the first quarter due to heavy refinery maintenance, OPEC supply cuts and higher tanker fleet growth. However, changing trade patterns due to OPEC production cuts have provided support for mid-sized spot tanker rates, as a decline in Middle Eastern oil exports resulted in an increase in ton-mile intensive Atlantic Basin to Asia oil movements.Read MoreSince the start of 2017, OPEC has implemented 1.2 million barrels per day (mb/d) of oil production cuts in an effort to rebalance oil prices. Compliance with these cuts by OPEC members was 92 percent as of March 2017, with most cuts coming from Saudi Arabia. While OPEC cuts are negative for overall oil volumes available for transport, the mid-sized segments have found some support from increased ton-mile demand as Asian buyers look to Atlantic Basin supply to replace reduced OPEC barrels. For the first four months of 2017, U.S. crude exports averaged 0.4 mb/d higher year-on-year, and reached 1.0 mb/d by mid-March 2017. Overall, U.S. crude volumes are increasingly moving to Asian and European buyers, which is supportive of mid-sized tanker demand. In February 2017, China imported 0.3 mb/d of U.S. crude, overtaking Canada as the largest importer of U.S. crude.In addition to these positive trade fundamentals, global oil demand growth remains robust with forecast growth of approximately 1.3 mb/d in 2017, according to the IEA. This growth is expected to provide further support for mid-sized tanker rates during an otherwise challenging freight rate environment.In 2017, the Company anticipates high tanker fleet growth to present headwinds to the crude spot tanker market. During the first four months of 2017, the world tanker fleet grew by 12.1 million deadweight tons (mdwt), or 2.2 percent. Total tanker fleet growth for 2017 is forecast to be 24.1 mdwt, or approximately 4.3 percent, which is slightly lower than 2016 but consistent with the ten-year average. Mid-size tanker fleet growth is expected to be around 10.7 mdwt, or approximately 5.6 percent, for 2017. After two years of record low scrapping, the Company believes that scrapping has the potential to ramp up in the near-term given the current weakness in spot tanker rates combined with an aging fleet across all segments. New regulations, including ballast water management, may also increase scrapping in the medium-term.Overall, the Company expects 2017 to be a year of softer tanker rates compared to 2016. However, growing crude oil supply in the Atlantic moving long-haul to Asia is expected to provide some underlying support to help offset the negative fundamentals of lower OPEC supply and a period of higher fleet growth. The Company anticipates this near-term dip in the market cycle to be relatively short-term in nature, as a lack of new tanker ordering in the mid-sized segments and increased scrapping due to regulatory changes, as well as a more balanced oil market, is expected to lead to a renewed market upturn in 2018.Operating Results The following table highlights the operating performance of the Company's time-charter vessels and spot vessels trading in revenue sharing arrangements (RSAs), voyage charters and full service lightering measured in net revenues(1) per revenue day, or time-charter equivalent (TCE) rates, before related-party pool management fees, related-party commissions and off-hire bunker expenses:    Three Months Ended     March 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 March 31, 2016   Time Charter-Out Fleet         Suezmax revenue days(i) 485 390 189   Suezmax TCE per revenue day $25,566 $27,825 $32,106   Aframax revenue days(i) 531 540 633   Aframax TCE per revenue day $22,851 $23,132 $22,768   LR2 revenue days(i) 270 247 91   LR2 TCE per revenue day $19,809 $19,532 $25,388             Spot Fleet         Suezmax revenue days(i) 1,305 1,573 1,696   Suezmax spot TCE per revenue day(ii) $21,868 $22,422 $36,145   Aframax revenue days(i) 1,264 1,240 1,522   Aframax spot TCE per revenue day(iii) $18,874 $17,542 $26,938   LR2 revenue days(i) 450 460 679   LR2 spot TCE per revenue day $18,354 $13,885 $23,687   MR revenue days(i) - 48 182   MR spot TCE per revenue day - $11,954 $18,629             Total Fleet         Suezmax revenue days(i) 1,790 1,963 1,885   Suezmax TCE per revenue day $22,870 $23,495 $35,739   Aframax revenue days(i) 1,795 1,780 2,155   Aframax TCE per revenue day $20,050 $19,238 $25,714   LR2 revenue days(i) 720 707 770   LR2 TCE per revenue day $18,900 $15,857 $23,888   MR revenue days(i) - 48 182   MR TCE per revenue day - $11,954 $18,629              (i) Revenues Days are the total number of calendar days the Company's vessels were in its possession during a period, less the total number of off-hire days during the period associated with major repairs, dry dockings or special or intermediate surveys. Consequently, revenue days represents the total number of days available for the vessel to earn revenue. Idle days which are days when the vessel is available for the vessel to earn revenue yet is not employed, are included in revenue days.         (ii) Includes vessels trading in the Teekay Suezmax RSA, Gemini Suezmax pool and non-pool voyage charters.         (iii) Includes vessels trading in the Teekay Aframax RSA, Teekay Aframax Classic RSA, non-pool voyage charters and full service lightering voyages.          (1) Net revenues is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please refer to "Definitions and Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for a definition of this term.

These non-GAAP financial measures, which include Adjusted Net Income, Free Cash Flow, Net Revenues and Cash Flow from Vessel Operations, are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these measures do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The Company believes that certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's financial performance, as does management.Adjusted Net IncomeAdjusted net income excludes from net income items of income or loss that are typically excluded by securities analysts in their published estimates of the Company's financial results, as outlined in Appendix A of this release. The Company believes that certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's financial performance as does management. Please refer to Appendix A of this release for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements.Free Cash FlowFree cash flow (FCF) represents net income, plus depreciation and amortization, unrealized losses from derivatives, certain non-cash items, FCF from the equity accounted investments, loss on sale of vessel, and any write-offs or other non-recurring items, less unrealized gains from derivatives, equity income from the equity accounted investments, gain on sale of vessel and certain other non-cash items. The Company has included FCF from the equity accounted investments as a component of our FCF. FCF from the equity accounted investments represents the Company's proportionate share of FCF from its equity-accounted investments. The Company does not control its equity-accounted investments. Consequently, the Company does not have the unilateral ability to determine whether the cash generated by its equity-accounted investments is retained within the equity accounted investment or distributed to the Company and other shareholders. In addition, the Company does not control the timing of such distributions to the Company and other shareholders. Consequently, readers are cautioned when using FCF as a liquidity measure as the amount contributed from FCF from the equity accounted investments may not be available to the Company in the periods such free cash flow is generated by the equity accounted investments. The Company believes that certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's financial and operating performance and to assess the Company's ability to generate cash sufficient to repay debt, pay dividends and undertake capital and dry dock expenditures. Please refer to Appendix B to this release for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements.Net RevenuesNet revenues represent revenues less voyage expenses. Because the amount of voyage expenses the Company incurs for a particular charter depends upon the type of the charter, the Company uses net revenues to improve the comparability between periods of reported revenues that are generated by the different types of charters and contracts. The Company principally uses net revenues, a non-GAAP financial measure, because the Company believes it provides more meaningful information about the deployment of the Company's vessels and their performance than does revenues, the most directly comparable financial measure under GAAP.Cash Flow From Vessel OperationsCash flow from vessel operations (CFVO) represents income from vessel operations before depreciation and amortization expense, amortization of in-process revenue contracts, vessel write-downs, and gains or losses on the sale of vessels and equipment. CFVO - Consolidated represents CFVO from vessels that are consolidated on the Company's financial statements. CFVO - Equity Investments represents the Company's proportionate share of CFVO from its equity accounted investments. The Company does not control the equity accounted investments. Consequently, the Company does not have the unilateral ability to determine whether the cash generated by the equity accounted investments is retained within the equity accounted investment or distributed to the Company and other shareholders. In addition, the Company does not control the timing of such distributions to the Company and other shareholders. Consequently, readers are cautioned when using total CFVO as a liquidity measure as the amount contributed from CFVO - Equity Investments may not be available to the Company in the periods such CFVO is generated by the equity accounted investments. CFVO is a non-GAAP financial measure used by certain investors to measure the financial performance of companies, as does management. Please refer to Appendices C of this release for reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to income from vessel operations and income from vessel operations of equity accounted investments, respectively, the most directly comparable GAAP measures reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements.
