Introducing ClickBank Joint Venture


At ClickBank, we recognize that partnerships are among the biggest keys to success in the affiliate marketing business. Having great relationships with other people in the industry such as affiliates, copywriters, subject matter experts, virtual assistants, or affiliate managers can be the difference between making a few dollars online and having a thriving Internet-based business.
Until now, managing the administratoristrative side of partnerships, whether it’s figuring out revenue sharing on a given sale or working with affiliate managers to determine the effectiveness of referred affiliates, has been challenging and time-consuming, if not impossible. With that in mind, ClickBank is very proud and excited to announce the availability of our extensive new Joint Venture capabilities.
ClickBank Joint Venture is a powerful new way to automate payouts, refunds, bonuses and more between multiple parties. It even allows for something which many ClickBank clients have wanted for a long time, which is 2nd tier affiliate commissions!
Joint Venture includes four different types of JV contracts you can create, with each serving a unique and useful function:

Traditional JV Contract– Allows a product vendor to give a portion of their earnings from a sale to another client, such as a partner, copywriter, designer, customer service manager, or anyone they wish.
Upsell JV Contract- Allows a product vendor to upsell another vendor’s product and split the proceeds of the sale however they wish.
Affiliate Referral Contract- Commonly referred to as 2nd tier affiliate commissions, this type of JV allows a product vendor to share a portion of their earnings with an affiliate manager or JV broker who referred the affiliate that led to a particular sale.
Affiliate JV Contract- Allows two or more affiliates to share the affiliate commission on a sale. This is a great way for affiliates to partner on an advertising campaign or collaborate on projects.

For more information on how to set up and use all the different kinds of Joint Venture contracts, please see our Joint Venture Help Center article!

What's Happenin' @ JVNotifyPro 2.0?





There's Only 2 Factors That Matter
By: Chris Freville · Featured Articles · Internet Marketing & Business


With over 100 different ways to make money online, many marketers are surprised to learn there are only 2 factors that matter. In fact, these are the ONLY 2 factors which can affect your income. You will not make a single penny online unless you have these 2 very important factors.(read more)
	





Niche Marketing Isn't Dead
By: Michael Rasmussen · Featured Articles · Internet Marketing & Business


Here’s a secret very few people will let you in on…niche marketing isn’t dead. In fact, it’s never been stronger. That’s why ClickBank is thriving. If you can find a niche hungry for a digital information product, you still can create a nice income stream for yourself.
Actually, the market is even better today, because most niches now have micro-niches that let you laser target your product. (read more)







Why a sales page with a money back guarantee converts better.
By: William E  Burton · Posted On: May 11, 2017, 12:40 am  Topic: JV Marketing Articles






There are so many people who buy things online these days. Online shopping is much more convenient than buying from a store. Also when someone buys something online they often have many more options to fit their customized needs. They can often find things in more colors that they can in the stores. They can find things that can fit the style of their home, the style of their wardrobe or the style of their life much better when they shop online. However, one of the many things that someone will look at when they are purchasing something online is a money back guarantee. This is why a sales page that has a money back guarantee will convert to better sales.

How to better your sales page?

You can lower the risk that customers are putting in when you have testimonials on your site of how great your product is and when you provide a money back guarantee that helps so much more as well. The way that your customers portray you and what they say about your product is the way that other potential customers are going to view you as well. The money back guarantee will allow more people to trust in your company and in your sales.

What about offering 30 day money back guarantees or 60 day money back guarantees?

As previously mentioned when you offer a money back guarantee you are going to see that your sales page with this guarantee will help you to convert your product into many more sales. When you offer a 30 day money back guarantee or a 60 day money back guarantee, then you are doing something positive with your product. You are making sure that your customers see that you trust in your own product enough that you are willing to offer your customers this guarantee to prove how much you trust in it. The old saying that, “you put your money where your mouth is,” is really a great one and it applies excellent to any business sales page and money back guarantees. 

When you are building your website to sell a product you should always make sure that you put some time into the sales page. The more time you put into your sales page the better. This page should include customer testimonials and more. If you provide the money back guarantee on your sales page you should start to see that guarantee will convert your product into more sales. The money back guarantee really is something that the majority of customers will look for before they purchase a product. If you trust in your product enough then you will provide this guarantee. By providing this guarantee, your customers and potential customers will know and believe that you trust in your product enough that you are willing to guarantee the cost. This is an excellent sales strategy and for all true business goers, offering this guarantee will help.(read more)

Aidan Booth, Steve Clayton + Matt Carter - BlackBird Launch Affiliate Program JV
By: Mike Merz · Posted On: July 20, 2017, 11:04 am  Topic: JVNP 2.0 Premium VIP JV Announcements






Welcome to the JVNP 2.0 Update featuring a JV request courtesy of fellow JVNP 2.0 Partners Aidan Booth, Steve Clayton + Matt Carter (BlackBird Azon seller tools & training package launch JVZoo affiliate program JV invite), Buzz Builders, and More ... in Today's what's the word? BlackBird edition.

    - Mike Merz Sr

Aidan Booth, Steve Clayton + Matt Carter – BlackBird Launch Affiliate Program JV Invite
    Launch Date: Monday, August 21st 2017

    Hi, Fellow JVNP 2.0 Partner,

Aidan Booth here on behalf of Steven Clayton and Matt Carter.

    We are extremely excited to announce the launch of BlackBird, the underground software and training that fuels over $10 Million in monthly sales.

Short on Time? Jump right on over to the JV Page.

BlackBird is the secret weapon that provides complete all-in- one coverage to Amazon sellers as well as comprehensive start-to- finish training for people looking to get started selling on Amazon.

    This software eliminates the need for the likes of Feedback Genius, Jungle Scout, Splitly, Manage By Stats, Feedback Five, AMZ Tracker and a host of other inferior and incomplete tools. In addition to state-of- the-art software, BlackBird provides users with over 70 training videos, unique on-demand ‘Grab-A- Guru’ strategic support, and much more.

What can YOU expect…

    With a current user-base of over 1,200 Amazon sellers, BlackBird is ready to EXPLODE. This is the first (and possibly the last) chance to cash in with 100% commissions on the initial sales, and 50% commission thereafter, for LIFE.

And… with a history of multi-million dollar launches to our name, including the #1 launch on JVZoo in history, we know how to convert your visitors in to buyers, and KEEP them subscribed and happy month-after-month. The number of testimonials we’ve collected from our current users is off-the- charts and the undeniable proof that we have is almost unprecedented.

Not only that, we also have a "Secret Weapon" in the form of Grab-A- Guru, direct access to get on-demand support from 5-figure Amazon sellers. This is unheard of, but it’s exactly what we offer our users.

    Get ready for $97/sale (average recurring value is $776), and to cash in on the 100% commissions and $40,000 prize pool.

GET REGISTERED TODAY: for the full details, please go here and sign up to the JV list.

    You will receive contest details, swipe files, banners, and anything else you might need to REALLY make a lot of money promoting BlackBird.

    Thanks for your support!

Aidan Booth, Steve Clayton & Matt Carter

Linn, Citizen form Anadarko Basin joint venture

                posted 21 days ago



A new joint venture based in Oklahoma has been created to focus on the prolific Merge, South Central Oklahoma Oil Province (SCOOP) and Sooner Trend Anadarko Basin Canadian and Kingfisher Counties (STACK) plays. 
Houston-based Linn Energy and Tulsa, Oklahoma-based Citizen Energy II agreed to form the 50:50 joint venture, known as Roan Resources. The deal is anticipated to close in the third quarter, and the joint venture is expected to pursue an initial public offering (IPO) in early 2018, subject to market conditions, the companies said in a June 27 statement. 
Roan will be independently managed, with a separate board of directors comprised of four Linn-designated directors, four Citizen-designated directors and a jointly appointed CEO. The joint venture is expected to establish a new revolving credit facility secured by its own assets, the statement said.
Linn and Citizen will each contribute about 70,000 net acres (283 square km) to the joint venture, located across Oklahoma’s Canadian, Carter, Cleveland, Garvin, Grady, Kingfisher, McClain and Stephens counties. In exchange for their respective contributions, Linn and Citizen will equally split the equity interest in Roan, where the “per well economics compare favourably with the very best, Tier-1 areas in the STACK and Permian Basin”, the statement said.

Simple Flow Chart for an Email Marketing Joint Venture Campaign




What are the sequence of steps involved in a joint venture email campaign? That’s the question I was answering when I sketched this flow chart for a client to illustrate an email joint venture that we are developing and which will be launched within a few days.
In short, three email messages will be sent to the subscribers of Joint Venture Partner (A) over the course of 2 weeks.  The emails will offer a free video and a series of three downloads in exchange for their names and emails.
Some percentage of interested subscribers from the email database of Joint Venture Partner (A) will be directed to the landing page of my client (Joint Venture Partner B) to view a video that will further inspire and encourage the visitors to subscribe to the offer.
Although the primary intent of the video message is to increase the percentage of subscribers via this video Landing Page, a secondary purpose is to develop a relationship with the visitors that positions the subject of the video as a thought leader in his niche industry.
Once the subscribers have entered their names and emails (and optional phone number), they will be directed to a “Success” page which features a one-question poll to gather additional info from the subscribers, which will be used for the marketing of follow-up products/services.
These new subscribers will instantly receive the first PDF download, via email, and will receive PDF downloads #2 and #3 over the following 10 days, also via email, which will familiarize the subscribers to the ongoing email newsletter which will continue on into the future offering valuable information, as well as offers for products and services, all specifically relevant to the same niche subject.
Joint Venture Partner (A) will also share in the profits generated by this campaign that I have developed for this client.
Once this campaign has run its course, a new one will be initiated with a different joint venture partner.  Furthermore, additional subscriber generating strategies will be developed, tested and refined, as part of an ongoing process of increasing leads and sales.
UPDATE: Here’s another email flow chart:

Partner or Strategic Alliance? 








































Business Success CenterProven Growth Structure to Take You to the Top 


 




Partner or Strategic Alliance?
March 9, 2013 By Jan Triplett Leave a Comment Partner or Strategic Business Alliance? Photo by Giorgio Montersino.
Partner or a strategic alliance — which is better for business growth? Many business owners want a “partner” to  share the load. Partners exert a lot of control no matter how little of the business they own. Use a strategic alliance instead to grow your business and  keep more control.
What is a Strategic Alliance?
The most accepted definition of a strategic alliance is that it’s “a formal or informal agreement between two or more individuals or entities to achieve a common goal”.
In 2005, companies reported that 18% of their revenue was generated through strategic alliances. The economy has changed but there are still thousands of alliances formed each year.
I agree with Winston Churchill. “If we are together, nothing is impossible. If we are divided all will fail.”
Kinds of Strategic Alliances
“Walking with a friend in the dark is better than walking alone in the light. . .Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.” Helen Keller
I have found at least seven different basic forms a strategic alliance can take. These are:

Friendship
Networking for career purposes
Cross marketing ally
Cooperative advertising ally
Shared production or operations expense ally
Joint Venture
Funding ally

Any strategic alliance can be:

Temporary or permanent
Long term, short term, one time event, trial
Vertical (between a vendor & a customer, competitors, two or more businesses) or horizontal (between employees, supervisors, managers, departments)
Local or global

Some strategic alliances have legal requirements. Those formed to share expenses and joint venture alliances certainly should not be even considered without some sort of written agreement. In a joint venture, a new business entity is formed. It requires a legal document to set down how this will be run, who’s in control, and how to handle income, expenses, and liability among other things.
Funding strategic alliances are created by agreements with angels or venture capitalists most often. Other potential allies include grant providers, customers, prospects or even the government.
Successful strategic alliance: California Milk Board & Oreo® cookies by NABISCO
Any marketing alliance will need written clarification to make sure everyone understands and agrees. Are you and your ally going to share out of pocket marketing expenses? Who pays what?  Think of the Oreo cookies and Milk Board and their “Got milk?” campaign. The billing for the ads and the paperwork to create this strategic alliance must be very interesting.
Commonalities
“The truth we’re seeing in markets around the globe, the more you share, the more you win.” Brian Featherstonhaugh Chairman and CEO of OgilvieOne Worldwide
All strategic alliances share three common elements:

Goals — who wants what
Responsibilities — who does what
Rules — how it’s done (based on business and personal culture and  attitudes)

But the perspective of each is different. A strategic alliance whose goal is just to find a friend to talk to or to network with has a very personal goal. Cross marketing, shared production expense, and joint venture alliances are more business growth focused.
Any alliance has expectations. One primary that they all share is reciprocity. The goal of each alliance is to add value and worth to each person or entity involved. Not only is “No man an island” but no business can  survive alone either.
The Right Strategic Alliances
“We cannot enter into alliances until we are acquainted with the designs of our neighbors.” from The Art of War by Sun Tzu
What’s the right alliance for you?  The strategic alliance that matches:

Your goals
Either short term or long term
Responsibilities you and each ally are willing to take on
The more complicated the alliance, the more the responsibilities of each party. The joint venture because of its legal nature is the most complex.
Rules you are willing to abide by
There are plenty of rules that apply to alliances. If you are going to try to win a government contract, for instance, there are special rules you have to follow if you and another business are pooling your resources to fulfill a contract.

How to use strategic alliances
Businesses use strategic alliances to achieve specific goals. Some examples are:

Production:
Achieve advantages of scale, scope & speed; enhance product development; diversify; skill building; share expertise
Marketing
Increase market penetration; expand market development; keep competitors out
Sales
Enhance competitiveness in domestic &/or global markets; Develop new business opportunities through new products & services; Increase exports
Finance
Create new businesses; reduce costs

Successful Alliances
To be successful:

Set reasonable, realistic goals
Choose the right kind of alliance
Know the rules
Select the right allies
Work the alliance
Measure results regularly
Have a way out (transfer, transform, exit) and a contingency plan

Shaking hands, a universal symbol for alliances. Photo by Leo Gruber.
We call this the Handshake Alliance Strategy™. We use it and teach it to our clients at the Business Success Center and at trade association conferences. It works. But it is work; sometimes even a struggle.
Top successful alliances added $72 Billion in shareholder value over 2 years. Bad alliances cost companies $43 Billion. (Harvard/Accenture study 2003)
Handshake Strategy ebook by Jan Triplett on the process for creating and maintaining successful strategic alliances.
Alliances aren’t perfect but they can be a lot better (and safer) than a partnership.
I’m finishing my ebook, Handshake Strategies: How to Grow Your Business or Career. What are your experiences? I’d love to add them to my examples.

        I have a wealth of experience in many online and offline businesses going back to the 1990's and I enjoy helping people manifest their dreams. Many others have benefited from my help over the years and I'd like to keep giving back to the community that has helped me along my travels. 
Let me know what you are looking for help with, and I'll see what I can do.

                                    I would love a little help or guidance. I recently learned how to code and build website. Now I want to learn how to make some money with it. Traffic has been my Achilles heal. Do you think you can help me out?

                                    Certainly. Feel free to PM me or add me on Skype.  
Remember a joint venture is where 2 or more parties work together to help each other succeed. Quid Pro Quo. So you want to let people know what you're willing or able to offer in return for the help.

                                    Are you opened to JV? I have a high-ticket product to sell, and I do all the hard work, I'm looking for people to JV with in order to promote it.  
My stats are like this: around 20-30% opt-in, 5-10% fill in the application, I close around 20-30% on the phone if they are targeted. 
PM me if that's something you do!

                                    Do you work with magazines and other publications? 
I've partnered with companies such as tvtibi.com to raise funds for multiple projects, include the animated series, reality television, and more.  
Right now I'm working on the first two phases of the overall model, which are publications, which include MavCore 3D Animation Magazine and the upcoming News Pros comic (along with a card game), which is a forerunner for a future animated sitcom series (starting production late 2017). 
To fund these first parts, first is some very low cost ($10 - $25 for full color ads) magazine advertising, As my numbers go up, the prices go up...but I stil need marketing. You can see the ad page at Magazine Advertising discount  
I'm also seeking sponsors, which is basically heavy long term advertising in multiple publications. You can see that info at MavCore Publication Sponsorship  
Of course there's numerous income possibilities once things are operating fully, so there's a lot of room for joint ventures and partnerships with the right people. 
Exactly what depends on the parties. You didn't give a large description on what you're looking for, but if any of this sounds like something you can work with, you can message me, or contact info is on those pages as well. 
If not, thank you for taking the time reading this...lol

I am not looking to invest in other people's projects at this time. If your idea of a joint venture is I sell your stuff for you, that is not a JV to me, that is called being an affiliate. If you are looking to recruit affiliates, I am not one. I have experience managing affiliates / sales teams, getting affiliates and training them. I could be contracted to do that kind of service, or to coach/train you if you really twisted my arm, but at this time I am not interested in becoming somebody's affiliate. I can offer advice and help, and I can partner on projects that have a congruence with something I already own or run.   
Yes, businesses that are offline or have a presence offline are of more interest to me than those that rely solely on websites. 
Thank you!

                                    M me and let's make some money together. It'll be 75% for you. My students literally quit they're jobs in 30 days.  
Also, I have a new product about some serious six figure earnings thru print media in the pipe line,but it'll be high ticket. I mean something like $1997. 
All things i talk about are tried and tested and still to this day my bread and butter. 
Let's talk and see if we can join arms.

                                    Hi, 
I have been running my website for 11 years now and have one of the best products in my niche for both quality and value. It runs well even without me doing much on the side of promotion, just the basics. I am looking for a partner or partner team who has already mastered the world of internet marketing to enjoy a 50/50 split on future website/product profits. 
Best,
Theo

                                    I don't mean to be rude, but I struggle to stay Focused and finish the Projects I'm working on, and the links in your Signature suggest that maybe you have the same problem! Any advice on what you type of businesses you have found easier to keep working on than your current signature links?

Joint Ventures Versus Venture Capital

Posted by dean on August 19th, 2008

It might be the first goal of many a budding entrepreneur: to find someone with more money than he knows what to do with, explain why your idea can make him richer than Beverly Hills and accept a seven-figure check from him in return for a tiny little stake in your company — one that’s now worth several million dollars. Whether the business ever makes a dime, you’ll always be able to say that you were worth a mint and that you ran a large corporation.
In practice of course, it’s never that easy. While venture capital may well provide the sort of launch pad that’s sent many a business into the stratosphere, finding the money can be as laborious as building the foundations of the business in the first place. Time that could have been spent talking to potential customers, perfecting the product and developing new service ranges will be spent creating business plans, contacting investors and creating Powerpoint presentations to land the capital.
The chances of success are fairly small too, although they depend on the industry. Entrepreneurs with an idea in the healthcare field, for example, are said have just a 3 percent chance of landing an investor. Those odds may well be higher for entrepreneurs with Web ideas and based in Silicon Valley, especially if they have a proven track record, but even they can expect a long wait, lots of meetings and plenty of responses that begin “We think it’s a very interesting idea but….”

The Price of Investment
And even if you’re successful, the money always comes at a price that goes beyond the time taken to find it. Accept money from an investor, and you give up full control over your company. You don’t get to decide on your own whether to sell up, go public or even close down. When Bryan Zmijewski, founder of microstock photography company Lucky Oliver, announced his company’s closure recently, he made clear that the move came from “the investment team” who had decided “that it was in the best interest of all stakeholders to shut the company down.” That’s a serious loss of control over a business that’s taken someone else’s money but all of your hopes, dreams and efforts — and a sizeable chunk of your life too.
So what’s the alternative?
There are quite a few. BusinessFund.com lists 25 Alternatives to Venture Capital and offers some interesting, if conventional ideas. (One suggestion, for example, is to use personal credit cards, a route that carries a high risk of punitive interest rates.) Mark van Osnabrugge and Robert J. Robinson point out in their book, “Angel Investing” that in the first round of investment, 74 percent of entrepreneurs use personal savings to fund their business. In the second round, just over a third use angels and by the third round, a quarter are established enough to use a public share offering.
How Joint Ventures Can Beat Venture Capital
But there is another option that’s less frequently taken, offers many of the benefits  provided by investors and lets you retain full control over your business too. You can create joint ventures with other entrepreneurs.
You would still be able to receive the professional support and advice that’s often as valuable as the numbers on a VC’s check. But instead of selling part of your company to someone else, you’d be partnering with someone on one particular aspect of your business.
While you wouldn’t be receiving a giant sum of money regardless of whether you succeeded, you would be able to receive income and grow at the same time.
Joint ventures though come in all sorts of forms. One option is to team up with a big company or even a group of big companies. MySpace’s deal with Universal, for example, may have helped to settle legal action but it provided clear benefits for both the social media site and the music companies. MySpace was already well-established but had it lost the court case, the site might have required a new injection of cash from owners News Corp.
Of course, joint ventures don’t have to be that complex. Joel Comm, an Internet guru with a popular following, invites entrepreneurs to submit their joint venture ideas to him… but charges $497 to review them. The fee is intended to put off all but the most confident of entrepreneurs from asking for help but it also suggests that the value of a partner with a large audience can be high.
Perhaps the best way for a new entrepreneur to form a joint venture though is with another company at the same stage of development. Two businesses that agree to recommend each other’s services or which uses each other’s products can cut their expenses while still growing and bringing in new customers. Conferences can be good places to meet these kinds of entrepreneurs, and in fact it’s the opportunity to create those partnerships that is main reason people attend them. The presentations are often just helpful extras.
Every joint venture though, whatever the business’s stage of development, has to provide real benefits to all parties, and like any deal that means selling the idea with an emphasis on what the other side will get out of it. Yes, that’s like pitching a business idea to a venture capitalist. This time though you’ll be talking to someone with as little money as you but with drive that’s just as big — and dreams that are the same size too.

What do you think about VCs like Y Combinator?
They invest small sums of money, around $5000, for 6% of stakes. They see it like investing in people rather in technology.
