 Reunion With Jon Hendricks CD music Product Description

Reunion With Jon Hendricks album for sale by Larry Vuckovich was released Mar 16, 2004 on the Tetrachord label. This set can easily be divided in two. Reunion With Jon Hendricks buy CD music Six of the 14 selections feature the vocals of the great Jon Hendricks. Reunion With Jon Hendricks songs Hendricks' voice was past its prime by the time he recorded these numbers with pianist Larry Vuckovich in 2001, but his mind and creative powers were still very sharp.  Particularly notable are his versions of "Shorty Indigo" (trumpeter Harold "Shorty" Baker's recorded solo on "Mood Indigo") and "Bye Bye Blackbird." Reunion With Jon Hendricks album for sale The latter has Hendricks singing his vocalese to Miles Davis' recorded solo before scatting a few choruses of his own. Reunion With Jon Hendricks CD music Some of the Hendricks tracks feature the tenors and other reeds of Noel Jewkes and Jules Broussard, who are also prominent on many of the other numbers. Reunion With Jon Hendricks buy CD music Trumpeter Allen Smith helps out on two songs, guitarist Josh Workman takes several solos, and six numbers have Latin percussionist John Santos and occasionally one other percussionist. Reunion With Jon Hendricks songs Vuckovich, who takes "Yesterdays" as an unaccompanied piano solo, is in excellent form throughout this swing-oriented date. An added plus is bassist Nat Johnson's excellent vocal on "The Shadow of Your Smile."
