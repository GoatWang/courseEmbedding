								End the debate at the bedside							

Provides total blood and red blood cell volume along with calculated patient-specific ideals*
Actionable results—quantifies the excess or deficit with 98% accuracy
Confidently identify and address anemia, regardless of plasma expansion or depletion
Non-invasive, single-venipuncture technique
Over 40,000 tests performed in over 75 hospitals
Fully reimbursed by Medicare

 



						    	Lower ICU mortality with individualized care guided by direct blood volume analysis (BVA)							
Individualized fluid and red blood cell management that integrated BVA results reduced mortality vs conventional management by pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) alone

 


									Prospective, randomized, controlled trial in which 100 critically ill surgical patients with septic shock, severe sepsis, severe raspiratory failure, and/or cardiovascular collapse. Mean APACHE II scores where comparable accross both study arms, at 25 (BVA, n=50) vs 24 (conventional, n=50) (P=0.16). All patients underwent BVA testing; physicians were blinded to BVA results for the control group, which was conventionally managed.								



BVA delivered actionable results that informed treatment decisions
For the BVA group, 44% of test results led to a change in treatment strategy







			    			More timely and effective care with BVA than with conventional treatment						

The control group had a mean delay in transfusion of 1.5 ± 2 days, received fewer mean units of RBCs vs those in the BVA group (2.74 vs 3.85 units; P=0.049), and had more significant volume derangements recorded more frequently than the BVA group
Pressures did not reliably correlate with volume. Pulmonary arterial occlusion pressure was a poor indicator of volume: high for 18% of those whose volume was low, and low for 25% of those whose volume was high2 







An important aspect of care was earlier treatment of intravascular volume deviations in the BVA group, before the abnormality became clinically manifested.

†A131| labeled albumin tracer injection (<25 microcuries: no requirement for thyroid blockade5) is followed by 5 blood draws 5-6 minutes apart. The Daxor BVA-100 measures plasma dilution in successive samples and performs a regression analysis to arrive at the total blood volume. Institutional procedural variance drives a real-world time range of ~45-90 minutes for full results; preliminary results may be obtained in < 30 minutes.

BVA Product Literature


Highlights of the BVA-100

The BVA-100 calculates true normal blood volume for a specific individual.
The BVA-100 directly measures circulating blood volume in 60 minutes or less.
Individuals of different body sizes may have identical hematocrits but vastly different blood volumes.
Accurate knowledge of blood volume can prevent serious complications from undertransfusion caused by unrecognized severe hypovolemia.
The BVA-100 is the first instrument for the measurement of human blood volume to receive patents in the U.S., European Common Market, and Japan.
The BVA-100 helps differentiate the post-surgical normovolemic anemic patient from the anemic hypovolemic patient.
The BVA-100 can accurately ascertain individual patient’s presurgical blood volume status to enable more precise fluid replacement during and after surgery.
The BVA-100 provides objective data upon which physicians can base decisions to transfuse, reducing unnecessary use of blood products and physician liability.
The BVA-100 reduces morbidity from potentially contaminated blood by avoiding unnecessary transfusions.
The BVA-100 is useful in measuring blood volume in conditions complicated by fluid retention such as hepatic and renal disease.




Product Specifications
Overview
Specifications
Requirements


Accuracy
The BVA-100 ensures accuracy in three ways:

The MAX-100 syringe is engineered to deliver a 99.5% accurate dose of tracer solution.
The BVA-100 provides advanced statistical analysis of data obtained during testing.

Automatic multi-point calculation with error-checking and true zero-time blood volume using real-time regression analysis ensures accuracy and the elimination of error.

The BVA-100 automatically provides normal (expected) blood volumes based on deviation from ideal weight. This is easily accomplished by entering height and weight into the computer program.

Patient Safety and Comfort

The BVA-100 eliminates the need for potentially harmful retransfusion of labeled blood.
Patient test time ranges from only 30 to 45 minutes.

Ease of Use

Time-consuming steps of blood labeling and preparation of exactly matched standards are eliminated.
Calculations are automatically provided.
Estimated test time ranges from 60 to 90 minutes Other less sophisticated methods can take 4 to 5 hours to complete.
Infusion and the acquisition of multiple samples can be performed with a single venipuncture.
