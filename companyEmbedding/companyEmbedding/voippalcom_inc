VoIP-Pal.Com Inc. Announces Fulfillment of Digifonica Share Purchase 
      Acquisition Agreement






July 01, 2013 05:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



BELLEVUE, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--VoIp-Pal.Com Inc. (“VoIP-Pal”, “Company”) (OTC Pink: VPLM) is pleased to 
      announce the fulfillment of the Digifonica Share Purchase Acquisition 
      announced late last year. On December 27, 2012, the parties entered into 
      an agreement to complete a share purchase acquisition of Digifonica 
      Gibraltar and all of its assets and complete Patent Portfolio. 
      VoIP-Pal.com and Digifonica have since fulfilled all of the terms and 
      conditions set forth in that agreement, making Digifonica Gibraltar a 
      wholly owned subsidiary of VoIP-Pal.Com Inc, and exchanging shares of 
      Digifonica Gibraltar for shares of VoIP-Pal.Com.
    


      The assets acquired by VoIP-Pal include Digifonica’s complete portfolio 
      of issued and pending patents. The complete Patents Portfolio is 
      comprised of one issued patent and four pending, which are in the final 
      stages awaiting approval. The first of the company’s issued patents, 
      Lawful Intercept (LI), was allowed on January 18, 2013. The four patents 
      pending are Rating Billing and Routing (RBR), Mobile Gateway (MG), 
      Enhanced 911, and Advanced Interoperability Solutions.
    

      “This is a monumental accomplishment for both VoIP-Pal and Digifonica,” 
      stated Dennis Chang, CEO of VoIP-Pal.Com Inc. “We have enjoyed a long 
      and mutually beneficial relationship with Digifonica in our joint 
      efforts to bring this patent portfolio to fruition. The completion of 
      this partnership is an exciting step forward as we continue to work 
      together in the rapidly expanding VoIP industry.”
    

About VoIP-Pal.Com Inc.


      VoIP-Pal.Com, Inc. (“VoIP-Pal”, ”Company”) is a publicly traded 
      corporation (OTC Pink: VPLM) 
      incorporated in December of 1997 in the State of Nevada and 
      headquartered in Bellevue, Washington. VoIP-Pal is a technical leader in 
      the broadband Voice-over-Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) market with the 
      ownership and development of a portfolio of leading edge VoIP Patent 
      Applications. Through its retail website, www.PlatinumPhone.com, 
      VoIP-Pal is also a provider of local and long-distance VoIP telephone 
      services for next generation devices including smartphones, tablets and 
      cell phones.
    

      VoIP-Pal’s primary products are VoIP patent application technology 
      acquired through the Company’s Share Purchase Agreement to acquire 100% 
      of the outstanding shares of Digifonica (International) Limited, a 
      privately held company registered in Gibraltar (“Digifonica”). The 
      Company is currently developing, testing, and administrating the patent 
      process to ultimately license or sell the patents once they have been 
      issued.
    

      The addition of Digifonica has immediately advanced Voip-Pal as a 
      technical leader in the VoIP services market which had revenues of $58 
      billion in 2011 and is experiencing double digit year-over-year growth. 
      The patent application portfolio has greatly enhanced shareholder value 
      and is expected to contribute to significant future revenue growth for 
      Voip-Pal.Com as the number of mobile VoIP subscribers is projected to 
      reach 410 million by 2015.

Hosted PBX. Virtual PBX.
 Cloud PBX.

A virtual PBX is the modern alternative to costly, clunky PBX equipment that is tied to one location. Unite your whole company with a virtual PBX in the cloud.


Hosted PBX. Virtual PBX. Cloud PBX. What does it really mean? Instead of that ungainly PBX box in the telecom closet, 8x8 delivers all hosted PBX phone services right over your Internet connection using VoIP technology. With 8x8, your virtual PBX phone service is affordable, simple to manage and gives your whole company access to enterprise-class features that other providers charge extra for.
8x8 Hosted PBX Business Phone Service Benefits

Lose the big box and the big fees—No need to buy, lease, or pay maintenance fees on a complex PBX system at your office; your hosted PBX solution is delivered right over your Internet connection.
Save a lot—We usually save businesses about 50% off their phone bill and up to 90% off what it would cost them to invest in a traditional PBX system.
Simplify with one company—Get everything you need from one company: your phones, all your calling features, and your local, long distance and international calls.
Put all employees under the same phone system—Distributed locations, office workers, home-based employees and traveling staff all share the same virtual PBX features; so no matter where they are located, they are only an extension call away from each other.
Grow at your own pace—Order as many extensions as you need now; add more extensions, fax lines, anytime.

How a Virtual PBX Helps Your Business
You get an amazing business phone system that works exactly like you would expect it to. But it’s virtual. All you need are phones and an Internet connection. Meanwhile, we own and manage all the virtual PBX equipment, software, and upgrades behind the scenes so you don’t have to. Learn more about 8x8 Virtual Office, our hosted PBX service.

Voip-Pal.Com Inc. Announces the Launch of Its New PointsPhone Platinum(TM) Suite Which Includes an Antivirus Program for North America Android UsersHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreYahooSearchSearchSkip to NavigationSkip to Main ContentSkip to Related Content0Voip-Pal.Com Inc. Announces the Launch of Its New PointsPhone Platinum(TM) Suite Which Includes an Antivirus Program for North America Android UsersMarketwireApril 11, 2011ReblogShareTweetShareBELLEVUE, WA--(Marketwire - 04/11/11) - Voip-Pal.Com Inc. (Pinksheets:VPLM - News) is a provider of international calls using VoIP technology on the internet and smart cell phones. Voip-Pal's goal is to provide a quality, reliable, cost-effective and safe solution for the casual and business international traveler who must rely on their smartphones to communicate.Voip-Pal.Com Inc. ("Voip-Pal") announces the availability for North America Android users of its PointsPhone Platinum™ Suite package which bundles an Antivirus Program. The Antivirus Program has been designed specifically to guard smartphones against spyware, malware and viruses."Having a virus protection program for your desktop or laptop PC is now common-place," states Dennis Chang, President of Voip-Pal, "with 90 percent of PC users using some kind of antivirus program. And yet, less than 10 percent of current smartphone users are using antivirus programs. Most smartphone users are unaware of the virus threat and those who are aware don't know what to do about it. Smartphone sales are outpacing sales of PCs. Smartphones are now taking over the world computer marketplace. Unlike our PCs, we carry our smartphones with us everywhere, and because of sensitive financial and personal information stored on our smartphones, smartphones are a gold mine for cyber criminals. Security protection is probably THE most important App to download for any smartphone."When a customer can receive a state-of-art antivirus program already included when they purchase airtime minutes, a decision to purchase our Platinum Suite is straightforward. Especially when you consider it can cost the consumer over $30 for a similar stand-alone product without airtime minutes. The airtime minutes are worth it by itself. The customer will save on ridiculous roaming charges and our rates are extremely competitive with everyone else out there, including Skype™."The PointsPhone Platinum™ Suite is now available in North America only for all Google Android smartphones, including the new high-performing Motorola ATRIX™ and Samsung's Galaxy 4G™. The Platinum Suite will include a one year subscription to a state-of-art antivirus program, substantial domestic and international airtime minutes, enhanced Voice Mail features and a free North America phone number. The antivirus program is truly comprehensive, providing automatic real-time protection against viruses, spyware and other malware. Memory cards are automatically scanned when they are inserted to prevent transfer of malware and viruses. A GPS locating system is available to track down lost or stolen smartphones. A Remote Backup feature is available to backup all data stored on the smartphone in case the smartphone is lost or stolen."Smartphone users should be aware of four basic types of threats from viruses on smartphones," says Mukesh (Mike) Mohanbhai, Chief Technical Officer (CTO). "The first is called Advanced Mobile Malware which attacks mobile users' bank accounts and steals their logins and passwords. The second threat is called Converged Messaging Spam which prompts users to reply to a SMS messaging spam and charges them extremely high per minute rates. The third is called IP Reputation which imbeds malicious malware in SMS and email spam. The fourth type is a Credit Attack which are messages prompting users to call back and incur an extremely high per minute billing rate. In addition to these basic types of threats, there are harmful spyware and new generation viruses that criminals are developing to access the financial and personal data on smartphones. We must always be one step ahead of the cyber criminals."We are proud to announce the PointsPhone Platinum™ Suite for the Android as our Vanguard product," adds Mr. Mohanbhai. "Our technical team is working around the clock to finish development of the Platinum Suite for the iPhone, Blackberry, Symbian and Windows Phone platforms, and working on extending our Platinum Suite service to international Android users. We are also improving the Point of Sales process for the Platinum Suite to make it easier for our users to download and use all of our services."The PointsPhone Platinum™ Suite is available in North America only for Google Android smartphones on our retail website www.pointsphone.com. Users will register and purchase a Platinum Suite for $29.95. A User account and password will be created and users will have immediate access to their account for airtime minutes, Voice Mail and virtual phone numbers. A registration number for their Antivirus Program will be sent as a text message to their smartphone which will provide access to download their Antivirus Program within 48 hours (to complete fraud check). A free North America Phone Number is allocated. The PointsPhone Mobile™ App for the Android is downloaded free from the Android Market App Store (search 'pointsphone').For more information on PointsPhone products and services please click on link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vSnIpCsnS0Links to recent related articles by MSNBC and The Globe and Mail: http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/41867328/ns/technology_and_science-security/ http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/tech-news/viruses-next-big-threat-to-smart-phones/article1928976/About Voip-Pal.Com Inc.Voip-Pal.Com Inc. is a broadband VoIP telecom company offering local and long distance VoIP services to consumers and business owners.

Its reciprocal product, the PointsPhone Mobile™ Android App, has been posted and ready for free downloading on the Android Market App Store. The new Antivirus Program has been designed specifically to guard the Android smartphone against spyware and viruses, and will be bundled as a suite with the PointsPhone Mobile™ Android App. The announcement and retail price for this suite is forthcoming."Android is on a pace to out sell its competitors five to one," states Dennis Chang, President of Voip-Pal. "Motorola has just announced its latest product, the Motorola A TRIX™ 4G, claiming to be the world's most powerful smartphone, and perhaps taking over the mantel from Samsung's Galaxy S 4G. Both rely on the Android OS platform. However, there's a lot more at stake now with the recent news that Android has pulled more than 50 apps from its Market Store due to the discovery of malware that may prove to compromise the security of Android smartphones. The timing of this new addition of a forthcoming PointsPhone Antivirus Program couldn't have come at a better moment. The final stage of delivery, which is the Point of Sales and Marketing, is soon to be finished and we can soon offer our comprehensive Antivirus Program which will be included with the purchase of the PointsPhone Platinum™ Suite.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
