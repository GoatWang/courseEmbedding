        Pretty but not sure about how they'd wear
Loved these boots, suede was very soft, fit comfortable. Sadly, I was not confident they'd stay up as over the knee boots because the suede was so nice and soft so I returned. :-(

I absolutely love these boots! They are very comfortable i do hair and can stand in them all day and not be miserable! I get so many compliments when I wear them, I have the wine color! These are my fav favorite boot I have of free bird! I love how you can wear them up above your knee or slouch them down!

        Amazing Boot
I bought it in all four colors. Fit is perfect, and I have wide feet, still perfect! I am also a body builder, and have big calves, still fits perfect. Comfortable for all day wear. Lots of compliments!

        I'm in love with this boot!!
I am a loyal Steve Madden shopper and  Was so excited when I saw this boot while shopping online.  I almost didn't purchase because of the one review talking about a tight fit around the heel.  Wow am I glad I ignored it!!!  It has an inside zipper at the ankle and was actually super easy to slide on.   I bought the burgundy and it is simply gorgeous! They sit just the right height above the knee.  So so excited to start wearing them,  they are going to be stunning with dresses & skinny jeans - or whatever's in your closet.

Contact Dave at (530) 575-8976.Eric HughesNortheast Regional Vice PresidentAfter 20 years in the sports surfacing world—including 12 years in synthetic turf, Eric joined the Brock team in 2015 to represent the Northeast region.  Even before his professional sales career, Eric grew up in and around sports, watching his father provide backyard recreational facilities to clients for over 15 years. This shaped Eric’s future in sales from early on. Brock has provided Eric the perfect platform to educate designers and end-users about safe field systems.  His two decades of experience in the industry allow him to provide hands-on customer service to each client.Eric stays active playing soccer in his local “Old Man League,” as well as kayaking the lakes and ponds in the Northeast with his wife, daughter, and son.  Ronnie PascaleEast Regional Vice PresidentRonnie is a seasoned professional in the synthetic turf business.  HIs passion for the design and construction of state of the art athletic fields comes from both his 13 years as a professional soccer player with the Richmond kickers playing on it, to his roll in developing the mid-atlantic region for highly respected turf manufacturers. His experience covers the entire process from proper design and specifications, to quality construction. “My values are centered around what the customer wants, and my job is to be an educational resource in order for them to achieve their goals”, Says Ronnie. “Because of my “feet on” experience on all types of quality surfaces, I can help owners and designers understand how to get the most value and the best surface for their project. And as a father, I am very sensitive to the idea of field safety.” Ronnie is married to wife Stacy, and they have two children, Tabatha, 13 and Brayden, 7.Jim FroslidCentral Regional Vice PresidentJim Froslid was recruited to Brock after more than 11 years in the artificial turf industry.
