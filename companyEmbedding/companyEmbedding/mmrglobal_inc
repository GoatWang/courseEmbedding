Persistence Pays Off
Posted by Robert Lorsch | Filed under Posts by Robert Lorsch
Persistence, endurance, tolerance, patience, determination, and commitment are all necessary to winning. To anyone who has followed MMRGlobal, they are also words that we have lived by for nearly ten years to get to where we are now; READY.
Now is a very challenging time in the world. The United States is involved in conflicts around the globe, while war rages on throughout the Middle East, Africa and Europe. We all have our own personal challenges in our daily lives and in the lives of the ones we love.  One of my wife Kira’s best friends is surviving breast cancer one day at a time, while a number of close friends have family members also fighting numerous medical crises.
In the past week alone, MyMedicalRecords has shown its readiness and is responsible for helping countless individuals, families, including our nearest and dearest two-legged and four-legged friends, manage their medical records and other important documents to fight illness, reduce medical costs, and save lives.
It’s sometimes hard to get up each day and face the challenges. But we do. We move forward.  We persist.
Meanwhile, the more we put out to the universe, the more we get back. And MyMedicalRecords personal health record system does just that.
MyMedicalRecords helps individuals and their families (2 legged or 4 legged) manage their health, reduce costs and save lives. The Company now finds itself in a market where electronic medical records and personal health records are mandated by global regulatory requirements.
The financial markets are valuing small health information providers, with minimal revenues, in the hundreds of millions, and in one recent IPO, billions of dollars. The fact is that after 10 years, and building a great product & service and accumulating three portfolios of 49 health IT and biotech patents, our first Markman hearing is a week away.
On Tuesday, August 19, MyMedicalRecords will be in Federal Court, facing four defendants, all major players in healthcare, and many times the size of MMR in what is legally termed a Markman hearing. A Markman hearing is a court hearing in which a judge determines the meaning of words from patent claims that are in dispute in a patent infringement lawsuit. Inventions are defined by the precise wording of the patent claims and the definition of these words play a key role as to whether the jury will ultimately determine that patent infringement has occurred.  This is a big deal. Huge.
The defendants’ law firms are legendary. If you recall the story of David vs. Goliath, I now know how David felt.  Since 2005, I have believed that the computer age would transform the way doctors and patients communicate. After all this time, it looks like we’re on the edge of that time. I knew that computers would eventually take over, and my doctor’s handwriting, which neither my pharmacist nor I could read, would be replaced by electronics.  What I didn’t know was that I would be running a company in the center of that transformation for almost ten years. Without the persistence, endurance, tolerance, patience, determination, and commitment of our shareholders, employees and friends, we may not have made it this far. However, we have.
It took nearly 10 years of research, technical refinement, and tens of millions of dollars to get to this point, and for the many of you who have been part of the journey, we are excited that the next destination is just around the corner.
A big step in our growing success came just last week, when we started selling our Personal Health Record Kit in Walgreens’ drugstore.com.  As members of my team can testify, as soon as I saw MyMedicalRecords up on a Walgreens website, I cried, exhausted and happy tears.  (http://www.drugstore.com/products/prod.asp?pid=530332&catid=184044)
Ok, back to work.  It’s Markman time.

The World Celebrates Independence Day
Posted by Robert Lorsch | Filed under Posts by Robert Lorsch
I love the Fourth of July. It’s one of my favorite Holidays.  Kira & I announced our engagement on the Fourth of July, I hosted many LorschLand parties www.lorschland.com on the big day, and I was planning on throwing one this year.
However, a business trip to Australia put my All-American Fourth of July Barbecue plans on hold until next year. The good news is we are not missing out. Because even half way around the world, they are celebrating America’s Independence Day every day during the week leading up to hot dogs and fireworks on the big day. The U.S. Embassy has the chef from Commander’s Palace in New Orleans making fried chicken bites, gumbo and peach cobbler along with the standard fare of hot dogs and hamburgers everywhere.  The only bad news is that it’s winter here and yesterday in Canberra our Fourth of July picnic was held in temperatures of almost zero. http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/act-news/us-and-australia-working-together-in-ways-many-of-us-don8217t-even-hear-about-defence-minister-david-johnston-20140702-zstjz.html
Since arriving Down Under, most of my time has been in meetings about healthcare with numerous medical professionals, hospitals and government officials on behalf of MMRGlobal and the Company’s MyMedicalRecords Personal Health Record (PHR). And we have been welcomed everywhere and given access to whomever we want to meet.
And if I ever thought that I worked hard in the U.S.!  Being in Australia forces me to work a 12-hour day of meetings with hospitals, physicians, providers, investors and government officials all day every day.  Then I get back to the hotel where I work all day again over the night with Los Angeles.
However, this Fourth of July, in addition to feeling proud to be an American among friends, I am very excited about the business opportunities ahead. Based on all the relationships we are making and doors we are opening, I plan on returning to the States with agreements for as many as 800 physicians to begin offering the MyMedicalRecords PHR.
This week so far I have attended two “July 4th” celebrations an Independence Day Cocktail Party celebration at the National Maritime Museum and the one in Canberra.  While in Canberra I attended meetings with the Minister for Health Peter Dutton. The Aussies sure know how to make a patriotic American feel right at home.
Most everyone loves freedom and much of the world looks to America’s Independence Day as a reason to celebrate the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. There is a definite spirit of partnership and collaboration here between Australian and American business, healthcare, entertainment, sustainability…I could go on and on.  I am proud to be an American in this great big world.  And it’s nice to see a lot of the world is proud of us too.
Happy 4th of July from the cold in Sydney!

Home from the Hospital
Posted by Robert Lorsch | Filed under Posts by Robert Lorsch
Last Thursday, I was admitted to the hospital with pain in my mid-section and an elevated white count. I had been experiencing mild symptoms of pain in the stomach for more than a week, and when the pain started keeping me up three nights in a row I called my Internist.  He referred me to a gastro specialist whom I saw on Monday, November 18th. The doctor gave me a complete workup which included taking a rush “STAT” blood draw.  After the appointment I was sent home with two antibiotics and instructions to wait for his call. At 9:00 that same evening the doctor called and told me I had a significantly elevated white count and to immediately go for an emergency CT Scan.
I told the specialist that would not be possible as I was traveling to Chicago early the next morning for scheduled meetings where attorneys from around the country were gathering and we were not meeting at an imaging center. I explained that this was an important and time-sensitive meeting and only something like removing my appendix would keep me away.  So unless he could tell me I was having an appendicitis attack, I was going to Chicago.
As it turned out, the only reason I am able to write this blog and appear on Fox News all weekend and again in a special segment later today is because my MyMedicalRecords.com Personal Health Record account kept me out of an operating room.
So since my diagnosis was not definitively an appendicitis attack….. despite the pain (and fever) I was at LAX at 4:30 AM and on a 5:40 flight to Chicago with the Company’s patent attorney (who did not have a copy of my advanced directives).
We arrived at the meeting in Chicago, which by that time was the only thing I could feel good about.  Then, I drove from the suburb of Deerfield to the Chicago Loop for an MMRGlobal investor dinner, returning to the Airport Hilton in time for a few hours of sleep and the morning flight that would get me back to the office for more than half a day of work on Wednesday.
However, that is not exactly what the universe had in store for me. Instead, the ongoing fever and pain made me realize I needed the CT Scan before going to the office.  So I scheduled the procedure from the in-flight Internet. After the three-hour imaging procedure I went home to wait for the results.
At about 6:00 PM that night I received a call from the specialist telling me to get myself to the hospital Emergency Room with specific instructions to be admitted, adding to both my wife Kira and I that it was a life or death situation. The specialist also contacted a surgeon to be my admitting physician and I was in a hospital bed the next morning, which was now Thursday.  I had been told that I would be out in 2 days and I had an infection that that would simply be treated with IV antibiotics.
I quickly learned that now everything was an emergency. My CT Scan was done outside the hospital so when I checked into the hospital no one had a copy, only a verbal report from the specialist.  However, when a surgical team came to my room to prep me that night, they told me I was not headed to an IV Line but to surgery. Then I started asking more questions. Based on what I learned, I told them that surgery was anything but acceptable. I made it very clear that I did not want surgery and requested a hospital radiologist render a second opinion on my CT Scan. The problem was it was not at the hospital. Because I know how important it is to ask for a disc of the procedure whenever a patient leaves a radiologist, I had one with me. But I did not have the report. I 911’d the specialist, who emailed the report to me. The hospital had no way to receive email from a patient, especially at what was now 7:00 at night. However, every Nurse’s Station can receive a fax.
So using my personal MyMedicalRecords.com account, I uploaded the email to my inbox, moved the report to my radiology file and faxed it directly from my Personal Health Record to the Nurse’s Station.
Records and disc in hand, the surgical team went to a radiologist in the hospital and they all read the film together.  Forty-five minutes later, the team canceled putting me under the knife and started the IV.  Clearly, without a patient-controlled copy of my PHR, I would not have able to be on Fox & Friends Saturday morning discussing the latest on Dr. Afridi and back in my office today. Instead, I would have been in recovery, having had an unnecessary surgery.
Apparently, one set of radiologists from outside the hospital had given one opinion and the radiologist in the hospital another.  Fortunately, the hospital won.
Surgery canceled, and 4 bags of IV antibiotics later, it was off to Fox & Friends.
The best news is of course that I didn’t need surgery, and that the influx of antibiotics seems to have resolved the problem. I walked out of the hospital feeling great and, as a matter of fact, several people have said I’ve never looked better.
Had I not had a Personal Health Record I would not be writing this blog pain-free. This Thanksgiving, Kira and I have a lot to be thankful for in that MyMedicalRecords kept me from having an unnecessary operation.
If you haven’t already done so, I encourage you to use this holiday season to open a Personal Health Record account at MyMedicalRecords.com and collect all your family’s important information when you are gathered together before it’s too late.
Happy Thanksgiving!

Health Care Meetings in Washington Lead to Closed Door Session with Prime Minister of Pakistan
Posted by Robert Lorsch | Filed under Posts by Robert Lorsch
I have been making regular trips to Washington, D.C. since 2005, meeting with various government officials going back to HHS Secretary Mike Leavitt, former National Coordinators for Health IT David Brailer and David Blumenthal, and Congressional Representatives of the House Science Committee staff, and others.
And there is no better proof about effectively getting things done than reading about the results of my impromptu meeting last week with Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif. The meeting came as a direct result of my many trips to Washington demonstrating the MyMedicalRecords Personal Health Record that patients can sign up for in real time. http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/10/26/exclusive-pakistani-premier-pledges-to-reconsider-jailed-doctor-case/
My message has been clear, repeatedly demonstrating MMR’s cost-effective solution to deployment of an interoperable Personal Health Record at the SBA, HHS, ONCHIT, Surgeon General of the United States, Congressional Representatives and appropriate committees that deal with health care and budgets for health IT.
I first got involved in health IT because I saw an opportunity to provide affordable, easy to use, patient-controlled access to protected health information regardless of the system that it originated from, which seemed like the right thing to do.
Then, in February this year, while in Washington to present the MyMedicalRecords story to the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, Subcommittee on Oversight, I was invited into a meeting which evolved into a discussion of international politics and Pakistan.
The meeting was about the plight of Dr. Shakil Afridi, who was imprisoned by Pakistani officials for helping the United States pinpoint the location of Osama bin Laden. Because it also felt like the right thing to do, Kira and I started www.freeafridi.com, which led us on a humanitarian mission to free Dr. Afridi from his 33-year prison sentence.
If you believe that the more you give to the universe the more the universe gives back, then look for Dr. Afridi to go free and MMR to fulfill a significant purpose in the world’s health care systems by empowering people with the freedom to manage and control their protected health information wherever and whenever they want to anywhere in the world, including Pakistan.

Beam Me Up Yamamoto
Posted by Robert Lorsch | Filed under Posts by Robert Lorsch
 The Honorable Ichita Yamamoto & Japanese Delegation Tour Endeavour – Saturday, September 28, 2013 
It’s been a busy couple of months since I have had the time to add to the pages of my blog.  However, this last weekend was so relevant to science and technology, and in particular the future of health care (and MMRGlobal) in Japan, that I felt remiss not sharing it on this page.  The visit was arranged by U.S. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher who, after welcoming The Honorable Ichita Yamamoto, who is Japan’s Minister of State for Science, Space & Information Technology including Ocean Policy, and his delegation at SpaceX, beamed himself back to Washington for emergency budget resolution votes late Saturday night.  As a result I was left hosting the Minister around the Southern California scientific hot spots.
The Minister also happens to be a former rock singer, speaks great English and is an all-around easygoing, quite likable guy.
I first met Minister Yamamoto and his entourage of ten plus drivers and luggage handlers at LAX and joined his State Department Motorcade caravanning to SpaceX for a private briefing and tour of the rocket manufacturing facility, less than twenty hours prior to the launch of Falcon 9 www.spacex.com.
From there, I traveled with the Japanese contingentto the California Science Center where President & CEO Jeffrey Rudolph and Trustee Kira Lorsch greeted us all at the Robert H. Lorsch Family Pavilion.
Bob Lorsch, MMRGlobal CEO, with Ichita Yamamoto, Minister of State for Government of Japan, and Jeffrey Rudolph, California Science Center CEO, at the Science Center’s Robert H. Lorsch Family Pavilion.
During our tour of the Science Center, we spent time discussing the effect of natural disasters on the environment in the wake of the recent earthquake and Tsunami in Japan, focusing in particular on the effect of the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant on the Pacific Oceans. We discussed the U.S. government and Japan scheduling a conference of nations who share coastlines to help mitigate damage from future disasters.
We ended the tour under the wing of Space Shuttle Endeavour where we spoke about how our nations have been working together in space as we looked at a plaque from a U.S.-Japan mission to the Space Station.  After the tour everyone enjoyed a luncheon hosted by MMRGlobal, starting with, of course, a traditional Miso soup.
We left the California Science Center and moved on to Aeroscraft located in a 500,000 square foot Marine Corps enclosed Air Station where we sat in the control pod of a state-of-the-art blimp being designed for surveillance and to carry as much as 500,000 tons of cargo as far as 12,000 nautical miles, http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/07/aeroscraft-test-ground-flight-airship_n_2424916.html.
After a briefing at Aeroscraft we moved to the Orange County Water District (OCWD) where we were hosted by Mr. Linden Blue, father of the Predator Drone amongst other very impressive technology,
There we saw the future of the Nuclear Reactor, small enough to be located on a flatbed truck.  After the General Atomics nuclear reactor presentation, http://www.ga.com/nuclear-energy,  we toured 30,000 acres of ground water reclamation facilities where we all got to drink sewer water reclaimed to clean drinking water.
The Groundwater Replenishment System technology seems to work, as I’m not sick.  The day was capped off by another fabulous meal hosted by OCWD board President Shawn Dewane, where we toasted our future with the Japanese over two excellent California wines, without the reclaimed sewer water.
As MMR expands its global footprint which includes the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, Israel, South Korea, European Nations, China, Hong Kong, Singapore and of course Japan, the whirlwind day underscored the importance of advancing technology in all areas, including healthcare – to make our world a better place.

Your Chance To Make A Difference By Showing Your Support To A Special Friend To America
Posted by Robert Lorsch | Filed under Posts by Robert Lorsch
The reason you are receiving this blog is because on June 13th in Pakistan, Dr. Shakhil Afridi’s attorneys will participate in the 2nd day of an appeal requesting Dr. Afridi be set free. This is your chance to make a difference by sending a message of appreciation and support on behalf of the man who verified the location of Osama bin Laden for the United States.
Considered by many as an American Hero, Dr. Afridi’s reward for helping locate bin Laden has been to be captured, tortured and sentenced to 33 years in a remote Pakistani prison. With his hearing only two days away, it is important that the government of Pakistan understand how important it is to free Dr. Afridi on behalf of a world once terrorized by bin Laden.
This campaign is completely underwritten by MMRGlobal CEO Bob Lorsch and his wife, Kira Lorsch. To learn more how you can help make a difference visit http://www.freeafridi.com where you can find important information on how you can support the Afridi’s and share, tweet, post, and vote to send a message on behalf of Dr. Afridi and his family to Congress, the State Department and the Pakistani government.
A video on the home page at www.freeafridi.com shows U.S. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) questioning Secretary of State John Kerry on this important moral dilemma.  When you visit the www.freeafridi.com website you can also participate in a poll asking what would happen if you or a member of your family were captured, tortured or left behind? What would you want America to do?
Congressman Rohrabacher also introduced a Resolution, H.Res. 86, calling Dr. Afridi “a hero to whom the people of the United States owe a debt of gratitude” and expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that he should be immediately released. The Resolution is being co-sponsored by 17 U.S. Congress members including Reps. Jim Gerlach (R-PA), Louie Gohmert (R-TX), Brian Higgins (D-NY), Duncan Hunter (R-CA), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Ted Poe (R-TX), Matt Salmon (R-AZ), Loretta Sanchez (D-CA), Brad Sherman (D-CA) and Steve Stockman (R-TX), the original co-sponsors, and Reps. Paul C. Broun (R-GA), Blake Farenthold (R-TX), Bob Goodlatte (R-VA), (Pete Olson (R-TX), Randy K. Weber (R-TX) and Frank R. Wolf (R-VA).
Pakistan Prime Minister Sharif’s message to America after his election last month included a pledge to work toward better relations with America. However, in a phone call with our sources in Pakistan, Kira and I were told that because of the change of regime, Dr. Afridi’s appeal may be postponed for an agonizing 13th time. We cannot sit back and watch that happen.
That is why it is more important than ever to send messages to your Congressman, Senators and Secretary of State Kerry to help ensure that Dr. Afridi’s release is not again delayed. In this critical time of transition in Pakistan, we must keep the pressure on our government to free the man that helped free the United States of America from the terror of Osama bin Laden.
During the past month, we have received significant support for this important effort. Below are some of the links you can visit to learn more about what the FreeAfridi campaign is doing globally.

Go Behind The Curtain & Ask The Wizard…
Posted by Robert Lorsch | Filed under Posts by Robert Lorsch
He will tell you, “it is real, it always will be, and it exists in and beyond every corner of every alternate universe”….so says Richard Bach.
I have spent the last four years blogging about the magic inside that keeps me motivated.  Many have criticized me for being a frustrated version of Richard Bach; however, nothing could be further from the truth. I write my blogs the way I do because it works for me.  Some readers might say that I should focus my writing more about the business of MMR, but what fun would that be, after all, if you can’t make money and have fun is it really worth it. The fact is that when I put myself out there personally I still get lots of the comments about MMR, but I also get comments about how I make a difference in other people’s lives, and that makes me feel good.
One example is Dr. Shakil Afridi (www.freeafridi.com), who is sitting in a dungeon in Pakistan after sacrificing his family so that he could help America pinpoint the location of Osama bin Laden. Kira and I have received a landslide of worldwide press from our efforts creating a campaign to free Dr. Afridi in order to call attention to this important humanitarian crisis. As a result of our efforts and the efforts of the employees at MMR, we received worldwide coverage last week, from London’s “Daily Mail” and Page 6 of the “New York Post” to Breitbart. Being who I am allows me to run MMRGlobal, a publicly traded company under MMRF, while keeping MMR in the spotlight and giving back by calling attention to humanitarian and philanthropic issues in the world like the plight of Dr. Shakil Afridi.
Now I am going to talk about MMR and how my Bach-like belief system is turning the dream of an emerging growth opportunity into the reality of a business which could hold more than one billion dollars worth of intellectual property rights for its shareholders. MMR is a company that was founded to facilitate better care by reducing medical costs and helping save lives.  MMR is a journey I embarked on as a result of my own life experiences and my fight to survive a deadly form of cancer 13 years ago which I did.
As I sit down to let my fingers do the walking, I realized that it was time to let you see how it’s possible that a person can turn a dream into a reality by simply wanting it to be so. This is the second time in my life I have entered an industry that was dominated by multi-billion dollar companies in communications or healthcare.
I entered both opportunities as the underdog, first competing in telecommunications, then health IT. The first time, based on will and determination, I knew I won big when I went public standing on the floor of the Nasdaq. This time I know we are winning based on the fact that we continue to hit consistent singles in the healthcare business and doubles and triples with our health IT and biotech patent portfolios.
So let’s travel to behind the curtain in Oz so you can actually see what the future could have in store for all of us. I believe that when you resist change you are stuck with what you have.  So in my world, I never resist change and I am always exploring places to visit on a never-ending canvas. Despite an extraordinary, unexplainable trading range in our stock, the direction is clearly up.  MMR’s world promises to continue coming alive with a high quality group of strategic partners and customers.  We no longer have to beat people over the head to get them to use a Personal Health Record.  Now we can focus on delivering products and services.  So as a result of consumer and professional awareness of PHRs and requirements to deploy them, we should begin to see revenues from operations and licensing far greater that any projected in the past.
E-Health is finally a reality of our time just like the evolution of other industries like credit monitoring services (which took forever to evolve), online banking services (which took forever to evolve), online travel services (which took forever to evolve), and online retail (which took forever to evolve). E-Health is now fast becoming a way of life.  And after eight long years, MMR is well positioned to benefit from that industry growth by exploiting the marketplace, much like Amazon did in retail, PayPal in payment processing, and eBay in auctions and commerce, to name only a few.
As CEO of the Company, I could not be more excited about how this year is progressing, and all the things that lie ahead.  For those who have followed this company since inception, when I have said, “the best is yet to come,” it means just that. For example, last week we spent a half-day in meetings with Sodexo regarding PHR offerings and an MMRPro distribution program internationally. We also met with representatives of the new employee owners of Kodak, who paid us a visit to help celebrate their purchase of Kodak’s Document Imaging business and other assets.  This means supply lines from Kodak in the future for MMRPro has never looked better.
Our relationships with all our strategic vendors and partners are excellent; from Nihilent to ng Connect to Unis-Tonghe, and Interbit Data, Fujitsu, Kodak, and many others. We continue to make significant progress in Australia and, in fact, one of our larger Australian strategic partners was in Los Angeles over the weekend helping us prepare for meetings with government officials in Australia next month. We are also getting close to significant announcements in Singapore.
During the week, we continued ongoing dialogue with WebMD and we met with Quest Diagnostics at their offices near San Diego. While we work through strategic business opportunities with both WebMD and Quest, we are also in meaningful conversations with half of the top 10 EMR vendors, including McKesson and Cerner, with whom the Company has already enjoyed a five-year licensing relationship. We are also getting closer to a major announcement with a wireless carrier where healthcare continues to be a major priority and agenda item. In all cases, and with all these opportunities, the Company continues to actively pursue other licensing and strategic business opportunities both here and abroad, as evidenced by last week’s announcement about the Middle East.
And to the extent relationships involve more than strategic conversations, we are keeping the investment banking team at B. Riley very busy. While all this goes on, the Company continues filing additional patent infringement and trademark actions.
Speaking of patents, the Company’s United States health IT portfolio has recently been re-valued to add Japan which increased it to as much as $1.3 billion.  As yet, the Company does not have a valuation on Australia, Singapore, South Korea, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Mexico, Canada, Israel, and European nations which when added could increase the number significantly. Australia and Singapore are currently the subject of active investigation into infringement matters at this time.  http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=178404&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1815638&highlight .
The MMR Patent Portfolio was created about the same time that the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology was formed. The MMR Patent Portfolio was granted over nearly an eight-year period of time as part of a multi-million dollar effort to create shareholder value through the ownership of patents and other intellectual property in 12 countries around the globe. Because there are thousands of patented products in every healthcare professional’s office and hospital, from the design of a handle on a scalpel to components of the most sophisticated imaging equipment, the healthcare industry has shown it respects the patent system, and, based on our experience so far, we feel good about our ability to license and monetize these patents on behalf of our shareholders.  In fact, we are not aware of a situation where an industry has paid so much attention to the value of a patent portfolio since Samsung and Apple went to court, which further makes us feel good about the future.
The fact that the MMR patents are the subject of worldwide media attention, and in the United States alone, the Company believes that more than 3000 hospitals and healthcare providers do, or will, infringe on the Company’s IP by the end of 2014, should make for a very good next few years.
In closing, my favorite Bachism is, “You are never given a wish without the power to make it true. You may have to work for it, however.”  So Kira, I am sorry I will be late for dinner tonight.

No News Means I’m Busy Making Good News
Posted by Robert Lorsch | Filed under Posts by Robert Lorsch
My Sunday afternoons are usually spent like “Three’s Company,” with Kira, my wife, and Michael Selsman of Investor Relations for the company. However, these days we are so busy making news at MMR that we barely have the time to report it.  Kira, who is also MMR’s Spokesperson, prepared a welcome dinner for Luo Jianhui, Vice President & Chairman of Unisoft Group/Unis-Tonghe Technology.  Unis-Tonghe is MMRGlobal’s joint venture partner in China. Mr. Luo arrived last night for a two-day visit to Lorschville and meetings at MMR’s corporate headquarters regarding deployment of the latest versions of our MyMedicalRecords Personal Health Record in China.
We will be discussing the growth of health IT in China since their nationwide EMR launch was first announced in 2009.  Since that time, Unis and MMR have formed Unis Tonghe MMR International Health Management Service Company, Ltd. The venture was formed to enable both our organizations to participate in the growth of health IT in China and in particular the expanded delivery of MyMedicalRecords PHRs in China.
In 2012, the Chinese government announced a USD $3.6 billion (23 billion Yuan) investment to support the development of medical and healthcare technologies. The growth is driven by the upgrades of large hospital information systems and HIT infrastructure.
As to the very good news, following are a few of many headlines that you might look forward to in the coming months:

Announcements on expansion of the Company’s patent portfolio in the U.S. and internationally.
Updates on opportunities in the Middle East, in particular Qatar.  In fact, one shareholder recently referred to me as needing to change my name to the Emir of PHRs.


Continued announcements of licensing and settlement agreements, as well as an expanded patent education and notification program to hospitals and healthcare professionals including major hospital systems such as PinnacleHealth and other ambulatory care facilities that I have been meeting with in Pennsylvania.


Specific announcements pertaining to licensing and deployment of the Company’s products and services in wireless apps.


Updates on milestone payments from biotech patents and the beginning of efforts to pursue infringement claims pertaining to the Company’s anti-CD20 antibody IP.


The “My Hospital Everywhere” PHR program in Japan and the effect that MMR’s patents could have throughout the Asia Pacific region.


Anticipated updates and announcements coming out of Australia and Singapore.


The culmination of all the above and more, which the Company will share in connection with its upcoming shareholder meeting in July.

Our management team remains as committed as ever to our customers and shareholders.  In the last four hours on a Sunday night I have spoken with Michael, Bobbie, Rich, Ingrid and Eric all about different matters. The entire team gives 100% seven by twenty-four so that MMR can take advantage of being in the fastest-growing and biggest emerging market opportunity of our time, healthcare.
Many of you have followed Kira and my efforts to help free Dr. Shakil Afridi.  Dr. Afridi is the man who helped verify the location of Osama bin Laden for the United States.  Without Dr. Afridi’s participation, we may not have pinpointed the location of the world’s most dangerous terrorist. His reward has been capture, torture and a sentence of 33 years in a remote prison in Pakistan. To learn more about the Free Afridi effort visit www.freeafridi.com.
I just spent the last hour on the phone with Pakistan preparing for interviews tomorrow.   As we observe the second anniversary of the end of bin Laden’s reign of terror, follow the media coverage of Kira and I appearing in national print media, television and radio in our efforts to help free Dr. Afridi. We will do our best to post times for interviews on MMR’s Facebook and Twitter sites.  We also appreciate your registering at www.Afridi.com and voting on the “We The People Petition” on that home page. I will discuss the plight of Dr. Shakil Afridi and what concerned Americans can do to help get him released.
While the Company continues its efforts to notice and license hospitals and other healthcare providers, we have spent the last couple of months focused on selling our products and services or licensing our patents in advance of requirements for patient portals and Personal Health Records driven by Stage 2 Meaningful Use.
Although it has taken nine years since President George W. Bush signed a 2004 Executive Order leading to the beginning of health IT and MMR’s business of Personal Health Records, I am excited to see physicians, hospital administrators and the general public understanding the value and importance of having a Personal Health Record, which is why I believe that followers of MMR will keep waking up to Big News.

As Reprinted from Pakistan and The Wall Street Journal
Posted by Robert Lorsch | Filed under Posts by Robert Lorsch
This is our time – there’s been an unprecedented outburst of activity at MMRGlobal and in our personal lives.  While the fight against terror is the operative agenda for our nation after the results of this week, along those lines, Kira and I have continued spearheading the launch of the citizen campaign to Free Dr. Shakil Afridi.  Dr Afridi is currently imprisoned in Pakistan after pinpointing the location of Osama bin Laden for the American government, helping end the largest international hunt for the world’s most wanted terrorist. It has been a week of heavy media coverage in our lives from The Wall Street Journal, FOX News, C-SPAN and, soon, Breitbart and others.
On the business front here at home, The Wall Street Journal ran an interview with Athenahealth’s Jonathan Bush this week that speaks to the value and opportunities of the health IT business, particularly as it relates to online medical records.  The piece highlighted that even today, more than 1100 pages of fax are still received in a doctor’s office per month. This clearly underscores the value and significance of the MyMedicalRecords patent portfolio in this extraordinary marketplace. In fact, as part of recent MMR press announcements, the Company called attention to a January 22, 2013 report published by the Michael Bass Research Group valuing MMR’s U.S. patents at between $600 million to $1.1 billion based on what is described as conservative estimates of a market projected to reach a GDP value of $19 billion. We expect those valuations to increase as a result of recent additional patents being granted to MMR in Canada and Japan.
As to Pakistan, please watch the important video of Rep. Dana Rohrabacher grilling Secretary of State John Kerry before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs about Dr. Afridi this week. Please view it on the front page of www.freeafridi.com where you can also watch Kira and me discussing this important topic all over network television. The Congressman forcefully called for the U.S. to stop funding aid to Pakistan while Dr. Afridi “languishes in a dungeon,” stating on a personal note, “shame on us if we ignore Dr. Afridi.”  So true, that this country can leave the man who pinpointed the location of Osama bin Laden behind at a time when we are reminded in the news this past week what he stood for..
You have the chance to show your support for Congressman Rohrabacher’s undiminished efforts to keep up the pressure on freeing Dr. Afridi by signing a petition to free this American Hero and support Congressional Resolution 86. When you visit FreeAfridi.com, you can click on “We the People” which is the link on the upper left corner of the page to sign the petition. It’s especially important now because on April 25th a tribal court in Pakistan will convene for the 10th time in as many months promising to rule on considering his release.  If we get 100,000- signatures by the 20th The White House will comment and that could make all the difference.
So from the pages of The Wall Street Journal, a U.S. Congressman and the Secretary of State on C-SPAN, and Kira and me on the major networks like Fox and CBS, the 20-hour days of my life are filled with excitement and opportunity. Most importantly, I continue to focus on business opportunities including the exploitation of our HIT and Biotech patents by attending marathon meetings on licensing opportunities for the Company. While I am focused on MMR, Kira is off shooting a music video for the band OK GO, I am also planning on bringing the Bob Lorsch Hidden Talent Revue back to Beverly Hills, and spending at least ten minutes a day stressing over carpet stains from our rescue animals.
The good news is despite so many important things to do, I have a feeling that soon my cell phone can take a break on a Sunday or, at least, be put on vibrate.

MMRGlobal, Inc. (MMR), incorporated on January 21, 2000, is engaged in offering a suite of online products, which enable consumers and professionals to manage medical records and various other documents in their life and business, whether paper-based or digital. The Company's online products include MyMedicalRecords.com, which an online personal health record (PHR) system for the entire family, including pets; MyEsafeDepositBox, which is an online secure document storage system; MyMedicalRecordsMD (MMRPro), which is an integrated scanning and Web-based document management solution for healthcare professionals, and private-label PHR and MyEsafeDepositBox storage solutions.MyMedicalRecordsThe Company's consumer product, MyMedicalRecords, is a Web-based PHR system, which allows documents, images and voice mail messages to be transmitted in and out of MMR's system using a range of methods, including fax, voice and file upload. MMR's consumer's MyMedicalRecords PHR can store and maintain medical records that are sent from any of the consumer's healthcare providers. A MyMedicalRecords PHR can receive and store medical records in a range of formats, including image, voice, and discrete data in Health Level-7 (HL7), extensible markup language (XML) or other formats, which are exported or communicated from electronic health records (EHR), electronic medical record (EMR) or telemedicine systems. The account holder receives a notification at the same time new information is received in the Company's system from their healthcare provider. This notification can be sent to over three different user e-mail addresses (including text-enabled cell phones and smartphones).The Company's PHR is secured not only by a unique user identity document (ID), but also by multiple passwords. Consumers can access their files through the Internet or a Web-enabled phone, and using a customized filing system can categorize, annotate and file their records. It enables a consumer to print, download, e-mail or fax records from PHR, sharing this information with healthcare providers and others. The Company's mobile application provides access to the MyMedicalRecords Personal Health Record service, allowing patients to access their PHR in a mobile optimized environment. MMR is engaged in selling its MyMedicalRecords PHR product directly to consumers, corporations, physicians, small hospitals, surgery centers, other healthcare professionals, including nursing associations, retail pharmacies, veterinarians, and to affinity organizations as a value-added service for their members or clients. It also introduced a Prepaid Personal Health Record Kit, which is marketed through pharmacy retailers, healthcare professionals, home healthcare agencies and facilities, and patient advocates. Its PHR is also offered both through the MyMedicalRecords Website and as a private-labeled product.The Company's MyMedicalRecords PHR product is bilingual in English and Spanish and allows users to store and segregate information for over 10 family members in a single account. It provides portability for the user, which means MyMedicalRecords PHR can stay with the individual through changes in doctors, jobs and insurers. Healthcare providers can transmit documents to a patient's MyMedicalRecords PHR mailbox without making any changes to existing patient or practice management software.The Company's MyMedicalRecords PHR product can be used to provide storage for a range of records, including patient charts, notes and medical histories; vaccination and immunization records; lab reports and test results, including any images (or, if offered by a laboratory, links that the user can use to access the laboratory's stored images); copies of prescription orders; x-ray results and images (either the actual images or, if offered by a radiology provider, links that the user can use to access the provider's stored images); electrocardiogram (EKG) results and images (either the actual images or, if offered by an imaging provider, links that the user can use to access the provider's stored images); birth certificates, living wills, healthcare powers of attorney and advance directives; lab report and pharmacy records through 4medica, and telemedicine data through Alcatel-Lucent ng Connect. In addition, users can store legal, insurance and financial documents, as well as copies of identification documents, such as passports and driver's license in their MyMedicalRecords PHR account. It also offers a value-added service to MyMedicalRecords PHR, which the Company refers to as Personal Touch. When a user enrolls in Personal Touch, their records are collected on their behalf and organized and placed into their PHR. Personal Touch is included in certain of the Company's subscription services and is also sold separately as an additional service from the basic MyMedicalRecords Personal Health Record service.The Company's MyMedicalRecords PHR product offers users multiple ways to enter and maintain their personal medical information, including by fax, voice, digital file upload and online annotations, as well as through customized Web service links. In addition to the core document conversion, storage and retrieval capabilities, the Company's MyMedicalRecords PHR product provides a layer of tools to help users manage their personal and/or their families' medical records. These tools include integration with electronic medical record systems and laboratory reporting services, forms management and electronic signature, ability to attach received faxes to e-mail notifications, health history, appointment calendar feature, prescription history and refill reminder feature, drug information and interaction database, voice reminders and messaging, secondary passwords on selected file folders, emergency login for physicians and other emergency response personnel, and telemedicine. Its mobile applications are also available for the MyMedicalRecords PHR for Android tablets, smartphones and on the iPhone/iPad Operating System (iOS) platform.MyEsafeDepositBoxThe Company's MyEsafeDepositBox service is geared towards small businesses, the financial, insurance and legal services industries. MyEsafeDepositBox is based on the same technology and architecture as the MyMedicalRecords PHR product. MyEsafeDepositBox provides online storage for medical records and other financial, legal and insurance documents, such as wills and advance directives. MyEsafeDepositBox.com is used as an online safe and serves various household or businesses by storing legal, insurance and financial documents, such as copies of insurance policies, deeds of trust, passport, birth certificate, photos of property and other documents, in addition to medical records that are retrieved in the event of a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, hurricane, flood or fire.The Company's MyEsafeDepositBox product offers online storage due to the Company's telecommunications platform, which enables users to fax records directly into their MyEsafeDepositBox account. It also permits service providers, such as insurance agents or lenders, to fax documents directly into a user's online account. It also enables sorting, storing and managing records, while also uses a form text search to find records stored in their account with specific annotations. It provides private label branding of this product to banks, insurance companies, escrow services and other financial and legal businesses. The Company's MyMedicalRecords PHR product and MyEsafeDepositBox product are marketed through various channels. MyMedicalRecords PHR product and MyEsafeDepositBox product focuses primarily on channels, including corporate accounts; insurance companies; affinity groups (such as alumni organizations and other membership organizations) and discount health benefit membership groups; charitable and critical illness organizations; legal, accounting, mortgage and other organizations, and direct to consumers.MyMedicalRecordsMDThe Company's MMRPro product provides physician offices with a solution of digitizing paper-based medical records, as well as providing doctors the access to those records through a private portal at MyMedicalRecordsMD.com. In addition, MMRPro features an integrated e-Prescribe automated drug order entry system and automatically deploys a patient's records to a free patient portal, MMRPatientView.com, where patients can view and print out their records. MMRPro also includes its own Stimulus Program, which allows physicians the opportunity to earn administrative reimbursements when their patients upgrade from the free MMRPatientView.com portal to a paid MyMedicalRecords PHR account. MMRPro includes all hardware, software and system management.The Company has introduced a new version of MMRPro, MMRPro Plus, which allows the solution to work with virtually any scanner. MMRPro Plus installs as a client on an office computer instead of being built into the intelligence of the scanner.

They are shipping product to Walgreens this month to sell???  Really   Doesn't say that in the settlement.  They never PR'd such a thing.  No wonder the selling is in big chunks nowadays.   I doubt anyone at all believes that they are shipping to Walgreens.  Things appear to be unravelling fast if that is the storyline.

MMRGlobal and Fujitsu Offer Low-Cost System to Digitize Medical Records
Joint Solution Readies Physicians for HITECH Act’s 
Meaningful Use Requirement to Provide Patients 
Timely Online Access to Medical Records
Fujitsu Computer Products of America

Sunnyvale, CA, June 18, 2012
MMRGlobal, Inc. (OTC: MMRF) and Fujitsu Computer Products of America, Inc., the market leader in document imaging scanners, announced today a strategic alignment to assist physicians in smaller practices efficiently digitize their medical records and start to meet the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act’s meaningful use requirement to provide patients timely online access to their medical records by the end of 2014.
 
To help physicians convert from paper-based record-keeping to computerized health records, MMRPro, MMRGlobal’s premiere scanning and Web-based document management technology, is now integrated with the Fujitsu ScanSnap N1800 Network Scanner. Utilizing a proprietary interface created by DocuFi™, the document imaging solution offers smaller physician offices, community hospitals and surgery centers the ability to digitize, store, manage and share medical records without making the significant investment required while transitioning to a full-blown EMR system. MMRPro is also designed with an integrated patient portal, MMRPatientView, and includes the MMR Stimulus Program, which allows doctors the opportunity to earn administrative reimbursements when their patients upgrade from the free portal to a full-featured patented MyMedicalRecords Personal Health Record.
 
“Deploying our network scanning strategy for healthcare providers is seamless to the way an office operates with paper. Additionally, the learning curve to scan, archive and share documents across a physician’s office or in a small hospital is minimal,” said Marni Carmichael, director of business development, Fujitsu Computer Products of America, Inc. “We’re excited to be a part of offering MMRPro to physicians to help them cost-effectively transition from paper to electronic records to improve their overall workflow and patient care.”
“Fujitsu has a history of providing quality document imaging solutions to its customers,” said Robert H. Lorsch, MMRGlobal Chairman and CEO. “The integration of our patented document imaging system provides physician offices with the necessary tools to easily and affordably digitize their documents in an electronic format and have the ability to securely access patient records remotely using an Internet-connected device, including their iPad.”
The Fujitsu ScanSnap N1800 Network Scanner is designed to simplify document collaboration for all types of organizations, including small and midsize businesses (SMBs), groups within an enterprise and across the front office to the back office. The latest network scanner added to the award-winning line of Fujitsu ScanSnap scanning solutions offers new tools to make digitizing documents simple and specialized training unnecessary, enhanced security features to combat the threat of data compromise, and added flexibility to easily create customizable interface screens for a consistent user experience.
"Our relationship with MMRGlobal and Fujitsu brings a highly automated solution to the patient records management world using ImageRamp™ for MMRGlobal,” said Dave Wilson, president and CEO of DocuFi. “ImageRamp enables touch screen use of the Fujitsu ScanSnap N1800 Network Scanner to provide intelligent reading and xml formatting of patient medical records, stored in 2-D barcode form. Users of any skill level can now easily capture medical records into a cloud or SaaS EMR infrastructure."
