Consensus Ratings for Ystrategies Corp (NASDAQ:YSTR) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A

Industry veteran Jon Sigerman to develop opportunities with emerging wind technologies







Ystrategies Logo

Wind is at a very early stage in many potential investment areas, in spite of an exploding market acceptance and significant worldwide investment commitment.


San Francisco, CA (PRWEB)
July 20, 2017
 Ystrategies Corp. (OTC PINK: YSTR), a publicly-traded venture capital firm focused on technology startups with disruptive intellectual property in the software and clean tech sectors, today announced the acceleration of its focus on wind-related investments with the launch of a new Group dedicated to building a wind technology portfolio.  Successful startup CEO, strategic consultant and startup coach Jon Sigerman will develop strategy for the Group and support Ystrategies entrepreneurs and startups.  Zach Lebovitz, experienced renewable energy/technology analyst, will join Mr. Sigerman as Director, Systems Engineering for the Group.
 
Ystrategies’ Wind Technology Group will focus its investments on Operations & Maintenance (O&M) and design technologies that increase annual energy production in wind plants, and designs that enhance and optimize turbines and analytics systems.  Independent third-party research predicts a $20 billion O&M market and a more than doubling of wind capacity by 2025.  Ystrategies is investing in systems engineering and optimization software technology with National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) and NextEra Resources, LLC, and investigating other similarly promising opportunities in wind.
 
"Wind is at a very early stage in many important development concepts, in spite of an exploding market acceptance and significant worldwide investment commitment. Ystrategies’ Wind Technology Group is an important platform to support new wind initiatives with strong scientists and entrepreneurs and I’m pleased to be part of it," said Sigerman.
 
Ystrategies CEO Jim Kiles noted, "We have been focused on emerging software and design technologies in wind for several years and it is time to accelerate those efforts.  Ystrategies entrepreneurs are lucky to have the opportunity to benefit from Jon Sigerman’s focused startup approach, wisdom and technology experience.  This is another step in Ystrategies' commitment to break new ground and be a leading 21st century venture capital firm with a strong portfolio in the wind sector."

Ystrategies Corp. (OTC PINK: YSTR) Launches Wind Technology Group
Posted: 

Thursday, July 20, 2017 7:03 AM EDT




 Industry veteran Jon Sigerman to develop opportunities with emerging wind technologiesSan Francisco, CA (PRWEB) July 20, 2017  Ystrategies Corp. (OTC PINK: YSTR), a publicly-traded venture capital firm focused on technology startups with disruptive intellectual property in the software and clean tech sectors, today announced the acceleration of its focus on wind-related investments with the launch of a new Group dedicated to building a wind technology portfolio.  Successful startup CEO, strategic consultant and startup coach Jon Sigerman will develop strategy for the Group and support Ystrategies entrepreneurs and startups.  Zach Lebovitz, experienced renewable energy/technology analyst, will join Mr. Sigerman as Director, Systems Engineering for the Group. Ystrategies’ Wind Technology Group will focus its investments on Operations & Maintenance (O&M) and design technologies that increase annual energy production in wind plants, and designs that enhance and optimize turbines and analytics systems.  Independent third-party research predicts a $20 billion O&M market and a more than doubling of wind capacity by 2025.  Ystrategies is investing in systems engineering and optimization software technology with National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) and NextEra Resources, LLC, and investigating other similarly promising opportunities in wind. "Wind is at a very early stage in many important development concepts, in spite of an exploding market acceptance and significant worldwide investment commitment. Ystrategies’ Wind Technology Group is an important platform to support new wind initiatives with strong scientists and entrepreneurs and I’m pleased to be part of it," said Sigerman. Ystrategies CEO Jim Kiles noted, "We have been focused on emerging software and design technologies in wind for several years and it is time to accelerate those efforts.  Ystrategies entrepreneurs are lucky to have the opportunity to benefit from Jon Sigerman’s focused startup approach, wisdom and technology experience.  This is another step in Ystrategies' commitment to break new ground and be a leading 21st century venture capital firm with a strong portfolio in the wind sector." About Ystrategies Corp.Ystrategies, founded by former Intel Capital Managing Director, Jim Kiles, is a publicly traded venture capital firm concentrated on building disruptive businesses focused on critical issues such as renewable energy.  Ystrategies invests in science and technology emerging from the US National Laboratory System, incubators, businesses and academic institutions.  It looks for market ready technology with products or services ready to engage identified customer segment partners in important commercial agreements.  Investments are premised on closing strategic partner agreements as a path to valuable exits.  Industry veterans Jon Sigerman, Ashish Badjatia, Neil Cohen and Shirley Gee round out the investment team.  YSTR has offices in Pittsburgh and San Francisco.
