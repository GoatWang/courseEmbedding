Katz Teller litigator Peter O’Shea grew up in Greater Cincinnati, and when it came time to pick a college, a law school, a judicial clerkship and a law firm, he didn’t travel far.  While those local ties may be helpful at any firm, they are especially important at a firm as connected to Greater Cincinnati as Katz Teller.

Although Peter has been educated and employed locally, no one would accuse him of being provincial.  Between graduating from Thomas More College and starting law school at the University of Cincinnati College of Law, Peter volunteered for the Peace Corps in the Republic of Moldova.  During his time abroad, Peter taught English to local students, conducted workshops on American culture and customs, and coached basketball and Model United Nations teams. 

After graduating from law school in 2010, Peter served as a judicial clerk for Judge David L. Bunning of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky in Covington.  His first private sector position in Cincinnati was with Taft, Stettinus & Hollister, LLP, where he represented clients in all phases of commercial litigation, including matters involving contractual disputes, insurance coverage, and antitrust law.

Peter joined Katz Teller in March 2014.  He handles all business disputes on both the plaintiff and the defense side, providing strategic advice and representation in litigation, mediation, or arbitration proceedings.
