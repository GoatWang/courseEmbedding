Fit Everything
Model X offers best in class interior storage space. Carry all the people, baggage, bikes, strollers, and groceries you can manage. There’s even a trunk in the front.






















































The Safest SUV Ever
Model X is the safest SUV ever, with standard active safety features and hardware built to provide visibility that a driver cannot access alone. Eight surround cameras allow for 360-degree vision, while twelve ultrasonic sensors provide detection of surrounding objects. Forward-facing radar see through heavy rain, fog, dust, and beyond the vehicle ahead—helping to prevent accidents by providing simultaneous visibility in every direction. Model X is the first SUV ever to achieve a 5-star safety rating in every category and sub-category, the lowest probability of occupant injury, and a rollover risk half that of any SUV on the road.



Front trunk acts as large, impact absorbing crumple zone
Active safety sensors
Medical grade HEPA filter removes pollen, bacteria, viruses and pollution from cabin air
Floor mounted battery lowers the center of gravity which resists rollovers
Battery support structure provides incredible side impact protection




Active Safety
Every Model X comes standard with the most advanced active safety features, including Automatic Emergency Braking, Side Collision Warning, Lane Departure Warning, Autopilot driver assistance capabilities and more. And Model X gets better over time with over-the-air software updates designed to optimize its advanced sensor technology.


Clean-Air Cabin
Medical-grade air quality is delivered through a HEPA filtration system, specifically designed to prevent viruses and bacteria from entering the cabin. There are three modes: circulate with outside air, re-circulate inside air, and a bioweapon defense mode – which creates positive pressure inside the cabin to protect occupants.






Full Self-Driving Hardware

All Tesla vehicles produced in our factory have the hardware needed for full self-driving capability at a safety level substantially greater than that of a human driver.

Tesla Powerpack to Enable Large Scale Sustainable Energy to South Australia

        The Tesla Team                    July 6, 2017

Last September, a 50-year storm damaged critical infrastructure in the state of South Australia, causing a state-wide blackout and leaving 1.7 million residents without electricity. Further blackouts occurred in the heat of the Australian summer in early 2017. In response, the South Australian Government as a leader in renewable energy, looked for a sustainable solution to ensure energy security for all residents, now and into the future, calling for expressions of interest to deploy grid-scale energy storage options with at least 100 megawatts (MW) of capacity.

Tesla Model X the First SUV Ever to Achieve 5-Star Crash Rating in Every Category

        The Tesla Team                    June 13, 2017

We engineered Model X to be the safest SUV ever, and today, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) announced that after conducting independent testing, it has awarded Model X a 5-star safety rating in every category and sub-category, making it the first SUV ever to earn the 5-star rating across the board. More than just resulting in a 5-star rating, the data from NHTSA’s testing shows that Model X has the lowest probability of injury of any SUV it has ever tested. In fact, of all the cars NHTSA has ever tested, Model X’s overall probability of injury was second only to Model S.

The Next Step in Energy Storage: Aggregation

        The Tesla Team                    May 12, 2017

Today, modern utilities and grid operators are utilizing battery technology like never before. The next step in tapping the potential of energy storage is putting together thousands of batteries to form an energy network that utilities can use to deliver immediate value for the electric system. Tesla can now bundle Powerwall and Powerpack batteries into a single portfolio, also called aggregation, to make the grid cleaner and more efficient. Meanwhile, Powerwall customers who allow Tesla and the utilities to use their battery when energy demand is highest will not only have home backup power, but will also receive compensation for its use on the grid.
