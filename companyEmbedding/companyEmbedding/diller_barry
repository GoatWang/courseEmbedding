Early life[edit]
Diller was born into a Jewish household in San Francisco, California, and is the son of Reva (née Addison) and Michael Diller.[4][5]
Career[edit]
Diller began his career through a family connection[6] in the mailroom of the William Morris Agency after dropping out of UCLA after one semester. He was hired as an assistant by Elton Rule, then west coast head of ABC who was promoted to network President at the same time Diller went to work for him in 1964, taking him on to New York City, and Diller was soon placed in charge of negotiating broadcast rights to feature films. He was promoted to Vice President of Development in 1965. In this position, Diller created the ABC Movie of the Week, pioneering the concept of the made-for-television movie through a regular series of 90-minute films produced exclusively for television.[7]
Paramount[edit]
Diller served for ten years as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Paramount Pictures Corporation starting in 1974. With Diller at the helm, the studio produced hit television programs such as Laverne & Shirley (1976), Taxi (1978), and Cheers (1982) and films that include Saturday Night Fever (1977), Grease (1978), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) and sequel Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984), Terms of Endearment (1983), and Beverly Hills Cop (1984).
Fox[edit]
From October 1984 to April 1992, Diller held the positions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Fox, Inc, the parent company of Fox network and 20th Century Fox, where he greenlighted megahit shows such as Married...with Children and The Simpsons. Diller quit 20th Century Fox in 1992 and purchased a $25 million stake in QVC teleshopping network. Diller then launched a bid to purchase Paramount Communications, but lost it to Viacom. Diller resigned from QVC in 1995.
USA Broadcasting[edit]
In 1997, Diller acquired the assets of Silver King Broadcasting, the collective group of over-the-air TV stations owned by then Bud Paxson's Home Shopping Network as well as the Home Shopping Network itself. Along with this acquisition, Diller also purchased the rights to the USA Network from the Bronfman family. Due to Home Shopping getting more notoriety on the cable networks from his former dealings with the QVC Network, Diller sought to repurpose the broadcast stations into independent, locally-run stations as part of a station group dubbed USA Broadcasting of which the flagship station was WAMI-TV in Miami Beach, Florida.
The purpose of the network was to have the flagship, WAMI, produce sports and news programming while testing general interest programming for the other stations in the group, of which the general interest programming would be locally produced by the other stations in the group. Due to the high costs involved with producing and acquiring talent for shows outside the typical areas of New York City and Los Angeles, plus the significantly low ratings such shows received in Miami Beach, the remaining shows were moved to Los Angeles to regain traction, but never did. Diller eventually sold the TV assets to Univision after rejecting a bid from The Walt Disney Company. The USA Network and its assets were later sold off to Vivendi. Diller retained the assets of the Home Shopping Network and the subsequent Internet assets he acquired later to bolster the HSN Online stable that later became IAC/InterActiveCorp.[citation needed]
2000s[edit]




Barry Diller at the Web 2.0 Conference 2005


Diller was the Chairman of Expedia and the Chairman of IAC/InterActiveCorp, an interactive commerce conglomerate and the parent of companies including HomeAdvisor, Match.com, Citysearch, and Connected Ventures, home of Vimeo and CollegeHumor. In 2005, IAC/InterActiveCorp acquired Ask.com, marking a strategic move into the Internet search category. He stepped down as Chief Executive Officer of IAC/InterActiveCorp on December 2, 2010.[8]
The new headquarters for the IAC/InterActiveCorp, IAC Building was designed by Frank Gehry and opened in 2007 at 18th Street and the West Side Highway in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood. The western half of the block is dedicated to the building, which stands several stories taller than the massive Chelsea Piers Sporting complex just across the West Side Highway. The extra floors guarantee a panoramic Hudson River view from Diller's sixth-floor office.
Diller has been on the board of Coca-Cola since 2002.[9]
In 2003, on the PBS TV program NOW with Bill Moyers, Diller vocalized a strong warning against media consolidation. In the interview he referred to media ownership by a few big corporations as an oligarchy, saying the concentration strangles new ideas.[10]
Diller was "the highest-paid executive [of 2005 fiscal year]" according to a report by The New York Times on Thursday, October 26, 2006 with a total compensation package in excess of $295 million (mostly from stock).[11][12] In an opinion article in the New York Times of Nov 7, 2006, Nicholas D. Kristof awarded him his annual Michael Eisner Award[13], consisting of a $5 shower curtain, for corporate rapacity and laziness.[14]
"The Killer Dillers"[edit]
Diller is responsible for what the media dubs "The Killer Dillers" – people whom Diller mentored and who later became big-time media executives in their own right. Examples include Michael Eisner (who was President & COO of Paramount Pictures while Diller was Chairman & CEO of Paramount Pictures, who went on to become Chairman & CEO of The Walt Disney Company), Dawn Steel (future head of Columbia Pictures and one of the first women to run a major movie studio, who worked under Diller at Paramount), Jeffrey Katzenberg (head of DreamWorks Animation, principal of DreamWorks SKG, former head of Walt Disney Studios, and a head of production of Paramount under Diller), Garth Ancier, President of BBC America, and Don Simpson, who was President of Production at Paramount under Diller and Eisner and later went on to run a production company based on the Disney lot with Jerry Bruckheimer.[15]
Diller worked with Stephen Chao at Fox Television Network, whom he later hired as President of Programming and Marketing at USA Network. Julius Genachowski, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, served as Diller's General Counsel during their tenure at USA Broadcasting, and again as Chief of Business Operations and a member of Barry Diller's Office of the Chairman at IAC/InterActiveCorp.[citation needed]
Personal life[edit]




Diller with his wife Diane von Fürstenberg at the 2009 Metropolitan Opera premiere


In 2001, Diller married fashion designer Diane von Fürstenberg, mother of Alexander von Fürstenberg and Tatiana von Fürstenberg. He is a member of the Democratic Party and supporter of related political causes.[16] As of October 2015, Diller's estimated net worth was $2.6 billion.[17]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 2011, the Diller-von Furstenberg Family Foundation announced a donation of $20 million to support the completion of the High Line park project in Manhattan.[18]
In 2012, Diller donated $30 million to the Hollywood Fund, which provides health and social care to retired individuals from the show-business world.[19]
In 2015, Diller and his wife committed to donate US$113 million toward a floating public park and performance space on a pier in the Hudson River, New York. It is stated to be the largest donation to a public park in New York's history, with the project completion estimated around 2019. Together the couple formed the Diller-von Furstenberg Foundation.[20][21]

He was hired as an assistant by Elton Rule, then west coast head of ABC who was promoted to network President at the same time Diller went to work for him in 1964, taking him on to New York City, and Diller was soon placed in charge of negotiating broadcast rights to feature films. He was promoted to Vice President of Development in 1965. In this position, Diller created the ABC Movie of the Week, pioneering the concept of the made-for-television movie through a regular series of 90-minute films produced exclusively for television.[7]
Paramount[edit]
Diller served for ten years as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Paramount Pictures Corporation starting in 1974. With Diller at the helm, the studio produced hit television programs such as Laverne & Shirley (1976), Taxi (1978), and Cheers (1982) and films that include Saturday Night Fever (1977), Grease (1978), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) and sequel Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984), Terms of Endearment (1983), and Beverly Hills Cop (1984).
Fox[edit]
From October 1984 to April 1992, Diller held the positions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Fox, Inc, the parent company of Fox network and 20th Century Fox, where he greenlighted megahit shows such as Married...with Children and The Simpsons. Diller quit 20th Century Fox in 1992 and purchased a $25 million stake in QVC teleshopping network. Diller then launched a bid to purchase Paramount Communications, but lost it to Viacom. Diller resigned from QVC in 1995.
USA Broadcasting[edit]
In 1997, Diller acquired the assets of Silver King Broadcasting, the collective group of over-the-air TV stations owned by then Bud Paxson's Home Shopping Network as well as the Home Shopping Network itself. Along with this acquisition, Diller also purchased the rights to the USA Network from the Bronfman family. Due to Home Shopping getting more notoriety on the cable networks from his former dealings with the QVC Network, Diller sought to repurpose the broadcast stations into independent, locally-run stations as part of a station group dubbed USA Broadcasting of which the flagship station was WAMI-TV in Miami Beach, Florida.
The purpose of the network was to have the flagship, WAMI, produce sports and news programming while testing general interest programming for the other stations in the group, of which the general interest programming would be locally produced by the other stations in the group. Due to the high costs involved with producing and acquiring talent for shows outside the typical areas of New York City and Los Angeles, plus the significantly low ratings such shows received in Miami Beach, the remaining shows were moved to Los Angeles to regain traction, but never did. Diller eventually sold the TV assets to Univision after rejecting a bid from The Walt Disney Company. The USA Network and its assets were later sold off to Vivendi. Diller retained the assets of the Home Shopping Network and the subsequent Internet assets he acquired later to bolster the HSN Online stable that later became IAC/InterActiveCorp.[citation needed]
2000s[edit]




Barry Diller at the Web 2.0 Conference 2005


Diller was the Chairman of Expedia and the Chairman of IAC/InterActiveCorp, an interactive commerce conglomerate and the parent of companies including HomeAdvisor, Match.com, Citysearch, and Connected Ventures, home of Vimeo and CollegeHumor. In 2005, IAC/InterActiveCorp acquired Ask.com, marking a strategic move into the Internet search category. He stepped down as Chief Executive Officer of IAC/InterActiveCorp on December 2, 2010.[8]
The new headquarters for the IAC/InterActiveCorp, IAC Building was designed by Frank Gehry and opened in 2007 at 18th Street and the West Side Highway in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood. The western half of the block is dedicated to the building, which stands several stories taller than the massive Chelsea Piers Sporting complex just across the West Side Highway. The extra floors guarantee a panoramic Hudson River view from Diller's sixth-floor office.
Diller has been on the board of Coca-Cola since 2002.[9]
In 2003, on the PBS TV program NOW with Bill Moyers, Diller vocalized a strong warning against media consolidation. In the interview he referred to media ownership by a few big corporations as an oligarchy, saying the concentration strangles new ideas.[10]
Diller was "the highest-paid executive [of 2005 fiscal year]" according to a report by The New York Times on Thursday, October 26, 2006 with a total compensation package in excess of $295 million (mostly from stock).[11][12] In an opinion article in the New York Times of Nov 7, 2006, Nicholas D. Kristof awarded him his annual Michael Eisner Award[13], consisting of a $5 shower curtain, for corporate rapacity and laziness.[14]
"The Killer Dillers"[edit]
Diller is responsible for what the media dubs "The Killer Dillers" – people whom Diller mentored and who later became big-time media executives in their own right. Examples include Michael Eisner (who was President & COO of Paramount Pictures while Diller was Chairman & CEO of Paramount Pictures, who went on to become Chairman & CEO of The Walt Disney Company), Dawn Steel (future head of Columbia Pictures and one of the first women to run a major movie studio, who worked under Diller at Paramount), Jeffrey Katzenberg (head of DreamWorks Animation, principal of DreamWorks SKG, former head of Walt Disney Studios, and a head of production of Paramount under Diller), Garth Ancier, President of BBC America, and Don Simpson, who was President of Production at Paramount under Diller and Eisner and later went on to run a production company based on the Disney lot with Jerry Bruckheimer.[15]
Diller worked with Stephen Chao at Fox Television Network, whom he later hired as President of Programming and Marketing at USA Network. Julius Genachowski, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, served as Diller's General Counsel during their tenure at USA Broadcasting, and again as Chief of Business Operations and a member of Barry Diller's Office of the Chairman at IAC/InterActiveCorp.[citation needed]
Personal life[edit]




Diller with his wife Diane von Fürstenberg at the 2009 Metropolitan Opera premiere


In 2001, Diller married fashion designer Diane von Fürstenberg, mother of Alexander von Fürstenberg and Tatiana von Fürstenberg. He is a member of the Democratic Party and supporter of related political causes.[16] As of October 2015, Diller's estimated net worth was $2.6 billion.[17]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 2011, the Diller-von Furstenberg Family Foundation announced a donation of $20 million to support the completion of the High Line park project in Manhattan.[18]
In 2012, Diller donated $30 million to the Hollywood Fund, which provides health and social care to retired individuals from the show-business world.[19]
In 2015, Diller and his wife committed to donate US$113 million toward a floating public park and performance space on a pier in the Hudson River, New York. It is stated to be the largest donation to a public park in New York's history, with the project completion estimated around 2019. Together the couple formed the Diller-von Furstenberg Foundation.[20][21]

Early life[edit]
Diller was born into a Jewish household in San Francisco, California, and is the son of Reva (née Addison) and Michael Diller.[4][5]
Career[edit]
Diller began his career through a family connection[6] in the mailroom of the William Morris Agency after dropping out of UCLA after one semester. He was hired as an assistant by Elton Rule, then west coast head of ABC who was promoted to network President at the same time Diller went to work for him in 1964, taking him on to New York City, and Diller was soon placed in charge of negotiating broadcast rights to feature films.

With Diller at the helm, the studio produced hit television programs such as Laverne & Shirley (1976), Taxi (1978), and Cheers (1982) and films that include Saturday Night Fever (1977), Grease (1978), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) and sequel Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984), Terms of Endearment (1983), and Beverly Hills Cop (1984).

Diller quit 20th Century Fox in 1992 and purchased a $25 million stake in QVC teleshopping network. Diller then launched a bid to purchase Paramount Communications, but lost it to Viacom. Diller resigned from QVC in 1995.
USA Broadcasting[edit]
In 1997, Diller acquired the assets of Silver King Broadcasting, the collective group of over-the-air TV stations owned by then Bud Paxson's Home Shopping Network as well as the Home Shopping Network itself. Along with this acquisition, Diller also purchased the rights to the USA Network from the Bronfman family. Due to Home Shopping getting more notoriety on the cable networks from his former dealings with the QVC Network, Diller sought to repurpose the broadcast stations into independent, locally-run stations as part of a station group dubbed USA Broadcasting of which the flagship station was WAMI-TV in Miami Beach, Florida.
The purpose of the network was to have the flagship, WAMI, produce sports and news programming while testing general interest programming for the other stations in the group, of which the general interest programming would be locally produced by the other stations in the group. Due to the high costs involved with producing and acquiring talent for shows outside the typical areas of New York City and Los Angeles, plus the significantly low ratings such shows received in Miami Beach, the remaining shows were moved to Los Angeles to regain traction, but never did. Diller eventually sold the TV assets to Univision after rejecting a bid from The Walt Disney Company. The USA Network and its assets were later sold off to Vivendi. Diller retained the assets of the Home Shopping Network and the subsequent Internet assets he acquired later to bolster the HSN Online stable that later became IAC/InterActiveCorp.[citation needed]
2000s[edit]




Barry Diller at the Web 2.0 Conference 2005


Diller was the Chairman of Expedia and the Chairman of IAC/InterActiveCorp, an interactive commerce conglomerate and the parent of companies including HomeAdvisor, Match.com, Citysearch, and Connected Ventures, home of Vimeo and CollegeHumor. In 2005, IAC/InterActiveCorp acquired Ask.com, marking a strategic move into the Internet search category. He stepped down as Chief Executive Officer of IAC/InterActiveCorp on December 2, 2010.[8]
The new headquarters for the IAC/InterActiveCorp, IAC Building was designed by Frank Gehry and opened in 2007 at 18th Street and the West Side Highway in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood. The western half of the block is dedicated to the building, which stands several stories taller than the massive Chelsea Piers Sporting complex just across the West Side Highway. The extra floors guarantee a panoramic Hudson River view from Diller's sixth-floor office.
Diller has been on the board of Coca-Cola since 2002.[9]
In 2003, on the PBS TV program NOW with Bill Moyers, Diller vocalized a strong warning against media consolidation. In the interview he referred to media ownership by a few big corporations as an oligarchy, saying the concentration strangles new ideas.[10]
Diller was "the highest-paid executive [of 2005 fiscal year]" according to a report by The New York Times on Thursday, October 26, 2006 with a total compensation package in excess of $295 million (mostly from stock).[11][12] In an opinion article in the New York Times of Nov 7, 2006, Nicholas D. Kristof awarded him his annual Michael Eisner Award[13], consisting of a $5 shower curtain, for corporate rapacity and laziness.[14]
"The Killer Dillers"[edit]
Diller is responsible for what the media dubs "The Killer Dillers" – people whom Diller mentored and who later became big-time media executives in their own right. Examples include Michael Eisner (who was President & COO of Paramount Pictures while Diller was Chairman & CEO of Paramount Pictures, who went on to become Chairman & CEO of The Walt Disney Company), Dawn Steel (future head of Columbia Pictures and one of the first women to run a major movie studio, who worked under Diller at Paramount), Jeffrey Katzenberg (head of DreamWorks Animation, principal of DreamWorks SKG, former head of Walt Disney Studios, and a head of production of Paramount under Diller), Garth Ancier, President of BBC America, and Don Simpson, who was President of Production at Paramount under Diller and Eisner and later went on to run a production company based on the Disney lot with Jerry Bruckheimer.[15]
Diller worked with Stephen Chao at Fox Television Network, whom he later hired as President of Programming and Marketing at USA Network. Julius Genachowski, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, served as Diller's General Counsel during their tenure at USA Broadcasting, and again as Chief of Business Operations and a member of Barry Diller's Office of the Chairman at IAC/InterActiveCorp.[citation needed]
Personal life[edit]




Diller with his wife Diane von Fürstenberg at the 2009 Metropolitan Opera premiere


In 2001, Diller married fashion designer Diane von Fürstenberg, mother of Alexander von Fürstenberg and Tatiana von Fürstenberg. He is a member of the Democratic Party and supporter of related political causes.[16] As of October 2015, Diller's estimated net worth was $2.6 billion.[17]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 2011, the Diller-von Furstenberg Family Foundation announced a donation of $20 million to support the completion of the High Line park project in Manhattan.[18]
In 2012, Diller donated $30 million to the Hollywood Fund, which provides health and social care to retired individuals from the show-business world.[19]
In 2015, Diller and his wife committed to donate US$113 million toward a floating public park and performance space on a pier in the Hudson River, New York. It is stated to be the largest donation to a public park in New York's history, with the project completion estimated around 2019. Together the couple formed the Diller-von Furstenberg Foundation.[20][21]

He moved into programming at ABC, popularizing the TV miniseries. At Twentieth Century-Fox in 1986, he launched the Fox Broadcasting Company, the first new network to hit television in decades. Diller then amassed a media empire, including multiple cable channels, Ticketmaster and internet companies.Early LifeWho invited Barry Diller to the Internet party? In the hip, young world of Internet start-ups, media mogul Barry Diller, owner of the Home Shopping and USA Networks, the Sci-Fi Channel and Ticketmaster, is sometimes regarded as an interloper. But Diller's innovative spirit, which helped invent the television miniseries and launched the brash young Fox Television Network when no one thought a fourth network was possible, is now hard at work integrating old and new media into a commerce empire.Born in San Francisco, in 1942, Diller grew up in Los Angeles and claims he rarely attended classes on Mondays or Fridays at Beverly Hills High School.He dropped out of UCLA after four months, but his friend Marlo Thomas helped him get a job in the mailroom at the William Morris Agency. Three years later, Diller was a full-fledged talent agent. In 1966, he became a programming assistant at ABC and steadily rose to the position of vice president. Along the way, he invented the made-for-TV movie and launched the TV miniseries Roots. In 1974, he took a job as chairman and chief executive of Paramount Studios and turned the flagging company around with hits including Saturday Night Fever (1977) and Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981). Creation of the Fox NetworkIn 1984, he joined Twentieth Century-Fox where he created the Fox  Television Network, which changed the television landscape by attracting  a young, male audience with shows like The Simpsons and Married with  Children. Diller, known for his tough-talking, volatile personality,  left the company in 1992 after having a falling out with Rupert Murdoch  (owner of Fox's parent company). Later that year, Diller bought shopping  channel QVC, and also tried to purchase Paramount and later CBS, losing  both bids. In 1995, Diller began amassing his own media empire,  becoming chairman of the Home Shopping Network, and acquiring USA and  the Sci-Fi Channel. In 1997, he became part owner of Ticketmaster. The  following year, he merged Ticketmaster's online arm with Citysearch,  a provider of local online city guides. The combination transformed  Citysearch into an e-commerce venture, and the combined company, called  Ticketmaster Online-Citysearch, went public in 1999. Internet MogulDiller continued his online expansion as Citysearch acquired two online  dating sites, a job listing service, and created CityAuction to satisfy  the growing demand for online auctions. Meanwhile, in early 1999, he  made a dramatic bid for Lycos, in a move that promised to create a  powerful cross-media empire. Television promotion and Lycos' high  traffic levels would lure Web surfers to the company's commerce  offerings, while the Websites promoted Diller's television properties,  including shows like Jerry Springer and Xena Warrior Princess.Fierce resistance to the uninvited Internet guest on the part of Lycos'  shareholders, however, torpedoed the deal several months after it was  announced. Nevertheless, even without a major portal site, Diller's  prowess at combining content and commerce, demonstrated with the success  of the Home Shopping Network, seems well suited to the new media world,  and he shows no signs of easing up his quest to meld old and new media  into one empire.To date, Ticketmaster Online-Citysearch's integrated family of sites  includes Ticketmaster Online, Citysearch, Match.com, CityAuction,  LiveDaily (an entertainment news site), and Astro Abby (an astrology  site). In August 2000, Diller negotiated a $500 million merger of the  e-commerce enabler Styleclick.com with USA's Internet Shopping Network.Fact CheckWe strive for accuracy and fairness.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Early life[edit]
Diller was born into a Jewish household in San Francisco, California, and is the son of Reva (née Addison) and Michael Diller.[4][5]
Career[edit]
Diller began his career through a family connection[6] in the mailroom of the William Morris Agency after dropping out of UCLA after one semester. He was hired as an assistant by Elton Rule, then west coast head of ABC who was promoted to network President at the same time Diller went to work for him in 1964, taking him on to New York City, and Diller was soon placed in charge of negotiating broadcast rights to feature films. He was promoted to Vice President of Development in 1965. In this position, Diller created the ABC Movie of the Week, pioneering the concept of the made-for-television movie through a regular series of 90-minute films produced exclusively for television.[7]
Paramount[edit]
Diller served for ten years as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Paramount Pictures Corporation starting in 1974. With Diller at the helm, the studio produced hit television programs such as Laverne & Shirley (1976), Taxi (1978), and Cheers (1982) and films that include Saturday Night Fever (1977), Grease (1978), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) and sequel Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984), Terms of Endearment (1983), and Beverly Hills Cop (1984).
Fox[edit]
From October 1984 to April 1992, Diller held the positions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Fox, Inc, the parent company of Fox network and 20th Century Fox, where he greenlighted megahit shows such as Married...with Children and The Simpsons. Diller quit 20th Century Fox in 1992 and purchased a $25 million stake in QVC teleshopping network. Diller then launched a bid to purchase Paramount Communications, but lost it to Viacom. Diller resigned from QVC in 1995.
USA Broadcasting[edit]
In 1997, Diller acquired the assets of Silver King Broadcasting, the collective group of over-the-air TV stations owned by then Bud Paxson's Home Shopping Network as well as the Home Shopping Network itself. Along with this acquisition, Diller also purchased the rights to the USA Network from the Bronfman family. Due to Home Shopping getting more notoriety on the cable networks from his former dealings with the QVC Network, Diller sought to repurpose the broadcast stations into independent, locally-run stations as part of a station group dubbed USA Broadcasting of which the flagship station was WAMI-TV in Miami Beach, Florida.
The purpose of the network was to have the flagship, WAMI, produce sports and news programming while testing general interest programming for the other stations in the group, of which the general interest programming would be locally produced by the other stations in the group. Due to the high costs involved with producing and acquiring talent for shows outside the typical areas of New York City and Los Angeles, plus the significantly low ratings such shows received in Miami Beach, the remaining shows were moved to Los Angeles to regain traction, but never did. Diller eventually sold the TV assets to Univision after rejecting a bid from The Walt Disney Company. The USA Network and its assets were later sold off to Vivendi. Diller retained the assets of the Home Shopping Network and the subsequent Internet assets he acquired later to bolster the HSN Online stable that later became IAC/InterActiveCorp.[citation needed]
2000s[edit]




Barry Diller at the Web 2.0 Conference 2005


Diller was the Chairman of Expedia and the Chairman of IAC/InterActiveCorp, an interactive commerce conglomerate and the parent of companies including HomeAdvisor, Match.com, Citysearch, and Connected Ventures, home of Vimeo and CollegeHumor. In 2005, IAC/InterActiveCorp acquired Ask.com, marking a strategic move into the Internet search category. He stepped down as Chief Executive Officer of IAC/InterActiveCorp on December 2, 2010.[8]
The new headquarters for the IAC/InterActiveCorp, IAC Building was designed by Frank Gehry and opened in 2007 at 18th Street and the West Side Highway in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood. The western half of the block is dedicated to the building, which stands several stories taller than the massive Chelsea Piers Sporting complex just across the West Side Highway. The extra floors guarantee a panoramic Hudson River view from Diller's sixth-floor office.
Diller has been on the board of Coca-Cola since 2002.[9]
In 2003, on the PBS TV program NOW with Bill Moyers, Diller vocalized a strong warning against media consolidation. In the interview he referred to media ownership by a few big corporations as an oligarchy, saying the concentration strangles new ideas.[10]
Diller was "the highest-paid executive [of 2005 fiscal year]" according to a report by The New York Times on Thursday, October 26, 2006 with a total compensation package in excess of $295 million (mostly from stock).[11][12] In an opinion article in the New York Times of Nov 7, 2006, Nicholas D. Kristof awarded him his annual Michael Eisner Award[13], consisting of a $5 shower curtain, for corporate rapacity and laziness.[14]
"The Killer Dillers"[edit]
Diller is responsible for what the media dubs "The Killer Dillers" – people whom Diller mentored and who later became big-time media executives in their own right. Examples include Michael Eisner (who was President & COO of Paramount Pictures while Diller was Chairman & CEO of Paramount Pictures, who went on to become Chairman & CEO of The Walt Disney Company), Dawn Steel (future head of Columbia Pictures and one of the first women to run a major movie studio, who worked under Diller at Paramount), Jeffrey Katzenberg (head of DreamWorks Animation, principal of DreamWorks SKG, former head of Walt Disney Studios, and a head of production of Paramount under Diller), Garth Ancier, President of BBC America, and Don Simpson, who was President of Production at Paramount under Diller and Eisner and later went on to run a production company based on the Disney lot with Jerry Bruckheimer.[15]
Diller worked with Stephen Chao at Fox Television Network, whom he later hired as President of Programming and Marketing at USA Network. Julius Genachowski, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, served as Diller's General Counsel during their tenure at USA Broadcasting, and again as Chief of Business Operations and a member of Barry Diller's Office of the Chairman at IAC/InterActiveCorp.[citation needed]
Personal life[edit]




Diller with his wife Diane von Fürstenberg at the 2009 Metropolitan Opera premiere


In 2001, Diller married fashion designer Diane von Fürstenberg, mother of Alexander von Fürstenberg and Tatiana von Fürstenberg. He is a member of the Democratic Party and supporter of related political causes.[16] As of October 2015, Diller's estimated net worth was $2.6 billion.[17]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 2011, the Diller-von Furstenberg Family Foundation announced a donation of $20 million to support the completion of the High Line park project in Manhattan.[18]
In 2012, Diller donated $30 million to the Hollywood Fund, which provides health and social care to retired individuals from the show-business world.[19]
In 2015, Diller and his wife committed to donate US$113 million toward a floating public park and performance space on a pier in the Hudson River, New York. It is stated to be the largest donation to a public park in New York's history, with the project completion estimated around 2019. Together the couple formed the Diller-von Furstenberg Foundation.[20][21]

Early life[edit]
Diller was born into a Jewish household in San Francisco, California, and is the son of Reva (née Addison) and Michael Diller.[4][5]
Career[edit]
Diller began his career through a family connection[6] in the mailroom of the William Morris Agency after dropping out of UCLA after one semester. He was hired as an assistant by Elton Rule, then west coast head of ABC who was promoted to network President at the same time Diller went to work for him in 1964, taking him on to New York City, and Diller was soon placed in charge of negotiating broadcast rights to feature films. He was promoted to Vice President of Development in 1965. In this position, Diller created the ABC Movie of the Week, pioneering the concept of the made-for-television movie through a regular series of 90-minute films produced exclusively for television.[7]
Paramount[edit]
Diller served for ten years as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Paramount Pictures Corporation starting in 1974. With Diller at the helm, the studio produced hit television programs such as Laverne & Shirley (1976), Taxi (1978), and Cheers (1982) and films that include Saturday Night Fever (1977), Grease (1978), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) and sequel Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984), Terms of Endearment (1983), and Beverly Hills Cop (1984).

From October 1984 to April 1992, Diller held the positions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Fox, Inc, the parent company of Fox network and 20th Century Fox, where he greenlighted megahit shows such as Married...with Children and The Simpsons. Diller quit 20th Century Fox in 1992 and purchased a $25 million stake in QVC teleshopping network. Diller then launched a bid to purchase Paramount Communications, but lost it to Viacom. Diller resigned from QVC in 1995.
USA Broadcasting[edit]
In 1997, Diller acquired the assets of Silver King Broadcasting, the collective group of over-the-air TV stations owned by then Bud Paxson's Home Shopping Network as well as the Home Shopping Network itself. Along with this acquisition, Diller also purchased the rights to the USA Network from the Bronfman family. Due to Home Shopping getting more notoriety on the cable networks from his former dealings with the QVC Network, Diller sought to repurpose the broadcast stations into independent, locally-run stations as part of a station group dubbed USA Broadcasting of which the flagship station was WAMI-TV in Miami Beach, Florida.
The purpose of the network was to have the flagship, WAMI, produce sports and news programming while testing general interest programming for the other stations in the group, of which the general interest programming would be locally produced by the other stations in the group. Due to the high costs involved with producing and acquiring talent for shows outside the typical areas of New York City and Los Angeles, plus the significantly low ratings such shows received in Miami Beach, the remaining shows were moved to Los Angeles to regain traction, but never did. Diller eventually sold the TV assets to Univision after rejecting a bid from The Walt Disney Company. The USA Network and its assets were later sold off to Vivendi. Diller retained the assets of the Home Shopping Network and the subsequent Internet assets he acquired later to bolster the HSN Online stable that later became IAC/InterActiveCorp.[citation needed]
2000s[edit]




Barry Diller at the Web 2.0 Conference 2005


Diller was the Chairman of Expedia and the Chairman of IAC/InterActiveCorp, an interactive commerce conglomerate and the parent of companies including HomeAdvisor, Match.com, Citysearch, and Connected Ventures, home of Vimeo and CollegeHumor. In 2005, IAC/InterActiveCorp acquired Ask.com, marking a strategic move into the Internet search category. He stepped down as Chief Executive Officer of IAC/InterActiveCorp on December 2, 2010.[8]
The new headquarters for the IAC/InterActiveCorp, IAC Building was designed by Frank Gehry and opened in 2007 at 18th Street and the West Side Highway in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood. The western half of the block is dedicated to the building, which stands several stories taller than the massive Chelsea Piers Sporting complex just across the West Side Highway. The extra floors guarantee a panoramic Hudson River view from Diller's sixth-floor office.
Diller has been on the board of Coca-Cola since 2002.[9]
In 2003, on the PBS TV program NOW with Bill Moyers, Diller vocalized a strong warning against media consolidation. In the interview he referred to media ownership by a few big corporations as an oligarchy, saying the concentration strangles new ideas.[10]
Diller was "the highest-paid executive [of 2005 fiscal year]" according to a report by The New York Times on Thursday, October 26, 2006 with a total compensation package in excess of $295 million (mostly from stock).[11][12] In an opinion article in the New York Times of Nov 7, 2006, Nicholas D. Kristof awarded him his annual Michael Eisner Award[13], consisting of a $5 shower curtain, for corporate rapacity and laziness.[14]
"The Killer Dillers"[edit]
Diller is responsible for what the media dubs "The Killer Dillers" – people whom Diller mentored and who later became big-time media executives in their own right. Examples include Michael Eisner (who was President & COO of Paramount Pictures while Diller was Chairman & CEO of Paramount Pictures, who went on to become Chairman & CEO of The Walt Disney Company), Dawn Steel (future head of Columbia Pictures and one of the first women to run a major movie studio, who worked under Diller at Paramount), Jeffrey Katzenberg (head of DreamWorks Animation, principal of DreamWorks SKG, former head of Walt Disney Studios, and a head of production of Paramount under Diller), Garth Ancier, President of BBC America, and Don Simpson, who was President of Production at Paramount under Diller and Eisner and later went on to run a production company based on the Disney lot with Jerry Bruckheimer.[15]
Diller worked with Stephen Chao at Fox Television Network, whom he later hired as President of Programming and Marketing at USA Network. Julius Genachowski, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, served as Diller's General Counsel during their tenure at USA Broadcasting, and again as Chief of Business Operations and a member of Barry Diller's Office of the Chairman at IAC/InterActiveCorp.[citation needed]
Personal life[edit]




Diller with his wife Diane von Fürstenberg at the 2009 Metropolitan Opera premiere


In 2001, Diller married fashion designer Diane von Fürstenberg, mother of Alexander von Fürstenberg and Tatiana von Fürstenberg. He is a member of the Democratic Party and supporter of related political causes.[16] As of October 2015, Diller's estimated net worth was $2.6 billion.[17]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 2011, the Diller-von Furstenberg Family Foundation announced a donation of $20 million to support the completion of the High Line park project in Manhattan.[18]
In 2012, Diller donated $30 million to the Hollywood Fund, which provides health and social care to retired individuals from the show-business world.[19]
In 2015, Diller and his wife committed to donate US$113 million toward a floating public park and performance space on a pier in the Hudson River, New York. It is stated to be the largest donation to a public park in New York's history, with the project completion estimated around 2019. Together the couple formed the Diller-von Furstenberg Foundation.[20][21]

Emphasizes Importance of Broadband Internet
BARRY DILLER DUMPS ON PRODUCT PLACEMENT
Calls Advertainment Not 'Particularly Effective'


	By  

Jon Fine.
	

	
	
 Published on October 21, 2003. 







		        RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. (AdAge.com) -- Barry Diller, chairman-CEO of InterActive Corp., warned attendees at the American Magazine Conference here not to believe

Barry Diller doesn't think product placement is effective.

 the hype of Madison & Vine-styled product-placement entertainment properties.

"I think it's ridiculous to think artful product placement is particularly effective," he said. 

Blunt but humorous 
Such comments typified the blunt but often humorous tone he took during a half-hour interview conducted by Newsweek's chairman, Rick Smith.

They also may be seen in light of Mr. Diller's broad dissatisfaction with the entertainment world he moved in -- and mastered -- for decades. "Hollywood is a pain in the ass," he said. 

Movies today, he said, cost "such a disgusting amount of money," and require even more "stupid" money to market. Moviemaking, he added, is now increasingly geared towards selling merchandise as well as inevitable sequels to "huge elephantine movies" that have lost all sense of traditional storytelling and narrative.

And entertainment, broadly speaking, "is challenged in every way" by factors such as audience fragmentation and the rise of digital video recorders like TiVo that he felt were "not interesting challenges."

The Internet advantage 
But the Internet, Mr. Diller said, gives one the chance to "make up new things" as well as giving one new ways to "get into trouble," with the benefit of no long-held structures "standing in your way."

He predicted that consumer acceptance of broadband online access would come much more rapidly than currently expected. 

Mr. Diller's InterActive Corp. split off from USA Networks last year. InterActive specializes in e-commerce (a word he termed "horrible") properties and owns Expedia, Ticketmaster, the Home Shopping Network and Lending Tree, the online mortgage company.

As he has before, Mr. Diller came out strongly in favor of federal regulatory oversight of media mergers, though he termed opposing such consolidation "idiocy."

Should, for instance, News Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch (once Mr. Diller's former boss) be mandated to air a set percentage of independent programming on his vast distribution holdings, it "wouldn't hurt the industrial value of the company at all."

Praising Rupert Murdoch 
Mr. Diller had high praise for Mr. Murdoch, calling him a "true internationalist" and "the only one who ever got it right in a clear and everlasting way."

Afterward, Mr. Diller said he wasn't interested in acquiring Primedia's New York Magazine. He declined to speculate on what quick consumer adoption of broadband would mean for media and advertising, calling it a "complex" topic.

Early life[edit]
Diller was born into a Jewish household in San Francisco, California, and is the son of Reva (née Addison) and Michael Diller.[4][5]
Career[edit]
Diller began his career through a family connection[6] in the mailroom of the William Morris Agency after dropping out of UCLA after one semester. He was hired as an assistant by Elton Rule, then west coast head of ABC who was promoted to network President at the same time Diller went to work for him in 1964, taking him on to New York City, and Diller was soon placed in charge of negotiating broadcast rights to feature films. He was promoted to Vice President of Development in 1965. In this position, Diller created the ABC Movie of the Week, pioneering the concept of the made-for-television movie through a regular series of 90-minute films produced exclusively for television.[7]
Paramount[edit]
Diller served for ten years as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Paramount Pictures Corporation starting in 1974. With Diller at the helm, the studio produced hit television programs such as Laverne & Shirley (1976), Taxi (1978), and Cheers (1982) and films that include Saturday Night Fever (1977), Grease (1978), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) and sequel Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984), Terms of Endearment (1983), and Beverly Hills Cop (1984).
Fox[edit]
From October 1984 to April 1992, Diller held the positions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Fox, Inc, the parent company of Fox network and 20th Century Fox, where he greenlighted megahit shows such as Married...with Children and The Simpsons. Diller quit 20th Century Fox in 1992 and purchased a $25 million stake in QVC teleshopping network. Diller then launched a bid to purchase Paramount Communications, but lost it to Viacom. Diller resigned from QVC in 1995.
USA Broadcasting[edit]
In 1997, Diller acquired the assets of Silver King Broadcasting, the collective group of over-the-air TV stations owned by then Bud Paxson's Home Shopping Network as well as the Home Shopping Network itself. Along with this acquisition, Diller also purchased the rights to the USA Network from the Bronfman family. Due to Home Shopping getting more notoriety on the cable networks from his former dealings with the QVC Network, Diller sought to repurpose the broadcast stations into independent, locally-run stations as part of a station group dubbed USA Broadcasting of which the flagship station was WAMI-TV in Miami Beach, Florida.
The purpose of the network was to have the flagship, WAMI, produce sports and news programming while testing general interest programming for the other stations in the group, of which the general interest programming would be locally produced by the other stations in the group. Due to the high costs involved with producing and acquiring talent for shows outside the typical areas of New York City and Los Angeles, plus the significantly low ratings such shows received in Miami Beach, the remaining shows were moved to Los Angeles to regain traction, but never did. Diller eventually sold the TV assets to Univision after rejecting a bid from The Walt Disney Company. The USA Network and its assets were later sold off to Vivendi. Diller retained the assets of the Home Shopping Network and the subsequent Internet assets he acquired later to bolster the HSN Online stable that later became IAC/InterActiveCorp.[citation needed]
2000s[edit]




Barry Diller at the Web 2.0 Conference 2005


Diller was the Chairman of Expedia and the Chairman of IAC/InterActiveCorp, an interactive commerce conglomerate and the parent of companies including HomeAdvisor, Match.com, Citysearch, and Connected Ventures, home of Vimeo and CollegeHumor. In 2005, IAC/InterActiveCorp acquired Ask.com, marking a strategic move into the Internet search category. He stepped down as Chief Executive Officer of IAC/InterActiveCorp on December 2, 2010.[8]
The new headquarters for the IAC/InterActiveCorp, IAC Building was designed by Frank Gehry and opened in 2007 at 18th Street and the West Side Highway in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood. The western half of the block is dedicated to the building, which stands several stories taller than the massive Chelsea Piers Sporting complex just across the West Side Highway. The extra floors guarantee a panoramic Hudson River view from Diller's sixth-floor office.
Diller has been on the board of Coca-Cola since 2002.[9]
In 2003, on the PBS TV program NOW with Bill Moyers, Diller vocalized a strong warning against media consolidation. In the interview he referred to media ownership by a few big corporations as an oligarchy, saying the concentration strangles new ideas.[10]
Diller was "the highest-paid executive [of 2005 fiscal year]" according to a report by The New York Times on Thursday, October 26, 2006 with a total compensation package in excess of $295 million (mostly from stock).[11][12] In an opinion article in the New York Times of Nov 7, 2006, Nicholas D. Kristof awarded him his annual Michael Eisner Award[13], consisting of a $5 shower curtain, for corporate rapacity and laziness.[14]
"The Killer Dillers"[edit]
Diller is responsible for what the media dubs "The Killer Dillers" – people whom Diller mentored and who later became big-time media executives in their own right. Examples include Michael Eisner (who was President & COO of Paramount Pictures while Diller was Chairman & CEO of Paramount Pictures, who went on to become Chairman & CEO of The Walt Disney Company), Dawn Steel (future head of Columbia Pictures and one of the first women to run a major movie studio, who worked under Diller at Paramount), Jeffrey Katzenberg (head of DreamWorks Animation, principal of DreamWorks SKG, former head of Walt Disney Studios, and a head of production of Paramount under Diller), Garth Ancier, President of BBC America, and Don Simpson, who was President of Production at Paramount under Diller and Eisner and later went on to run a production company based on the Disney lot with Jerry Bruckheimer.[15]
Diller worked with Stephen Chao at Fox Television Network, whom he later hired as President of Programming and Marketing at USA Network. Julius Genachowski, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, served as Diller's General Counsel during their tenure at USA Broadcasting, and again as Chief of Business Operations and a member of Barry Diller's Office of the Chairman at IAC/InterActiveCorp.[citation needed]
Personal life[edit]




Diller with his wife Diane von Fürstenberg at the 2009 Metropolitan Opera premiere


In 2001, Diller married fashion designer Diane von Fürstenberg, mother of Alexander von Fürstenberg and Tatiana von Fürstenberg. He is a member of the Democratic Party and supporter of related political causes.[16] As of October 2015, Diller's estimated net worth was $2.6 billion.[17]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 2011, the Diller-von Furstenberg Family Foundation announced a donation of $20 million to support the completion of the High Line park project in Manhattan.[18]
In 2012, Diller donated $30 million to the Hollywood Fund, which provides health and social care to retired individuals from the show-business world.[19]
In 2015, Diller and his wife committed to donate US$113 million toward a floating public park and performance space on a pier in the Hudson River, New York. It is stated to be the largest donation to a public park in New York's history, with the project completion estimated around 2019. Together the couple formed the Diller-von Furstenberg Foundation.[20][21]

Early life[edit]
Diller was born into a Jewish household in San Francisco, California, and is the son of Reva (née Addison) and Michael Diller.[4][5]
Career[edit]
Diller began his career through a family connection[6] in the mailroom of the William Morris Agency after dropping out of UCLA after one semester. He was hired as an assistant by Elton Rule, then west coast head of ABC who was promoted to network President at the same time Diller went to work for him in 1964, taking him on to New York City, and Diller was soon placed in charge of negotiating broadcast rights to feature films. He was promoted to Vice President of Development in 1965. In this position, Diller created the ABC Movie of the Week, pioneering the concept of the made-for-television movie through a regular series of 90-minute films produced exclusively for television.[7]
Paramount[edit]
Diller served for ten years as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Paramount Pictures Corporation starting in 1974. With Diller at the helm, the studio produced hit television programs such as Laverne & Shirley (1976), Taxi (1978), and Cheers (1982) and films that include Saturday Night Fever (1977), Grease (1978), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) and sequel Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984), Terms of Endearment (1983), and Beverly Hills Cop (1984).
Fox[edit]
From October 1984 to April 1992, Diller held the positions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Fox, Inc, the parent company of Fox network and 20th Century Fox, where he greenlighted megahit shows such as Married...with Children and The Simpsons. Diller quit 20th Century Fox in 1992 and purchased a $25 million stake in QVC teleshopping network. Diller then launched a bid to purchase Paramount Communications, but lost it to Viacom. Diller resigned from QVC in 1995.
USA Broadcasting[edit]
In 1997, Diller acquired the assets of Silver King Broadcasting, the collective group of over-the-air TV stations owned by then Bud Paxson's Home Shopping Network as well as the Home Shopping Network itself. Along with this acquisition, Diller also purchased the rights to the USA Network from the Bronfman family. Due to Home Shopping getting more notoriety on the cable networks from his former dealings with the QVC Network, Diller sought to repurpose the broadcast stations into independent, locally-run stations as part of a station group dubbed USA Broadcasting of which the flagship station was WAMI-TV in Miami Beach, Florida.
The purpose of the network was to have the flagship, WAMI, produce sports and news programming while testing general interest programming for the other stations in the group, of which the general interest programming would be locally produced by the other stations in the group. Due to the high costs involved with producing and acquiring talent for shows outside the typical areas of New York City and Los Angeles, plus the significantly low ratings such shows received in Miami Beach, the remaining shows were moved to Los Angeles to regain traction, but never did. Diller eventually sold the TV assets to Univision after rejecting a bid from The Walt Disney Company. The USA Network and its assets were later sold off to Vivendi. Diller retained the assets of the Home Shopping Network and the subsequent Internet assets he acquired later to bolster the HSN Online stable that later became IAC/InterActiveCorp.[citation needed]
2000s[edit]




Barry Diller at the Web 2.0 Conference 2005


Diller was the Chairman of Expedia and the Chairman of IAC/InterActiveCorp, an interactive commerce conglomerate and the parent of companies including HomeAdvisor, Match.com, Citysearch, and Connected Ventures, home of Vimeo and CollegeHumor. In 2005, IAC/InterActiveCorp acquired Ask.com, marking a strategic move into the Internet search category. He stepped down as Chief Executive Officer of IAC/InterActiveCorp on December 2, 2010.[8]
The new headquarters for the IAC/InterActiveCorp, IAC Building was designed by Frank Gehry and opened in 2007 at 18th Street and the West Side Highway in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood. The western half of the block is dedicated to the building, which stands several stories taller than the massive Chelsea Piers Sporting complex just across the West Side Highway. The extra floors guarantee a panoramic Hudson River view from Diller's sixth-floor office.
Diller has been on the board of Coca-Cola since 2002.[9]
In 2003, on the PBS TV program NOW with Bill Moyers, Diller vocalized a strong warning against media consolidation. In the interview he referred to media ownership by a few big corporations as an oligarchy, saying the concentration strangles new ideas.[10]
Diller was "the highest-paid executive [of 2005 fiscal year]" according to a report by The New York Times on Thursday, October 26, 2006 with a total compensation package in excess of $295 million (mostly from stock).[11][12] In an opinion article in the New York Times of Nov 7, 2006, Nicholas D. Kristof awarded him his annual Michael Eisner Award[13], consisting of a $5 shower curtain, for corporate rapacity and laziness.[14]
"The Killer Dillers"[edit]
Diller is responsible for what the media dubs "The Killer Dillers" – people whom Diller mentored and who later became big-time media executives in their own right. Examples include Michael Eisner (who was President & COO of Paramount Pictures while Diller was Chairman & CEO of Paramount Pictures, who went on to become Chairman & CEO of The Walt Disney Company), Dawn Steel (future head of Columbia Pictures and one of the first women to run a major movie studio, who worked under Diller at Paramount), Jeffrey Katzenberg (head of DreamWorks Animation, principal of DreamWorks SKG, former head of Walt Disney Studios, and a head of production of Paramount under Diller), Garth Ancier, President of BBC America, and Don Simpson, who was President of Production at Paramount under Diller and Eisner and later went on to run a production company based on the Disney lot with Jerry Bruckheimer.[15]
Diller worked with Stephen Chao at Fox Television Network, whom he later hired as President of Programming and Marketing at USA Network. Julius Genachowski, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, served as Diller's General Counsel during their tenure at USA Broadcasting, and again as Chief of Business Operations and a member of Barry Diller's Office of the Chairman at IAC/InterActiveCorp.[citation needed]

Early life[edit]
Diller was born into a Jewish household in San Francisco, California, and is the son of Reva (née Addison) and Michael Diller.[4][5]
Career[edit]
Diller began his career through a family connection[6] in the mailroom of the William Morris Agency after dropping out of UCLA after one semester. He was hired as an assistant by Elton Rule, then west coast head of ABC who was promoted to network President at the same time Diller went to work for him in 1964, taking him on to New York City, and Diller was soon placed in charge of negotiating broadcast rights to feature films. He was promoted to Vice President of Development in 1965. In this position, Diller created the ABC Movie of the Week, pioneering the concept of the made-for-television movie through a regular series of 90-minute films produced exclusively for television.[7]
Paramount[edit]
Diller served for ten years as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Paramount Pictures Corporation starting in 1974. With Diller at the helm, the studio produced hit television programs such as Laverne & Shirley (1976), Taxi (1978), and Cheers (1982) and films that include Saturday Night Fever (1977), Grease (1978), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) and sequel Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984), Terms of Endearment (1983), and Beverly Hills Cop (1984).
Fox[edit]
From October 1984 to April 1992, Diller held the positions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Fox, Inc, the parent company of Fox network and 20th Century Fox, where he greenlighted megahit shows such as Married...with Children and The Simpsons. Diller quit 20th Century Fox in 1992 and purchased a $25 million stake in QVC teleshopping network. Diller then launched a bid to purchase Paramount Communications, but lost it to Viacom. Diller resigned from QVC in 1995.
USA Broadcasting[edit]
In 1997, Diller acquired the assets of Silver King Broadcasting, the collective group of over-the-air TV stations owned by then Bud Paxson's Home Shopping Network as well as the Home Shopping Network itself. Along with this acquisition, Diller also purchased the rights to the USA Network from the Bronfman family. Due to Home Shopping getting more notoriety on the cable networks from his former dealings with the QVC Network, Diller sought to repurpose the broadcast stations into independent, locally-run stations as part of a station group dubbed USA Broadcasting of which the flagship station was WAMI-TV in Miami Beach, Florida.
The purpose of the network was to have the flagship, WAMI, produce sports and news programming while testing general interest programming for the other stations in the group, of which the general interest programming would be locally produced by the other stations in the group. Due to the high costs involved with producing and acquiring talent for shows outside the typical areas of New York City and Los Angeles, plus the significantly low ratings such shows received in Miami Beach, the remaining shows were moved to Los Angeles to regain traction, but never did. Diller eventually sold the TV assets to Univision after rejecting a bid from The Walt Disney Company. The USA Network and its assets were later sold off to Vivendi. Diller retained the assets of the Home Shopping Network and the subsequent Internet assets he acquired later to bolster the HSN Online stable that later became IAC/InterActiveCorp.[citation needed]
2000s[edit]




Barry Diller at the Web 2.0 Conference 2005


Diller was the Chairman of Expedia and the Chairman of IAC/InterActiveCorp, an interactive commerce conglomerate and the parent of companies including HomeAdvisor, Match.com, Citysearch, and Connected Ventures, home of Vimeo and CollegeHumor. In 2005, IAC/InterActiveCorp acquired Ask.com, marking a strategic move into the Internet search category. He stepped down as Chief Executive Officer of IAC/InterActiveCorp on December 2, 2010.[8]
The new headquarters for the IAC/InterActiveCorp, IAC Building was designed by Frank Gehry and opened in 2007 at 18th Street and the West Side Highway in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood. The western half of the block is dedicated to the building, which stands several stories taller than the massive Chelsea Piers Sporting complex just across the West Side Highway. The extra floors guarantee a panoramic Hudson River view from Diller's sixth-floor office.
Diller has been on the board of Coca-Cola since 2002.[9]
In 2003, on the PBS TV program NOW with Bill Moyers, Diller vocalized a strong warning against media consolidation. In the interview he referred to media ownership by a few big corporations as an oligarchy, saying the concentration strangles new ideas.[10]
Diller was "the highest-paid executive [of 2005 fiscal year]" according to a report by The New York Times on Thursday, October 26, 2006 with a total compensation package in excess of $295 million (mostly from stock).[11][12] In an opinion article in the New York Times of Nov 7, 2006, Nicholas D. Kristof awarded him his annual Michael Eisner Award[13], consisting of a $5 shower curtain, for corporate rapacity and laziness.[14]
"The Killer Dillers"[edit]
Diller is responsible for what the media dubs "The Killer Dillers" – people whom Diller mentored and who later became big-time media executives in their own right. Examples include Michael Eisner (who was President & COO of Paramount Pictures while Diller was Chairman & CEO of Paramount Pictures, who went on to become Chairman & CEO of The Walt Disney Company), Dawn Steel (future head of Columbia Pictures and one of the first women to run a major movie studio, who worked under Diller at Paramount), Jeffrey Katzenberg (head of DreamWorks Animation, principal of DreamWorks SKG, former head of Walt Disney Studios, and a head of production of Paramount under Diller), Garth Ancier, President of BBC America, and Don Simpson, who was President of Production at Paramount under Diller and Eisner and later went on to run a production company based on the Disney lot with Jerry Bruckheimer.[15]
Diller worked with Stephen Chao at Fox Television Network, whom he later hired as President of Programming and Marketing at USA Network. Julius Genachowski, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, served as Diller's General Counsel during their tenure at USA Broadcasting, and again as Chief of Business Operations and a member of Barry Diller's Office of the Chairman at IAC/InterActiveCorp.[citation needed]
Personal life[edit]




Diller with his wife Diane von Fürstenberg at the 2009 Metropolitan Opera premiere


In 2001, Diller married fashion designer Diane von Fürstenberg, mother of Alexander von Fürstenberg and Tatiana von Fürstenberg. He is a member of the Democratic Party and supporter of related political causes.[16] As of October 2015, Diller's estimated net worth was $2.6 billion.[17]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 2011, the Diller-von Furstenberg Family Foundation announced a donation of $20 million to support the completion of the High Line park project in Manhattan.[18]
In 2012, Diller donated $30 million to the Hollywood Fund, which provides health and social care to retired individuals from the show-business world.[19]
In 2015, Diller and his wife committed to donate US$113 million toward a floating public park and performance space on a pier in the Hudson River, New York. It is stated to be the largest donation to a public park in New York's history, with the project completion estimated around 2019. Together the couple formed the Diller-von Furstenberg Foundation.[20][21]
