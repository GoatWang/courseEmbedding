This afternoon, the MIT Corporation — the Institute’s board of trustees — elected Robert B. Millard ’73 to serve as chair of the Corporation, effective this October.
Millard succeeds John Reed ’61, SM ’65, who has served as chair since June 2010. After the transition in chairmanship in October, Reed will serve as Life Member Emeritus of the Corporation.
“I am truly honored to have been elected to this position by my Corporation colleagues,” Millard says. “MIT formed me when I was a student here, and my Corporation work in more recent years has given me a profound sense of appreciation for how energetically MIT continues to pursue its mission. I look forward to working with President Reif and the Institute’s senior leadership.”
“Bob Millard has been an active member of the MIT Corporation for many years,” Reif says, “and I am delighted that he has agreed to serve as its chair. Humble, a critical thinker, a problem solver, and a doer, Bob has a way of constructively asking insightful questions and of getting people to focus on the most important long-term strategic issues. I very much look forward to working closely with him.”
Reif praised Reed for the leadership he provided during his tenure as chair, saying: “John’s remarkable professional experience, deep and enduring connection to MIT, and extraordinary rigor and discipline proved to be of immeasurable value. John led a smooth transition from President Hockfield’s presidency to mine, and he played a central role in preparing the Institute for the next capital campaign. To these and other critical pieces of MIT business, John brought imagination, focus, and a steady hand. MIT was strengthened greatly by John’s chairmanship, and I look forward to his continued help.”
The chair of the MIT Corporation presides over all Corporation meetings and chairs the Executive Committee, the Corporation Development Committee, and the Membership Committee; the chair is also a member of the Investment Management Company Board.
Millard joined the MIT Corporation as a Term Member in 2003 and was elected a Life Member in 2013. He has served on the Executive Committee for 10 years and on the Investment Company Management Board for seven years, including serving as its chair for the last four years. He is a member of the Visiting Committees for Physics (2000 to present, including eight years as chair), Architecture (2004 to present), and Chemistry (2013 to present).
In addition, Millard has served as a member of the Linguistics and Philosophy Visiting Committee, the Corporation Development Committee, and the Advisory Council for the Council for the Arts. He was director of the MIT Club of New York from 1987 to 1993.
In 2011, Millard received the Bronze Beaver Award, the MIT Alumni Association’s highest honor for distinguished service. 
Millard joined Kuhn Loeb & Co. in 1976, and became a managing director of Lehman Brothers Inc. in 1983. He built and led the risk arbitrage/proprietary investing business.
He is currently the chairman of Realm Partners LLC, a private investment partnership. He is also chairman and president of Churchill Allagash Holdings LLC, a timber company in Maine.
Millard co-founded and served as the chairman of L-3 Communications Holdings, a Fortune 200 firm that supplies electronics and communications products to the defense and intelligence industries, and he remains lead independent director and chairman of the executive committee for the company. He serves on the board of Evercore Partners, an independent investment-banking advisory firm, and has previously served on a number of other public and private company boards. 
He has previously served on numerous nonprofit boards, including that of the New School (executive committee); the Population Council (executive committee); the Remarque Institute; Associated Universities Inc. (a scientific board with historical ties to MIT); the Corcoran Gallery of Art; the Mannes College of Music (chairman of the board); and the Manhattan Theater Club. Millard is a current member of the Council on Foreign Relations and serves on its finance and budget committee.
Born in New York, Millard holds an SB in architecture from MIT and an MBA from Harvard University. He and his wife, Bethany, reside in New York. They have four children.
Other elections
During today’s meeting, the Corporation elected 11 term members, with terms of five or two years. Corporation Chairman John Reed announced the election results; all appointments are effective July 1.
Nine term members were elected to serve for five years: Alan M. Dachs; Rafael del Pino SM ’86; Mark R. Epstein ’63, SM ’64; Ilene S. Gordon ’75, SM ’76 (an Alumni Association nominee); John W. Jarve ’78 (an Alumni Association nominee); Alan M. Leventhal; Samantha F. O’Keefe ’09, SM ’12 (the recent-classes nominee); Theresa M. Stone SM ’76; and Ronald A. Williams SM ’84 (an Alumni Association nominee).
Two members were elected to serve for two years: Eran Broshy ’79 and Victor J. Menezes SM ’72.
This year, two new Life Members were elected: Mohammed A.L. Jameel ’78 and Barry Lam.
It was also announced at the meeting that Donald E. Shobrys ’75 is the 2014-15 president of the Association of Alumni and Alumnae of MIT and ex officio member of the Corporation and of the Corporation Joint Advisory Committee on Institute-Wide Affairs.
Both Term Members and Life Members — who serve without a specific term until they reach age 75 — have voting rights in the Corporation. At age 75, Life Members become Life Members Emeritus; while they no longer have a vote, they continue to play an active role in Institute affairs.
As of July 1, the Corporation will consist of 78 distinguished leaders in education, science, engineering, and industry; of those, 25 are Life Members and 8 are ex officio. An additional 33 individuals are Life Members Emeritus.
The elected Term Members are:
Eran Broshy ’79 

Executive Advisor, Court Square Capital Partners
Broshy earned his SB in civil engineering from MIT in December 1978. He subsequently completed his MS in civil engineering at Stanford University in 1979 and his MBA at Harvard University in 1984. After a few early years as a civil engineer and project manager, Broshy has spent the last 30 years as a strategically focused health care executive, building leading high-growth public and private healthcare businesses as CEO, board chairman and director, strategist, and investor. For the last four years, Broshy has partnered with select private-equity firms to invest broadly in health care. Previously, Broshy served for more than a decade as CEO and chairman of inVentiv Health, where he transformed the company into the leading global provider of outsourced clinical, communications, commercial, and patient outcomes services to the biopharmaceutical industry. Previously, Broshy spent 14 years, from 1984 to 1998, at the Boston Consulting Group, including six years as the managing partner responsible for the firm’s health care practice across the Americas. Broshy serves on the Brain and Cognitive Sciences and Health Sciences and Technology Visiting Committees and on the Dean of Science Advisory Council. He previously served on the Social Sciences Visiting Committee.
Alan M. Dachs 

President and CEO, Fremont Group LLC
Dachs received a BA in liberal arts from Wesleyan University in 1970, an MBA from New York University in 1974, and an honorary doctorate of humane letters from Wesleyan in 2007. Dachs is president and CEO, and a director, of Fremont Group LLC, a San Francisco-based investment firm specializing in direct investments, real estate, venture capital, and publicly traded securities. Prior to his current post, Dachs held positions in the banking and construction industries. After graduating from Wesleyan, he joined Chemical Bank and New York Trust Company, where he was a credit officer serving the contractual lending requirements of Fortune 500 customers. In 1974 Dachs joined the Refinery and Chemical Division of the worldwide engineering and construction firm Bechtel.
