INVESTMENT OUR FINANCING PARTNERS INVESTMENT TEAM










We make healthcare progress possible by connecting capital to opportunity.

Companies in the healthcare field face a myriad of financing challenges. What is the optimal funding strategy for an acquisition? How can the development and launch of new products or services be paid for more creatively? What approaches can be taken to improve balance sheet flexibility or limit equity dilution? Too often the options are formulaic and inflexible.


At Deerfield, our comprehensive understanding of healthcare assets allows us to appreciate opportunity even when complex financial, legislative, regulatory and competitive pressures are present. Collaboration, intellectual curiosity and pragmatism define our approach. We craft flexible, tailored and often unexpected financing options, exploring every angle so that companies can execute their business strategy to the fullest.
