About Us
Advanced BioEnergy, LLC was  formed in 2005 as a Delaware limited liability company. Our business consists  of producing ethanol and co-products, including wet, modified and dried  distillers’ grains, as well as corn oil. The Company currently operates three  ethanol production facilities in the U.S. with a combined production  capacity of 85 million gallons per year. The Company acquired existing  facilities in Aberdeen, South Dakota (9 million gallons) and Huron, South  Dakota (32 million gallons) in November 2006 and began operations at the 44  million gallon Aberdeen expansion facility in January 2008.
 Ethanol is a renewable, environmentally  clean fuel source that is produced at numerous facilities in the United States,  mostly in the Midwest. In the U.S., ethanol is produced primarily from corn and  then blended with unleaded gasoline in varying percentages. The ethanol  industry in the U.S. has grown significantly as the use of ethanol reduces  harmful auto emissions, enhances octane ratings of the gasoline with which it  is blended, offers consumers a cost-effective choice, and decreases the amount  of crude oil in the U.S. needs to import from foreign sources.

Advanced BioEnergy, LLC - Ethanol - How is Ethanol Produced?

How is Ethanol Produced?
Ethanol Production Process - Dry Milling
 In
      dry milling, the entire corn kernel is first processed into flour, which is referred to in the industry as "meal." This meal is then slurried with water to form a "mash." Enzymes are added to the mash to convert the starch to dextrose, a simple sugar. Ammonia is added for pH control and as a nutrient to the yeast. 
 The mash is processed in
      a high-temperature cooker at approximately 105 degrees Celsius to 
      reduce bacteria levels ahead of fermentation. The mash is cooled to 
      around 35 degrees Celsius and transferred to fermenters where yeast is 
      added and the transformation of sugar to ethanol and carbon dioxide 
      (CO2) begins. 
 The fermentation process takes approximately 40 
      to 60 hours. At this point of the process, the mash is agitated and
      kept cool to facilitate the activity of the yeast. After fermentation 
      is completed, the resulting "beer" is transferred to distillation 
      columns where the ethanol is separated from the remaining "stillage." 
      The ethanol is concentrated to 190 proof using conventional distillation
      and then is further dehydrated to approximately 200 proof. Often this 
      is done in a molecular sieve system. 
 The anhydrous (pure) 
      ethanol is then blended with about 2-5% denaturant (such as natural 
      gasoline) to render it undrinkable so that it is not subject to beverage
      alcohol tax. The finished product can then be shipped to gasoline 
      terminals or retailers.


Co-Products: DDGS, Corn Oil & CO2
      The stillage is sent through a centrifuge that separates the 
      coarse grain from the solubles. The solubles are then concentrated to 
      about 30% solids by evaporation, resulting in Condensed Distillers 
      Solubles (CDS) or "syrup." Syrup is sent through a centrifuge to remove 
      corn oil. Corn oil is used for livestock feed or biodiesel 
      production. The coarse grain and the remaining syrup are then 
      dried together to produce dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS), a
      high quality livestock feed. The CO2 released during fermentation can 
      be captured and sold for use in carbonating soft drinks and beverages 
      and the manufacture of dry ice. 

      For more information the ethanol production process, please visit the Renewable Fuels Association website at www.ethanolrfa.org or the American Coalition for Ethanol website at www.ethanol.org. 

What are the benefits of using ethanol?    

Improved Air Quality: Ethanol increases the oxygen 
        content of fuel, leading to more complete combustion, reduced tailpipe 
        emissions and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.


Cleaner Power: Ethanol increases the octane rating of fuel-providing enhanced performance while reducing the level of toxins in gasoline.


Reduced Reliance on Imported Oil: Ethanol is made from renewable sources produced in the U.S., thus extending our nation’s fuel supply.


Environmentally Friendly: In addition to its clean air benefits, ethanol does not pollute groundwater.
