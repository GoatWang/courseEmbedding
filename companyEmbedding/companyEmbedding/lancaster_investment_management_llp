Our approach

Leaders of small and mid-sized businesses have multiple roles and competing priorities. You want a best-in-class retirement plan but may be unsure about all the complexities and requirements. You may be uncertain about the costs and fees involved. You need a provider focused solely on retirement and aligned with your needs and goals—and fully committed to you, your participants, and the ongoing improvement of retirement investing.

Vanguard is committed to the retirement business and is a leader in the retirement plan industry. Best of all, you can benefit from Vanguard's unique ownership structure: We're owned by our clients and not by outside investors or stockholders. That means you never need to question whose interests come first for us. This approach serves as a foundation for all that we do with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access™, our 401(k) offer for small and mid-sized plans. You can count on our expertise to remove the uncertainties from managing your plan and our leadership to help you offer a strong plan for your participants. 



Key benefits




You can:

Have confidence in your plan.
Understand your costs.
Focus on your business.





Cost-conscious?
As a business owner and plan fiduciary, you want to eliminate ambiguity in retirement plan costs. Research has shown that plan costs for the smaller end of the market tend to be higher, and you need a retirement plan provider that not only provides transparent pricing but has a fair and reasonable cost structure.1
With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access:

You receive an All-in Fee Report that shows the total cost of your plan.
You have access to low-cost Vanguard index funds, plus the opportunity to choose from among more than 12,000 non-Vanguard funds.
Your annual recordkeeping price is based on a per-participant fee—a fee that doesn't jump as your assets grow, as with many small to mid-sized retirement plans.
You have flexibility in how you cover your plan costs—including a recordkeeping credit depending on the share class selected.




Too busy?
 As a business owner, you're pressed for time and focused on many aspects of business. With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, you can rely on high-quality recordkeeping and administration to ease your administrative burden and help your employees stay on track for retirement.

Advisory services

Your input was invalid






























Enduring. Holistic.Defendable. Vanguard Target Retirement Funds










 



Not all target-date funds are created equal.™ 






Our infographic can help you evaluate your target-date fund (TDF) strategy. It includes three steps that focus on TDF costs, stability, and investor focus.                                 Learn more.






















Target-date strategies
Selecting a target-date fund (TDF) series for your qualified default investment alternative can be a critical step in designing a defined contribution (DC) retirement plan that can stand up to the scrutiny from many quarters, including regulators.

Vanguard Target Retirement Funds offer a sophisticated design and a clear, straightforward glide path that's a natural fit for autoenrollment and default investment programs—a TDF strategy that can help lower your fiduciary risk and help improve the odds of your plan participants achieving their retirement goals.



Fiduciaries value not only the sophisticated methodology behind the Vanguard Target Retirement portfolio, but also the clarity of the glide path, index implementation, and high degree of transparency.
John Croke
Target Retirement Fund Product Manager










Enduring investment solution
With Vanguard, you'll have a target-date retirement solution that is implemented with a well-diversified set of market-cap-weighted index funds. The embedded diversification of this approach provides balance against the markets‘ natural ups and downs.





Reaching goals through a holistic approach
Vanguard's target-date funds are designed by investment, plan design, and participant behavior experts. This integrated approach puts participants at the heart of your target-date offering so you can have confidence that your target-date offering can help your participants reach their retirement goals.





Defendable performance year after year
The combination of consistent, prudent product oversight and our history of reducing costs help you deliver defensible performance to investment committees and plan participants year after year.


Sophisticated portfolio construction
The Target Retirement Funds are designed by Vanguard's respected investment managers and asset allocation experts and are grounded in ongoing, cross-disciplinary research. The glide path reflects a long-term, holistic view of retirement investing.



MORE ABOUT TARGET-DATE STRATEGIES
Research & commentary

* Vanguard Target Retirement Funds offer the simplicity of an index-oriented, well-diversified portfolio that is strategic and straightforward in its approach. The funds are composed of five underlying index funds and follow an easy-to-understand asset allocation glide path. Underlying this simplicity is Vanguard's deep investment expertise, knowledge of the capital markets, and insights into participant behavior.
Investments in Target Retirement Funds are subject to the risks of their underlying funds. The year in the fund name refers to the approximate year (the target date) when an investor in the fund would retire and leave the workforce. The fund will gradually shift its emphasis from more aggressive investments (stocks) to more conservative ones (bonds and short-term reserves) based on its
                   target date. An investment in a Target Retirement Fund is not guaranteed at any time, including on or after the target date.
              
All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest.
Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.
There is no guarantee that any particular asset allocation or mix of funds will meet your investment objectives or provide you with a given level of income.

Checklist: 9 Questions Every Advisor Should Be Able to Answer 




Whatever your priorities, this can help you find someone who understands you and has the resources to help you manage your financial life 











AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER, WE ALL face major turning points in our lives—getting married, becoming a parent, receiving a life-changing promotion, getting ready to retire. At times like these, many people feel a need for financial help, and start to wonder whether working with a financial advisor might make sense. That's when the search begins.
The challenge is finding someone you'll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family, your money, your hopes for your future. Someone who'll be there for you for years to come, and who can provide more than just stock recommendations.
To find an advisor who can help you with those decisions, don't be afraid to ask the following tough questions—they'll help you get a clear idea of what you can expect from the relationship and whether it makes sense for you.
1. What types of clients do you work with?
Some advisors have special experience working with business owners or members of a specific profession. Others might have particular knowledge in a specialty, such as sustainable investing or retirement planning. Ask what team members or resources from around their company they can call upon to help you meet your specific needs.
The challenge is finding someone you'll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family, your money, your hopes for your future.
2. What is your track record?
No advisor can or should promise financial results based on past performance. And beware those who do. But an advisor with a record of long relationships with clients likely provides the kind of service that earns their loyalty.
3. How often will we talk?
An advisor should be committed to conversations in person, by phone, or online—whatever your preference is—as often as you require. Every client has different needs and expectations. Be upfront with the advisor about how frequently and by what means you would like to get together to discuss your finances.
4. How realistic are my goals?
Even if you have a strong idea of what you want to accomplish with your money, the right advisor can help you better understand and prioritize your goals, including making any necessary tradeoffs based on your finances, timelines and investing preferences.

5. How will we keep my strategy on course?
Even the best strategy will need adjusting as financial markets and your goals change. An advisor should have a plan for regular reviews and the ability to correct as market conditions and your priorities shift.
6. What happens if the markets are volatile? Will you call me?
When markets get scary, there's nothing worse than feeling isolated and alone. One of an advisor's most vital functions is to reach out at such times, hear your concerns, offer perspective, and talk about any needed adjustments to your strategy.
7. What if I'm upset about a service issue or an investment?
As life becomes increasingly automated, there's nothing like a human voice and quick response when you're concerned about a financial matter. Advisors who define their success by your success will be eager to quickly resolve any such issues.
8. Who will I actually be working with?
Many advisors have teams of professionals to enhance the services they provide. Ask who you'd be working with on a regular basis and their level of experience. Beyond the immediate team, does the company supporting them have access to a broad array of financial insights and resources?
9. How do I pay you for your work?
It's never easy to ask, but the right advisors will welcome this question. Clarity about fees is vital to a successful relationship. Payment—whether a percentage of assets or per transaction—should be structured around your needs and preferences.

Welcome

Lancaster Investment Management is an investment group based in
London and founded in 2007. Lancaster began trading in January 2008
and runs a European Fundamental Equity strategy, managed by Matthew
Wood.
We are a small team of experienced individuals and strive to
create a culture where challenge and debate are expected and
encouraged.
We aim to generate investment returns that are uncorrelated with
equity markets through the investment cycle, thereby allowing us to
compound returns for our investors over long periods of time.

Investment Approach

Lancaster manages European Fundamental Equity strategies with a
large cap bias.
Valuation alone is not a sufficient pre-cursor to investment;
each investment must have a clear investment thesis that is
differentiated from the market view.
Stock selection is deeply fundamental with key attention paid to
the supply side dynamics within an industry, and the track record
of cash generation and capital deployment within a business.
Portfolio construction and risk management are critical to the
investment process and are designed to provide duration to allow
individual stock returns to drive fund performance.

Philosophy

Understanding and being deliberate about the risks we are taking
both at an individual stock level and at the aggregate portfolio
level lies at the core of our investment philosophy.
We invest in companies. Understanding a business, its
management, and the environment in which they operate, is
fundamental to our process.
As stewards of our investors' capital we believe it is important
to form open and close relationships with our investors; having a
limited number of clients is central to achieving this goal.

("Lancaster") and the information on this Website is issued by
Lancaster both inside and outside the United Kingdom. Lancaster is
registered in England and Wales as a limited liability partnership
with registered number OC330805 and has its registered office at
4th Floor, 60 Charlotte Street,  London,  W1T 2NU.
Lancaster is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct
Authority (the "FCA") and is registered as an investment adviser

Investment Information
The distribution of the information contained in this Website in
certain countries may be restricted by law and persons who access
it are required to inform themselves and to comply with any such
restrictions.
This information does not constitute an offer or solicitation in
any jurisdiction in which such an offer or solicitation is not
authorised or to any person to whom it is unlawful to make such an
offer or solicitation. Prospective investors should inform
themselves as to applicable legal requirements, exchange control
regulations and taxes in the countries of their citizenship,
residence or domicile.
 
Risk Factors
Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results.
The value of investments and the income therefrom may go down as
well as up and investors may not get back the original amount
invested. You are not guaranteed to make money from your
investments and you may lose money. Exchange rates may cause the
value of overseas investments and the income therefore to rise and
fall.
This Website is published solely for informational purposes and
has no regard to the specific investment objectives, financial
situation or particular needs of any person. Information contained
herein is believed to be reliable but no warranty is given as to
its accuracy or completeness and views and opinions, whilst given
in good faith, are subject to change without notice. Opinions
expressed are our present opinions only, reflecting prevailing
market conditions and certain assumptions (which may not prove to
be valid), and are subject to change.
The information contained in this Website is not intended to
constitute, and should not be construed as, investment advice.
Potential investors in the funds that are described, or referred
to, in this Website should seek their own independent financial
advice. Lancaster neither provides investment advice to, nor
receives and transmits orders from, investors in the funds
described, or referred to, in this Website nor does it carry on any
other activities with or for such investors that constitute "MiFID
or equivalent third country business" for the purposes of the
Handbook of Rules and Guidance issued from time to time by the FCA
(the "FCA Rules").
If you choose to invest in any fund described or referred to in
this Website, your capital will be at risk and you may therefore
lose some or all of any amount that you choose to invest.
 
Sales Restrictions
The information contained in this Website relates to investment
funds which are not recognised collective investment schemes for
the purposes of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. The
promotion of these funds, the distribution of offering materials
and access to this Website is accordingly restricted by law.
The information provided on this Website is not intended for
distribution to, or use by, any person or entity in any
jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be
contrary to law or regulation or which would subject Lancaster or
its affiliates to any registration requirement within such
jurisdiction or country.
This information on this Website is issued inside and outside
the United Kingdom by Lancaster Investment Management LLP (which is
authorised and regulated by the FCA and is registered as an
investment adviser with the SEC) and is directed only at persons
who are professional clients or eligible counterparties for the
purposes of the FCA Rules. The investments and investment services
to which this Website relates are only available to such persons
and other persons should not act or rely on any of the information
on this Website. In particular, any investment or investment
service to which this Website relates is not intended for persons
who are retail clients and will not be made available to retail
clients.
By accessing this Website beyond this point you confirm your
status as a professional client or eligible counterparty (as
defined in the FCA Rules) and you warrant as such.
This Website and the information contained in it constitutes a
financial promotion for the purposes of the Act and the FCA
Rules.
An application for shares in any of the investment funds
referred to on this Website should only be made having read fully
the relevant Prospectus or Offering Memorandum. It is your
responsibility to read such Prospectus or Offering Memorandum and
by making an application you will be deemed to represent that you

bound by its contents.

existing and prospective investors in investment funds managed by
Lancaster who, among other requirements, are qualified as
accredited investors, within the meaning of Regulation D under the
US Securities Act of 1933, as amended or who generally are

Our approach

Leaders of small and mid-sized businesses have multiple roles and competing priorities. You want a best-in-class retirement plan but may be unsure about all the complexities and requirements. You may be uncertain about the costs and fees involved. You need a provider focused solely on retirement and aligned with your needs and goals—and fully committed to you, your participants, and the ongoing improvement of retirement investing.

Vanguard is committed to the retirement business and is a leader in the retirement plan industry. Best of all, you can benefit from Vanguard's unique ownership structure: We're owned by our clients and not by outside investors or stockholders. That means you never need to question whose interests come first for us. This approach serves as a foundation for all that we do with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access™, our 401(k) offer for small and mid-sized plans. You can count on our expertise to remove the uncertainties from managing your plan and our leadership to help you offer a strong plan for your participants. 



Key benefits




You can:

Have confidence in your plan.
Understand your costs.
Focus on your business.





Cost-conscious?
As a business owner and plan fiduciary, you want to eliminate ambiguity in retirement plan costs. Research has shown that plan costs for the smaller end of the market tend to be higher, and you need a retirement plan provider that not only provides transparent pricing but has a fair and reasonable cost structure.1
With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access:

You receive an All-in Fee Report that shows the total cost of your plan.
You have access to low-cost Vanguard index funds, plus the opportunity to choose from among more than 12,000 non-Vanguard funds.
Your annual recordkeeping price is based on a per-participant fee—a fee that doesn't jump as your assets grow, as with many small to mid-sized retirement plans.
You have flexibility in how you cover your plan costs—including a recordkeeping credit depending on the share class selected.




Too busy?
 As a business owner, you're pressed for time and focused on many aspects of business. With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, you can rely on high-quality recordkeeping and administration to ease your administrative burden and help your employees stay on track for retirement.

Advisory services
Many organizations like yours find it challenging to oversee their portfolio while also managing the day-to-day responsibilities of running their endowment, foundation, or charitable organization. But partnering with a provider who understands your needs can help you better balance these competing priorities.
Partnering with your organization
Vanguard Institutional Advisory Services® (VIAS) offers nonprofits the considerable resources of a large investment firm like Vanguard with the customized service of a specialized boutique. When your organization partners with VIAS, you work with a team of investment professionals that has your objectives and fiduciary responsibilities in mind. VIAS strives to:

Understand your organization's mission, spending needs, and unique situation and offer sophisticated, unbiased advice.
Develop a low-cost portfolio customized to your organization's needs.
Relieve your staff of many of the day-to-day burdens of investment program management.

OCIO: One service, many names


One approach nonprofits are increasingly considering is an outsourced chief investment officer (OCIO). An OCIO service—which is a key offering of Vanguard Institutional Advisory Services—acts as an extension of the board and investment staff. The OCIO determines an asset allocation strategy, selects investment advisors to implement it, and manages its operation and execution. Investment providers and clients call this service a variety of names, including discretionary management, advisory services, and investment management.





Investing and advising
Optimizing your portfolio to meet your long-term investment objectives requires time and skill. VIAS helps you develop a tailored portfolio that ensures your investments are diversified, risk-appropriate, and aligned with your overall strategy.
Our comprehensive advisory services include:









Portfolio construction 

Asset allocation analysis that uses a distinct, proprietary model to deliver solutions based on your portfolio needs.
Investment policy consulting designed to meet the unique investment goals of your organization.
Customized product selection that focuses on low-cost index and active investments.











Portfolio management

Performance reporting to help keep your investment committee informed.
Investment reviews that provide insights into your portfolio and the broader market and economic environment.
Steadfast commitment to risk management and process excellence through ongoing portfolio monitoring and rebalancing.








Research & expertise

Investment expertise and commentary on financial issues that provide context for your decision-making.
Investment committee best practices that are designed to increase your group's effectiveness.





Notes:

Advice services offered through Vanguard Institutional Advisory Services are provided by Vanguard Advisers, Inc., a registered investment advisor.
All investments are subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. 
Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market.

Checklist: 9 Questions Every Advisor Should Be Able to Answer 




Whatever your priorities, this can help you find someone who understands you and has the resources to help you manage your financial life 











AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER, WE ALL face major turning points in our lives—getting married, becoming a parent, receiving a life-changing promotion, getting ready to retire. At times like these, many people feel a need for financial help, and start to wonder whether working with a financial advisor might make sense. That's when the search begins.
The challenge is finding someone you'll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family, your money, your hopes for your future. Someone who'll be there for you for years to come, and who can provide more than just stock recommendations.
To find an advisor who can help you with those decisions, don't be afraid to ask the following tough questions—they'll help you get a clear idea of what you can expect from the relationship and whether it makes sense for you.
1. What types of clients do you work with?
Some advisors have special experience working with business owners or members of a specific profession. Others might have particular knowledge in a specialty, such as sustainable investing or retirement planning. Ask what team members or resources from around their company they can call upon to help you meet your specific needs.
The challenge is finding someone you'll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family, your money, your hopes for your future.
2. What is your track record?
No advisor can or should promise financial results based on past performance. And beware those who do. But an advisor with a record of long relationships with clients likely provides the kind of service that earns their loyalty.
3. How often will we talk?
An advisor should be committed to conversations in person, by phone, or online—whatever your preference is—as often as you require. Every client has different needs and expectations. Be upfront with the advisor about how frequently and by what means you would like to get together to discuss your finances.
4. How realistic are my goals?
Even if you have a strong idea of what you want to accomplish with your money, the right advisor can help you better understand and prioritize your goals, including making any necessary tradeoffs based on your finances, timelines and investing preferences.

5. How will we keep my strategy on course?
Even the best strategy will need adjusting as financial markets and your goals change. An advisor should have a plan for regular reviews and the ability to correct as market conditions and your priorities shift.
6. What happens if the markets are volatile? Will you call me?
When markets get scary, there's nothing worse than feeling isolated and alone. One of an advisor's most vital functions is to reach out at such times, hear your concerns, offer perspective, and talk about any needed adjustments to your strategy.
7. What if I'm upset about a service issue or an investment?
As life becomes increasingly automated, there's nothing like a human voice and quick response when you're concerned about a financial matter. Advisors who define their success by your success will be eager to quickly resolve any such issues.
8. Who will I actually be working with?
Many advisors have teams of professionals to enhance the services they provide. Ask who you'd be working with on a regular basis and their level of experience. Beyond the immediate team, does the company supporting them have access to a broad array of financial insights and resources?
9. How do I pay you for your work?
It's never easy to ask, but the right advisors will welcome this question. Clarity about fees is vital to a successful relationship. Payment—whether a percentage of assets or per transaction—should be structured around your needs and preferences.
