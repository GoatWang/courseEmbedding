American Beacon Advisors Expands Alternatives Product Line with American Beacon Ionic Strategic Arbitrage Fund

Fund Seeks Long-Term Capital Appreciation with Low Volatility and Reduced Correlation to Primary Market Factors








This Fund provides investors with an opportunity to mitigate downside risk though Ionic’s arbitrage investment strategies.


Irving, Texas (PRWEB)
July 20, 2015
 American Beacon Advisors, Inc. (“American Beacon”), an experienced provider of investment advisory services to institutional and retail markets, launched the American Beacon Ionic Strategic Arbitrage Fund (Institutional Class: IONIX, A Class: IONAX) today. The Fund became effective June 30. 
The American Beacon Ionic Strategic Arbitrage Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by implementing a strategic arbitrage strategy comprised of: convertible arbitrage, credit/rates relative value arbitrage, equity arbitrage and volatility arbitrage. By employing a “market-neutral” strategy, the Fund’s returns are not intended to be closely correlated to the stock market as a whole, interest rates, or a particular market index. 
Arbitrage is an active trading strategy that seeks to identify price inefficiencies between related instruments. It involves the simultaneous purchase and sale of related assets with the objective of isolating and/or capturing mispricing between the two instruments. 
“We continue to take a calculated approach to expanding our product line and apply the proper due diligence in selecting sub-advisors, particularly in the liquid alts space,” Gene L. Needles, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer of American Beacon said. “This Fund provides investors with an opportunity to mitigate downside risk though Ionic’s arbitrage investment strategies.”
The Fund’s sub-advisor is Ionic Capital Management ® LLC (“Ionic”). Founded in 2006, Ionic is based in New York with an office in San Francisco. The $2.7 billion alternative asset management firm focuses on relative-value arbitrage and event-driven investment strategies. Within the relative-value arbitrage strategies, Ionic strives to generate negatively correlated returns and outperformance in uncertain markets utilizing a variety of asset classes. Within the event-driven strategy, Ionic focuses on both announced and anticipated hard-catalyst opportunities, seeking to drive returns from unique, company-specific events.  
“After thoughtfully constructing a relative value portfolio across a broad range of asset classes, we are thrilled to partner with American Beacon to expand our footprint in the liquid alternatives space,” Bart Baum, Principal and Chief Investment Officer of Ionic Capital said. 
About American Beacon Advisors
Established in 1986, American Beacon is an experienced provider of investment advisory services to institutional and retail markets. American Beacon Advisors serves defined benefit plans, defined contribution plans, foundations, endowments, corporations and other institutional investors, as well as retail clients. The firm also provides corporate cash management and fixed-income separate account management.
American Beacon manages the American Beacon Funds, a series of competitively priced mutual funds. The Funds employ a “manager of managers” investment style and currently include international and domestic equity, fixed-income and money market funds. As of March 31, 2015, American Beacon Advisors had $62.9 billion in assets under management. For more information, go to http://www.americanbeaconfunds.com or follow on Twitter via @AmBeacon.
You should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fund carefully before investing. The prospectus and summary prospectus contain this and additional information regarding the Fund. To obtain a prospectus or summary prospectus, please contact your financial advisor, call (800) 967-9009 or visit americanbeaconfunds.com. The prospectus and summary prospectus should be read carefully before investing.
All investing involves risk including the possible loss of principal. The Fund’s strategy of investing in a variety of arbitrage strategies entails certain risks including that the sub-advisor’s judgments about allocation between such strategies, as well as individual arbitrage opportunities, may not perform to expectations, resulting in the Fund’s underperformance or even losses versus other similar funds. Arbitrage is the simultaneous purchase and sale of an asset or assets to take advantage of a perceived pricing anomaly. Because the Fund may invest in fewer issuers than a more diversified portfolio, the fluctuating value of a single holding may have a greater effect on the value of the Fund. The Fund may have high portfolio turnover, which could increase the Fund’s transaction costs and possibly have a negative impact on performance. Small- or mid-capitalization stocks may involve greater volatility and lower liquidity than larger company stocks. The use of fixed-income securities, including convertible securities, entails interest rate and credit risks. In addition, the value of a convertible security could fluctuate based on the value of the underlying stock.  Investing in foreign securities may involve heightened risk due to currency fluctuations and economic and political risks. Investing in derivative instruments involves liquidity, credit, interest rate and market risks. Short sales involve special risks, including greater reliance on the sub-advisor’s ability to accurately anticipate the future value of a security or instrument; the Fund’s losses are potentially unlimited in a short sale.
Please see the prospectus for a complete discussion of the Fund’s risks. There can be no assurances that the investment objectives of this Fund will be met.

American Beacon Ionic Strategic Arbitrage

Portfolio information as of March 31, 2017




Summary
Performance
Overview


 





Investment Objective
The  Fund’s investment objective is to seek capital appreciation with low volatility  and reduced correlation to equities and interest rates.
 


commitment to risk management
Ionic Capital Management LLC (“Ionic”) is based in New York with an office in San Francisco. The  alternative asset management firm focuses on relative-value arbitrage and  event-driven investment strategies. Within the relative-value arbitrage  strategies, Ionic strives to generate negatively correlated returns and  outperformance in uncertain markets using a variety of asset classes.  
                Firm  inception: 2006
Portfolio  Managers:

Bart  Baum, Chief Investment Officer and Principal; industry since 1992
Dan Stone, Principal; industry since 1996
Adam Radosti, Principal; industry since 1994
Doug Fincher;  industry since 1987

investment philosophy: 
  ABSOLUTE RETURNS WITH 
  LIMITED CORRELATION
The  investment team seeks to combine relative value-based arbitrage strategies with  a disciplined portfolio and risk management process. It strives to employ a “market-neutral”  strategy, meaning the Fund’s returns are not intended to be closely correlated  to the stock market as a whole, interest rates or a particular market index.  The Fund’s asset allocation among its arbitrage strategies and the use of  various hedging strategies are intended to enhance returns and mitigate  downside risk. Risk management is a key element of the investment philosophy.

The  Fund’s strategy of investing in a variety of arbitrage strategies entails certain risks including that the  sub-advisor’s judgments about allocation between such strategies, as well as  individual arbitrage opportunities, may not perform to expectations, resulting  in the Fund’s underperformance or even losses versus other similar funds. Arbitrage  is the simultaneous purchase and sale of an asset or assets to take advantage  of a perceived pricing anomaly. Because the Fund may invest in fewer issuers than a more diversified  portfolio, the fluctuating value of a single holding may have a greater effect  on the value of the Fund. The Fund may have high portfolio turnover, which could increase the Fund’s  transaction costs and possibly have a negative impact on performance. Investing in small- and mid-capitalization stocks may  involve greater volatility and lower liquidity than larger company stocks. The  use of fixed-income securities,  including convertible securities, entails interest rate and credit risks. In  addition, the value of a convertible security could fluctuate  based on the value of the underlying stock.   Investing in foreign securities may  involve heightened risk due to currency fluctuations and economic and political  risks. Investing in derivative  instruments involves liquidity, credit, interest rate and market risks. Short sales involve special risks,  including greater reliance on the sub-advisor’s ability to accurately  anticipate the future value of a security or instrument; the Fund’s losses are  potentially unlimited in a short sale. Please see the prospectus for a complete discussion of the Fund's risks. There can be no assurances that the investment objectives of this Fund will be met.

1The Manager has contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses of the Fund through April 30, 2017, to the extent that the expense ratios exceed 1.54% for Institutional, 1.92% for Investor, 1.64% for Y, 1.94% for A and 2.69% for C (excluding taxes, interest, brokerage commissions, acquired fund fees and expenses, securities lending fees, expenses associated with securities sold short, litigation, and other extraordinary expenses).

Important Information: 
        All investing involves risk, including possible  loss of principal. Indexes are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in an index.		
*Annualized. 
For any Class of the Fund that began operating within the 10-year/since inception period
shown, the performance shown prior to the inception date of the Class is that of a class (or
series of classes) previously in operation. The combined returns have not been adjusted for
any difference between the fees and expenses of the Class and the historical fees and
expenses of the included previous class (or classes). If the previous class(es) had lower
expenses, the resulting performance would be better than the Class would have realized
during the same period. If the previous class(es) had higher expenses, the resulting
performance would be lower than the Class would have realized during the same period. A
portion of fees charged to the Institutional and Y Classes of the Fund has been waived since
June 30, 2015. Performance prior to waiving fees was lower than actual returns shown since
June 30, 2015. A portion of fees charged to the Investor Class of the Fund was waived in 2015
and partially recovered in 2016. Performance prior to waiving fees was lower than actual
returns shown in 2015.
The BofA Merrill Lynch U.S. Dollar 3-Month LIBOR Constant Maturity Index represents the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) with a constant 3-month average maturity. LIBOR is a composite of the rates of interest at which banks borrow from one another in the London market, and it is a widely used benchmark for short-term interest rates. The Bloomberg Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Index is a market value weighted performance benchmark for government, corporate, mortgage-backed and asset-backed fixed-rate debt securities of all maturities.
On June 30, 2015, the Ionic  Absolute Return Fund LLC (“Private Fund”), a privately offered investment fund  managed by the Fund’s sub-advisor transferred its assets to the Institutional  Class shares of the Fund. The Fund’s investment policies, objective, guidelines  and restrictions are, in all material respects, equivalent to those of the  Private Fund. The Trust calculated the performance for each share class of the  Fund for periods commencing prior to the transfer of the Private Fund’s assets  to the Fund by including the Private Fund’s total return adjusted to reflect the  deduction of fees and expenses applicable to each share class as stated in the  prospectus. The Private Fund was not registered under the Investment Company  Act of 1940 and was not subject to certain investment limitations,  diversification requirements, and other restrictions which, if applicable, may  have adversely affected its performance. Please refer to the Financial  Statements section of the Fund’s SAI to review additional information regarding  the Private Fund.

Among them, the American Beacon Ionic Strategic Arbitrage Fund (IONAX), a fund designed to seek capital appreciation with low volatility and reduced correlation to stocks and interest rates.The new fund follows the launch of a managed futures fund with AHL last August, and the sale of American Beacon to two private equity firms. In addition, American Beacon has one additional liquid alternative fund in registration, a long/short equity fund that will be sub-advised by Grosvenor Capital Management.Multi-Strategy ApproachThe American Beacon Ionic Strategic Arbitrage Fund will pursue its investment objectives by employing a “strategic arbitrage strategy” that can be broken down into a quartet of sub-strategies: Convertible arbitrage, credit/rates relative value arbitrage, equity arbitrage, and volatility arbitrage.According to the fund’s prospectus, under typical conditions, the fund’s assets will be allocated as follows:40-50% of the fund’s assets will be allocated to its convertible arbitrage sub-strategy, which involves identifying and capitalizing on the pricing of a company’s convertible securities relative to its common stock;Between 20% and 30% of the fund’s assets will be allocated to “credit/rates relative value arbitrage,” which involves investing in mortgage-related derivatives (and other derivatives) the fund’s managers consider relatively inexpensive;Another 30-40% of the fund’s assets will be allocated to equity arbitrage, and;The remainder, 5-15%, will be allocated to volatility arbitrage – strategies that, respectively, seek to profit from inefficiencies between share classes of a company’s stock, and the movement of prices, regardless of market direction.Ionic Capital Management is the fund’s sub-advisor, and the firm’s CIO Bart Baum is among its portfolio managers. Mr. Baum is joined by fellow principals Adam Radosti and Daniel Stone, as well as portfolio manager Doug Fincher.Fund DetailsShares of the American Beacon Ionic Strategic Arbitrage Fund are available in five share classes: A (IONAX), C (IONCX), Y (IONYX), institutional (IONIX), and investor (IONPX). The management fee across all share classes is 1.05%.A, C, and Y-class shares have respective net-expense ratios of 3.78%, 4.53%, and 3.48%; while institutional- and investor-class shares have respective net-expense ratios of 3.38% and 3.76%. The minimum initial investment is lowest for C-class shares, at $1,000; while A and investor-class shares have a $2,500 minimum; and Y and institutional-class shares have initial minimums of $100,000 and $250,000, respectively.All of the expense ratios above include 1.74% of “Dividends & Interest Expenses on Securities Sold Short,” which is an investment expense that the SEC requires to be included in the expense ratio.For more information, visit the fund’s web page.
