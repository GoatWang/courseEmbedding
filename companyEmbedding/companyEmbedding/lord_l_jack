Early years[edit]
Born in Brooklyn, New York, Lord was the son of Irish-American parents. His father, William Lawrence Ryan, was a steamship company executive.[1] He grew up in Morris Park[2] (now known as Richmond Hill), Queens, New York.
Young Lord developed his equestrian skills on his mother's fruit farm[3] in the Hudson River Valley. He started spending summers at sea, and from the decks of cargo ships[4] painted and sketched the landscapes he encountered—Africa, the Mediterranean and China. He was educated at St. Benedict Joseph Labre School,[2] John Adams High School, in Ozone Park, New York, and the United States Merchant Marine Academy,[5] then located at Fort Trumbull in New London, Connecticut, graduating as an Ensign[6] with a Third Mates License. He attended New York University (NYU) on a football scholarship,[1][4] and earned a degree in Fine Arts.
He spent the first year of the United States' involvement in World War II with the United States Army Corps of Engineers, building bridges in Persia.[2] He returned to the Merchant Marine [7] as an Able Seaman before enrolling in the deck officer course at Fort Trumbull. While making maritime training films, he took to the idea of acting.
Career[edit]
Lord received theatrical training from Sanford Meisner[8] at the Neighborhood Playhouse.[9] He worked first as a car salesman[3] for Horgan Ford, then later as a Cadillac salesman in New York to fund his studies. Later he studied at the Actors Studio.[10]
His Broadway debut was as Slim Murphy in Horton Foote's The Traveling Lady with Kim Stanley.[11][12] The show ran for 30 performances, October 27, 1954 through November 20, 1954. Lord won the Theatre World Award[13] for his performance. Lord was then cast as Brick[14] in a replacement for Ben Gazzara in the 1955–1956 production of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.[15] He had been in The Little Hut (his first play), The Illegitimist, and The Savage.
His first commercial film role was in the 1949 film[9] The Red Menace a.k.a. Project X, an anti-Communist production. He was associate producer in his 1950 film Cry Murder. In 1957, Lord starred in Williamsburg: the Story of a Patriot,[16] which has run daily at Colonial Williamsburg since then. In 1958, Lord co-starred as Buck Walden in God's Little Acre,[17] the film adaptation of Erskine Caldwell's 1933 novel.
Lord was the first actor to play the character Felix Leiter[18] in the James Bond film series, introduced in the first Bond film, Dr. No. According to screenwriter Richard Maibaum, Lord demanded co-star billing, a bigger role and more money to reprise the role[19] in Goldfinger, which resulted in director Guy Hamilton casting Cec Linder in the role.
In 1962, Lord starred as series namesake Stoney Burke,[20] a rodeo cowboy from Mission Ridge, South Dakota. The basis for the series was real-life champion rodeo rider Casey Tibbs.[21] The series featured Warren Oates and Bruce Dern in recurring supporting roles. Lord credited Gary Cooper as his on-screen role model,[8] and the inspiration for his characterization of Stoney Burke.
Lord was considered for Eliot Ness in The Untouchables before Robert Stack won the role.[22] Ironically, he appeared in the Season One episode "The Jake Lingle Killing." In 1965 he guest-starred as Colonel 'Pres' Gallagher in second-season episode 5, "Big Brother" of 12 O-Clock High. Other television guest appearances include Appointment with Adventure, The Americans, Bonanza, The High Chaparral, Combat!, The Man from U.N.C.L.E., The Reporter starring Harry Guardino, The Fugitive, The Invaders, Rawhide, Ironside, and The F.B.I.
Lord appeared on the first episode of Have Gun, Will Travel. In 1968, Lord appeared with Susan Strasberg in the film The Name of the Game Is Kill.[23]
According to William Shatner,[24] in 1966, Gene Roddenberry offered Lord the role of Captain James T. Kirk on Star Trek, to replace Jeffrey Hunter, whose wife was making too many demands. Lord asked for 50 percent ownership of the show, so Roddenberry offered the role to Shatner.
Hawaii Five-O[edit]




Lord in 1974.


Jack Lord helped conceive Hawaii Five-O and starred for its 12 seasons as Detective Stephen McGarrett, appointed by the Governor to head the (fictional) State Police criminal investigation department in Honolulu, Hawaii.[25] The opening sequence includes a shot of Lord standing on a penthouse balcony of The Ilikai hotel. Chin Ho Kelly,[26] the name of the police detective played by Kam Fong, was a tip-of-the-hat to Ilikai developer Chinn Ho. Lord's catchphrase, "Book 'em, Danno!",[25] became a part of pop culture. He was instrumental in the casting of native Hawaiians, instead of mainland actors.[25] Lord insisted his character drive Ford vehicles; McGarrett drove a 1967 Mercury Park Lane in the pilot, a 1968 Park Lane from 1968–1974, and a 1974 Mercury Marquis for the remainder of the series (this very car was shown in the 2010 remake).[27] Lord was a perfectionist. At the airing of its last episode, Hawaii Five-O was the longest-running cop show in television history.
When series creator Leonard Freeman died in 1974, the show's ownership was shared among Lord, CBS and Freeman's estate,[25] with a contract that made Lord executive producer and gave him complete control over content. He was a hands-on partner who paid attention to minute details,[8] and was known for battles with network executives.
Artist[edit]
During his years at NYU, Lord and his brother Bill opened the Village Academy of Arts.[2] Jack's childhood dream was to become an artist. His first professional sale was in 1941 to the Metropolitan Museum of Art for his two linoleum cuts, entitled Vermont and Fishing Shacks, Block Island.[1]
Personal life[edit]
Lord's first marriage to Anne Willard ended in divorce in 1947.[1] Lord met his son (from his first marriage) only once when the boy was an infant. The boy was later killed in an accident at age 13.[27]
Jack met his second wife while house hunting in upstate New York.[28] On January 17, 1949, Lord married Marie de Narde,[2] who gave up her career in fashion design to devote her life to him. Marie designed Lord's off-camera wardrobe, as well as her own.
Lord was a chain-smoker who failed at traditional methods of quitting. According to Lord, it was his faith in God which broke his habit.[8] Lord and a friend visited a Catholic church where both knelt while Lord promised God he would stop smoking.
Lord was known for being a cultured man who loved reading poetry out loud on the set of his television show and for being reclusive[8] at his Honolulu home.
Popular culture[edit]
Cinematographers sometimes refer to a 50mm lens ("5-0") as a "Jack Lord" in reference to the name of the show that made him famous.[29]
Actress Traci Lords chose that stage name because she was a fan of his character in Hawaii 5-0.[30]
Death[edit]
After his series ended in 1980, Lord kept a low profile, rarely making public appearances. His final TV appearance was that same year in a failed pilot for a new CBS series called M Station: Hawaii which he also directed. Lord suffered from Alzheimer's disease for seven years before his death.[31][32] He died of congestive heart failure at his home in Honolulu, on January 21, 1998, at age 77, leaving an estate of $40 million. He was a philanthropist and the entire estate went to Hawaiian charities upon his wife Marie's death in 2005.[33]
Lord's passing was not widely covered by the media; accordingly, Randy Cassingham used this as the start of his Honorary Unsubscribe featurette in his online newsletter This is True.[34]
Memorial[edit]
A bronze bust of Lord by Hawaii sculptor Lynn Weiler Liverton was unveiled in a ceremony at the Kahala Mall on June 19, 2004. The Lords lived in a condominium in the Kahala area, and they were known to frequent the neighborhood mall. The nonprofit Jack Lord Memorial Fund, which raised the money for the memorial, was co-chaired by British Hawaii Five-O fan Esperanza Isaac and Lord's co-star Doug Mossman.[35][36]

In 1965 he guest-starred as Colonel 'Pres' Gallagher in second-season episode 5, "Big Brother" of 12 O-Clock High. Other television guest appearances include Appointment with Adventure, The Americans, Bonanza, The High Chaparral, Combat!, The Man from U.N.C.L.E., The Reporter starring Harry Guardino, The Fugitive, The Invaders, Rawhide, Ironside, and The F.B.I.
Lord appeared on the first episode of Have Gun, Will Travel. In 1968, Lord appeared with Susan Strasberg in the film The Name of the Game Is Kill.[23]
According to William Shatner,[24] in 1966, Gene Roddenberry offered Lord the role of Captain James T. Kirk on Star Trek, to replace Jeffrey Hunter, whose wife was making too many demands. Lord asked for 50 percent ownership of the show, so Roddenberry offered the role to Shatner.
Hawaii Five-O[edit]




Lord in 1974.


Jack Lord helped conceive Hawaii Five-O and starred for its 12 seasons as Detective Stephen McGarrett, appointed by the Governor to head the (fictional) State Police criminal investigation department in Honolulu, Hawaii.[25] The opening sequence includes a shot of Lord standing on a penthouse balcony of The Ilikai hotel. Chin Ho Kelly,[26] the name of the police detective played by Kam Fong, was a tip-of-the-hat to Ilikai developer Chinn Ho. Lord's catchphrase, "Book 'em, Danno!",[25] became a part of pop culture. He was instrumental in the casting of native Hawaiians, instead of mainland actors.[25] Lord insisted his character drive Ford vehicles; McGarrett drove a 1967 Mercury Park Lane in the pilot, a 1968 Park Lane from 1968–1974, and a 1974 Mercury Marquis for the remainder of the series (this very car was shown in the 2010 remake).[27] Lord was a perfectionist. At the airing of its last episode, Hawaii Five-O was the longest-running cop show in television history.
When series creator Leonard Freeman died in 1974, the show's ownership was shared among Lord, CBS and Freeman's estate,[25] with a contract that made Lord executive producer and gave him complete control over content. He was a hands-on partner who paid attention to minute details,[8] and was known for battles with network executives.
Artist[edit]
During his years at NYU, Lord and his brother Bill opened the Village Academy of Arts.[2] Jack's childhood dream was to become an artist. His first professional sale was in 1941 to the Metropolitan Museum of Art for his two linoleum cuts, entitled Vermont and Fishing Shacks, Block Island.[1]
Personal life[edit]
Lord's first marriage to Anne Willard ended in divorce in 1947.[1] Lord met his son (from his first marriage) only once when the boy was an infant. The boy was later killed in an accident at age 13.[27]
Jack met his second wife while house hunting in upstate New York.[28] On January 17, 1949, Lord married Marie de Narde,[2] who gave up her career in fashion design to devote her life to him. Marie designed Lord's off-camera wardrobe, as well as her own.
Lord was a chain-smoker who failed at traditional methods of quitting. According to Lord, it was his faith in God which broke his habit.[8] Lord and a friend visited a Catholic church where both knelt while Lord promised God he would stop smoking.
Lord was known for being a cultured man who loved reading poetry out loud on the set of his television show and for being reclusive[8] at his Honolulu home.
Popular culture[edit]
Cinematographers sometimes refer to a 50mm lens ("5-0") as a "Jack Lord" in reference to the name of the show that made him famous.[29]
Actress Traci Lords chose that stage name because she was a fan of his character in Hawaii 5-0.[30]
Death[edit]
After his series ended in 1980, Lord kept a low profile, rarely making public appearances. His final TV appearance was that same year in a failed pilot for a new CBS series called M Station: Hawaii which he also directed. Lord suffered from Alzheimer's disease for seven years before his death.[31][32] He died of congestive heart failure at his home in Honolulu, on January 21, 1998, at age 77, leaving an estate of $40 million. He was a philanthropist and the entire estate went to Hawaiian charities upon his wife Marie's death in 2005.[33]
Lord's passing was not widely covered by the media; accordingly, Randy Cassingham used this as the start of his Honorary Unsubscribe featurette in his online newsletter This is True.[34]
Memorial[edit]
A bronze bust of Lord by Hawaii sculptor Lynn Weiler Liverton was unveiled in a ceremony at the Kahala Mall on June 19, 2004. The Lords lived in a condominium in the Kahala area, and they were known to frequent the neighborhood mall. The nonprofit Jack Lord Memorial Fund, which raised the money for the memorial, was co-chaired by British Hawaii Five-O fan Esperanza Isaac and Lord's co-star Doug Mossman.[35][36]

Early years[edit]
Born in Brooklyn, New York, Lord was the son of Irish-American parents. His father, William Lawrence Ryan, was a steamship company executive.[1] He grew up in Morris Park[2] (now known as Richmond Hill), Queens, New York.
Young Lord developed his equestrian skills on his mother's fruit farm[3] in the Hudson River Valley. He started spending summers at sea, and from the decks of cargo ships[4] painted and sketched the landscapes he encountered—Africa, the Mediterranean and China. He was educated at St. Benedict Joseph Labre School,[2] John Adams High School, in Ozone Park, New York, and the United States Merchant Marine Academy,[5] then located at Fort Trumbull in New London, Connecticut, graduating as an Ensign[6] with a Third Mates License. He attended New York University (NYU) on a football scholarship,[1][4] and earned a degree in Fine Arts.
He spent the first year of the United States' involvement in World War II with the United States Army Corps of Engineers, building bridges in Persia.[2] He returned to the Merchant Marine [7] as an Able Seaman before enrolling in the deck officer course at Fort Trumbull. While making maritime training films, he took to the idea of acting.
Career[edit]
Lord received theatrical training from Sanford Meisner[8] at the Neighborhood Playhouse.[9] He worked first as a car salesman[3] for Horgan Ford, then later as a Cadillac salesman in New York to fund his studies. Later he studied at the Actors Studio.[10]
His Broadway debut was as Slim Murphy in Horton Foote's The Traveling Lady with Kim Stanley.[11][12] The show ran for 30 performances, October 27, 1954 through November 20, 1954. Lord won the Theatre World Award[13] for his performance. Lord was then cast as Brick[14] in a replacement for Ben Gazzara in the 1955–1956 production of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.[15] He had been in The Little Hut (his first play), The Illegitimist, and The Savage.
His first commercial film role was in the 1949 film[9] The Red Menace a.k.a. Project X, an anti-Communist production. He was associate producer in his 1950 film Cry Murder. In 1957, Lord starred in Williamsburg: the Story of a Patriot,[16] which has run daily at Colonial Williamsburg since then. In 1958, Lord co-starred as Buck Walden in God's Little Acre,[17] the film adaptation of Erskine Caldwell's 1933 novel.
Lord was the first actor to play the character Felix Leiter[18] in the James Bond film series, introduced in the first Bond film, Dr. No. According to screenwriter Richard Maibaum, Lord demanded co-star billing, a bigger role and more money to reprise the role[19] in Goldfinger, which resulted in director Guy Hamilton casting Cec Linder in the role.
In 1962, Lord starred as series namesake Stoney Burke,[20] a rodeo cowboy from Mission Ridge, South Dakota. The basis for the series was real-life champion rodeo rider Casey Tibbs.[21] The series featured Warren Oates and Bruce Dern in recurring supporting roles. Lord credited Gary Cooper as his on-screen role model,[8] and the inspiration for his characterization of Stoney Burke.
Lord was considered for Eliot Ness in The Untouchables before Robert Stack won the role.[22] Ironically, he appeared in the Season One episode "The Jake Lingle Killing." In 1965 he guest-starred as Colonel 'Pres' Gallagher in second-season episode 5, "Big Brother" of 12 O-Clock High. Other television guest appearances include Appointment with Adventure, The Americans, Bonanza, The High Chaparral, Combat!, The Man from U.N.C.L.E., The Reporter starring Harry Guardino, The Fugitive, The Invaders, Rawhide, Ironside, and The F.B.I.
Lord appeared on the first episode of Have Gun, Will Travel. In 1968, Lord appeared with Susan Strasberg in the film The Name of the Game Is Kill.[23]
According to William Shatner,[24] in 1966, Gene Roddenberry offered Lord the role of Captain James T. Kirk on Star Trek, to replace Jeffrey Hunter, whose wife was making too many demands. Lord asked for 50 percent ownership of the show, so Roddenberry offered the role to Shatner.
Hawaii Five-O[edit]




Lord in 1974.


Jack Lord helped conceive Hawaii Five-O and starred for its 12 seasons as Detective Stephen McGarrett, appointed by the Governor to head the (fictional) State Police criminal investigation department in Honolulu, Hawaii.[25] The opening sequence includes a shot of Lord standing on a penthouse balcony of The Ilikai hotel. Chin Ho Kelly,[26] the name of the police detective played by Kam Fong, was a tip-of-the-hat to Ilikai developer Chinn Ho. Lord's catchphrase, "Book 'em, Danno!",[25] became a part of pop culture. He was instrumental in the casting of native Hawaiians, instead of mainland actors.[25] Lord insisted his character drive Ford vehicles; McGarrett drove a 1967 Mercury Park Lane in the pilot, a 1968 Park Lane from 1968–1974, and a 1974 Mercury Marquis for the remainder of the series (this very car was shown in the 2010 remake).[27] Lord was a perfectionist. At the airing of its last episode, Hawaii Five-O was the longest-running cop show in television history.
When series creator Leonard Freeman died in 1974, the show's ownership was shared among Lord, CBS and Freeman's estate,[25] with a contract that made Lord executive producer and gave him complete control over content. He was a hands-on partner who paid attention to minute details,[8] and was known for battles with network executives.
Artist[edit]
During his years at NYU, Lord and his brother Bill opened the Village Academy of Arts.[2] Jack's childhood dream was to become an artist. His first professional sale was in 1941 to the Metropolitan Museum of Art for his two linoleum cuts, entitled Vermont and Fishing Shacks, Block Island.[1]
Personal life[edit]
Lord's first marriage to Anne Willard ended in divorce in 1947.[1] Lord met his son (from his first marriage) only once when the boy was an infant. The boy was later killed in an accident at age 13.[27]
Jack met his second wife while house hunting in upstate New York.[28] On January 17, 1949, Lord married Marie de Narde,[2] who gave up her career in fashion design to devote her life to him. Marie designed Lord's off-camera wardrobe, as well as her own.
Lord was a chain-smoker who failed at traditional methods of quitting. According to Lord, it was his faith in God which broke his habit.[8] Lord and a friend visited a Catholic church where both knelt while Lord promised God he would stop smoking.
Lord was known for being a cultured man who loved reading poetry out loud on the set of his television show and for being reclusive[8] at his Honolulu home.
Popular culture[edit]
Cinematographers sometimes refer to a 50mm lens ("5-0") as a "Jack Lord" in reference to the name of the show that made him famous.[29]
Actress Traci Lords chose that stage name because she was a fan of his character in Hawaii 5-0.[30]
Death[edit]
After his series ended in 1980, Lord kept a low profile, rarely making public appearances. His final TV appearance was that same year in a failed pilot for a new CBS series called M Station: Hawaii which he also directed. Lord suffered from Alzheimer's disease for seven years before his death.[31][32] He died of congestive heart failure at his home in Honolulu, on January 21, 1998, at age 77, leaving an estate of $40 million. He was a philanthropist and the entire estate went to Hawaiian charities upon his wife Marie's death in 2005.[33]
Lord's passing was not widely covered by the media; accordingly, Randy Cassingham used this as the start of his Honorary Unsubscribe featurette in his online newsletter This is True.[34]
Memorial[edit]
A bronze bust of Lord by Hawaii sculptor Lynn Weiler Liverton was unveiled in a ceremony at the Kahala Mall on June 19, 2004. The Lords lived in a condominium in the Kahala area, and they were known to frequent the neighborhood mall. The nonprofit Jack Lord Memorial Fund, which raised the money for the memorial, was co-chaired by British Hawaii Five-O fan Esperanza Isaac and Lord's co-star Doug Mossman.[35][36]

Early years[edit]
Born in Brooklyn, New York, Lord was the son of Irish-American parents. His father, William Lawrence Ryan, was a steamship company executive.[1] He grew up in Morris Park[2] (now known as Richmond Hill), Queens, New York.
Young Lord developed his equestrian skills on his mother's fruit farm[3] in the Hudson River Valley. He started spending summers at sea, and from the decks of cargo ships[4] painted and sketched the landscapes he encountered—Africa, the Mediterranean and China. He was educated at St. Benedict Joseph Labre School,[2] John Adams High School, in Ozone Park, New York, and the United States Merchant Marine Academy,[5] then located at Fort Trumbull in New London, Connecticut, graduating as an Ensign[6] with a Third Mates License. He attended New York University (NYU) on a football scholarship,[1][4] and earned a degree in Fine Arts.
He spent the first year of the United States' involvement in World War II with the United States Army Corps of Engineers, building bridges in Persia.[2] He returned to the Merchant Marine [7] as an Able Seaman before enrolling in the deck officer course at Fort Trumbull. While making maritime training films, he took to the idea of acting.
Career[edit]
Lord received theatrical training from Sanford Meisner[8] at the Neighborhood Playhouse.[9] He worked first as a car salesman[3] for Horgan Ford, then later as a Cadillac salesman in New York to fund his studies. Later he studied at the Actors Studio.[10]
His Broadway debut was as Slim Murphy in Horton Foote's The Traveling Lady with Kim Stanley.[11][12] The show ran for 30 performances, October 27, 1954 through November 20, 1954. Lord won the Theatre World Award[13] for his performance. Lord was then cast as Brick[14] in a replacement for Ben Gazzara in the 1955–1956 production of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.[15] He had been in The Little Hut (his first play), The Illegitimist, and The Savage.
His first commercial film role was in the 1949 film[9] The Red Menace a.k.a. Project X, an anti-Communist production. He was associate producer in his 1950 film Cry Murder. In 1957, Lord starred in Williamsburg: the Story of a Patriot,[16] which has run daily at Colonial Williamsburg since then. In 1958, Lord co-starred as Buck Walden in God's Little Acre,[17] the film adaptation of Erskine Caldwell's 1933 novel.
Lord was the first actor to play the character Felix Leiter[18] in the James Bond film series, introduced in the first Bond film, Dr. No. According to screenwriter Richard Maibaum, Lord demanded co-star billing, a bigger role and more money to reprise the role[19] in Goldfinger, which resulted in director Guy Hamilton casting Cec Linder in the role.
In 1962, Lord starred as series namesake Stoney Burke,[20] a rodeo cowboy from Mission Ridge, South Dakota. The basis for the series was real-life champion rodeo rider Casey Tibbs.[21] The series featured Warren Oates and Bruce Dern in recurring supporting roles. Lord credited Gary Cooper as his on-screen role model,[8] and the inspiration for his characterization of Stoney Burke.
Lord was considered for Eliot Ness in The Untouchables before Robert Stack won the role.[22] Ironically, he appeared in the Season One episode "The Jake Lingle Killing." In 1965 he guest-starred as Colonel 'Pres' Gallagher in second-season episode 5, "Big Brother" of 12 O-Clock High. Other television guest appearances include Appointment with Adventure, The Americans, Bonanza, The High Chaparral, Combat!, The Man from U.N.C.L.E., The Reporter starring Harry Guardino, The Fugitive, The Invaders, Rawhide, Ironside, and The F.B.I.
Lord appeared on the first episode of Have Gun, Will Travel. In 1968, Lord appeared with Susan Strasberg in the film The Name of the Game Is Kill.[23]
According to William Shatner,[24] in 1966, Gene Roddenberry offered Lord the role of Captain James T. Kirk on Star Trek, to replace Jeffrey Hunter, whose wife was making too many demands. Lord asked for 50 percent ownership of the show, so Roddenberry offered the role to Shatner.
Hawaii Five-O[edit]




Lord in 1974.


Jack Lord helped conceive Hawaii Five-O and starred for its 12 seasons as Detective Stephen McGarrett, appointed by the Governor to head the (fictional) State Police criminal investigation department in Honolulu, Hawaii.[25] The opening sequence includes a shot of Lord standing on a penthouse balcony of The Ilikai hotel. Chin Ho Kelly,[26] the name of the police detective played by Kam Fong, was a tip-of-the-hat to Ilikai developer Chinn Ho. Lord's catchphrase, "Book 'em, Danno!",[25] became a part of pop culture. He was instrumental in the casting of native Hawaiians, instead of mainland actors.[25] Lord insisted his character drive Ford vehicles; McGarrett drove a 1967 Mercury Park Lane in the pilot, a 1968 Park Lane from 1968–1974, and a 1974 Mercury Marquis for the remainder of the series (this very car was shown in the 2010 remake).[27] Lord was a perfectionist. At the airing of its last episode, Hawaii Five-O was the longest-running cop show in television history.
When series creator Leonard Freeman died in 1974, the show's ownership was shared among Lord, CBS and Freeman's estate,[25] with a contract that made Lord executive producer and gave him complete control over content. He was a hands-on partner who paid attention to minute details,[8] and was known for battles with network executives.
Artist[edit]
During his years at NYU, Lord and his brother Bill opened the Village Academy of Arts.[2] Jack's childhood dream was to become an artist. His first professional sale was in 1941 to the Metropolitan Museum of Art for his two linoleum cuts, entitled Vermont and Fishing Shacks, Block Island.[1]
Personal life[edit]
Lord's first marriage to Anne Willard ended in divorce in 1947.[1] Lord met his son (from his first marriage) only once when the boy was an infant. The boy was later killed in an accident at age 13.[27]
Jack met his second wife while house hunting in upstate New York.[28] On January 17, 1949, Lord married Marie de Narde,[2] who gave up her career in fashion design to devote her life to him. Marie designed Lord's off-camera wardrobe, as well as her own.
Lord was a chain-smoker who failed at traditional methods of quitting. According to Lord, it was his faith in God which broke his habit.[8] Lord and a friend visited a Catholic church where both knelt while Lord promised God he would stop smoking.
Lord was known for being a cultured man who loved reading poetry out loud on the set of his television show and for being reclusive[8] at his Honolulu home.
Popular culture[edit]
Cinematographers sometimes refer to a 50mm lens ("5-0") as a "Jack Lord" in reference to the name of the show that made him famous.[29]
Actress Traci Lords chose that stage name because she was a fan of his character in Hawaii 5-0.[30]
Death[edit]
After his series ended in 1980, Lord kept a low profile, rarely making public appearances. His final TV appearance was that same year in a failed pilot for a new CBS series called M Station: Hawaii which he also directed. Lord suffered from Alzheimer's disease for seven years before his death.[31][32] He died of congestive heart failure at his home in Honolulu, on January 21, 1998, at age 77, leaving an estate of $40 million. He was a philanthropist and the entire estate went to Hawaiian charities upon his wife Marie's death in 2005.[33]
Lord's passing was not widely covered by the media; accordingly, Randy Cassingham used this as the start of his Honorary Unsubscribe featurette in his online newsletter This is True.[34]
Memorial[edit]
A bronze bust of Lord by Hawaii sculptor Lynn Weiler Liverton was unveiled in a ceremony at the Kahala Mall on June 19, 2004. The Lords lived in a condominium in the Kahala area, and they were known to frequent the neighborhood mall. The nonprofit Jack Lord Memorial Fund, which raised the money for the memorial, was co-chaired by British Hawaii Five-O fan Esperanza Isaac and Lord's co-star Doug Mossman.[35][36]

Early years[edit]
Born in Brooklyn, New York, Lord was the son of Irish-American parents. His father, William Lawrence Ryan, was a steamship company executive.[1] He grew up in Morris Park[2] (now known as Richmond Hill), Queens, New York.
Young Lord developed his equestrian skills on his mother's fruit farm[3] in the Hudson River Valley. He started spending summers at sea, and from the decks of cargo ships[4] painted and sketched the landscapes he encountered—Africa, the Mediterranean and China. He was educated at St. Benedict Joseph Labre School,[2] John Adams High School, in Ozone Park, New York, and the United States Merchant Marine Academy,[5] then located at Fort Trumbull in New London, Connecticut, graduating as an Ensign[6] with a Third Mates License. He attended New York University (NYU) on a football scholarship,[1][4] and earned a degree in Fine Arts.
He spent the first year of the United States' involvement in World War II with the United States Army Corps of Engineers, building bridges in Persia.[2] He returned to the Merchant Marine [7] as an Able Seaman before enrolling in the deck officer course at Fort Trumbull. While making maritime training films, he took to the idea of acting.
Career[edit]
Lord received theatrical training from Sanford Meisner[8] at the Neighborhood Playhouse.[9] He worked first as a car salesman[3] for Horgan Ford, then later as a Cadillac salesman in New York to fund his studies. Later he studied at the Actors Studio.[10]
His Broadway debut was as Slim Murphy in Horton Foote's The Traveling Lady with Kim Stanley.[11][12] The show ran for 30 performances, October 27, 1954 through November 20, 1954. Lord won the Theatre World Award[13] for his performance. Lord was then cast as Brick[14] in a replacement for Ben Gazzara in the 1955–1956 production of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.[15] He had been in The Little Hut (his first play), The Illegitimist, and The Savage.
His first commercial film role was in the 1949 film[9] The Red Menace a.k.a. Project X, an anti-Communist production. He was associate producer in his 1950 film Cry Murder. In 1957, Lord starred in Williamsburg: the Story of a Patriot,[16] which has run daily at Colonial Williamsburg since then. In 1958, Lord co-starred as Buck Walden in God's Little Acre,[17] the film adaptation of Erskine Caldwell's 1933 novel.
Lord was the first actor to play the character Felix Leiter[18] in the James Bond film series, introduced in the first Bond film, Dr. No. According to screenwriter Richard Maibaum, Lord demanded co-star billing, a bigger role and more money to reprise the role[19] in Goldfinger, which resulted in director Guy Hamilton casting Cec Linder in the role.
In 1962, Lord starred as series namesake Stoney Burke,[20] a rodeo cowboy from Mission Ridge, South Dakota. The basis for the series was real-life champion rodeo rider Casey Tibbs.[21] The series featured Warren Oates and Bruce Dern in recurring supporting roles. Lord credited Gary Cooper as his on-screen role model,[8] and the inspiration for his characterization of Stoney Burke.
Lord was considered for Eliot Ness in The Untouchables before Robert Stack won the role.[22] Ironically, he appeared in the Season One episode "The Jake Lingle Killing." In 1965 he guest-starred as Colonel 'Pres' Gallagher in second-season episode 5, "Big Brother" of 12 O-Clock High. Other television guest appearances include Appointment with Adventure, The Americans, Bonanza, The High Chaparral, Combat!, The Man from U.N.C.L.E., The Reporter starring Harry Guardino, The Fugitive, The Invaders, Rawhide, Ironside, and The F.B.I.
Lord appeared on the first episode of Have Gun, Will Travel. In 1968, Lord appeared with Susan Strasberg in the film The Name of the Game Is Kill.[23]
According to William Shatner,[24] in 1966, Gene Roddenberry offered Lord the role of Captain James T. Kirk on Star Trek, to replace Jeffrey Hunter, whose wife was making too many demands. Lord asked for 50 percent ownership of the show, so Roddenberry offered the role to Shatner.
Hawaii Five-O[edit]




Lord in 1974.


Jack Lord helped conceive Hawaii Five-O and starred for its 12 seasons as Detective Stephen McGarrett, appointed by the Governor to head the (fictional) State Police criminal investigation department in Honolulu, Hawaii.[25] The opening sequence includes a shot of Lord standing on a penthouse balcony of The Ilikai hotel. Chin Ho Kelly,[26] the name of the police detective played by Kam Fong, was a tip-of-the-hat to Ilikai developer Chinn Ho. Lord's catchphrase, "Book 'em, Danno!",[25] became a part of pop culture. He was instrumental in the casting of native Hawaiians, instead of mainland actors.[25] Lord insisted his character drive Ford vehicles; McGarrett drove a 1967 Mercury Park Lane in the pilot, a 1968 Park Lane from 1968–1974, and a 1974 Mercury Marquis for the remainder of the series (this very car was shown in the 2010 remake).[27] Lord was a perfectionist. At the airing of its last episode, Hawaii Five-O was the longest-running cop show in television history.
When series creator Leonard Freeman died in 1974, the show's ownership was shared among Lord, CBS and Freeman's estate,[25] with a contract that made Lord executive producer and gave him complete control over content. He was a hands-on partner who paid attention to minute details,[8] and was known for battles with network executives.
Artist[edit]
During his years at NYU, Lord and his brother Bill opened the Village Academy of Arts.[2] Jack's childhood dream was to become an artist. His first professional sale was in 1941 to the Metropolitan Museum of Art for his two linoleum cuts, entitled Vermont and Fishing Shacks, Block Island.[1]
Personal life[edit]
Lord's first marriage to Anne Willard ended in divorce in 1947.[1] Lord met his son (from his first marriage) only once when the boy was an infant. The boy was later killed in an accident at age 13.[27]
Jack met his second wife while house hunting in upstate New York.[28] On January 17, 1949, Lord married Marie de Narde,[2] who gave up her career in fashion design to devote her life to him. Marie designed Lord's off-camera wardrobe, as well as her own.
Lord was a chain-smoker who failed at traditional methods of quitting. According to Lord, it was his faith in God which broke his habit.[8] Lord and a friend visited a Catholic church where both knelt while Lord promised God he would stop smoking.
Lord was known for being a cultured man who loved reading poetry out loud on the set of his television show and for being reclusive[8] at his Honolulu home.
Popular culture[edit]
Cinematographers sometimes refer to a 50mm lens ("5-0") as a "Jack Lord" in reference to the name of the show that made him famous.[29]
Actress Traci Lords chose that stage name because she was a fan of his character in Hawaii 5-0.[30]
Death[edit]
After his series ended in 1980, Lord kept a low profile, rarely making public appearances. His final TV appearance was that same year in a failed pilot for a new CBS series called M Station: Hawaii which he also directed. Lord suffered from Alzheimer's disease for seven years before his death.[31][32] He died of congestive heart failure at his home in Honolulu, on January 21, 1998, at age 77, leaving an estate of $40 million. He was a philanthropist and the entire estate went to Hawaiian charities upon his wife Marie's death in 2005.[33]
Lord's passing was not widely covered by the media; accordingly, Randy Cassingham used this as the start of his Honorary Unsubscribe featurette in his online newsletter This is True.[34]
Memorial[edit]
A bronze bust of Lord by Hawaii sculptor Lynn Weiler Liverton was unveiled in a ceremony at the Kahala Mall on June 19, 2004. The Lords lived in a condominium in the Kahala area, and they were known to frequent the neighborhood mall. The nonprofit Jack Lord Memorial Fund, which raised the money for the memorial, was co-chaired by British Hawaii Five-O fan Esperanza Isaac and Lord's co-star Doug Mossman.[35][36]

Early years[edit]
Born in Brooklyn, New York, Lord was the son of Irish-American parents. His father, William Lawrence Ryan, was a steamship company executive.[1] He grew up in Morris Park[2] (now known as Richmond Hill), Queens, New York.
Young Lord developed his equestrian skills on his mother's fruit farm[3] in the Hudson River Valley. He started spending summers at sea, and from the decks of cargo ships[4] painted and sketched the landscapes he encountered—Africa, the Mediterranean and China. He was educated at St. Benedict Joseph Labre School,[2] John Adams High School, in Ozone Park, New York, and the United States Merchant Marine Academy,[5] then located at Fort Trumbull in New London, Connecticut, graduating as an Ensign[6] with a Third Mates License. He attended New York University (NYU) on a football scholarship,[1][4] and earned a degree in Fine Arts.
He spent the first year of the United States' involvement in World War II with the United States Army Corps of Engineers, building bridges in Persia.[2] He returned to the Merchant Marine [7] as an Able Seaman before enrolling in the deck officer course at Fort Trumbull. While making maritime training films, he took to the idea of acting.
Career[edit]
Lord received theatrical training from Sanford Meisner[8] at the Neighborhood Playhouse.[9] He worked first as a car salesman[3] for Horgan Ford, then later as a Cadillac salesman in New York to fund his studies. Later he studied at the Actors Studio.[10]
His Broadway debut was as Slim Murphy in Horton Foote's The Traveling Lady with Kim Stanley.[11][12] The show ran for 30 performances, October 27, 1954 through November 20, 1954. Lord won the Theatre World Award[13] for his performance. Lord was then cast as Brick[14] in a replacement for Ben Gazzara in the 1955–1956 production of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.[15] He had been in The Little Hut (his first play), The Illegitimist, and The Savage.
His first commercial film role was in the 1949 film[9] The Red Menace a.k.a. Project X, an anti-Communist production. He was associate producer in his 1950 film Cry Murder. In 1957, Lord starred in Williamsburg: the Story of a Patriot,[16] which has run daily at Colonial Williamsburg since then. In 1958, Lord co-starred as Buck Walden in God's Little Acre,[17] the film adaptation of Erskine Caldwell's 1933 novel.
Lord was the first actor to play the character Felix Leiter[18] in the James Bond film series, introduced in the first Bond film, Dr. No. According to screenwriter Richard Maibaum, Lord demanded co-star billing, a bigger role and more money to reprise the role[19] in Goldfinger, which resulted in director Guy Hamilton casting Cec Linder in the role.
In 1962, Lord starred as series namesake Stoney Burke,[20] a rodeo cowboy from Mission Ridge, South Dakota. The basis for the series was real-life champion rodeo rider Casey Tibbs.[21] The series featured Warren Oates and Bruce Dern in recurring supporting roles. Lord credited Gary Cooper as his on-screen role model,[8] and the inspiration for his characterization of Stoney Burke.
Lord was considered for Eliot Ness in The Untouchables before Robert Stack won the role.[22] Ironically, he appeared in the Season One episode "The Jake Lingle Killing." In 1965 he guest-starred as Colonel 'Pres' Gallagher in second-season episode 5, "Big Brother" of 12 O-Clock High. Other television guest appearances include Appointment with Adventure, The Americans, Bonanza, The High Chaparral, Combat!, The Man from U.N.C.L.E., The Reporter starring Harry Guardino, The Fugitive, The Invaders, Rawhide, Ironside, and The F.B.I.
Lord appeared on the first episode of Have Gun, Will Travel. In 1968, Lord appeared with Susan Strasberg in the film The Name of the Game Is Kill.[23]
According to William Shatner,[24] in 1966, Gene Roddenberry offered Lord the role of Captain James T. Kirk on Star Trek, to replace Jeffrey Hunter, whose wife was making too many demands. Lord asked for 50 percent ownership of the show, so Roddenberry offered the role to Shatner.
Hawaii Five-O[edit]




Lord in 1974.


Jack Lord helped conceive Hawaii Five-O and starred for its 12 seasons as Detective Stephen McGarrett, appointed by the Governor to head the (fictional) State Police criminal investigation department in Honolulu, Hawaii.[25] The opening sequence includes a shot of Lord standing on a penthouse balcony of The Ilikai hotel. Chin Ho Kelly,[26] the name of the police detective played by Kam Fong, was a tip-of-the-hat to Ilikai developer Chinn Ho. Lord's catchphrase, "Book 'em, Danno!",[25] became a part of pop culture. He was instrumental in the casting of native Hawaiians, instead of mainland actors.[25] Lord insisted his character drive Ford vehicles; McGarrett drove a 1967 Mercury Park Lane in the pilot, a 1968 Park Lane from 1968–1974, and a 1974 Mercury Marquis for the remainder of the series (this very car was shown in the 2010 remake).[27] Lord was a perfectionist. At the airing of its last episode, Hawaii Five-O was the longest-running cop show in television history.
When series creator Leonard Freeman died in 1974, the show's ownership was shared among Lord, CBS and Freeman's estate,[25] with a contract that made Lord executive producer and gave him complete control over content. He was a hands-on partner who paid attention to minute details,[8] and was known for battles with network executives.
Artist[edit]
During his years at NYU, Lord and his brother Bill opened the Village Academy of Arts.[2] Jack's childhood dream was to become an artist. His first professional sale was in 1941 to the Metropolitan Museum of Art for his two linoleum cuts, entitled Vermont and Fishing Shacks, Block Island.[1]
Personal life[edit]
Lord's first marriage to Anne Willard ended in divorce in 1947.[1] Lord met his son (from his first marriage) only once when the boy was an infant. The boy was later killed in an accident at age 13.[27]
Jack met his second wife while house hunting in upstate New York.[28] On January 17, 1949, Lord married Marie de Narde,[2] who gave up her career in fashion design to devote her life to him. Marie designed Lord's off-camera wardrobe, as well as her own.
Lord was a chain-smoker who failed at traditional methods of quitting. According to Lord, it was his faith in God which broke his habit.[8] Lord and a friend visited a Catholic church where both knelt while Lord promised God he would stop smoking.
Lord was known for being a cultured man who loved reading poetry out loud on the set of his television show and for being reclusive[8] at his Honolulu home.
Popular culture[edit]
Cinematographers sometimes refer to a 50mm lens ("5-0") as a "Jack Lord" in reference to the name of the show that made him famous.[29]
Actress Traci Lords chose that stage name because she was a fan of his character in Hawaii 5-0.[30]
Death[edit]
After his series ended in 1980, Lord kept a low profile, rarely making public appearances. His final TV appearance was that same year in a failed pilot for a new CBS series called M Station: Hawaii which he also directed. Lord suffered from Alzheimer's disease for seven years before his death.[31][32] He died of congestive heart failure at his home in Honolulu, on January 21, 1998, at age 77, leaving an estate of $40 million. He was a philanthropist and the entire estate went to Hawaiian charities upon his wife Marie's death in 2005.[33]
Lord's passing was not widely covered by the media; accordingly, Randy Cassingham used this as the start of his Honorary Unsubscribe featurette in his online newsletter This is True.[34]
Memorial[edit]
A bronze bust of Lord by Hawaii sculptor Lynn Weiler Liverton was unveiled in a ceremony at the Kahala Mall on June 19, 2004. The Lords lived in a condominium in the Kahala area, and they were known to frequent the neighborhood mall. The nonprofit Jack Lord Memorial Fund, which raised the money for the memorial, was co-chaired by British Hawaii Five-O fan Esperanza Isaac and Lord's co-star Doug Mossman.[35][36]

Lord received theatrical training from Sanford Meisner[8] at the Neighborhood Playhouse.[9] He worked first as a car salesman[3] for Horgan Ford, then later as a Cadillac salesman in New York to fund his studies. Later he studied at the Actors Studio.[10]
His Broadway debut was as Slim Murphy in Horton Foote's The Traveling Lady with Kim Stanley.[11][12] The show ran for 30 performances, October 27, 1954 through November 20, 1954. Lord won the Theatre World Award[13] for his performance. Lord was then cast as Brick[14] in a replacement for Ben Gazzara in the 1955–1956 production of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.[15] He had been in The Little Hut (his first play), The Illegitimist, and The Savage.
His first commercial film role was in the 1949 film[9] The Red Menace a.k.a. Project X, an anti-Communist production. He was associate producer in his 1950 film Cry Murder. In 1957, Lord starred in Williamsburg: the Story of a Patriot,[16] which has run daily at Colonial Williamsburg since then. In 1958, Lord co-starred as Buck Walden in God's Little Acre,[17] the film adaptation of Erskine Caldwell's 1933 novel.
Lord was the first actor to play the character Felix Leiter[18] in the James Bond film series, introduced in the first Bond film, Dr. No. According to screenwriter Richard Maibaum, Lord demanded co-star billing, a bigger role and more money to reprise the role[19] in Goldfinger, which resulted in director Guy Hamilton casting Cec Linder in the role.
In 1962, Lord starred as series namesake Stoney Burke,[20] a rodeo cowboy from Mission Ridge, South Dakota. The basis for the series was real-life champion rodeo rider Casey Tibbs.[21] The series featured Warren Oates and Bruce Dern in recurring supporting roles. Lord credited Gary Cooper as his on-screen role model,[8] and the inspiration for his characterization of Stoney Burke.
Lord was considered for Eliot Ness in The Untouchables before Robert Stack won the role.[22] Ironically, he appeared in the Season One episode "The Jake Lingle Killing." In 1965 he guest-starred as Colonel 'Pres' Gallagher in second-season episode 5, "Big Brother" of 12 O-Clock High. Other television guest appearances include Appointment with Adventure, The Americans, Bonanza, The High Chaparral, Combat!, The Man from U.N.C.L.E., The Reporter starring Harry Guardino, The Fugitive, The Invaders, Rawhide, Ironside, and The F.B.I.
Lord appeared on the first episode of Have Gun, Will Travel. In 1968, Lord appeared with Susan Strasberg in the film The Name of the Game Is Kill.[23]
According to William Shatner,[24] in 1966, Gene Roddenberry offered Lord the role of Captain James T. Kirk on Star Trek, to replace Jeffrey Hunter, whose wife was making too many demands. Lord asked for 50 percent ownership of the show, so Roddenberry offered the role to Shatner.
Hawaii Five-O[edit]




Lord in 1974.


Jack Lord helped conceive Hawaii Five-O and starred for its 12 seasons as Detective Stephen McGarrett, appointed by the Governor to head the (fictional) State Police criminal investigation department in Honolulu, Hawaii.[25] The opening sequence includes a shot of Lord standing on a penthouse balcony of The Ilikai hotel. Chin Ho Kelly,[26] the name of the police detective played by Kam Fong, was a tip-of-the-hat to Ilikai developer Chinn Ho. Lord's catchphrase, "Book 'em, Danno!",[25] became a part of pop culture. He was instrumental in the casting of native Hawaiians, instead of mainland actors.[25] Lord insisted his character drive Ford vehicles; McGarrett drove a 1967 Mercury Park Lane in the pilot, a 1968 Park Lane from 1968–1974, and a 1974 Mercury Marquis for the remainder of the series (this very car was shown in the 2010 remake).[27] Lord was a perfectionist. At the airing of its last episode, Hawaii Five-O was the longest-running cop show in television history.
When series creator Leonard Freeman died in 1974, the show's ownership was shared among Lord, CBS and Freeman's estate,[25] with a contract that made Lord executive producer and gave him complete control over content. He was a hands-on partner who paid attention to minute details,[8] and was known for battles with network executives.
Artist[edit]
During his years at NYU, Lord and his brother Bill opened the Village Academy of Arts.[2] Jack's childhood dream was to become an artist. His first professional sale was in 1941 to the Metropolitan Museum of Art for his two linoleum cuts, entitled Vermont and Fishing Shacks, Block Island.[1]
Personal life[edit]
Lord's first marriage to Anne Willard ended in divorce in 1947.[1] Lord met his son (from his first marriage) only once when the boy was an infant. The boy was later killed in an accident at age 13.[27]
Jack met his second wife while house hunting in upstate New York.[28] On January 17, 1949, Lord married Marie de Narde,[2] who gave up her career in fashion design to devote her life to him. Marie designed Lord's off-camera wardrobe, as well as her own.
Lord was a chain-smoker who failed at traditional methods of quitting. According to Lord, it was his faith in God which broke his habit.[8] Lord and a friend visited a Catholic church where both knelt while Lord promised God he would stop smoking.
Lord was known for being a cultured man who loved reading poetry out loud on the set of his television show and for being reclusive[8] at his Honolulu home.
Popular culture[edit]
Cinematographers sometimes refer to a 50mm lens ("5-0") as a "Jack Lord" in reference to the name of the show that made him famous.[29]
Actress Traci Lords chose that stage name because she was a fan of his character in Hawaii 5-0.[30]
Death[edit]
After his series ended in 1980, Lord kept a low profile, rarely making public appearances. His final TV appearance was that same year in a failed pilot for a new CBS series called M Station: Hawaii which he also directed. Lord suffered from Alzheimer's disease for seven years before his death.[31][32] He died of congestive heart failure at his home in Honolulu, on January 21, 1998, at age 77, leaving an estate of $40 million. He was a philanthropist and the entire estate went to Hawaiian charities upon his wife Marie's death in 2005.[33]
Lord's passing was not widely covered by the media; accordingly, Randy Cassingham used this as the start of his Honorary Unsubscribe featurette in his online newsletter This is True.[34]
Memorial[edit]
A bronze bust of Lord by Hawaii sculptor Lynn Weiler Liverton was unveiled in a ceremony at the Kahala Mall on June 19, 2004. The Lords lived in a condominium in the Kahala area, and they were known to frequent the neighborhood mall. The nonprofit Jack Lord Memorial Fund, which raised the money for the memorial, was co-chaired by British Hawaii Five-O fan Esperanza Isaac and Lord's co-star Doug Mossman.[35][36]

Ordered for Megan Con Orlando Event, I bought 3 jackets, one for mine and two for my brothers, we all participating the event. I already purchased many jacket for my costume completion from here. I believe that this is much closer replica of star-lord second version. My brothers jackets were fit them perfectly but unfortunate my jacket tightens on my sleeves. New American Jacket staff speedily processed my exchange request and delivered a new jacket in 3 days. Leather quality I examine is awesome and true as described so I recommend to purchases from here without any doubt. Thanks much

Manage My Reading List








In Lord of the Flies, British schoolboys are stranded on a tropical island. In an attempt to recreate the culture they left behind, they elect Ralph to lead, with the intellectual Piggy as counselor. But Jack wants to lead, too, and one-by-one, he lures the boys from civility and reason to the savage survivalism of primeval hunters. In Lord of the Flies, William Golding gives us a glimpse of the savagery that underlies even the most civilized human beings.

The three most important aspects of Lord of the Flies:

The major theme of Lord of the Flies is that humans are essentially barbaric if not downright evil. The stranded boys begin by establishing a society similar to the one they left behind in England, but soon their society has degenerated into rival clans ruled by fear and violence; before the book is over, three boys have been killed.


The novel is an allegory, which is a story in which characters, settings, and events stand for things larger than themselves. For example, the island represents the world; Ralph and Jack symbolize different approaches to leadership.
William Golding wrote Lord of the Flies following World War II, during which the Nazis exterminated six million Jews and the United States dropped two atomic bombs on Japan. In this context, the novel's profound pessimism is understandable.

Early years[edit]
Born in Brooklyn, New York, Lord was the son of Irish-American parents. His father, William Lawrence Ryan, was a steamship company executive.[1] He grew up in Morris Park[2] (now known as Richmond Hill), Queens, New York.
Young Lord developed his equestrian skills on his mother's fruit farm[3] in the Hudson River Valley. He started spending summers at sea, and from the decks of cargo ships[4] painted and sketched the landscapes he encountered—Africa, the Mediterranean and China. He was educated at St. Benedict Joseph Labre School,[2] John Adams High School, in Ozone Park, New York, and the United States Merchant Marine Academy,[5] then located at Fort Trumbull in New London, Connecticut, graduating as an Ensign[6] with a Third Mates License. He attended New York University (NYU) on a football scholarship,[1][4] and earned a degree in Fine Arts.
He spent the first year of the United States' involvement in World War II with the United States Army Corps of Engineers, building bridges in Persia.[2] He returned to the Merchant Marine [7] as an Able Seaman before enrolling in the deck officer course at Fort Trumbull. While making maritime training films, he took to the idea of acting.
Career[edit]
Lord received theatrical training from Sanford Meisner[8] at the Neighborhood Playhouse.[9] He worked first as a car salesman[3] for Horgan Ford, then later as a Cadillac salesman in New York to fund his studies. Later he studied at the Actors Studio.[10]
His Broadway debut was as Slim Murphy in Horton Foote's The Traveling Lady with Kim Stanley.[11][12] The show ran for 30 performances, October 27, 1954 through November 20, 1954. Lord won the Theatre World Award[13] for his performance. Lord was then cast as Brick[14] in a replacement for Ben Gazzara in the 1955–1956 production of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.[15] He had been in The Little Hut (his first play), The Illegitimist, and The Savage.
His first commercial film role was in the 1949 film[9] The Red Menace a.k.a. Project X, an anti-Communist production. He was associate producer in his 1950 film Cry Murder. In 1957, Lord starred in Williamsburg: the Story of a Patriot,[16] which has run daily at Colonial Williamsburg since then. In 1958, Lord co-starred as Buck Walden in God's Little Acre,[17] the film adaptation of Erskine Caldwell's 1933 novel.
Lord was the first actor to play the character Felix Leiter[18] in the James Bond film series, introduced in the first Bond film, Dr. No. According to screenwriter Richard Maibaum, Lord demanded co-star billing, a bigger role and more money to reprise the role[19] in Goldfinger, which resulted in director Guy Hamilton casting Cec Linder in the role.
In 1962, Lord starred as series namesake Stoney Burke,[20] a rodeo cowboy from Mission Ridge, South Dakota. The basis for the series was real-life champion rodeo rider Casey Tibbs.[21] The series featured Warren Oates and Bruce Dern in recurring supporting roles. Lord credited Gary Cooper as his on-screen role model,[8] and the inspiration for his characterization of Stoney Burke.
Lord was considered for Eliot Ness in The Untouchables before Robert Stack won the role.[22] Ironically, he appeared in the Season One episode "The Jake Lingle Killing." In 1965 he guest-starred as Colonel 'Pres' Gallagher in second-season episode 5, "Big Brother" of 12 O-Clock High. Other television guest appearances include Appointment with Adventure, The Americans, Bonanza, The High Chaparral, Combat!, The Man from U.N.C.L.E., The Reporter starring Harry Guardino, The Fugitive, The Invaders, Rawhide, Ironside, and The F.B.I.
Lord appeared on the first episode of Have Gun, Will Travel. In 1968, Lord appeared with Susan Strasberg in the film The Name of the Game Is Kill.[23]
According to William Shatner,[24] in 1966, Gene Roddenberry offered Lord the role of Captain James T. Kirk on Star Trek, to replace Jeffrey Hunter, whose wife was making too many demands. Lord asked for 50 percent ownership of the show, so Roddenberry offered the role to Shatner.
Hawaii Five-O[edit]




Lord in 1974.


Jack Lord helped conceive Hawaii Five-O and starred for its 12 seasons as Detective Stephen McGarrett, appointed by the Governor to head the (fictional) State Police criminal investigation department in Honolulu, Hawaii.[25] The opening sequence includes a shot of Lord standing on a penthouse balcony of The Ilikai hotel. Chin Ho Kelly,[26] the name of the police detective played by Kam Fong, was a tip-of-the-hat to Ilikai developer Chinn Ho. Lord's catchphrase, "Book 'em, Danno!",[25] became a part of pop culture. He was instrumental in the casting of native Hawaiians, instead of mainland actors.[25] Lord insisted his character drive Ford vehicles; McGarrett drove a 1967 Mercury Park Lane in the pilot, a 1968 Park Lane from 1968–1974, and a 1974 Mercury Marquis for the remainder of the series (this very car was shown in the 2010 remake).[27] Lord was a perfectionist. At the airing of its last episode, Hawaii Five-O was the longest-running cop show in television history.
When series creator Leonard Freeman died in 1974, the show's ownership was shared among Lord, CBS and Freeman's estate,[25] with a contract that made Lord executive producer and gave him complete control over content. He was a hands-on partner who paid attention to minute details,[8] and was known for battles with network executives.
Artist[edit]
During his years at NYU, Lord and his brother Bill opened the Village Academy of Arts.[2] Jack's childhood dream was to become an artist. His first professional sale was in 1941 to the Metropolitan Museum of Art for his two linoleum cuts, entitled Vermont and Fishing Shacks, Block Island.[1]
Personal life[edit]
Lord's first marriage to Anne Willard ended in divorce in 1947.[1] Lord met his son (from his first marriage) only once when the boy was an infant. The boy was later killed in an accident at age 13.[27]
Jack met his second wife while house hunting in upstate New York.[28] On January 17, 1949, Lord married Marie de Narde,[2] who gave up her career in fashion design to devote her life to him. Marie designed Lord's off-camera wardrobe, as well as her own.
Lord was a chain-smoker who failed at traditional methods of quitting. According to Lord, it was his faith in God which broke his habit.[8] Lord and a friend visited a Catholic church where both knelt while Lord promised God he would stop smoking.
Lord was known for being a cultured man who loved reading poetry out loud on the set of his television show and for being reclusive[8] at his Honolulu home.
Popular culture[edit]
Cinematographers sometimes refer to a 50mm lens ("5-0") as a "Jack Lord" in reference to the name of the show that made him famous.[29]
Actress Traci Lords chose that stage name because she was a fan of his character in Hawaii 5-0.[30]
Death[edit]
After his series ended in 1980, Lord kept a low profile, rarely making public appearances. His final TV appearance was that same year in a failed pilot for a new CBS series called M Station: Hawaii which he also directed. Lord suffered from Alzheimer's disease for seven years before his death.[31][32] He died of congestive heart failure at his home in Honolulu, on January 21, 1998, at age 77, leaving an estate of $40 million. He was a philanthropist and the entire estate went to Hawaiian charities upon his wife Marie's death in 2005.[33]
Lord's passing was not widely covered by the media; accordingly, Randy Cassingham used this as the start of his Honorary Unsubscribe featurette in his online newsletter This is True.[34]
Memorial[edit]
A bronze bust of Lord by Hawaii sculptor Lynn Weiler Liverton was unveiled in a ceremony at the Kahala Mall on June 19, 2004. The Lords lived in a condominium in the Kahala area, and they were known to frequent the neighborhood mall. The nonprofit Jack Lord Memorial Fund, which raised the money for the memorial, was co-chaired by British Hawaii Five-O fan Esperanza Isaac and Lord's co-star Doug Mossman.[35][36]

Early years[edit]
Born in Brooklyn, New York, Lord was the son of Irish-American parents. His father, William Lawrence Ryan, was a steamship company executive.[1] He grew up in Morris Park[2] (now known as Richmond Hill), Queens, New York.
Young Lord developed his equestrian skills on his mother's fruit farm[3] in the Hudson River Valley. He started spending summers at sea, and from the decks of cargo ships[4] painted and sketched the landscapes he encountered—Africa, the Mediterranean and China. He was educated at St. Benedict Joseph Labre School,[2] John Adams High School, in Ozone Park, New York, and the United States Merchant Marine Academy,[5] then located at Fort Trumbull in New London, Connecticut, graduating as an Ensign[6] with a Third Mates License. He attended New York University (NYU) on a football scholarship,[1][4] and earned a degree in Fine Arts.
He spent the first year of the United States' involvement in World War II with the United States Army Corps of Engineers, building bridges in Persia.[2] He returned to the Merchant Marine [7] as an Able Seaman before enrolling in the deck officer course at Fort Trumbull. While making maritime training films, he took to the idea of acting.
Career[edit]
Lord received theatrical training from Sanford Meisner[8] at the Neighborhood Playhouse.[9] He worked first as a car salesman[3] for Horgan Ford, then later as a Cadillac salesman in New York to fund his studies. Later he studied at the Actors Studio.[10]
His Broadway debut was as Slim Murphy in Horton Foote's The Traveling Lady with Kim Stanley.[11][12] The show ran for 30 performances, October 27, 1954 through November 20, 1954. Lord won the Theatre World Award[13] for his performance. Lord was then cast as Brick[14] in a replacement for Ben Gazzara in the 1955–1956 production of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.[15] He had been in The Little Hut (his first play), The Illegitimist, and The Savage.
His first commercial film role was in the 1949 film[9] The Red Menace a.k.a. Project X, an anti-Communist production. He was associate producer in his 1950 film Cry Murder. In 1957, Lord starred in Williamsburg: the Story of a Patriot,[16] which has run daily at Colonial Williamsburg since then. In 1958, Lord co-starred as Buck Walden in God's Little Acre,[17] the film adaptation of Erskine Caldwell's 1933 novel.
Lord was the first actor to play the character Felix Leiter[18] in the James Bond film series, introduced in the first Bond film, Dr. No. According to screenwriter Richard Maibaum, Lord demanded co-star billing, a bigger role and more money to reprise the role[19] in Goldfinger, which resulted in director Guy Hamilton casting Cec Linder in the role.
In 1962, Lord starred as series namesake Stoney Burke,[20] a rodeo cowboy from Mission Ridge, South Dakota. The basis for the series was real-life champion rodeo rider Casey Tibbs.[21] The series featured Warren Oates and Bruce Dern in recurring supporting roles. Lord credited Gary Cooper as his on-screen role model,[8] and the inspiration for his characterization of Stoney Burke.
Lord was considered for Eliot Ness in The Untouchables before Robert Stack won the role.[22] Ironically, he appeared in the Season One episode "The Jake Lingle Killing." In 1965 he guest-starred as Colonel 'Pres' Gallagher in second-season episode 5, "Big Brother" of 12 O-Clock High. Other television guest appearances include Appointment with Adventure, The Americans, Bonanza, The High Chaparral, Combat!, The Man from U.N.C.L.E., The Reporter starring Harry Guardino, The Fugitive, The Invaders, Rawhide, Ironside, and The F.B.I.
Lord appeared on the first episode of Have Gun, Will Travel. In 1968, Lord appeared with Susan Strasberg in the film The Name of the Game Is Kill.[23]
According to William Shatner,[24] in 1966, Gene Roddenberry offered Lord the role of Captain James T. Kirk on Star Trek, to replace Jeffrey Hunter, whose wife was making too many demands. Lord asked for 50 percent ownership of the show, so Roddenberry offered the role to Shatner.
Hawaii Five-O[edit]




Lord in 1974.


Jack Lord helped conceive Hawaii Five-O and starred for its 12 seasons as Detective Stephen McGarrett, appointed by the Governor to head the (fictional) State Police criminal investigation department in Honolulu, Hawaii.[25] The opening sequence includes a shot of Lord standing on a penthouse balcony of The Ilikai hotel. Chin Ho Kelly,[26] the name of the police detective played by Kam Fong, was a tip-of-the-hat to Ilikai developer Chinn Ho. Lord's catchphrase, "Book 'em, Danno!",[25] became a part of pop culture. He was instrumental in the casting of native Hawaiians, instead of mainland actors.[25] Lord insisted his character drive Ford vehicles; McGarrett drove a 1967 Mercury Park Lane in the pilot, a 1968 Park Lane from 1968–1974, and a 1974 Mercury Marquis for the remainder of the series (this very car was shown in the 2010 remake).[27] Lord was a perfectionist. At the airing of its last episode, Hawaii Five-O was the longest-running cop show in television history.
When series creator Leonard Freeman died in 1974, the show's ownership was shared among Lord, CBS and Freeman's estate,[25] with a contract that made Lord executive producer and gave him complete control over content. He was a hands-on partner who paid attention to minute details,[8] and was known for battles with network executives.
Artist[edit]
During his years at NYU, Lord and his brother Bill opened the Village Academy of Arts.[2] Jack's childhood dream was to become an artist. His first professional sale was in 1941 to the Metropolitan Museum of Art for his two linoleum cuts, entitled Vermont and Fishing Shacks, Block Island.[1]
Personal life[edit]
Lord's first marriage to Anne Willard ended in divorce in 1947.[1] Lord met his son (from his first marriage) only once when the boy was an infant. The boy was later killed in an accident at age 13.[27]
Jack met his second wife while house hunting in upstate New York.[28] On January 17, 1949, Lord married Marie de Narde,[2] who gave up her career in fashion design to devote her life to him. Marie designed Lord's off-camera wardrobe, as well as her own.
Lord was a chain-smoker who failed at traditional methods of quitting. According to Lord, it was his faith in God which broke his habit.[8] Lord and a friend visited a Catholic church where both knelt while Lord promised God he would stop smoking.
Lord was known for being a cultured man who loved reading poetry out loud on the set of his television show and for being reclusive[8] at his Honolulu home.
Popular culture[edit]
Cinematographers sometimes refer to a 50mm lens ("5-0") as a "Jack Lord" in reference to the name of the show that made him famous.[29]
Actress Traci Lords chose that stage name because she was a fan of his character in Hawaii 5-0.[30]
Death[edit]
After his series ended in 1980, Lord kept a low profile, rarely making public appearances. His final TV appearance was that same year in a failed pilot for a new CBS series called M Station: Hawaii which he also directed. Lord suffered from Alzheimer's disease for seven years before his death.[31][32] He died of congestive heart failure at his home in Honolulu, on January 21, 1998, at age 77, leaving an estate of $40 million. He was a philanthropist and the entire estate went to Hawaiian charities upon his wife Marie's death in 2005.[33]
Lord's passing was not widely covered by the media; accordingly, Randy Cassingham used this as the start of his Honorary Unsubscribe featurette in his online newsletter This is True.[34]
Memorial[edit]
A bronze bust of Lord by Hawaii sculptor Lynn Weiler Liverton was unveiled in a ceremony at the Kahala Mall on June 19, 2004. The Lords lived in a condominium in the Kahala area, and they were known to frequent the neighborhood mall. The nonprofit Jack Lord Memorial Fund, which raised the money for the memorial, was co-chaired by British Hawaii Five-O fan Esperanza Isaac and Lord's co-star Doug Mossman.[35][36]

Early years[edit]
Born in Brooklyn, New York, Lord was the son of Irish-American parents. His father, William Lawrence Ryan, was a steamship company executive.[1] He grew up in Morris Park[2] (now known as Richmond Hill), Queens, New York.
Young Lord developed his equestrian skills on his mother's fruit farm[3] in the Hudson River Valley. He started spending summers at sea, and from the decks of cargo ships[4] painted and sketched the landscapes he encountered—Africa, the Mediterranean and China. He was educated at St. Benedict Joseph Labre School,[2] John Adams High School, in Ozone Park, New York, and the United States Merchant Marine Academy,[5] then located at Fort Trumbull in New London, Connecticut, graduating as an Ensign[6] with a Third Mates License. He attended New York University (NYU) on a football scholarship,[1][4] and earned a degree in Fine Arts.
He spent the first year of the United States' involvement in World War II with the United States Army Corps of Engineers, building bridges in Persia.[2] He returned to the Merchant Marine [7] as an Able Seaman before enrolling in the deck officer course at Fort Trumbull. While making maritime training films, he took to the idea of acting.
Career[edit]
Lord received theatrical training from Sanford Meisner[8] at the Neighborhood Playhouse.[9] He worked first as a car salesman[3] for Horgan Ford, then later as a Cadillac salesman in New York to fund his studies. Later he studied at the Actors Studio.[10]
His Broadway debut was as Slim Murphy in Horton Foote's The Traveling Lady with Kim Stanley.[11][12] The show ran for 30 performances, October 27, 1954 through November 20, 1954. Lord won the Theatre World Award[13] for his performance. Lord was then cast as Brick[14] in a replacement for Ben Gazzara in the 1955–1956 production of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.[15] He had been in The Little Hut (his first play), The Illegitimist, and The Savage.
His first commercial film role was in the 1949 film[9] The Red Menace a.k.a. Project X, an anti-Communist production. He was associate producer in his 1950 film Cry Murder. In 1957, Lord starred in Williamsburg: the Story of a Patriot,[16] which has run daily at Colonial Williamsburg since then. In 1958, Lord co-starred as Buck Walden in God's Little Acre,[17] the film adaptation of Erskine Caldwell's 1933 novel.
Lord was the first actor to play the character Felix Leiter[18] in the James Bond film series, introduced in the first Bond film, Dr. No. According to screenwriter Richard Maibaum, Lord demanded co-star billing, a bigger role and more money to reprise the role[19] in Goldfinger, which resulted in director Guy Hamilton casting Cec Linder in the role.
In 1962, Lord starred as series namesake Stoney Burke,[20] a rodeo cowboy from Mission Ridge, South Dakota. The basis for the series was real-life champion rodeo rider Casey Tibbs.[21] The series featured Warren Oates and Bruce Dern in recurring supporting roles. Lord credited Gary Cooper as his on-screen role model,[8] and the inspiration for his characterization of Stoney Burke.
Lord was considered for Eliot Ness in The Untouchables before Robert Stack won the role.[22] Ironically, he appeared in the Season One episode "The Jake Lingle Killing." In 1965 he guest-starred as Colonel 'Pres' Gallagher in second-season episode 5, "Big Brother" of 12 O-Clock High. Other television guest appearances include Appointment with Adventure, The Americans, Bonanza, The High Chaparral, Combat!, The Man from U.N.C.L.E., The Reporter starring Harry Guardino, The Fugitive, The Invaders, Rawhide, Ironside, and The F.B.I.
Lord appeared on the first episode of Have Gun, Will Travel. In 1968, Lord appeared with Susan Strasberg in the film The Name of the Game Is Kill.[23]
According to William Shatner,[24] in 1966, Gene Roddenberry offered Lord the role of Captain James T. Kirk on Star Trek, to replace Jeffrey Hunter, whose wife was making too many demands. Lord asked for 50 percent ownership of the show, so Roddenberry offered the role to Shatner.
Hawaii Five-O[edit]




Lord in 1974.


Jack Lord helped conceive Hawaii Five-O and starred for its 12 seasons as Detective Stephen McGarrett, appointed by the Governor to head the (fictional) State Police criminal investigation department in Honolulu, Hawaii.[25] The opening sequence includes a shot of Lord standing on a penthouse balcony of The Ilikai hotel. Chin Ho Kelly,[26] the name of the police detective played by Kam Fong, was a tip-of-the-hat to Ilikai developer Chinn Ho. Lord's catchphrase, "Book 'em, Danno!",[25] became a part of pop culture. He was instrumental in the casting of native Hawaiians, instead of mainland actors.[25] Lord insisted his character drive Ford vehicles; McGarrett drove a 1967 Mercury Park Lane in the pilot, a 1968 Park Lane from 1968–1974, and a 1974 Mercury Marquis for the remainder of the series (this very car was shown in the 2010 remake).[27] Lord was a perfectionist. At the airing of its last episode, Hawaii Five-O was the longest-running cop show in television history.
When series creator Leonard Freeman died in 1974, the show's ownership was shared among Lord, CBS and Freeman's estate,[25] with a contract that made Lord executive producer and gave him complete control over content. He was a hands-on partner who paid attention to minute details,[8] and was known for battles with network executives.
Artist[edit]
During his years at NYU, Lord and his brother Bill opened the Village Academy of Arts.[2] Jack's childhood dream was to become an artist. His first professional sale was in 1941 to the Metropolitan Museum of Art for his two linoleum cuts, entitled Vermont and Fishing Shacks, Block Island.[1]
Personal life[edit]
Lord's first marriage to Anne Willard ended in divorce in 1947.[1] Lord met his son (from his first marriage) only once when the boy was an infant. The boy was later killed in an accident at age 13.[27]
Jack met his second wife while house hunting in upstate New York.[28] On January 17, 1949, Lord married Marie de Narde,[2] who gave up her career in fashion design to devote her life to him. Marie designed Lord's off-camera wardrobe, as well as her own.
Lord was a chain-smoker who failed at traditional methods of quitting. According to Lord, it was his faith in God which broke his habit.[8] Lord and a friend visited a Catholic church where both knelt while Lord promised God he would stop smoking.
Lord was known for being a cultured man who loved reading poetry out loud on the set of his television show and for being reclusive[8] at his Honolulu home.
Popular culture[edit]
Cinematographers sometimes refer to a 50mm lens ("5-0") as a "Jack Lord" in reference to the name of the show that made him famous.[29]
Actress Traci Lords chose that stage name because she was a fan of his character in Hawaii 5-0.[30]
Death[edit]
After his series ended in 1980, Lord kept a low profile, rarely making public appearances. His final TV appearance was that same year in a failed pilot for a new CBS series called M Station: Hawaii which he also directed. Lord suffered from Alzheimer's disease for seven years before his death.[31][32] He died of congestive heart failure at his home in Honolulu, on January 21, 1998, at age 77, leaving an estate of $40 million. He was a philanthropist and the entire estate went to Hawaiian charities upon his wife Marie's death in 2005.[33]
Lord's passing was not widely covered by the media; accordingly, Randy Cassingham used this as the start of his Honorary Unsubscribe featurette in his online newsletter This is True.[34]
Memorial[edit]
A bronze bust of Lord by Hawaii sculptor Lynn Weiler Liverton was unveiled in a ceremony at the Kahala Mall on June 19, 2004. The Lords lived in a condominium in the Kahala area, and they were known to frequent the neighborhood mall. The nonprofit Jack Lord Memorial Fund, which raised the money for the memorial, was co-chaired by British Hawaii Five-O fan Esperanza Isaac and Lord's co-star Doug Mossman.[35][36]

About Jack Lord


Brooklyn-born actor John Joseph Patrick Ryan borrowed his stage name "Jack Lord" from a distant relative. Despite his training at the prestigious Actors Studio and a long film career, he is best remembered for playing tough, hair-heavy cop Steve McGarrett on the TV drama Hawaii Five-O. The show, with its brassy theme song, ran on CBS from 1968 to 1980 and continues in reruns. 
Spending his immediate post-college years as a seafaring man, Lord worked as an engineer in Persia before returning to American shores to manage a Greenwich Village art school and paint original work; he flourished within that sphere (often signing his paintings "John J. Ryan,") and in fact exhibited the tableaux at an array of prestigious institutions including the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Modern Museum of Art. 
Lord switched to acting in the late 1940s, studying under Sanford Meisner  at New York's Neighborhood Playhouse. In films and television from 1949, Lord (a performer with stark features including deep-set eyes and high cheekbones) played his share of brutish villains and working stiffs before gaining TV fame as star of the critically acclaimed but low-rated rodeo series Stoney Burke (1962).
At around the same time, Lord played CIA agent Felix Leiter in the first James Bond film, Dr. No. From 1968 through 1980, Lord starred on the weekly cop drama Hawaii Five-O; producers cast him as Steve McGarrett, a troubleshooter with the Hawaii State Police who spent his days cruising around the islands, cracking open individual cases, and taking on the movers and shakers in Hawaiian organized crime, particularly gangster Wo Fat (Khigh Dhiegh), who eluded capture until the program's final month on the air. Lord also wrote and directed several episodes. After Hawaii 5-0 folded, Lord attempted another Hawaii-based TV series, but M Station: Hawaii (1980) never got any farther than a pilot film. 
Lord died of congestive heart failure in his Honolulu beachfront home at the age of 77, in January 1998. 
He was married to Marie Denarde for 50 years but had no children.

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
