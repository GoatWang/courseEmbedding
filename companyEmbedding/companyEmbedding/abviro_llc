You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

It's amazing what three letters can do.
Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

This season, swimwear is brighter and bolder than ever. With a variety of prints, colours and shapes available, our swimwear pieces are perfect for every getaway. From bikinis to one pieces, our curated collections will ensure effortless style wherever you're headed.







TOP STYLING TIPS


"Invest as much time and energy into finding your swimwear as you would your lingerie, whatever your shape" - Alexandra, Lingerie Stylist


Matching prints balance attention equally between your top and bottom halves, giving you the perfect proportions.


To gently care for your swimwear, be sure to hand wash with our rinse-free Soak formula to keep delicates looking brand new.


As well as being super fun and eye-catching, prints actually help to deflect from problem areas so can be incredibly flattering too! Designs with printed tops balance your figure and draw attention to your upper half.




SWIMWEAR: THE TREND EDIT




BLOCK COLOURS
Colour is back this season - the brighter the better! Choose a colour that will suit your complexion and then experiment with different shapes.

» ANDRES SARDA MAGDA
» PRIMADONNA SWIMSHERRY

PRINT FEVER
Prints are always a swimwear winner and this season, inspiration has been taken from the jungle, aztec patterns and tropical florals.

» PRIMADONNA SWIMBOSSA NOVA
» PRIMADONNA SWIMCHA CHA

SHOW STOPPERS
Achieve that wow-factor with these show stopping pieces. Think deep plunges, slinky shapes and serious detailing.
