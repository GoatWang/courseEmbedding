Enabling smart employers to help theiremployees build a brighter future.

retirement plans










 
retirement plans for profits and non-profits
WE HELP YOU BE GOOD STEWARDS OF YOUR MONEY
 



trustedadvisors
TRUTINA OFFERS FIDUCIARY SERVICES THAT PROTECT BUSINESS OWNERS.


we meetone-on-one
WE PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL PLANNING TO YOUR EMPLOYEES AT LIKELY THE SAME COST (OR LESS) OF WHAT YOU'RE CURRENTLY PAYING.


win-winfor all
A POSITIVE, PROACTIVE 401(K) EXPERIENCE FOR YOUR EMPLOYEES HELPS YOU RETAIN GOOD PEOPLE AND IMPROVES THEIR FUTURE OUTLOOK.



 
employee retirement plans
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE POWER OF ONE!
 



+small, do-able stepsthat lead to a moresecure future.
(LET'S GET STARTED!)


+LITTLE HABITS REALLY CAN YIELD BIG RESULTSWe'll show you how. Trutina helps you take control of your future. Using "the Power of One," you'll be amazed at what you can do, day-to-day to remove the doubts. Make a difference. And have a clear savings path to follow.
FOR ANYTHING WITH A DOLLAR SIGN IN FRONT OF IT...TRUTINA CAN HELP.Whatever defines "you," we can help show you ways to attain it. Trutina offers a safe place to talk, along with simple strategies to help you reach your life goals.





RETIREMENT PLANS PROVIDE A POWERFUL INCENTIVE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALITY PEOPLETrutina is a proven expert with a strong track record of getting employees on board. Trutina "gets it" and offers smart, creative ways to encourage participation and make your entire organization look good.
We make it easy to access the information you need regarding recent tax rules and other key insights.
Using the latest technology, Trutina gives you powerful tools to track, manage and securely share files.
Throughout the year, Trutina meets with your management team to review how your plan is achieving the goals originally established.
 
EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT CARE PACKAGEOnce a year, Trutina connects with your employees to support their retirement efforts and track their progress. Normally, these people don’t have access to the insights a retirement planner can offer. With Trutina, they get that personal touch.
Every year, we connect in person for an on-site group meeting.
Our annual program provides a step by step guide for employees to be successful.
This motivational get-together sparks interest, commitment and action.
From that, Trutina meets individually with interested employees.
 
OUR UNIQUE POINT OF VIEW
We know what a 401(k) can be - and deliver on that promise.
In our experience, most plans are not managed as well as they could be.
We fill the void to help you make the best choices and most of your plan.
We take a hard-to-quantify (and not very compelling) benefit and turn it into something your people thank you for.
 



+MATCHING PLANS:
WHATEVER AMOUNT YOUR EMPLOYER PITCHES IN FOR YOUR PARTICULAR PLAN IS FREE MONEY.It's like getting a raise, without having to ask.
Your employer matches a percentage of your contribution.
Getting on board with a plan today makes it easier to pay your bills tomorrow.
The taxes you don't pay now are deferred to when you retire when your rates will likely be lower.
Trutina will walk with you every step of the way.



+who said there'sno such thing asa free dollar?
