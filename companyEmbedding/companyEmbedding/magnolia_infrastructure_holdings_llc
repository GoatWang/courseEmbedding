ACTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE

2.1.    
Distribution Financial Support to AMID .

(a)    The
Supporting Party hereby acknowledges and agrees, that if the LP
Merger is consummated, to provide financial support to AMID, as
necessary, commencing with (i) the regular quarterly distribution
for the quarter ending March 31, 2017 or (ii) if the Effective Time
occurs after such time that the quarterly distribution for the
quarter ending March 31, 2017 is determined or paid, the quarterly
distribution for the quarter immediately following the Effective
Time, (such distribution date, the “ Commencement
Date ”), and ending with the regular quarterly
distribution for the 8th quarter following the Commencement Date,
in an aggregate amount not to exceed $25.0 million (the “
Cap ”), such that, subject to the Cap and the
provisions of Section 2.1(b) , AMID will have LP DCF per
Unit (as defined in Exhibit A ) during the eight (8)
consecutive quarters following the Commencement Date (the “
Support Period ”) equal to the amounts set
forth on Exhibit A (each, a “ Target DCF per
Unit ”).

(b)    As soon
as practicable, and in any event within 20 days, following the
completion of each calendar quarter during the Support Period, AMID
shall determine the LP DCF per Unit for such quarter, the Support
DCF Per Unit, and the difference, if any (such difference, the
“ DCF per Unit Difference ”), of (i) the
Target DCF per Unit for such quarter set forth in Exhibit A
less (ii) the LP DCF per Unit in respect of such quarter. The
DCF per Unit Difference shall be multiplied by the number of Units
outstanding, as such number of Units is determined pursuant to
Exhibit A , as of the end of such quarter (such product, the
“ DCF Difference ”). For any quarter
in which the DCF Difference is negative, such negative amount(s)
shall be reserved for use as credits against support obligations of
the Supporting Party for future quarters during the Support Period
(such unused credits, the “ DCF Credits
”). For any quarter in which the DCF Difference less any
previously unused DCF Credits is positive, subject to the Cap, the
Supporting Party shall provide support sufficient to eliminate such
shortfall (the amount of such shortfall, the “
Shortfall Amount ”). Not later than 30
days after the end of each calendar quarter of the Support Period,
AMID shall provide notice in writing to the Supporting Party of the
LP DCF per Unit and the Shortfall Amount, if any, or DCF Credits,
if any, for such calendar quarter, together with supporting
financial information. No later than two (2) business days
before the day on which the quarterly financial statements of AMID
are to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the
applicable calendar quarter of the Support Period, the Supporting

(a)    Magnolia

expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation, execution and
performance of the Merger Agreement and consummation of the

the amounts and descriptions of all expenses for which

requirements of Section 2.1 , Section 2.2 or
Section 2.3 by such other methods as AMID and the Supporting
Party determine to be appropriate.

be necessary or appropriate to eliminate (by payment in full,
cancellation or otherwise) all outstanding indebtedness of JPE GP
to the Supporting Party or any of its Affiliates, and after giving
effect to such elimination there shall be no further liability
(including any tax liability arising from such elimination) or
obligation of JPE GP (or its successors, including AMID Merger Sub
GP or AMID GP following consummation of the GP Merger) as a result
of such elimination. The Supporting Party shall make available
to AMID GP, upon its reasonable request, any and all supporting
documentation in connection with its or its Affiliates performance
of the obligations set forth in this Section 2.4

American Midstream Partners Announces Successful Completion Of Merger With JP Energy Partners






Business Wire




Mar 8, 2017 9:09 AM EST













 


















































  American Midstream Partners, LP (NYSE:AMID) ("American Midstream" or "Partnership") and JP Energy Partners LP (NYSE: JPEP) ("JP Energy") today announced the successful completion of the previously announced merger.  At a special meeting of JP Energy unitholders held on March 7, 2017, a majority of the JP Energy unitholders other than certain affiliates voted in favor of the agreement governing the merger.  American Midstream is now a larger, more diversified midstream business operating in leading North American basins, including the Permian, Gulf of Mexico, Eagle Ford, East Texas and Bakken. The merged Partnership and its unitholders will benefit from significantly improved scale and financial flexibility to invest in growth projects, third-party acquisitions and potential drop downs from affiliates of ArcLight Capital Partners, LLC ("ArcLight"), while establishing a path to future distribution growth.  "Through this merger, American Midstream will emerge as a stronger company with higher growth, new business opportunities and a stronger financial position," said Lynn L. Bourdon, President and Chief Executive Officer of American Midstream. "This merger allows us to expand our service offerings from the well-head to the end user market. The combined company will have an enhanced growth strategy by offering customers a more comprehensive and competitive suite of services that enables us to capture incremental fee opportunities that strengthen margins and maximize returns to our unitholders."  Immediately prior to the completion of the merger, the general partner of JP Energy merged with the general partner of American Midstream with the general partner of American Midstream continuing in its current form.  Upon market open, JP Energy will cease to be a publicly-traded partnership and its common units will now trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker AMID.  Each JP Energy common unit and each JP Energy subordinated unit not held by Magnolia Infrastructure Holdings, LLC (together with its affiliates, the "Affiliated Holders"), were converted into 0.5775 American Midstream common units, and each JP Energy common unit and each JP Energy subordinated unit held by the Affiliated Holders were converted into 0.5225 American Midstream common units. Based on the JP Energy units outstanding, American Midstream issued approximately 20.2 million of its common units to existing JP Energy unitholders.
