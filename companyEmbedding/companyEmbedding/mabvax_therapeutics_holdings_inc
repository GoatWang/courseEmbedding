About
Developing Therapies from the Protective Human Immune Response to Cancer
MabVax Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biotechnology company with a fully human antibody discovery platform focused on the clinical development of products to address unmet medical needs for the treatment of cancer. Our antibody HuMab-5B1, is a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets sialyl Lewis A (sLea), an epitope on CA19-9. CA19-9 is expressed in over 90% of pancreatic cancer (PDAC) and in other diseases including small cell lung, colon and other GI cancers. HuMab-5B1 when used as a therapeutic agent, designated as MVT-5873, has been studied in patients with pancreatic cancer and other CA19-9 positive tumors. MVT-5873 has recently completed a monotherapy Phase 1a clinical trial in 32 patients. The HuMab-5B1 antibody coupled with a PET imaging agent, designated as MVT-2163, has recently completed a 12 patient Phase 1a clinical trial as well. With our collaborators including Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Rockefeller University, Sarah Cannon Research Institute, HonorHealth and Imaging Endpoints, we have treated 50 patients with either our therapeutic antibody (MVT-5873) or our PET imaging diagnostic product (MVT-2163), and demonstrated early safety, specificity for the target and a potential efficacy signal. Data from these two studies have accelerated development of the Company's Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) product, designated as MVT-1075, and patient dosing in a Phase 1 clinical study has commenced for our lead development program which combines the targeting specificity of the HuMab-5B1 antibody with the clinically proven potency of a radionuclide.
Identifying and Recovering the Right Antibodies
We study the protective immune response created by repeated vaccination of cancer patients. Our antibody discovery technology is able to identify and recover the antibodies patients have made from vaccines administered to patients against their cancers. We search for the very best antibodies made, from any patient receiving the vaccine and the best antibody can become our monoclonal antibody development candidate.
Proprietary approach to the discovery and development of novel fully human antibody therapy and diagnostic agents

MabVax Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. Key Developments

MabVax Therapeutics Commences Patient Dosing in MVT-1075 Radioimmunotherapy Phase 1 Clinical Trial for the Treatment of Pancreatic, Colon and Lung Cancers
Jun 27 17
MabVax Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. announced that the first patient has been dosed in the Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating MVT-1075, the Company's fully human antibody radioimmunotherapy (RIT), for the treatment of CA19-9 positive malignancies including pancreatic, colon and lung cancers. This Phase 1 first-in-human clinical trial is an open-label, multi-center study evaluating the safety and efficacy of MVT-1075 in up to 22 patients with CA19-9 positive malignancies in the U.S. The primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose and safety profile in patients with recurring disease who have failed prior therapies. Secondary endpoints are to evaluate tumor response rate and duration of response by RECIST 1.1, and to determine dosimetry and pharmacokinetics. This dose-escalation study utilizes a traditional 3+3 design. The investigative sites will include Honor Health in Scottsdale, Arizona and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City.


MabVax Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. Reports Results from Phase 1 Clinical Trial of ImmunoPET Imaging Agent, MVT-2163, for Patients with Locally Advanced or Metastatic Adenocarcinoma of the Pancreas (PDAC) or Other CA19-9 Positive Malignancies
Jun 14 17
MabVax Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. reported results from its Phase 1 clinical trial of its ImmunoPET imaging agent, MVT-2163, for patients with locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (PDAC) or other CA19-9 positive malignancies. Results from the Phase 1 clinical trial were presented in a poster session and podium talk at the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (SNMMI) Annual Meeting held in Denver, COJune 10-14, 2017. To date, twelve patients have been treated in this first-in-human trial evaluating the safety and feasibility of MVT-2163 to image pancreatic tumors and other CA19-9 positive malignancies. MVT-2163 was administered alone and in combination with MVT-5873, and was well tolerated in all cohorts. The only toxicities were infusion reactions that resolved on the day of the injection, with some requiring supportive medication. Uptake of MVT-2163 was observed in primary tumors and metastases as early as day 2 and continuously through day 7. Standard Uptake Values (SUV), a measurement of activity in PET imaging, reached as high as 101 in the study. The investigators reported that the high SUV is amongst the highest lesion uptake they have ever seen for a radiolabeled antibody. Bone and soft tissue disease were readily visualized and lesion uptake of the radiotracer was higher than typically seen with PET imaging agents. The correlation with Computerized Tomography (CT) scans was high. Results showed that MVT-5873 cold antibody pre-dose reduces liver SUV facilitating detection of liver metastases. In addition, the MVT-5873 cold antibody pre-dose does not interfere with the uptake of MVT-2163 on cancer lesions.


Mabvax Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. Signs Research Agreement with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to Develop Novel CAR T-Cell Based Anti-Cancer Immunotherapies for Treatment of Pancreatic and Small Cell Lung Cancers
May 31 17
MabVax Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. announced that it has entered into a sponsored research agreement with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) for the development of novel Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapeutics using antibody targeting sequences derived from MabVax's fully-human antibodies for pancreatic, small cell lung, and other solid tumor cancers. CAR T-cell therapeutics are unique anti-cancer immunotherapies that genetically modify a patient's own T-cells to recognize an antigen on targeted tumor cells. Under the new agreement, MabVax will provide funding to evaluate the efficacy of multiple CAR T-cell products incorporating several different antibody targeting sequences. The research program will evaluate in xenograft models of pancreatic and small cell lung cancer targeting sequences from MabVax's leading monoclonal antibody clinical development candidate HuMab-5B1. Multiple CAR T-cell constructs have been created and tested in cell based assays demonstrating utility and warranting continued testing in animal models of pancreatic cancer and other CA19-9 expressing tumors.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.
