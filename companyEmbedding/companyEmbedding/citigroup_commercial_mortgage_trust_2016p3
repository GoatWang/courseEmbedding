in the Mortgage Loans and the Other Loans will be issued by the trust fund (the �Trust Fund�). In exchange for

�
The Purchaser and the
Seller wish to prescribe the manner of sale of the Mortgage Loans from the Seller to the Purchaser and in consideration of the
premises and the mutual agreements hereinafter set forth, agree as follows:
�
SECTION 1�����Sale and Conveyance of Mortgages; Possession of Mortgage File. The Seller does hereby sell, transfer, assign, set
over and convey to the Purchaser, without recourse, representation or warranty (except as otherwise specifically set forth herein),
subject to the rights of the holders of interests in any related Companion Loan, all of its right, title and interest in and to
the Mortgage Loans identified on Exhibit A to this Agreement (the �Mortgage Loan Schedule�) including
all interest and principal received or receivable on or with respect to the Mortgage Loans after the Cut-Off Date (and, in any
event, excluding payments of principal and interest and other amounts due and payable on the Mortgage Loans on or before the Cut-Off
Date and excluding any Retained Defeasance Rights and Obligations with respect to the Mortgage Loans). Upon the sale of the Mortgage
Loans, the ownership of each related Note, the Seller�s interest in the related Mortgage represented by the Note and the
other contents of the related Mortgage File (subject to the rights of the holders of interests in any related Companion Loan) will
be vested in the Purchaser and immediately thereafter the Trustee, and the ownership of records and documents with respect to each
Mortgage Loan (other than those to be held by the holder of any related Companion Loan) prepared by or which come into the possession
of the Seller shall (subject to the rights of the holders of interests in any related Companion Loan) immediately vest in the Purchaser
and immediately thereafter the Trustee. In connection with
�


�
�
�
the
transfer pursuant to this Section�1 of any Mortgage Loan that is part of a Loan Combination, the Seller does hereby assign
to the Purchaser all of its rights, title and interest (solely in its capacity as the holder of the subject Mortgage Loan) in,
to and under the related Co-Lender Agreement (it being understood and agreed that the Seller does not assign any right, title
or interest that it or any other party may have thereunder in its capacity as the holder of any related Companion Loan, if applicable).
The Seller�s assignment of any Outside Serviced Mortgage Loan is subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable Outside
Servicing Agreement and the related Co-Lender Agreement. The Purchaser will sell certain of the Certificates (the �Public
Certificates�) to the underwriters (the �Underwriters�) specified in the Underwriting Agreement,
dated as of March 29, 2016 (the �Underwriting Agreement�), between the Purchaser and the Underwriters, and
the Purchaser will sell certain of the Certificates (the �Private Certificates�) to the initial purchasers
(the �Initial Purchasers� and, collectively with the Underwriters, the �Dealers�) specified
in the Purchase Agreement, dated as of March 29, 2016 (the �Certificate Purchase Agreement�), between the Purchaser
and Initial Purchasers.
�
The sale and conveyance
of the Mortgage Loans is being conducted on an arms-length basis and upon commercially reasonable terms. As the purchase price
for the Mortgage Loans, the Purchaser shall pay, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to the Seller or at the Seller�s
direction that sum set forth in the funding schedule executed by the Seller and the Purchaser relating to the sale of the Mortgage
Loans contemplated hereby (but subject to certain post-settlement adjustment for expenses incurred by the Underwriters and the
Initial Purchasers on behalf of the Depositor and for which the Seller is specifically responsible).
�
The purchase and sale
of the Mortgage Loans shall take place on the Closing Date.
�
SECTION 2�����Books and Records; Certain Funds Received After the Cut-Off Date. From and after the sale of the Mortgage Loans to
the Purchaser, record title to each Mortgage (other than with respect to any Outside Serviced Mortgage Loan) and each Note shall
be transferred to the Trustee subject to and in accordance with this Agreement. Any funds due after the Cut-Off Date in connection
with a Mortgage Loan received by the Seller shall be held in trust on behalf of the Trustee (for the benefit of the Certificateholders)
as the owner of such Mortgage Loan and shall be transferred promptly to the Certificate Administrator. All scheduled payments of
principal and interest due on or before the Cut-Off Date but collected after the Cut-Off Date, and all recoveries and payments
of principal and interest collected on or before the Cut-Off Date (only in respect of principal and interest on the Mortgage Loans
due on or before the Cut-Off Date and principal prepayments thereon), shall belong to, and shall be promptly remitted to, the Seller.
�
The transfer of each
Mortgage Loan shall be reflected on the Seller�s balance sheets and other financial statements as the sale of such Mortgage
Loan by the Seller to the Purchaser. The Seller intends to treat the transfer of each Mortgage Loan to the Purchaser as a sale
for tax purposes. Following the transfer of the Mortgage Loans by the Seller to the Purchaser, the Seller shall not take any actions
inconsistent with the ownership of the Mortgage Loans by the Purchaser and its assignees.
�


-2-
�
�
The transfer of each
Mortgage Loan shall be reflected on the Purchaser�s balance sheets and other financial statements as the purchase of such
Mortgage Loan by the Purchaser from the Seller. The Purchaser intends to treat the transfer of each Mortgage Loan from the Seller
as a purchase for tax purposes. The Purchaser shall be responsible for maintaining, and shall maintain, a set of records for each
Mortgage Loan which shall be clearly marked to reflect the transfer of ownership of each Mortgage Loan by the Seller to the Purchaser
pursuant to this Agreement.
�
SECTION 3�����Delivery of Mortgage Loan Documents; Additional Costs and Expenses. (a)��The Purchaser hereby directs the
Seller, and the Seller hereby agrees, such agreement effective upon the transfer of the Mortgage Loans as contemplated herein,
to deliver to and deposit with (or to cause to be delivered to and deposited with) the Custodian (on behalf of the Trustee), with
copies (other than with respect to an Outside Serviced Mortgage Loan) to be delivered to the Master Servicer, on the dates set
forth in Section�2.01 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, all documents, instruments and agreements required to be delivered
by the Purchaser, or contemplated to be delivered by the Seller (whether at the direction of the Purchaser or otherwise), to the
Custodian and the Master Servicer, with respect to the Mortgage Loans under Section�2.01 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement,
and meeting all the requirements of such Section�2.01 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement; provided that the Seller
shall not be required to deliver any draft documents, privileged or other related Seller communications, credit underwriting, due
diligence analyses or data, or internal worksheets, memoranda, communications or evaluations.
�

of credit (exclusive of those relating to an Outside Serviced Mortgage Loan), the Seller shall deliver to the Master Servicer,
and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement shall require the Master Servicer to hold, the original (or copy, if such original has
been submitted by the Seller to the issuing bank to effect an assignment or amendment of such letter of credit (changing the beneficiary
thereof to the Trustee (in care of the Master Servicer) for the benefit of Certificateholders and, if applicable, the related
Serviced Companion Loan Holder, to the extent required in order for the Master Servicer to draw on such letter of credit on behalf
of the Trustee for the benefit of Certificateholders and, if applicable, the related Serviced Companion Loan Holder in accordance
with the applicable terms thereof and/or of the related Loan Documents)) and the Seller shall be deemed to have satisfied any
such delivery requirements by delivering with respect to any letter(s) of credit a copy thereof to the Custodian together with
an Officer�s Certificate of the Seller certifying that such document has been delivered to the Master Servicer or an Officer�s
Certificate from the Master Servicer certifying that it holds the letter(s) of credit pursuant to Section 2.01(b) of the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement. If a letter of credit referred to in the previous sentence is not in a form that would allow
the Master Servicer to draw on such letter of credit on behalf of the Trustee for the benefit of Certificateholders and, if applicable,
the related Serviced Companion Loan Holder in accordance with the applicable terms thereof and/or of the related Loan Documents,
the Seller shall deliver the appropriate assignment or amendment documents (or copies of such assignment or amendment documents
if the Seller has submitted the originals to the related issuer of such letter of credit for processing) to the Master Servicer
within 90�days of the Closing Date. The Seller shall pay any costs of assignment or amendment of such letter(s) of credit
required in order for the Master Servicer to draw on such letter(s) of credit on behalf of the Trustee for the benefit of Certificateholders
and, if applicable, the related Serviced Companion Loan Holder,

and

effectuating a draw under any such letter of credit prior to the date such letter of credit is assigned or amended in order that
it may be drawn by the Master Servicer on behalf of the Trustee for the benefit of Certificateholders and, if applicable, the
related Serviced Companion Loan Holder.
�
(b)�����������Except
with respect to any Outside Serviced Mortgage Loan, the Seller shall deliver to and deposit with (or cause to be delivered to
and deposited with)�the Master Servicer within five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date: (i) a copy of the Mortgage

Loans or for evidencing or enforcing any of the rights of the holder of the Mortgage Loans or any related Serviced Companion Loans
or holders of interests therein, and (C) are in the possession or under the control of the Seller; and (iii) all unapplied Escrow
Payments and reserve funds in the possession or under control of the Seller that relate to the Mortgage Loans and any related
Serviced Companion Loans together with a statement indicating which Escrow Payments and reserve funds are allocable to each Mortgage
Loan or any related Serviced Companion Loan; provided that copies of any document in the Mortgage File and any other document,
record or item referred to above in this sentence that, in each case, constitutes a Designated Servicing Document shall be delivered
to the Master Servicer on or before the Closing Date; and provided, further, that the Seller shall not be required
to deliver any draft documents, privileged or other related Seller communications, credit underwriting, due diligence analyses
or data, or internal worksheets, memoranda, communications or evaluations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section�3(b) shall not apply to any Outside Serviced Mortgage Loan.
�

by the applicable comfort letter), provide any such required notice or make any such required request to the related franchisor
for the transfer or assignment of such comfort letter or issuance of a new comfort letter (or any such new document or acknowledgement
as may be contemplated under the existing comfort letter), with a copy of such notice or request to the Custodian (who shall include
such document in the related Mortgage File) and the Master Servicer, and the Master Servicer shall use reasonable efforts in accordance

�
SECTION 4�����Treatment as a Security Agreement. Pursuant to Section�1 hereof, the Seller has conveyed to the Purchaser
all of its right, title and interest in and to the Mortgage Loans. The parties intend that such conveyance of the Seller�s
right, title and interest in and to the Mortgage Loans pursuant to this Agreement shall constitute a purchase and sale and not
a loan. If such conveyance is deemed to be a pledge and not a sale, then the parties also intend and agree that the Seller shall
be deemed to have granted, and in such event does hereby grant, to the Purchaser, a first priority security interest in all of
its right, title and interest in, to and under the Mortgage Loans, all payments of principal or interest on such Mortgage Loans
due after the Cut-Off Date, all other payments made in respect of such Mortgage Loans after the Cut-Off Date (and, in any event,
excluding scheduled payments of principal and interest due on or before the Cut-Off Date) and all proceeds thereof, and that this
Agreement shall constitute a security agreement under applicable law. If such conveyance is deemed to be a pledge and not a sale,
the Seller consents to the Purchaser hypothecating and transferring such security interest in favor of the Trustee and transferring
the obligation secured thereby to the Trustee.
�
SECTION 5������Covenants of the Seller. The Seller covenants with the Purchaser as follows:
�
(a)�����������with respect to the Mortgage Loans (other than any Outside Serviced Mortgage Loan), it shall record and file, or cause a
third party on its behalf to record and file, in the appropriate public recording office for real property records or UCC financing
statements, as appropriate, each related assignment of Mortgage and assignment of Assignment of Leases, and each related UCC-3
financing statement referred to in the definition of Mortgage File, in each case in favor of the Trustee, as and to the extent
contemplated under Section�2.01(c) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, as soon as reasonably possible and in any event
within 120 days after the later of (i) the Closing Date and (ii) the date on which all recording information necessary to complete
the subject documents is received by the Seller. All out of pocket costs and expenses relating to the recordation or filing of
such assignments of Assignment of Leases, assignments of Mortgage and financing statements shall be paid by (or caused to be paid
by) the Seller. If any such document or instrument is lost or returned unrecorded or unfiled, as the case may be, because of a
defect therein, then the Seller shall promptly prepare or cause the preparation of a substitute therefor or cure such defect or
cause such defect to be cured, as the case may be, and the Seller shall record or file, or cause the recording or filing of, such
substitute or corrected document or instrument, or with respect to any assignments that a third party on the Seller�s behalf
has agreed to record or file as described in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Seller shall deliver such substitute or corrected
document or instrument to such third party (or, if the Mortgage Loan is then no longer subject to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement,
the then holder of such Mortgage Loan);
�
(b)�����������as to each Mortgage Loan (except with respect to any Outside Serviced Mortgage Loan), if the Seller cannot deliver or cause
to be delivered the documents and/or instruments referred to in clauses (2), (3), (6) (if recorded) and (15) of the definition
of �Mortgage File� in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement solely because of a delay caused by the public recording
or filing office where such document or instrument has been delivered for recordation or filing, as applicable, it shall forward
to the Custodian a copy of the original certified by the Seller or the title agent to be a true and complete copy of the original
thereof submitted for recording. The Seller shall cause each assignment referred to in Section (5)(a)
�


-5-
�
�
above
that is recorded and the file copy of each UCC-3 assignment referred to in Section (5)(a) above to reflect that it should
be returned by the public recording or filing office to the Custodian or its agent following recording (or, alternatively, to
the Seller or its designee, in which case the Seller shall deliver or cause the delivery of the recorded/filed original to the
Custodian promptly following receipt); provided that, in those instances where the public recording office retains the
original assignment of Mortgage or assignment of Assignment of Leases, the Seller or its designee shall obtain and provide to
the Custodian a certified copy of the recorded original. On a monthly basis, at the expense of the Seller, the Custodian shall
forward to the Master Servicer a copy of each of the aforementioned assignments following the Custodian�s receipt thereof;
�
(c)������������it shall take any action reasonably required by the Purchaser, the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee or the Master
Servicer in order to assist and facilitate the transfer of the servicing of the Mortgage Loans (other than any Outside Serviced
Mortgage Loan) to the Master Servicer, including effectuating the transfer of any letters of credit with respect to any Mortgage
Loan to the Master Servicer on behalf of the Trustee for the benefit of Certificateholders and any Serviced Companion Loan Holder.
Prior to the date that a letter of credit with respect to any Mortgage Loan is so transferred to the Master Servicer, the Seller
will cooperate with the reasonable requests of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, in connection with effectuating
a draw under such letter of credit as required under the terms of the related Loan Documents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this
Section�5(c) shall not apply with respect to any Outside Serviced Mortgage Loan;
�
(d)�����������the Seller shall provide the Master Servicer the initial data with respect to each Mortgage Loan for (i) the CREFC�
Financial File and the CREFC� Loan Periodic Update File that are required to be prepared by the Master Servicer pursuant to
the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and (ii) the Supplemental Servicer Schedule;
�
(e)������������if (during the period of time that the Underwriters are required, under applicable law, to deliver a prospectus related
to the Public Certificates in connection with sales of the Public Certificates by an Underwriter or a dealer) the Seller has obtained
actual knowledge of undisclosed or corrected information related to an event that occurred prior to the Closing Date, which event
causes there to be an untrue statement of a material fact with respect to the Seller Information in (i) the Prospectus dated March
29, 2016 relating to the Public Certificates, the annexes and exhibits thereto and any electronic media delivered therewith, or
(ii) the Offering Circular dated March 29, 2016 relating to the Private Certificates, the annexes and exhibits thereto and any
electronic media delivered therewith (collectively, the �Offering Documents�), or causes there to be an omission
to state therein a material fact with respect to the Seller Information required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein with respect to the Seller Information, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading,
then the Seller shall promptly notify the Dealers and the Depositor. If as a result of any such event the Dealers� legal
counsel determines that it is necessary to amend or supplement the Offering Documents in order to correct the untrue statement,
or to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances when the Offering Documents are delivered to a purchaser,
not misleading, or to make the Offering Documents in compliance with applicable law, the Seller shall (to the extent that such
amendment or supplement solely relates to the Seller Information) at the expense of the Seller, do all things reasonably necessary
to assist the Depositor to prepare and furnish to the Dealers, such amendments or supplements to the
�


-6-
�

�
Offering
Documents as may be necessary so that the Seller Information in the Offering Documents, as so amended or supplemented, will not
contain an untrue statement, will not, in the light of the circumstances when the Offering Documents are delivered to a purchaser,
be misleading and will comply with applicable law. (All capitalized terms used in this Section�5(e) and not otherwise
defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings set forth in the Indemnification Agreement, dated as of March 29, 2016, between
the Underwriters, the Initial Purchasers, the Seller and the Depositor (the �Indemnification Agreement� and,
together with this Agreement, the �Operative Documents�)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller shall
have no affirmative obligation to monitor the performance of the Mortgage Loans or any changes in condition or circumstance of
any Mortgaged Property, Mortgagor, guarantor or any of their Affiliates after the Closing Date in connection with its obligations
under this Section 5(e);
�
(f)������������for so long as the Trust Fund is subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Seller shall provide the
Depositor and the Certificate Administrator with any Additional Form 10-D Disclosure, any Additional Form 10-K Disclosure and any
Form 8-K Disclosure Information for which the Seller is responsible as indicated on Exhibit�U, Exhibit�V and Exhibit�Z
to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement within the time periods set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement; provided
that, in connection with providing Additional Form 10-K Disclosure and the Seller�s reporting obligations under Item 1119
of Regulation AB, upon reasonable request by the Seller, the Purchaser shall provide the Seller with a list of all parties to the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement and any other Servicing Function Participant;
�
(g)�����������within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, the Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered an electronic copy of the
Diligence File for each Mortgage Loan to the Depositor by uploading such Diligence File (including, if applicable, any additional
documents that the Seller believes should be included to enable the Asset Representations Reviewer to perform an Asset Review on
such Mortgage Loan; provided that such documents are clearly labeled and identified) to the Designated Site, each such Diligence
File being organized and categorized in accordance with the electronic file structure reasonably requested by the Depositor;
�
(h)�����������within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, the Seller shall provide the Depositor, with a copy (which may be sent by
email) to each of the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee, the Custodian, the Controlling
Class Representative, the Asset Representations Reviewer and the Operating Advisor, with a certification by an authorized officer
of the Seller that the electronic copy of the Diligence File for each Mortgage Loan uploaded to the Designated Site contains all
documents required under the definition of �Diligence File� and such Diligence Files are organized and categorized
in accordance with the electronic file structure reasonably requested by the Depositor;
�
(i)������������upon written request of the Asset Representations Reviewer (in the event that the Asset Representations Reviewer reasonably
determines that any Review Materials made available or delivered to the Asset Representations Reviewer are missing any documents
required to complete any Test for a Delinquent Loan), the Seller shall provide to the Asset Representations Reviewer (or the Master
Servicer or the Special Servicer at the request of the Asset Representations Reviewer) within ten (10) Business Days of receipt
of such written request (which time period may be extended upon the mutual agreement of the Seller and the
�


-7-
�
�
Asset
Representations Reviewer), such documents requested by the Asset Representations Reviewer and reasonably available to the Seller
relating to each Delinquent Loan to enable the Asset Representations Reviewer to complete any Test for a Delinquent Loan, but
only to the extent such documents are in the possession of the Seller; provided that the Seller shall not be required to
provide any documents that are proprietary to the related originator or the Seller or any draft documents, privileged or internal
communications, credit underwriting or due diligence analysis (in connection with providing any requested documents to the Master
Servicer or the Special Servicer, the Seller shall use reasonable efforts to clearly identify such documents as being delivered
in response to a request from the Asset Representations Reviewer and as being required to be transmitted to the Asset Representations
Reviewer; provided that the absence of any such identification shall not relieve the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer,
as the case may be, from any obligations under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to transmit any such documents to the Asset
Representations Reviewer);
�
(j)�������������upon the completion of an Asset Review with respect to each Delinquent Loan and receipt by the Seller of a written request

the Mortgage Loan Schedule, or does not appear to be regular on its face (each, a �Document Defect�), or discovers
or receives notice alleging a breach of any representation or warranty of the Seller made pursuant to Section�6(c)
of this Agreement with respect to any Mortgage Loan (a �Breach�) or (ii) the Special Servicer or the Purchaser

�
(e)�����������Pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Special Servicer is required to determine whether any such Document
Defect or Breach with respect to any Mortgage Loan materially and adversely affects, or such Document Defect is deemed in accordance
with Section�2.03 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to materially and adversely affect, the value of the Mortgage Loan
or any related REO Property or the interests of the Certificateholders therein or causes any Mortgage Loan to fail to be a Qualified
Mortgage (any such Document Defect shall constitute a �Material Document Defect� and any such Breach shall constitute
a �Material Breach�; and a Material Breach and/or a Material Document Defect, as the case may be, shall constitute
a �Material Defect�). If such Document Defect or Breach has been determined to be a Material Defect, then the
Special Servicer will be required to give
�


-12-
�
�
prompt
written notice thereof to the Seller, demanding that the Seller cure such Material Defect. Promptly upon becoming aware of any
such Material Defect (including, without limitation, through a written notice given by any party to the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement, as provided above if the Document Defect or Breach identified therein is a Material Defect), the Seller shall, not
later than 90�days from the earlier of the Seller�s (x) discovery of, and (y) receipt of notice of and receipt of a
demand to take action with respect to such Material Defect (or, in the case of a Material Defect relating to a Mortgage Loan not
being a Qualified Mortgage, not later than 90�days from any party discovering such Material Defect) (such 90-day period,
the �Initial Cure Period�), cure the same in all material respects (which cure shall include payment of any
losses and Additional Trust Fund Expenses associated therewith (including, if applicable, the amount of any fees of the Asset
Representations Reviewer payable pursuant to Section 5(j) above attributable to the Asset Review of such Mortgage Loan)) or, if
such Material Defect cannot be cured within the Initial Cure Period, the Seller shall (before the end of the Initial Cure Period)
either: (i) repurchase the affected Mortgage Loan or any related REO Property (or the Trust Fund�s interest therein) at
the applicable Purchase Price by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Collection Account; or (ii) substitute a
Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan for such affected Mortgage Loan (provided that in no event shall any such substitution occur
later than the second anniversary of the Closing Date) and pay the Master Servicer, for deposit into the Collection Account, any
Substitution Shortfall Amount in connection therewith; provided, however, that if (i)�such Material Defect
is capable of being cured but not within the Initial Cure Period, (ii) such Material Defect is not related to any Mortgage Loan�s
not being a Qualified Mortgage and (iii) the Seller has commenced and is diligently proceeding with the cure of such Material
Defect within the Initial Cure Period, then the Seller shall have an additional 90�days (any such additional 90-day period,
the �Extended Cure Period�) to complete such cure (or, in the event of a failure to so cure, to complete such
repurchase of the related Mortgage Loan or substitute a Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan as described above) it being understood
and agreed that, in connection with the Seller�s receiving the Extended Cure Period, the Seller shall deliver an Officer�s
Certificate to the Trustee, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer and the Certificate Administrator setting forth the reasons
such Material Defect is not capable of being cured within the Initial Cure Period and what actions the Seller is pursuing in connection
with the cure thereof and stating that the Seller anticipates that such Material Defect will be cured within the Extended Cure
Period; and provided, further, that, if any such Material Defect is still not cured after the Initial Cure Period
and any Extended Cure Period solely due to the failure of the Seller to have received the recorded document, then the Seller shall
be entitled to continue to defer its cure, repurchase and/or substitution obligations in respect of such Material Defect so long
as the Seller certifies to the Trustee, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer and the Certificate Administrator every 30�days
thereafter that the Material Defect is still in effect solely because of its failure to have received the recorded document and
that the Seller is diligently pursuing the cure of such defect (specifying the actions being taken), except that no such deferral
of cure, repurchase or substitution may continue beyond the date that is 18 months following the Closing Date. Any such repurchase
or substitution of a Mortgage Loan shall be on a whole loan, servicing released basis. The Seller shall have no obligation to
monitor the Mortgage Loans regarding the existence of a Breach or a Document Defect, but if the Seller discovers a Material Defect
with respect to a Mortgage Loan, it will notify the Purchaser. Monthly Payments due with respect to each Qualified Substitute
Mortgage Loan (if any) after the related Due Date in the month of substitution, and Monthly Payments due with respect to each
Mortgage Loan being
�


-13-
�
�
repurchased or replaced after the related Cut-Off Date and received by the Master Servicer or the Special
Servicer on behalf of the Trust on or prior to the related date of repurchase or substitution, shall be part of the Trust Fund.
Monthly Payments due with respect to each Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan (if any) on or prior to the related Due Date in the
month of substitution, and Monthly Payments due with respect to each Mortgage Loan being repurchased or replaced and received
by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer on behalf of the Trust after the related date of repurchase or substitution, shall
not be part of the Trust Fund and shall be required, under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, to be remitted by the Master Servicer
to the Seller promptly following receipt. From and after the date of substitution, each Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan, if
any, that has been substituted shall be deemed to constitute a �Mortgage Loan� hereunder for all purposes. No mortgage
loan may be substituted for a Defective Mortgage Loan as contemplated by this Section 6(e) if the Mortgage Loan to be replaced
was itself a Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan that had replaced a prior Mortgage Loan, in which case, absent a cure (including
by the making of a Loss of Value Payment pursuant to the following paragraph) of the relevant Material Defect, the affected Mortgage
Loan will be required to be repurchased.
�
Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Section 6(e), in lieu of the Seller performing its obligations with respect to any Material Defect as
set forth in the preceding paragraph, to the extent that the Seller and the Purchaser (or, following the assignment of the Mortgage
Loans to the Trust, the Seller and the Special Servicer on behalf of the Trust, and with the consent of the Controlling Class Representative
(other than with respect to any Excluded Mortgage Loan) prior to the occurrence of a Control Termination Event) are able to agree
upon a cash payment payable by the Seller to the Purchaser or the Trust, as applicable, that would be deemed sufficient to compensate
the Purchaser or the Trust, as applicable, for a Material Defect (a �Loss of Value Payment�), the Seller may
elect, in its sole discretion, to pay such Loss of Value Payment to the Purchaser or the Trust, as applicable; provided,
that a Material Defect as a result of a Mortgage Loan not constituting a Qualified Mortgage, may not be cured by a Loss of Value
Payment; and provided, further, that the Loss of Value Payment shall include the portion of any Liquidation Fees
payable to the Special Servicer in respect of such Loss of Value Payment and the portion of fees of the Asset Representations Reviewer
attributable to the Asset Review of such Mortgage Loan. Upon its making such payment, the Seller shall be deemed to have cured
such Material Defect in all respects. Provided that such Loss of Value Payment is made, this paragraph describes the sole remedy
available to the Purchaser or the Trust, as applicable, and its assignees regarding any such Material Defect, and the Seller shall
not be obligated to repurchase or replace the affected Mortgage Loan or otherwise cure such Material Defect. This paragraph is
intended to apply only to a mutual agreement or settlement between the Seller and the Special Servicer on behalf of the Trust,
provided that prior to any such agreement or settlement nothing in this paragraph shall preclude the Seller or the Special
Servicer, as applicable, from exercising any of its rights related to a Material Defect in the manner and timing set forth in the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement or this Section 6(e) (excluding this paragraph) (including any right to cure, repurchase
or substitute for such Mortgage Loan).
�
If (x)�a Mortgage
Loan is to be repurchased or replaced as described above (a �Defective Mortgage Loan�), (y)�such Defective
Mortgage Loan is part of a Cross-Collateralized Group and (z)�the applicable Document Defect or Breach does not constitute
a Material Defect
�


-14-
�
�
as
to the other Mortgage Loan(s) that are a part of such Cross-Collateralized Group (the �Other Crossed Loans�)
(without regard to this paragraph), then the applicable Document Defect or Breach (as the case may be) shall be deemed to constitute
a Material Defect as to each such Other Crossed Loan for purposes of the above provisions, and the Seller shall be obligated to
repurchase or replace each such Other Crossed Loan in accordance with the provisions above unless, in the case of such Breach
or Document Defect, as applicable:
�
(A)
���the Seller (at its expense) delivers or causes to be delivered to the Trustee, the Master Servicer and
the Special Servicer an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such Seller�s repurchase or replacement of only those Mortgage
Loans as to which a Material Defect has actually occurred without regard to the provisions of this paragraph�(the �Affected
Loan(s)�) and the operation of the remaining provisions of this Section�6(e) (i) will not cause either Trust
REMIC to fail to qualify as a REMIC or cause the Grantor Trust to fail to qualify as a grantor trust under subpart E, part I of
subchapter J of the Code for federal income tax purposes at any time that any Certificate is outstanding and (ii) will not result
in the imposition of a tax upon either Trust REMIC or the Trust Fund (including but not limited to the tax on �prohibited
transactions� as defined in Section�860F(a)(2) of the Code and the tax on contributions to a REMIC set forth in Section�860G(d)
of the Code); and
�
(B)�
 ��each of the following conditions would be satisfied if the Seller were to repurchase or replace only the Affected Loans
and not the Other Crossed Loans:
�
(1)��
the debt service coverage ratio for such Other Crossed Loan(s) (excluding the Affected Loan(s)) for the four calendar quarters
immediately preceding the repurchase or replacement is not less than the lesser of (A)�0.10x below the debt service coverage
ratio for the Cross-Collateralized Group (including the Affected Loan(s)) set forth in Annex�A to the Prospectus and
(B)�the debt service coverage ratio for the Cross-Collateralized Group (including the Affected Loan(s)) for the four preceding
calendar quarters preceding the repurchase or replacement;
�
(2)��
the loan-to-value ratio for the Other Crossed Loans (excluding the Affected Loan(s)) is not greater than the greatest of
(A)�the loan-to-value ratio, expressed as a whole number percentage (taken to one decimal place), for the Cross-Collateralized
Group (including the Affected Loan(s)) set forth in Annex�A to the Prospectus plus 10%, (B)�the loan-to-value
ratio, expressed as a whole number percentage (taken to one decimal place), for the Cross-Collateralized Group (including the Affected
Loan(s)) at the time of repurchase or replacement and (C) 75%; and
�
(3)��
either (x) the exercise of remedies against the Primary Collateral of any Mortgage Loan in the Cross-Collateralized Group
will not impair the ability to exercise remedies against the Primary Collateral of the other Mortgage Loans in the Cross-Collateralized
Group or (y) the
�


-15-
�
�
Loan
Documents evidencing and securing the relevant Mortgage Loans have been modified in a manner that complies with this Agreement
and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and that removes any threat of impairment of the ability to exercise remedies against
the Primary Collateral of the other Mortgage Loans in the Cross-Collateralized Group as a result of the exercise of remedies against
the Primary Collateral of any Mortgage Loan in the Cross-Collateralized Group.
�
The determination of
the Special Servicer as to whether the conditions set forth above have been satisfied shall be conclusive and binding in the absence
of manifest error on the Certificateholders, other parties to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the Seller. The Master Servicer
or the Special Servicer, as applicable, will be entitled to cause to be delivered, or direct the Seller to (in which case the Seller
shall) cause to be delivered, to the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, an Appraisal of any or all of the
related Mortgaged Properties for purposes of determining whether the condition set forth in clause�(B)(2) above has
been satisfied, in each case at the expense of the Seller if the scope and cost of the Appraisal is approved by the Seller and,
prior to the occurrence and continuance of a Control Termination Event, the Controlling Class Representative (such approval not
to be unreasonably withheld in each case).
�
With respect to any Defective
Mortgage Loan that forms a part of a Cross-Collateralized Group and as to which the conditions described in the second preceding
paragraph are satisfied, such that the Trust Fund will continue to hold the Other Crossed Loans, the Seller and the Depositor agree
to forbear from enforcing any remedies against the other�s Primary Collateral but each is permitted to exercise remedies
against the Primary Collateral securing its respective Mortgage Loans, including with respect to the Trustee, the Primary Collateral
securing the Affected Loan(s) still held by the Trustee. If the exercise of remedies by one such party would impair the ability
of the other such party to exercise its remedies with respect to the Primary Collateral securing the Affected Loan or the Other
Crossed Loans, as the case may be, held by the other such party, then both parties shall forbear from exercising such remedies
unless and until the Loan Documents evidencing and securing the relevant Mortgage Loans can be modified in a manner that complies
with this Agreement to remove the threat of impairment as a result of the exercise of remedies. Any reserve or other cash collateral
or letters of credit securing any of the Mortgage Loans that form a Cross-Collateralized Group shall be allocated between such
Mortgage Loans in accordance with the related Loan Documents, or otherwise on a pro rata basis based upon their outstanding
Stated Principal Balances. All other terms of the Mortgage Loans shall remain in full force and effect, without any modification
thereof. The provisions of this paragraph shall be binding on all future holders of each Mortgage Loan that forms part of a Cross-Collateralized
Group.
�
The Pooling and Servicing
Agreement provides that, to the extent necessary and appropriate, the Special Servicer will execute (pursuant to a limited power
of attorney provided by the Trustee who will not be liable for any misuse of any such power of attorney by the Special Servicer
or any of its agents or subcontractors) the modification of the Loan Documents that complies with this Agreement to remove the
threat of impairment of the ability of the Seller or the Trust Fund to exercise its remedies with respect to the Primary Collateral
securing the Mortgage Loan(s) held by such party resulting from the exercise of remedies by the other such
�


-16-
�
�
party.
All costs and expenses incurred by the Trustee, the Special Servicer and the Master Servicer with respect to any Cross-Collateralized
Group pursuant to this paragraph and the first, second and third preceding paragraphs shall be advanced by the Master Servicer
as provided for in Section 2.03(a) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, and such advances and interest thereon shall be included
in the calculation of Purchase Price for the Affected Loan(s) to be repurchased or replaced.
�
Subject to the Seller�s
right to cure set forth above in this Section�6(e), and further subject to Sections�2.01(b) and 2.01(c) of the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement, failure of the Seller to deliver the documents referred to in clauses (1), (2), (7), (8), (18)
and (19) in the definition of �Mortgage File� in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement in accordance with this Agreement
and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement for any Mortgage Loan shall be deemed a Material Document Defect; provided, however,
that no Document Defect (except such deemed Material Document Defect described above) shall be considered to be a Material Document
Defect unless the document with respect to which the Document Defect exists is required in connection with an imminent enforcement
of the lender�s rights or remedies under the related Mortgage Loan, defending any claim asserted by any Mortgagor or third
party with respect to the Mortgage Loan, establishing the validity or priority of any lien on any collateral securing the Mortgage
Loan or for any immediate significant servicing obligation.
�
With respect to any Outside
Serviced Mortgage Loan, the Seller agrees that if a �material document defect� (as such term or any analogous term
is defined in the related Outside Servicing Agreement) exists under the related Outside Servicing Agreement with respect to the
related Outside Serviced Companion Loan included in the related Outside Securitization Trust, and such Outside Serviced Companion
Loan is repurchased by or on behalf of such Seller (or other responsible repurchasing entity) from the related Outside Securitization
Trust as a result of such �material document defect� (as such term or any analogous term is defined in such Outside
Servicing Agreement), then the Seller shall repurchase such Outside Serviced Mortgage Loan; provided, however, that
such repurchase obligation does not apply to any �material document defect� (as such term or any analogous term is
defined in the related Outside Servicing Agreement) related solely to the promissory note for such Outside Serviced Companion Loan.
�
(f)������������In connection with any repurchase or substitution of one or more Mortgage Loans pursuant to this Section�6,
the Pooling and Servicing Agreement shall provide that the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian, the Master Servicer
and the Special Servicer shall each tender to the repurchasing entity, upon delivery to each of them of a receipt executed by the
repurchasing entity evidencing such repurchase or substitution, all portions of the Mortgage File (including, without limitation,
the Servicing File) and other documents and all Escrow Payments and reserve funds pertaining to such Mortgage Loan possessed by
it, and each document that constitutes a part of the Mortgage File shall be endorsed or assigned to the extent necessary or appropriate
to the repurchasing or substituting entity or its designee in the same manner, but only if the respective documents have been previously
assigned or endorsed to the Trustee, and pursuant to appropriate forms of assignment, substantially similar to the manner and forms
pursuant to which such documents were previously assigned to the Trustee or as otherwise reasonably requested to effect the retransfer
and reconveyance of the Mortgage Loan and the security therefor to the Seller or its designee; provided that such tender
by the Trustee and the Custodian shall be conditioned upon its receipt from the Master Servicer of a Request for
�


-17-
�
�
Release
and an Officer�s Certificate to the effect that the requirements for repurchase or substitution have been satisfied. In
the event a Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan is substituted for a Defective Mortgage Loan by the Seller as contemplated by this
Section 6, the Seller shall deliver to the Custodian the related Mortgage File and to the Master Servicer all Escrow Payments
and reserve funds pertaining to such Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan possessed by it and a certification to the effect that
such Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan satisfies all of the requirements of the definition of �Qualified Substitute Mortgage
Loan� in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
�
If any Mortgage Loan
is to be repurchased or replaced as contemplated by this Section 6, the Seller shall amend the Mortgage Loan Schedule to
reflect the removal of any deleted Mortgage Loan and, if applicable, the substitution of the related Qualified Substitute Mortgage
Loan(s) and deliver or cause the delivery of such amended Mortgage Loan Schedule to the parties to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
Upon any substitution of a Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan for a deleted Mortgage Loan, such Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan
shall become part of the Trust Fund and be subject to the terms of this Agreement in all respects.

EXHIBIT B

MORTGAGE LOAN REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

�

(1)Whole Loan; Ownership of Mortgage Loans. Except with respect to a Mortgage Loan that is
part of a Loan Combination, each Mortgage Loan is a whole loan and not a participation interest in a Mortgage Loan. Each Mortgage
Loan that is part of a Loan Combination is a senior or pari passu portion of a whole loan evidenced by a senior or pari
passu note. At the time of the sale, transfer and assignment to Depositor, no Mortgage Note or Mortgage was subject to any
assignment (other than assignments to the Seller), participation or pledge, and the Seller had good title to, and was the sole
owner of, each Mortgage Loan free and clear of any and all liens, charges, pledges, encumbrances, participations, any other ownership
interests on, in or to such Mortgage Loan other than any servicing rights appointment or similar agreement, any Outside Servicing
Agreement with respect to an Outside Serviced Mortgage Loan and rights of the holder of a related Companion Loan pursuant to a
Co-Lender Agreement. The Seller has full right and authority to sell, assign and transfer each Mortgage Loan, and the assignment
to Depositor constitutes a legal, valid and binding assignment of such Mortgage Loan free and clear of any and all liens, pledges,
charges or security interests of any nature encumbering such Mortgage Loan other than the rights of the holder of a related Companion
Loan pursuant to a Co-Lender Agreement.
�

(2)Loan Document Status. Each related Mortgage Note, Mortgage, Assignment of Leases (if a separate
instrument), guaranty and other agreement executed by or on behalf of the related Mortgagor, guarantor or other obligor in connection
with such Mortgage Loan is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the related Mortgagor, guarantor or other obligor (subject
to any non-recourse provisions contained in any of the foregoing agreements and any applicable state anti-deficiency or market
value limit deficiency legislation), as applicable, and is enforceable in accordance with its terms, except (i)�as such enforcement
may be limited by (a)�bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting
the enforcement of creditors� rights generally and (b)�general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforcement
is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and�(ii)�that certain provisions in such Loan Documents (including,
without limitation, provisions requiring the payment of default interest, late fees or prepayment/yield maintenance fees, charges
and/or premiums) are, or may be, further limited or rendered unenforceable by or under applicable law, but (subject to the limitations
set forth in clause (i) above) such limitations or unenforceability will not render such Loan Documents invalid as a whole or materially
interfere with the Mortgagee�s realization of the principal benefits and/or security provided thereby (clauses (i) and (ii)
collectively, the �Standard Qualifications�).
�
Except as set
forth in the immediately preceding sentence, there is no valid offset, defense, counterclaim or right of rescission available to
the related Mortgagor with respect to any of the related Mortgage Notes, Mortgages or other Loan Documents, including, without
limitation, any such valid offset, defense, counterclaim or right based
�


B-1
�
�
on intentional fraud by the Seller in connection with the
origination of the Mortgage Loan, that would deny the Mortgagee the principal benefits intended to be provided by the Mortgage
Note, Mortgage or other Loan Documents.
�

(3)Mortgage Provisions. The Loan Documents for each Mortgage Loan contain provisions that render
the rights and remedies of the holder thereof adequate for the practical realization against the Mortgaged Property of the principal
benefits of the security intended to be provided thereby, including realization by judicial or, if applicable, nonjudicial foreclosure
subject to the limitations set forth in the Standard Qualifications.
�

(4)Mortgage Status; Waivers and Modifications. Since origination and except by written instruments
set forth in the related Mortgage File (a) the material terms of such Mortgage, Mortgage Note, Mortgage Loan guaranty, and related
Loan Documents have not been waived, impaired, modified, altered, satisfied, canceled, subordinated or rescinded in any respect
which materially interferes with the security intended to be provided by such Mortgage; (b) no related Mortgaged Property or any
portion thereof has been released from the lien of the related Mortgage in any manner which materially interferes with the security
intended to be provided by such Mortgage or the use or operation of the remaining portion of such Mortgaged Property; and (c) neither
the related Mortgagor nor the related guarantor has been released from its material obligations under the Mortgage Loan.
�

(5)Lien; Valid Assignment. Subject to the Standard Qualifications, each assignment of Mortgage
and assignment of Assignment of Leases to the Trust Fund constitutes a legal, valid and binding assignment to the Trust Fund. Each
related Mortgage and Assignment of Leases is freely assignable without the consent of the related Mortgagor. Each related Mortgage
is a legal, valid and enforceable first lien on the related Mortgagor�s fee (or if identified on the Mortgage Loan Schedule,
leasehold) interest in the Mortgaged Property in the principal amount of such Mortgage Loan or allocated loan amount (subject only
to Permitted Encumbrances (as defined below) and the exceptions to paragraph (6) set forth on Exhibit�C (each such
exception, a �Title Exception�)), except as the enforcement thereof may be limited by the Standard Qualifications.
Such Mortgaged Property (subject to and excepting Permitted Encumbrances and the Title Exceptions) as of origination was, and as
of the Cut-Off Date, to the Seller�s knowledge, is free and clear of any recorded mechanics� liens, recorded materialmen�s
liens and other recorded encumbrances which are prior to or equal with the lien of the related Mortgage, except those which are
bonded over, escrowed for or insured against by a lender�s title insurance policy (as described below), and, to the Seller�s
knowledge and subject to the rights of tenants (as tenants only) (subject to and excepting Permitted Encumbrances and the Title
Exceptions), no rights exist which under law could give rise to any such lien or encumbrance that would be prior to or equal with
the lien of the related Mortgage, except those which are bonded over, escrowed for or insured against by a lender�s title
insurance policy (as described below). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no representation is made as to the perfection
of any security interest in rents or other personal property to the extent that possession or control of such items or actions
other than the filing of Uniform Commercial Code financing statements is required in order to effect such perfection.
�


B-2
�
�

(6)Permitted Liens; Title Insurance. Each Mortgaged Property securing a Mortgage Loan is covered
by an American Land Title Association loan title insurance policy or a comparable form of loan title insurance policy approved
for use in the applicable jurisdiction (or, if such policy is yet to be issued, by a pro forma policy, a preliminary title policy
with escrow instructions or a �marked up� commitment, in each case binding on the title insurer) (the �Title
Policy�) in the original principal amount of such Mortgage Loan (or with respect to a Mortgage Loan secured by multiple
properties, an amount equal to at least the allocated loan amount with respect to the Title Policy for each such property) after
all advances of principal (including any advances held in escrow or reserves), that insures for the benefit of the owner of the
indebtedness secured by the Mortgage, the first priority lien of the Mortgage, which lien is subject only to (a)�the lien
of current real property taxes, water charges, sewer rents and assessments due and payable but not yet delinquent; (b)�covenants,
conditions and restrictions, rights of way, easements and other matters of public record; (c) the exceptions (general and specific)
and exclusions set forth in such Title Policy; (d) other matters to which like properties are commonly subject; (e) the rights
of tenants (as tenants only) under leases (including subleases) pertaining to the related Mortgaged Property and condominium declarations;
(f)�if the related Mortgage Loan constitutes a Cross-Collateralized Mortgage Loan, the lien of the Mortgage for another Mortgage
Loan contained in the same Cross-Collateralized Group; and (g) if the related Mortgage Loan is part of a Loan Combination, the
rights of the holder(s) of the related Companion Loan(s) pursuant to the related Co-Lender Agreement; provided that none of items
(a) through (g), individually or in the aggregate, materially and adversely interferes with the value or current use of the Mortgaged
Property or the security intended to be provided by such Mortgage or the Mortgagor�s ability to pay its obligations when
they become due (collectively, the �Permitted Encumbrances�). For purposes of clause (a) of the immediately
preceding sentence, any such taxes, assessments and other charges shall not be considered delinquent until the date on which interest
and/or penalties would first be payable thereon. Except as contemplated by clauses�(f) and (g) of the second
preceding sentence, none of the Permitted Encumbrances are mortgage liens that are senior to or coordinate and co-equal with the
lien of the related Mortgage. Such Title Policy (or, if it has yet to be issued, the coverage to be provided thereby) is in full
force and effect, all premiums thereon have been paid and no claims have been made by the Seller thereunder and no claims have
been paid thereunder. Neither the Seller, nor to the Seller�s knowledge, any other holder of the Mortgage Loan, has done,
by act or omission, anything that would materially impair the coverage under such Title Policy.
�

(7)Junior Liens. It being understood that B notes secured by the same Mortgage as a Mortgage
Loan are not subordinate mortgages or junior liens, except for any Mortgage Loan that is cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted
with another Mortgage Loan, there are no subordinate mortgages or junior liens securing the payment of money encumbering the related
Mortgaged Property (other than Permitted Encumbrances and the Title Exceptions, taxes and assessments, mechanics� and materialmen�s
liens (which are the subject of the representation in paragraph (5) above), and equipment and other personal property financing).
Except as set forth on Exhibit B-30-1, the Seller has no knowledge of any mezzanine debt secured directly by interests in
the related Mortgagor.
�


B-3
�
�

(8)Assignment of Leases and Rents. There exists as part of the related Mortgage File an Assignment
of Leases (either as a separate instrument or incorporated into the related Mortgage). Subject to the Permitted Encumbrances and
the Title Exceptions, each related Assignment of Leases creates a valid first-priority collateral assignment of, or a valid first-priority
lien or security interest in, rents and certain rights under the related lease or leases, subject only to a license granted to
the related Mortgagor to exercise certain rights and to perform certain obligations of the lessor under such lease or leases, including
the right to operate the related leased property, except as the enforcement thereof may be limited by the Standard Qualifications.
The related Mortgage or related Assignment of Leases, subject to applicable law, provides that, upon an event of default under
the Mortgage Loan, a receiver is permitted to be appointed for the collection of rents or for the related Mortgagee to enter into
possession to collect the rents or for rents to be paid directly to the Mortgagee.
�

(9)UCC Filings. If the related Mortgaged Property is operated as a hospitality property, the
Seller has filed and/or recorded or caused to be filed and/or recorded (or, if not filed and/or recorded, submitted in proper form
for filing and/or recording), UCC financing statements in the appropriate public filing and/or recording offices necessary at the
time of the origination of the Mortgage Loan to perfect a valid security interest in all items of physical personal property reasonably
necessary to operate such Mortgaged Property owned by such Mortgagor and located on the related Mortgaged Property (other than
any non-material personal property, any personal property subject to a purchase money security interest, a sale and leaseback financing
arrangement as permitted under the terms of the related Loan Documents or any other personal property leases applicable to such
personal property), to the extent perfection may be effected pursuant to applicable law by recording or filing, as the case may
be. Subject to the Standard Qualifications, each related Mortgage (or equivalent document) creates a valid and enforceable lien
and security interest on the items of personalty described above. No representation is made as to the perfection of any security
interest in rents or other personal property to the extent that possession or control of such items or actions other than the filing
of UCC financing statements are required in order to effect such perfection.
�

(10)Condition of Property. The Seller or the originator of the Mortgage Loan inspected or caused
to be inspected each related Mortgaged Property within six months of origination of the Mortgage Loan and within thirteen months
of the Cut-Off Date.
�
An engineering
report or property condition assessment was prepared in connection with the origination of each Mortgage Loan no more than thirteen
months prior to the Cut-Off Date. To the Seller�s knowledge, based solely upon due diligence customarily performed in connection
with the origination of comparable mortgage loans, as of the Closing Date, each related Mortgaged Property was free and clear of
any material damage (other than deferred maintenance for which escrows were established at origination) that would affect materially
and adversely the use or value of such Mortgaged Property as security for the Mortgage Loan.
�

(11)Taxes and Assessments. As of the date of origination and, to the Seller�s knowledge,
as of the Cut-Off Date, all taxes, governmental assessments and other outstanding 
�


B-4
�
�

governmental charges (including, without limitation, water
and sewage charges), or installments thereof, which could be a lien on the related Mortgaged Property that would be of equal or
superior priority to the lien of the Mortgage and that prior to the Cut-Off Date have become delinquent in respect of each related
Mortgaged Property have been paid, or an escrow of funds has been established in an amount sufficient to cover such payments and
reasonably estimated interest and penalties, if any, thereon. For purposes of this representation and warranty, real estate taxes
and governmental assessments and other outstanding governmental charges and installments thereof shall not be considered delinquent
until the date on which interest and/or penalties would first be payable thereon.

�

(12)Condemnation. As of the date of origination and to the Seller�s knowledge as of the
Cut-Off Date, there is no proceeding pending, and, to the Seller�s knowledge as of the date of origination and as of the
Cut-Off Date, there is no proceeding threatened, for the total or partial condemnation of such Mortgaged Property that would have
a material adverse effect on the value, use or operation of the Mortgaged Property.
�

(13)Actions Concerning Mortgage Loan. As of the date of origination and to the Seller�s
knowledge as of the Cut-Off Date, there was no pending or filed action, suit or proceeding, arbitration or governmental investigation
involving any Mortgagor, guarantor, or Mortgagor�s interest in the Mortgaged Property, an adverse outcome of which would
reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect (a) such Mortgagor�s title to the Mortgaged Property, (b) the validity
or enforceability of the Mortgage, (c) such Mortgagor�s ability to perform under the related Mortgage Loan, (d) such guarantor�s
ability to perform under the related guaranty, (e)�the principal benefit of the security intended to be provided by the Loan
Documents or (f) the current principal use of the Mortgaged Property.
�

(14)Escrow Deposits. All escrow deposits and payments required to be escrowed with Mortgagee
pursuant to each Mortgage Loan are in the possession, or under the control, of the Seller or its servicer, and there are no deficiencies
(subject to any applicable grace or cure periods) in connection therewith, and all such escrows and deposits (or the right thereto)
that are required to be escrowed with Mortgagee under the related Loan Documents are being conveyed by the Seller to Depositor
or its servicer.
�

(15)No Holdbacks. The principal amount of the Mortgage Loan stated on the Mortgage Loan Schedule
has been fully disbursed as of the Closing Date and there is no requirement for future advances thereunder (except in those cases
where the full amount of the Mortgage Loan has been disbursed but a portion thereof is being held in escrow or reserve accounts
pending the satisfaction of certain conditions relating to leasing, repairs or other matters with respect to the related Mortgaged
Property, the Mortgagor or other considerations determined by the Seller to merit such holdback).
�

(16)Insurance. Each related Mortgaged Property is, and is required pursuant to the related Mortgage
to be, insured by a property insurance policy providing coverage for loss in accordance with coverage found under a �special
cause of loss form� or �all risk form� that includes replacement cost valuation issued by an insurer meeting
the requirements of 
�


B-5
�
�
the
related Loan Documents and having a claims-paying or financial strength rating of at least �A-:VIII� from A.M. Best
Company or �A3� (or the equivalent) from Moody�s Investors Service, Inc. or �A-� from Standard &
Poor�s Ratings Services (collectively the �Insurance Rating Requirements�), in an amount (subject to a customary
deductible) not less than the lesser of (1) the original principal balance of the Mortgage Loan and (2) the full insurable value
on a replacement cost basis of the improvements, furniture, furnishings, fixtures and equipment owned by the Mortgagor and included
in the Mortgaged Property (with no deduction for physical depreciation), but, in any event, not less than the amount necessary
or containing such endorsements as are necessary to avoid the operation of any coinsurance provisions with respect to the related
Mortgaged Property.
�
Each related
Mortgaged Property is also covered, and required to be covered pursuant to the related Loan Documents, by business interruption
or rental loss insurance which (subject to a customary deductible) covers a period of not less than 12 months (or with respect
to each Mortgage Loan on a single asset with a principal balance of $50 million or more, 18 months).
�
If any material
part of the improvements, exclusive of a parking lot, located on a Mortgaged Property is in an area identified in the Federal Register
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as a �Special Flood Hazard Area,� the related Mortgagor is required to maintain
insurance in the maximum amount available under the National Flood Insurance Program.
�
If the Mortgaged
Property is located within 25 miles of the coast of the Gulf of Mexico or the Atlantic coast of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina
or North Carolina, the related Mortgagor is required to maintain coverage for windstorm and/or windstorm related perils and/or
�named storms� issued by an insurer meeting the Insurance Rating Requirements or endorsement covering damage from windstorm
and/or windstorm related perils and/or named storms.
�
The Mortgaged
Property is covered, and required to be covered pursuant to the related Loan Documents, by a commercial general liability insurance
policy issued by an insurer meeting the Insurance Rating Requirements including coverage for property damage, contractual damage
and personal injury (including bodily injury and death) in amounts as are generally required by prudent institutional commercial
mortgage lenders, and in any event not less than $1 million per occurrence and $2 million in the aggregate.
�
An architectural
or engineering consultant has performed an analysis of each of the Mortgaged Properties located in seismic zones 3 or 4 in order
to evaluate the structural and seismic condition of such property, for the sole purpose of assessing the scenario expected limit
(�SEL�) for the Mortgaged Property in the event of an earthquake. In such instance, the SEL was based on a 475-year
return period, an exposure period of 50 years and a 10% probability of exceedance. If the resulting report concluded that the SEL
would exceed 20% of the amount of the replacement costs of the improvements, earthquake insurance on such Mortgaged Property was
obtained from an insurer rated at least �A:VIII� by A.M. Best Company or �A3� (or the equivalent) from
Moody�s
�


B-6
�
�
Investors Service, Inc. or �A-� by Standard & Poor�s Ratings Services in an amount not less
than 100% of the SEL.
�
The Loan Documents
require insurance proceeds in respect of a property loss to be applied either (a) to the repair or restoration of all or part of
the related Mortgaged Property, with respect to all property losses in excess of 5% of the then outstanding principal amount of
the related Mortgage Loan (or related Loan Combination), the Mortgagee (or a trustee appointed by it) having the right to hold
and disburse such proceeds as the repair or restoration progresses, or (b) to the payment of the outstanding principal balance
of such Mortgage Loan together with any accrued interest thereon.
�
All premiums
on all insurance policies referred to in this section required to be paid as of the Cut-Off Date have been paid, and such insurance
policies name the Mortgagee under the Mortgage Loan and its successors and assigns as a loss payee under a mortgagee endorsement
clause or, in the case of the general liability insurance policy, as named or additional insured. Such insurance policies will
inure to the benefit of the Trustee. Each related Mortgage Loan obligates the related Mortgagor to maintain all such insurance
and, at such Mortgagor�s failure to do so, authorizes the Mortgagee to maintain such insurance at the Mortgagor�s reasonable
cost and expense and to charge such Mortgagor for related premiums. All such insurance policies (other than commercial liability
policies) require at least 10 days� prior notice to the Mortgagee of termination or cancellation arising because of nonpayment
of a premium and at least 30 days� prior notice to the Mortgagee of termination or cancellation (or such lesser period, not
less than 10 days, as may be required by applicable law) arising for any reason other than non-payment of a premium and no such
notice has been received by the Seller.
�

(17)Access; Utilities; Separate Tax Lots. Based solely on evaluation of the Title Policy (as
defined in paragraph (6) of this Exhibit�B) and survey, if any, an engineering report or property condition assessment
as described in paragraph (10) of this Exhibit�B, applicable local law compliance materials as described in paragraph
(24) of this Exhibit�B, and the ESA (as defined in paragraph (40) of this Exhibit�B), each Mortgaged Property
(a) is located on or adjacent to a public road and has direct legal access to such road, or has access via an irrevocable easement
or irrevocable right of way permitting ingress and egress to/from a public road, (b) is served by or has uninhibited access rights
to public or private water and sewer (or well and septic) and all required utilities, all of which are appropriate for the current
use of the Mortgaged Property, and (c) constitutes one or more separate tax parcels which do not include any property which is
not part of the Mortgaged Property or is subject to an endorsement under the related Title Policy insuring the Mortgaged Property,
or in certain cases, an application has been, or will be, made to the applicable governing authority for creation of separate tax
lots, in which case the Mortgage Loan requires the Mortgagor to escrow an amount sufficient to pay taxes for the existing tax parcel
of which the Mortgaged Property is a part until the separate tax lots are created.
�

(18)No Encroachments. To the Seller�s knowledge based solely on surveys obtained in connection
with origination and the Mortgagee�s Title Policy (or, if such policy is not yet issued, a pro forma title policy, a preliminary
title policy with escrow instructions or a 
�


B-7
�
�
�marked
up� commitment) obtained in connection with the origination of each Mortgage Loan, all material improvements that were included
for the purpose of determining the appraised value of the related Mortgaged Property at the time of the origination of such Mortgage
Loan are within the boundaries of the related Mortgaged Property, except encroachments that do not materially and adversely affect
the value or current use of such Mortgaged Property or for which insurance or endorsements were obtained under the Title Policy.
No improvements on adjoining parcels encroach onto the related Mortgaged Property except for encroachments that do not materially
and adversely affect the value or current use of such Mortgaged Property or for which insurance or endorsements were obtained
under the Title Policy. No improvements encroach upon any easements except for encroachments the removal of which would not materially
and adversely affect the value or current use of such Mortgaged Property or for which insurance or endorsements were obtained
under the Title Policy.
�

(19)No Contingent Interest or Equity Participation. No Mortgage Loan has a shared appreciation
feature, any other contingent interest feature or a negative amortization feature or an equity participation by the Seller (except
that any ARD Mortgage Loan may provide for the accrual of the portion of interest in excess of the rate in effect prior to its
related Anticipated Repayment Date).
�

(20)REMIC. The Mortgage Loan is a �qualified mortgage� within the meaning of Section
860G(a)(3) of the Code (but determined without regard to the rule in Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-2(f)(2) that treats certain
defective mortgage loans as qualified mortgages), and, accordingly, (A) the issue price of the Mortgage Loan to the related Mortgagor
at origination did not exceed the non-contingent principal amount of the Mortgage Loan and (B) either: (a) such Mortgage Loan is
secured by an interest in real property (including buildings and structural components thereof, but excluding personal property)
having a fair market value (i) at the date the Mortgage Loan (or related Loan Combination) was originated at least equal to 80%
of the adjusted issue price of the Mortgage Loan (or related Loan Combination) on such date or (ii) at the Closing Date at least
equal to 80% of the adjusted issue price of the Mortgage Loan (or related Loan Combination) on such date, provided that for purposes
hereof, the fair market value of the real property interest must first be reduced by (A) the amount of any lien on the real property
interest that is senior to the Mortgage Loan and (B) a proportionate amount of any lien that is in parity with the Mortgage Loan;
or (b)�substantially all of the proceeds of such Mortgage Loan were used to acquire, improve or protect the real property
which served as the only security for such Mortgage Loan (other than a recourse feature or other third-party credit enhancement
within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-2(a)(1)(ii)). If the Mortgage Loan was �significantly modified�
prior to the Closing Date so as to result in a taxable exchange under Section 1001 of the Code, it either (x) was modified as a
result of the default or reasonably foreseeable default of such Mortgage Loan or (y) satisfies the provisions of either sub-clause
(B)(a)(i) above (substituting the date of the last such modification for the date the Mortgage Loan was originated) or sub-clause
(B)(a)(ii), including the proviso thereto. Any prepayment premium and yield maintenance charges applicable to the Mortgage Loan
constitute �customary prepayment penalties� within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 
�


B-8
�
�
1.860G-1(b)(2).
All terms used in this paragraph shall have the same meanings as set forth in the related Treasury Regulations.
�

(21)Compliance with Usury Laws. The Mortgage Rate (exclusive of any default interest, late charges,
yield maintenance charge, or prepayment premiums) of such Mortgage Loan complied as of the date of origination with, or was exempt
from, applicable state or federal laws, regulations and other requirements pertaining to usury.
�

(22)Authorized to do Business. To the extent required under applicable law, as of the Cut-Off
Date or as of the date that such entity held the Mortgage Note, each holder of the Mortgage Note was authorized to originate, acquire
and/or hold (as applicable) the Mortgage Note in the jurisdiction in which each related Mortgaged Property is located, or the failure
to be so authorized does not materially and adversely affect the enforceability of such Mortgage Loan by the Trust.
�

(23)Trustee under Deed of Trust. With respect to each Mortgage which is a deed of trust, as
of the date of origination and, to the Seller�s knowledge, as of the Closing Date, a trustee, duly qualified under applicable
law to serve as such, currently so serves and is named in the deed of trust or has been substituted in accordance with the Mortgage
and applicable law or may be substituted in accordance with the Mortgage and applicable law by the related Mortgagee.
�

(24)Local Law Compliance. To the Seller�s knowledge, based upon any of a letter from any
governmental authorities, a legal opinion, an architect�s letter, a zoning consultant�s report, an endorsement to the
related Title Policy, a survey or other affirmative investigation of local law compliance consistent with the investigation conducted
by the Seller for similar commercial and multifamily mortgage loans intended for securitization, there are no material violations
of applicable zoning ordinances, building codes and land laws (collectively �Zoning Regulations�) with respect
to the improvements located on or forming part of each Mortgaged Property securing a Mortgage Loan as of the date of origination
of such Mortgage Loan (or related Loan Combination, as applicable) or as of the Cut-Off Date, other than those which (i)�are
insured by the Title Policy or a law and ordinance insurance policy or (ii)�would not have a material adverse effect on the
value, operation or net operating income of the Mortgaged Property. The terms of the Loan Documents require the Mortgagor to comply
in all material respects with all applicable governmental regulations, zoning and building laws.
�

(25)Licenses and Permits. Each Mortgagor covenants in the Loan Documents that it shall keep
all material licenses, permits, franchises and applicable governmental authorizations necessary for its operation of the Mortgaged
Property in full force and effect, and to the Seller�s knowledge based upon any of a letter from any government authorities
or other affirmative investigation of local law compliance consistent with the investigation conducted by the Seller for similar
commercial and multifamily mortgage loans intended for securitization, all such material licenses, permits, franchises and applicable
governmental authorizations are in effect or the failure to obtain or maintain such material licenses, permits, franchises and
applicable governmental authorizations does not materially and adversely affect the use and/or operation of the Mortgaged Property
as 
�


B-9
�
�
it
was used and operated as of the date of origination of the related Mortgage Loan or the rights of a holder of the related Mortgage
Loan. The Mortgage Loan requires the related Mortgagor to be qualified to do business in the jurisdiction in which the related
Mortgaged Property is located.
�

(26)Recourse Obligations. The Loan Documents for each Mortgage Loan provide that such Mortgage
Loan (a) becomes full recourse to the Mortgagor and guarantor (which is a natural person or persons, or an entity distinct from
the Mortgagor (but may be affiliated with the Mortgagor) that has assets other than equity in the related Mortgaged Property that
are not de minimis) in any of the following events: (i) if any voluntary petition for bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution or liquidation
pursuant to federal bankruptcy law, or any similar federal or state law, shall be filed by the Mortgagor; (ii) the Mortgagor or
guarantor shall have colluded with (or, alternatively, solicited or caused to be solicited) other creditors to cause an involuntary
bankruptcy filing with respect to the Mortgagor or (iii) voluntary transfers of either the Mortgaged Property or equity interests
in Mortgagor made in violation of the Loan Documents; and (b) contains provisions providing for recourse against the Mortgagor
and guarantor (which is a natural person or persons, or an entity distinct from the Mortgagor (but may be affiliated with the Mortgagor)
that has assets other than equity in the related Mortgaged Property that are not de minimis), for losses and damages sustained
by reason of Mortgagor�s (i) misappropriation of rents after the occurrence of an event of default under the Mortgage Loan;
(ii) misappropriation of (A) insurance proceeds or condemnation awards or (B)�security deposits or, alternatively, the failure
of any security deposits to be delivered to Mortgagee upon foreclosure or action in lieu thereof (except to the extent applied
in accordance with leases prior to a Mortgage Loan event of default); (iii) fraud or intentional material misrepresentation; (iv)�breaches
of the environmental covenants in the Loan Documents; or (v) commission of intentional material physical waste at the Mortgaged
Property (but, in some cases, only to the extent there is sufficient cash flow generated by the related Mortgaged Property to prevent
such waste).
�

(27)Mortgage Releases. The terms of the related Mortgage or related Loan Documents do not provide
for release of any material portion of the Mortgaged Property from the lien of the Mortgage except (a) a partial release, accompanied
by principal repayment, of not less than a specified percentage at least equal to the lesser of (i)�110% of the related allocated
loan amount of such portion of the Mortgaged Property and (ii)�the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan, (b)�upon
payment in full of such Mortgage Loan, (c) upon a Defeasance defined in (32) below, (d) releases of out-parcels that are unimproved
or other portions of the Mortgaged Property which will not have a material adverse effect on the underwritten value of the Mortgaged
Property and which were not afforded any material value in the appraisal obtained at the origination of the Mortgage Loan and are
not necessary for physical access to the Mortgaged Property or compliance with zoning requirements, or (e) as required pursuant
to an order of condemnation or taking by a State or any political subdivision or authority thereof. With respect to any partial
release under the preceding clauses (a) or (d), either: (x)�such release of collateral (i)�would not constitute a �significant
modification� of the subject Mortgage Loan within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-2(b)(2) and (ii) would
not cause the subject Mortgage Loan to fail to be a �qualified mortgage� within the meaning of Section 
�


B-10
�
�
860G(a)(3)(A)
of the Code; or (y) the Mortgagee or servicer can, in accordance with the related Loan Documents, condition such release of collateral
on the related Mortgagor�s delivery of an opinion of tax counsel to the effect specified in the immediately preceding clause
(x). For purposes of the preceding clause (x), for all Mortgage Loans originated after December�6, 2010, if the fair market
value of the real property constituting such Mortgaged Property (reduced by (1) the amount of any lien on the real property that
is senior to the Mortgage Loan and (2) a proportionate amount of any lien on the real property that is in parity with the Mortgage
Loan) after the release is not equal to at least 80% of the principal balance of the Mortgage Loan (or related Loan Combination)
outstanding after the release, the Mortgagor is required to make a payment of principal in an amount not less than the amount
required by the REMIC Provisions.
�
With respect
to any partial release under the preceding clause (e), for all Mortgage Loans originated after December�6, 2010, the Mortgagor
can be required to pay down the principal balance of the Mortgage Loan (or related Loan Combination) in an amount not less than
the amount required by the REMIC Provisions and, to such extent, such amount may not be required to be applied to the restoration
of the Mortgaged Property or released to the Mortgagor, if, immediately after the release of such portion of the Mortgaged Property
from the lien of the Mortgage (but taking into account the planned restoration) the fair market value of the real property constituting
the remaining Mortgaged Property (reduced by (1) the amount of any lien on the real property that is senior to the Mortgage Loan
and (2) a proportionate amount of any lien on the real property that is in parity with the Mortgage Loan) is not equal to at least
80% of the remaining principal balance of the Mortgage Loan (or related Loan Combination).
�
No Mortgage
Loan originated after December 6, 2010 that is secured by more than one Mortgaged Property or that is cross-collateralized with
another Mortgage Loan permits the release of cross-collateralization of the related Mortgaged Properties or a portion thereof,
including due to partial condemnation, other than in compliance with the REMIC Provisions.
�

(28)Financial Reporting and Rent Rolls. The Loan Documents for each Mortgage Loan require the
Mortgagor to provide the owner or holder of the Mortgage with quarterly (other than for single-tenant properties) and annual operating
statements, and quarterly (other than for single-tenant properties) rent rolls for properties that have leases contributing more
than 5% of the in-place base rent and annual financial statements.
�

(29)Acts of Terrorism Exclusion.
With respect to each Mortgage Loan over $20�million, the related special-form all-risk insurance policy and business interruption
policy (issued by an insurer meeting the Insurance Rating Requirements) do not specifically exclude Acts of Terrorism, as defined
in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as amended by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007, and
as amended by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 (collectively referred to as �TRIA�),
from coverage, or if such coverage is excluded, it is covered by a separate terrorism insurance policy. With respect to each other
Mortgage Loan, the related special all-risk insurance policy and business interruption policy (issued by an insurer meeting the
Insurance Rating Requirements) did not, as of the date of origination of the Mortgage
�


B-11
�
�
Loan,
and, to the Seller�s knowledge, do not, as of the Cut-Off Date, specifically exclude Acts of Terrorism, as defined in TRIA,
from coverage, or if such coverage is excluded, it is covered by a separate terrorism insurance policy. With respect to each Mortgage
Loan, the related Loan Documents do not expressly waive or prohibit the Mortgagee from requiring coverage for Acts of Terrorism,
as defined in TRIA, or damages related thereto; provided, however, that if TRIA or a similar or subsequent statute
is not in effect, then, provided that terrorism insurance is commercially available, the Mortgagor under each Mortgage Loan is
required to carry terrorism insurance, but in such event the Mortgagor shall not be required to spend more than the Terrorism
Cap Amount on terrorism insurance coverage, and if the cost of terrorism insurance exceeds the Terrorism Cap Amount, the Mortgagor
is required to purchase the maximum amount of terrorism insurance available with funds equal to the Terrorism Cap Amount. The
�Terrorism Cap Amount� is the specified percentage (which is at least equal to 200%) of the amount of the insurance
premium that is payable at such time in respect of the property and business interruption/rental loss insurance required under
the related Loan Documents (without giving effect to the cost of terrorism and earthquake components of such casualty and business
interruption/rental loss insurance).
�

(30)Due on Sale or Encumbrance.
Subject to specific exceptions set forth below, each Mortgage Loan contains a �due on sale� or other such provision
for the acceleration of the payment of the unpaid principal balance of such Mortgage Loan if, without the consent of the holder
of the Mortgage (which consent, in some cases, may not be unreasonably withheld) and/or complying with the requirements of the
related Loan Documents (which provide for transfers without the consent of the Mortgagee which are customarily acceptable to prudent
commercial and multifamily mortgage lending institutions lending on the security of property comparable to the related Mortgaged
Property, including, without limitation, transfers of worn-out or obsolete furnishings, fixtures, or equipment promptly replaced
with property of equivalent value and functionality and transfers by leases entered into in accordance with the Loan Documents),
(a) the related Mortgaged Property, or any equity interest of greater than 50% in the related Mortgagor, is directly or indirectly
pledged, transferred or sold, other than as related to (i) family and estate planning transfers or transfers upon death or legal
incapacity, (ii) transfers to certain affiliates as defined in the related Loan Documents, (iii) transfers of less than, or other
than, a controlling interest in the related Mortgagor, (iv) transfers to another holder of direct or indirect equity in the Mortgagor,
a specific Person designated in the related Loan Documents or a Person satisfying specific criteria identified in the related
Loan Documents, such as a qualified equityholder, (v)�transfers of stock or similar equity units in publicly traded companies
or (vi) a substitution or release of collateral within the parameters of paragraphs (27) and (32) of this Exhibit B or
the exceptions thereto set forth on Exhibit�C, or (vii) as set forth on Exhibit B-30-1 by reason of any mezzanine
debt that existed at the origination of the related Mortgage Loan, or future permitted mezzanine debt as set forth on Exhibit
B-30-2 or (b) the related Mortgaged Property is encumbered with a subordinate lien or security interest against the related
Mortgaged Property, other than (i)�any Companion Loan of any Mortgage Loan or any subordinate debt that existed at origination
and is permitted under the related Loan Documents, (ii) purchase money security interests�(iii) any Mortgage Loan that is
cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with another Mortgage Loan, as set forth on
�


B-12
�
�
Exhibit�B-30-3 or (iv) Permitted Encumbrances. The Mortgage or other Loan Documents provide that to the extent any Rating Agency fees are
incurred in connection with the review of and consent to any transfer or encumbrance, the Mortgagor is responsible for such payment
along with all other reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by the Mortgagee relative to such transfer or encumbrance.
�

(31)Single-Purpose Entity. Each Mortgage Loan requires the Mortgagor to be a Single-Purpose
Entity for at least as long as the Mortgage Loan is outstanding. Both the Loan Documents and (with respect to each Mortgage Loan
with a Cut-Off Date Balance in excess of $10 million) the organizational documents of the Mortgagor provide that the Mortgagor
is a Single-Purpose Entity, and each Mortgage Loan with a Cut-Off Date Balance of $30 million or more has a counsel�s opinion
regarding non-consolidation of the Mortgagor. For this purpose, a �Single-Purpose Entity� shall mean an entity,
other than an individual, whose organizational documents (or if the Mortgage Loan has a Cut-Off Date Balance equal to $10 million
or less, its organizational documents or the related Loan Documents) provide substantially to the effect that it was formed or
organized solely for the purpose of owning and operating one or more of the Mortgaged Properties securing the Mortgage Loans and
prohibit it from engaging in any business unrelated to such Mortgaged Property or Properties, and whose organizational documents
further provide, or which entity represented in the related Loan Documents, substantially to the effect that it does not have any
assets other than those related to its interest in and operation of such Mortgaged Property or Properties, or any indebtedness
other than as permitted by the related Mortgage(s) or the other related Loan Documents, that it has its own books and records and
accounts separate and apart from those of any other person (other than a Mortgagor for a Mortgage Loan that is cross-collateralized
and cross-defaulted with the related Mortgage Loan), and that it holds itself out as a legal entity, separate and apart from any
other person or entity.
�

(32)Defeasance. With respect to any Mortgage Loan that, pursuant to the Loan Documents, can
be defeased (a �Defeasance�), (i) the Loan Documents provide for defeasance as a unilateral right of the Mortgagor,
subject to satisfaction of conditions specified in the Loan Documents; (ii) the Mortgage Loan cannot be defeased within two years
after the Closing Date; (iii) the Mortgagor is permitted to pledge only United States �government securities� within
the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-2(a)(8)(ii), the revenues from which will, in the case of a full Defeasance,
be sufficient to make all scheduled payments under the Mortgage Loan when due, including the entire remaining principal balance
(A) on the maturity date, (B) on or after the first date on which payment may be made without payment of a yield maintenance charge
or prepayment penalty or (C) if the Mortgage Loan is an ARD Mortgage Loan, on the related Anticipated Repayment Date, and if the
Mortgage Loan permits partial releases of real property in connection with partial defeasance, the revenues from the collateral
will be sufficient to pay all such scheduled payments calculated on a principal amount equal to a specified percentage at least
equal to the lesser of (A)�110% of the allocated loan amount for the real property to be released and (B)�the outstanding
principal balance of the Mortgage Loan; (iv) the defeasance collateral is not permitted to be subject to prepayment, call, or early
redemption; (v) the Mortgagor is required to provide a certification from an independent certified public accountant that the collateral
is sufficient to make all

(33)Fixed Interest Rates. Each Mortgage Loan bears interest at a rate that remains fixed throughout
the remaining term of such Mortgage Loan, except in the case of ARD Mortgage Loans and in situations where default interest is
imposed.
�

(34)Ground Leases. For purposes of this Exhibit B, a �Ground Lease� shall
mean a lease creating a leasehold estate in real property where the fee owner as the ground lessor conveys for a term or terms
of years its entire interest in the land and buildings and other improvements, if any, comprising the premises demised under such
lease to the ground lessee (who may, in certain circumstances, own the building and improvements on the land), subject to the reversionary
interest of the ground lessor as fee owner and does not include industrial development agency (IDA) or similar leases for purposes
of conferring a tax abatement or other benefit.
�
With respect
to any Mortgage Loan where the Mortgage Loan is secured by a leasehold estate under a Ground Lease in whole or in part, and the
related Mortgage does not also encumber the related lessor�s fee interest in such Mortgaged Property, based upon the terms
of the Ground Lease and any estoppel or other agreement received from the ground lessor in favor of the Seller, its successors
and assigns, the Seller represents and warrants that:
�

(a)The Ground Lease or a memorandum regarding such Ground
Lease has been duly recorded or submitted for recordation in a form that is acceptable for recording in the applicable jurisdiction.
The Ground Lease or an estoppel or other agreement received from the ground lessor permits the interest of the lessee to be encumbered
by the related Mortgage and does not restrict the use of the related Mortgaged Property by such lessee, its successors or assigns
in a manner that would materially adversely affect the security provided by the related Mortgage. No material change in the terms
of the Ground Lease had occurred since the origination of the Mortgage Loan, except as reflected in any written instruments which
are included in the related Mortgage File;

�

(b)The lessor under such Ground Lease has agreed in a writing
included in the related Mortgage File (or in such Ground Lease) that the Ground Lease may not be amended or modified, or canceled
or terminated by agreement of lessor and lessee, without the prior written consent of the Mortgagee;

�


B-14
�
�

(c)The Ground Lease has an original term (or an original
term plus one or more optional renewal terms, which, under all circumstances, may be exercised, and will be enforceable, by either
Mortgagor or the Mortgagee) that extends not less than twenty (20) years beyond the stated maturity of the related Mortgage Loan,
or ten (10) years past the stated maturity if such Mortgage Loan fully amortizes by the stated maturity (or with respect to a
Mortgage Loan that accrues on an Actual/360 Basis, substantially amortizes);

�

(d)The Ground Lease either (i) is not subject to any liens
or encumbrances superior to, or of equal priority with, the Mortgage, except for the related fee interest of the ground lessor
and the Permitted Encumbrances, or (ii) �is subject to a subordination, non-disturbance and attornment agreement to which
the Mortgagee on the lessor�s fee interest in the Mortgaged Property is subject;

�

(e)The Ground Lease does not place commercially unreasonable
restrictions on the identity of the Mortgagee and the Ground Lease is assignable to the holder of the Mortgage Loan and its successors
and assigns without the consent of the lessor thereunder (provided that proper notice is delivered to the extent required in accordance
with the Ground Lease), and in the event it is so assigned, it is further assignable by the holder of the Mortgage Loan and its
successors and assigns without the consent of (but with prior notice to) the lessor;

�

(f)The Seller has not received any written notice of material
default under or notice of termination of such Ground Lease. To the Seller�s knowledge, there is no material default under
such Ground Lease and no condition that, but for the passage of time or giving of notice, would result in a material default under
the terms of such Ground Lease and to the Seller�s knowledge, such Ground Lease is in full force and effect as of the Closing
Date;

�

(g)The Ground Lease or ancillary agreement between the
lessor and the lessee requires the lessor to give to the Mortgagee written notice of any default, and provides that no notice
of default or termination is effective against the Mortgagee unless such notice is given to the Mortgagee;

�

(h)The Mortgagee is permitted a reasonable opportunity
(including, where necessary, sufficient time to gain possession of the interest of the lessee under the Ground Lease through legal
proceedings) to cure any default under the Ground Lease which is curable after the Mortgagee�s receipt of notice of any
default before the lessor may terminate the Ground Lease;

�

(i)The Ground Lease does not impose any restrictions on
subletting that would be viewed as commercially unreasonable by a prudent commercial mortgage lender;

�

(j)Under the terms of the Ground Lease, an estoppel or
other agreement received from the ground lessor and the related Mortgage (taken together), any related insurance proceeds or the
portion of the condemnation award allocable to the ground lessee�s interest (other than (i) de minimis amounts for minor
casualties or 

�


B-15
�
�
(ii)
in respect of a total or substantially total loss or taking as addressed in subpart (k)) will be applied either to the repair
or to restoration of all or part of the related Mortgaged Property with (so long as such proceeds are in excess of the threshold
amount specified in the related Loan Documents) the Mortgagee or a trustee appointed by it having the right to hold and disburse
such proceeds as repair or restoration progresses, or to the payment of the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan,
together with any accrued interest;
�

(k)In the case of a total or substantially total taking
or loss, under the terms of the Ground Lease, an estoppel or other agreement and the related Mortgage (taken together), any related
insurance proceeds, or portion of the condemnation award allocable to the ground lessee�s interest in respect of a total
or substantially total loss or taking of the related Mortgaged Property to the extent not applied to restoration, will be applied
first to the payment of the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan, together with any accrued interest; and

�

(l)Provided that the Mortgagee cures any defaults which
are susceptible to being cured, the ground lessor has agreed to enter into a new lease with the Mortgagee upon termination of
the Ground Lease for any reason, including rejection of the Ground Lease in a bankruptcy proceeding.

�

(35)Servicing. The servicing and collection practices used by the Seller with respect to the
Mortgage Loan have been, in all respects, legal and have met customary industry standards for servicing of commercial loans for
conduit loan programs.
�

(36)Origination and Underwriting. The origination practices of the Seller (or the related originator
if the Seller was not the originator) with respect to each Mortgage Loan have been, in all material respects, legal and as of the
date of its origination, such Mortgage Loan (or the related Loan Combination, as applicable) and the origination thereof complied
in all material respects with, or was exempt from, all requirements of federal, state or local law relating to the origination
of such Mortgage Loan; provided that such representation and warranty does not address or otherwise cover any matters with respect
to federal, state or local law otherwise covered in this Exhibit�B.
�

(37)No Material Default; Payment Record.
No Mortgage Loan has been more than 30 days delinquent, without giving effect to any grace or cure period, in making required
debt service payments since origination and, as of the Cut-Off Date, no Mortgage Loan is more than 30 days delinquent (beyond
any applicable grace or cure period) in making required payments. To the Seller�s knowledge, there is (a) no material default,
breach, violation or event of acceleration existing under the related Mortgage Loan, or (b) no event (other than payments due
but not yet delinquent) which, with the passage of time or with notice and the expiration of any grace or cure period, would constitute
a material default, breach, violation or event of acceleration, which default, breach, violation or event of acceleration, in
the case of either (a) or (b), materially and adversely affects the value of the Mortgage Loan or the value, use or operation
of the related Mortgaged Property, provided, however, that this representation and warranty does not cover any default, breach,
violation or event of acceleration that specifically pertains to or arises out
�


B-16
�
�
of
an exception scheduled to any other representation and warranty made by the Seller in this Exhibit�B (including, but
not limited to, the prior sentence). No person other than the holder of such Mortgage Loan may declare any event of default under
the Mortgage Loan or accelerate any indebtedness under the Loan Documents.
�

(38)Bankruptcy. As of the date of origination of the related Mortgage Loan and to the Seller�s
knowledge as of the Cut-Off Date, neither the Mortgaged Property (other than any tenants of such Mortgaged Property), nor any portion
thereof, is the subject of, and no Mortgagor, guarantor or tenant occupying a single-tenant property is a debtor in a state or
federal bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding.
�

(39)Organization of Mortgagor. With respect to each Mortgage Loan, in reliance on certified
copies of the organizational documents of the Mortgagor delivered by the Mortgagor in connection with the origination of such Mortgage
Loan (or related Loan Combination, as applicable), the Mortgagor is an entity organized under the laws of a state of the United
States of America, the District of Columbia or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Except with respect to any Mortgage Loan that is
cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with another Mortgage Loan, no Mortgage Loan has a Mortgagor that is an affiliate of another
Mortgagor under another Mortgage Loan.
�

(40)Environmental Conditions. A Phase I environmental site assessment (or update of a previous
Phase I and or Phase II site assessment) and, with respect to certain Mortgage Loans, a Phase II environmental site assessment
(collectively, an �ESA�) meeting ASTM requirements were conducted by a reputable environmental consultant in
connection with such Mortgage Loan within 12 months prior to its origination date (or an update of a previous ESA was prepared),
and such ESA (i) did not identify the existence of recognized environmental conditions (as such term is defined in ASTM E1527-05
or its successor, an �Environmental Condition�) at the related Mortgaged Property or the need for further investigation,
or (ii)�if the existence of an Environmental Condition or need for further investigation was indicated in any such ESA, then
at least one of the following statements is true: (A)�an amount reasonably estimated by a reputable environmental consultant
to be sufficient to cover the estimated cost to cure any material noncompliance with applicable Environmental Laws or the Environmental
Condition has been escrowed by the related Mortgagor and is held or controlled by the related Mortgagee; (B) if the only Environmental
Condition relates to the presence of asbestos-containing materials, radon in indoor air, lead based paint or lead in drinking water,
the only recommended action in the ESA is the institution of such a plan, an operations or maintenance plan has been required to
be instituted by the related Mortgagor that, based on the ESA, can reasonably be expected to mitigate the identified risk; (C)�the
Environmental Condition identified in the related environmental report was remediated or abated in all material respects prior
to the date hereof, and, if and as appropriate, a no further action or closure letter was obtained from the applicable governmental
regulatory authority (or the environmental issue affecting the related Mortgaged Property was otherwise listed by such governmental
authority as �closed� or a reputable environmental consultant has concluded that no further action is required); (D)�an
environmental policy or a lender�s pollution legal liability insurance policy meeting the requirements set forth below that
covers liability for the identified circumstance or condition was obtained from an insurer 
�


B-17
�
�
rated
no less than A- (or the equivalent) by Moody�s Investors Service, Inc., Standard & Poor�s Ratings Services and/or
Fitch Ratings, Inc.; (E)�a party not related to the Mortgagor was identified as the responsible party for such condition
or circumstance and such responsible party has financial resources reasonably estimated to be adequate to address the situation;
or (F)�a party related to the Mortgagor having financial resources reasonably estimated to be adequate to address the situation
is required to take action. To the Seller�s knowledge, except as set forth in the ESA, there is no Environmental Condition
(as such term is defined in ASTM E1527-05 or its successor) at the related Mortgaged Property.
�

(41)Appraisal. The Mortgage File contains an appraisal of the related Mortgaged Property with
an appraisal date within six (6) months of the Mortgage Loan origination date, and within twelve (12) months of the Closing Date.
The appraisal is signed by an appraiser who is a Member of the Appraisal Institute (�MAI�) and, to the Seller�s
knowledge, had no interest, direct or indirect, in the Mortgaged Property or the Mortgagor or in any loan made on the security
thereof, and whose compensation is not affected by the approval or disapproval of the Mortgage Loan. Each appraiser has represented
in such appraisal or in a supplemental letter that the appraisal satisfies the requirements of the �Uniform Standards of
Professional Appraisal Practice� as adopted by the Appraisal Standards Board of the Appraisal Foundation. Each appraisal
contains a statement, or is accompanied by a letter from the appraiser, to the effect that the appraisal was performed in accordance
with the requirements of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, as in effect on the date such
Mortgage Loan was originated.
�

(42)Mortgage Loan Schedule. The information pertaining to each Mortgage Loan which is set forth
in the Mortgage Loan Schedule is true and correct in all material respects as of the Cut-Off Date and contains all information
required by the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to be contained therein.
�

(43)Cross-Collateralization. Except with respect to a Mortgage Loan that is part of a Loan Combination,
no Mortgage Loan is cross-collateralized or cross-defaulted with any other Mortgage Loan that is outside the Mortgage Pool, except
as set forth on Exhibit�B-30-3.
�

(44)Advance of Funds by the Seller. After origination, no advance of funds has been made by
the Seller to the related Mortgagor other than in accordance with the Loan Documents, and, to the Seller�s knowledge, no
funds have been received from any person other than the related Mortgagor or an affiliate for, or on account of, payments due on
the Mortgage Loan (other than as contemplated by the Loan Documents, such as, by way of example and not in limitation of the foregoing,
amounts paid by the tenant(s) into a Mortgagee-controlled lockbox if required or contemplated under the related lease or Loan Documents).
Neither the Seller nor any affiliate thereof has any obligation to make any capital contribution to any Mortgagor under a Mortgage
Loan, other than contributions made on or prior to the date hereof.
�

(45)Compliance with Anti-Money Laundering Laws. The Seller has complied in all material respects
with all applicable anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including 
�


B-18
�
�
without
limitation the USA Patriot Act of 2001 with respect to the origination of the Mortgage Loan.
�
For purposes of these
representations and warranties, �Mortgagee� means the mortgagee, grantee or beneficiary under any Mortgage, any holder
of legal title to any portion of any Mortgage Loan or, if applicable, any agent or servicer on behalf of such party.
�
For purposes of these
representations and warranties, the phrases �the Seller�s knowledge� or �the Seller�s belief�
and other words and phrases of like import mean, except where otherwise expressly set forth in these representations and warranties,

With respect to the Mortgaged Property known as UMIP N 107th Street, a vacant portion of the Mortgaged Property (the �Side Lot�) was purchased in January 2016 from a third party adjacent property owner. Documentation for a lot line adjustment to separate the tax parcels has been filed with the local authority and will take effect in December 2016, when 2017 tax bills are released. To mitigate risks associated with the Side Lot not being a separate tax lot from the third party land at closing, the lender has taken a tax escrow in an amount equal to two months of taxes, covering taxes for the entire tax parcel, including the portion still owned by the third-party seller. The borrower is required to replenish the tax escrow if it is ever used. The tax escrow will be released to the borrower once the lot line adjustment is effectuated and the borrower delivers an endorsement to the lender�s title policy that the Side Lot is a separate tax lot. Additionally,
the Loan Documents provide recourse from the borrower and guarantors for any losses the lender may suffer due to the fact that part of the Mortgaged Property is not on a separate tax lot.

carveout for losses has been added for failure to do so.

Fitch Rates Citigroup Commercial Mortgage Trust 2016-P6; Outlook Stable
























NEW YORK, Dec 15, 2016 (BUSINESS WIRE) --
Fitch rates Citigroup Commercial Mortgage Trust 2016-P6, Commercial 
      Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2016-P6. Fitch has assigned 
      ratings and Rating Outlooks. A full list of rating actions follows at 
      the end of this ratings action commentary.


                                        








KEY RATING DRIVERS


                                        








Fitch Leverage: The pool's leverage statistics are slightly worse than 
      those of other recent Fitch-rated, fixed-rate multiborrower 
      transactions. The pool's Fitch debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and 
      Fitch loan to value (LTV) of 1.17x and 108.9%, respectively, are 
      slightly worse than the year-to-date (YTD) 2016 averages of 1.20x and 
      105.5%. The Fitch stressed DSCR and LTV for the conduit portion of the 
      pool (net of investment-grade credit-opinion loans) are 1.14x and 
      112.2%, respectively.


                                        








Diverse Pool: The 10 largest loans comprise 44.9% of the pool, which is 
      better than the YTD average of 54.5% for other Fitch-rated multiborrower 
      deals. The largest loan in the pool is 8 Times Square & 1460 Broadway at 
      8.21% of the pool. The respective loan concentration index (LCI) and 
      sponsor concentration index (SCI) scores of 319 and 375 are better than 
      the YTD averages of 421 and 494 for other Fitch-rated multiborrower 
      deals.


                                        








Below-Average Amortization: Eleven loans comprising 42.3% of the pool 
      are full interest-only. This is worse than the average when compared to 
      other Fitch-rated U.S. multiborrower deals of 23.3% for 2015 and 32.1% 
      for YTD 2016. Additionally, there are 19 loans comprising 28.4% of the 
      pool which are partial interest-only, which is better than the 2015 and 
      YTD 2016 averages of 43.1% and 34.7%. Overall, the pool is scheduled to 
      pay down by 8.8% which is worse than average when compared with the 
      averages of 11.7% for 2015 and 10.5% YTD 2016 for other Fitch-rated U.S. 
      deals.


                                        








RATING SENSITIVITIES


                                        








For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 9.32% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI), for properties for which 
      a full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period. Unanticipated further declines in property-level NCF 
      could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted loans 
      and in potential rating actions on the certificates.


                                        








Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to CGCMT 2016-P6 
      certificates and found that the transaction displays average 
      sensitivities to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF 
      declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'A-sf' could result. In a more severe scenario, 
      in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBBsf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on page 12.


                                        








DUE DILIGENCE USAGE


                                        








Fitch was provided with due diligence information from KPMG LLP. The due 
      diligence focused on a comparison and re-computation of certain 
      characteristics with respect to each of the mortgage loans. Fitch 
      considered this information in its analysis and the findings did not 
      have an impact on our analysis. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E 
      received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be obtained 
      through the link contained on the bottom of the related rating action 
      commentary.

      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third-party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch’s ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.


                                        








The information in this report is provided “as is” without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to

      Fitch Assigns Final Ratings to Citigroup Commercial Mortgage Trust 
      2016-P3 CMT P-T Ctfs
    





April 13, 2016 05:23 PM Eastern Daylight Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings and Rating Outlooks to 
      Citigroup Commercial Mortgage Trust 2016-P3 Commercial Mortgage 
      Pass-Through Certificates:
    

      --$13,614,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$98,127,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$175,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$221,743,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;

      --$19,274,000a class E 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$9,637,000a class F 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      (a) Privately placed and pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      (b) Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      (c) The class A-S, class B and class C certificates may be exchanged for 
      class EC certificates, and class EC certificates may be exchanged for 
      the class A-S, class B and class C certificates.
    

      Fitch does not rate the $36,622,163a class G certificates.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 37 loans secured by 75 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $771 
      million as of the cutoff date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by Citigroup Commercial Mortgage Securities Inc., Natixis Real Estate 
      Capital LLC, Societe Generale, Macquarie US Trading LLC d/b/a Principal 
      Commercial Capital, The Bank of New York Mellon, and Walker & Dunlop 
      Commercial Property Funding I WF, LLC.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral 
      including site inspections on 79.5% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 90.8%, and asset summary reviews on 100% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      High Fitch Leverage: The pool demonstrates high leverage statistics with 
      a Fitch debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and loan-to-value (LTV) of 
      1.14x and 108.7%, respectively. Excluding the credit-opinion 225 Liberty 
      Street loan (5.3% of the pool), the Fitch DSCR and LTV are 1.12x and 
      111.4%, respectively. The 2015 and YTD 2016 average DSCRs were 1.18x and 
      1.14x, respectively. The 2015 and YTD 2016 average Fitch LTVs were 
      109.3% and 108.7%, respectively.
    

      New York City Concentration: Ten loans (39.2% of the pool) are secured 
      by properties located in the New York MSA, including six of the top 10. 
      Nyack College NYC, 600 Broadway, 79 Madison Avenue, 5 Penn Plaza and 225 
      Liberty Street are located in Manhattan. One Court Square is located in 
      Long Island City, Queens.
    

      Below-Average Amortization: The pool is scheduled to amortize 6.8% of 
      the initial pool balance prior to maturity, significantly lower than the 
      2015 and YTD 2016 averages of 11.7% and 10%, respectively. Twelve loans 
      (47.4%) are full-term, interest-only, and 13 loans (37%) are 
      partial-interest-only. The remaining 12 loans (15.6%) are amortizing 
      balloon loans with terms of five to 10 years.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 12% below the most 
      recent year's NOI (for properties for which a full-year NOI was 
      provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing during this 
      period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level NCF could 
      result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted loans, and 
      could lead to potential rating actions on the certificates.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to CGCMT 2016-P3 
      certificates and found that the transaction displays average sensitivity 
      to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF declined a 
      further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' 
      certificates to 'A-sf' could result. In a more severe scenario, in which 
      NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB+sf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on page 10.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from 
      Deloitte & Touche LLP. The third-party due diligence information was 
      provided on Form ABS Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and 
      re-computation of certain characteristics with respect to each of the 37 
      mortgage loans. Fitch considered this information in its analysis and 
      the findings did not have an impact on our analysis. A copy of the ABS 
      Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this 
      transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the bottom of 
      the related rating action commentary.

Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
