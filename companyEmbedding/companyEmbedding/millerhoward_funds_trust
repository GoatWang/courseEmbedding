				Names with trims or sells during the year will result in a Statement of Sale to be included with the K-1 package; the Statement of Sale determines adjustments to basis, which together with Form 1099 from the custodian determines profit and loss of MLPs.
			

			Telephone and fax numbers for each MLP can be found at www.taxpackagesupport.com or www.partnerdatalink.com.
				
Finally, please take a look at our client-approved MLP Primer. The MLP Primer, along with other client-approved material, is available at www.mhinvest.com/mlps.




				This presentation is to report on the investment strategies as reported by Miller/Howard Investments and is for illustration purposes only. The information contained herein is obtained from multiple sources and believed to be reliable. Information has not been verified by any custodian, brokerage firm or financial institution, and may differ from documents created by the brokerage firm. For additional information on other programs, please speak to your Financial Advisor.
			
Risk Factors to consider when investing in MLPs:

Cash distributions are not guaranteed and may fluctuate with the MLP's operating or business performance.
MLPs typically have a General Partner that maintains an aggregate 2% General Partner interest. Unit holders will have limited voting rights and do not own an interest in, vote with, or control the General Partner. The General Partner often cannot be removed without its own consent, and the General Partner has conflicts of interest and limited fiduciary responsibilities which may permit it to favor its own interests to the detriment of unit holders.
The MLP may issue additional common units, diluting existing unit holders’ interests.
Unit holders may be required to pay taxes on income from the MLP even if they do not receive cash distributions.
The IRS could reclassify the MLP as a taxable entity, which could reduce the cash available for distribution to unit holders.
If at any time the GP owns 85% or more of the issued and outstanding limited partner interests, the GP will have the right to purchase all of the limited partnership interests not held by the GP at a price that may be undesirable.


MLP Tax Considerations: The tax treatment for investors in MLPs is different than that of an investment in stock, including (a) the investor's share of the MLP's income, deductions and expenses are reported on Schedule K-1, not Form 1099, (b) because of the possibility of unrelated business taxable income, charitable remainder trusts should not invest in this strategy, and other non-taxable investors (such as ERISA and IRA accounts) should carefully consider whether to invest in this strategy, (c) investors may have to file income tax returns in states in which the MLP's do business and (d) MLP tax information is sent directly from the partnership which generally has until April 15th to provide this information. You should discuss these and any other tax implications with your tax advisor.

Non-performance based criteria have been used to select the securities listed. The past performance of these stocks is no guarantee of future results.

Strategies / Income-Equity Strategy 
											



Income-Equity Strategy






Portfolio Highlights 






Unfixed Income
									Portfolio companies pay and grow dividends, providing high current income and increasing income over time. By focusing on dividend growth, we help clients meet income needs today and in the future.
							

Dividend Growth — A better “Analyst” than Analysts
								Dividend and dividend increases help confirm past and current financial reports and are one of the best signals from management about current and future prospects for a company.
							

Diversified Compounding Machine 
								Over time, it is compounding income — not style, sector, or asset classes — that is a main driver of long-term returns. Investors can reinvest income and dollar cost average, earning on both their original investments and also on their earnings.
							

 

 
 

Portfolio Overview




Income-Equity Strategy is a diversified, dividend-growth equity portfolio that seeks high current dividend income plus growth of income and principal. Stocks are primarily US based, multi-cap companies from across the broad equity market. In the portfolio, 25% can be invested in foreign stocks that trade on US exchanges (ADRs) and up to 25% can be exchange-traded Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs).
This strategy has the potential to provide “unfixed income” from stocks with high current yields and growth of cash flow from dividends. Investors seeking solid total returns that comprise both income and growth, high current income that may increase every year, potential for inflation protection, and a lower federal tax rate on qualified dividends will find this strategy attractive. Because this version of Income-Equity includes MLPs, it will generate K-1 tax reports.
 

 
 

Investment Philosophy




Consistent with our firm philosophy, this portfolio invests in financially strong companies with rising dividends. Our disciplined investment process focuses on compounding income — not style, sector, or asset allocation — which is the main driver of long-term returns. Many studies, including our own, show that dividend-paying stocks have historically outperformed non-dividend-paying stocks, and companies that increase their dividends tend to perform the best. Stock prices may fluctuate, but dividends, when paid, are always positive. And unlike bonds (with static income), equities with growth of income help protect investors from the ravages of inflation. Even a “tame” inflation rate of 2.5% can destroy almost two thirds of an investor's purchasing power over 20 years.

 

 
 

Portfolio Objective




Our investment objective is to provide high current income, growth of income, and growth of principal as conservatively as possible while investing in the equity markets. We seek to add value to our clients’ overall investments by lowering volatility, raising the income level, and enhancing total return.
 

 
 

Portfolio Strategy




This portfolio, as with all of our strategies, is team managed. We invest in stocks with solid financial strength (investment grade or better) and moderately steady growth. Our holdings have consistent and reliable business models and a history of high and rising dividends that we project will continue to grow. We focus on essential services, low-cost producers, niche companies, and companies with outstanding consistency in their earnings and dividends. This helps ensure that return expectations are realistic and achievable. Stocks are sold when: a company fails to increase dividends with no reasonable excuse; there is deterioration in a company's fundamentals; a stock exhibits extended overvaluation; there is a negative impact from a regulatory decision; or we need to make room for a more attractive investment.

Firm / Our History 
										



Our History
Miller/Howard Investments Inc. was founded in 1984 as an institutional research firm providing quantitative and technical research on large-capitalization stocks to clients such as Fidelity, CIGNA, USF&G, Delta Airlines, John Templeton, George Soros, Federal Express, and many others.* In 1989, while investigating alternatives to traditional fixed-income vehicles, we conducted a landmark study of the long-term returns of utilities as an asset class. Our research revealed the income-generating, wealth-building potential of dividends over the long term. Based on these findings, we began managing our first utilities portfolio in 1991 founded on our philosophy that internal compounding (high current dividend income plus dividend growth) is the key to building long-term wealth. We hold to the adage, “slow and steady wins the race.”

Founder Lowell Miller, a leading expert on utilities, energy, and listed infrastructure as well as broad market dividend-growth companies, has been a keynote speaker and member of many industry panels, has appeared on Louis Rukeyser's Wall $treet Week and Bloomberg TV, and is regularly quoted in the national financial media. The strong investment team we have built has more than 150 years of combined investment experience.
Our evolution has been significantly influenced by the results of our utility study and the concept of a repeating-business model. In May 1997, we initiated the Income-Equity Strategy, which expands that model to nearly all sectors of the market and emphasizes stable companies that have a high current yield, rising dividend, and that may contain a hidden “growth kicker” that's not built into the stock's price.
Miller/Howard continues to evolve with development of disciplined investment strategies that provide investors with various levels of current income and dividend growth generated by companies with real assets, such as MLPs, companies that provide essential services, and broad market, dividend-focused stocks.

Why Strategic Indexes?
Miller/Howard Strategic Indexes is a subsidiary of Miller/Howard Investments Inc., a boutique asset management firm focused on income-producing equities and the entire energy vertical for more than 25 years. Our investment focus, since inception, has been on high-quality companies that not only pay a high dividend yield, but also have the potential to grow their dividends at above-market averages. We seek both income and opportunities for growth of principal in a single investment.
Our indexes seek to capture and distill all we have learned over nearly a quarter century of active management of dividend and energy infrastructure companies. Our strategic, rules-based indexes are created to enhance current passive approaches to asset allocation.
The indexes are designed to go beyond market exposure by applying persistent, strategic factors we have observed and confirmed through our active management. They find and retain the "good," as opposed to cap-weighted indexes, which in our view hold the good, the bad, and the ugly—by their very nature and definition.
In addition to their "everything but the kitchen sink" approach, traditional market-capitalization-weighted indexes tend to overweight overvalued stocks that have appreciated in price. Miller/Howard Strategic Indexes seeks to improve on this model by equal weighting, and by limiting constituent selection to those companies that share distinct, positive, fundamental factors such as dividend growth, yield, valuation, and profitability—all through a disciplined rules-based process with regular rebalancing.

ESG / Environmental Social Governance 
										



Environmental Social Governance

Socially Responsible Investing (SRI) is a commonly used phrase that describes the integration of environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) criteria with financial standards when making investment decisions. Miller/Howard Investments Inc. believes, as do many others, that this integrated approach provides a framework for achieving better long-term investment returns while building sustainable global economies and markets.  Our first SRI strategy ("Better than Bonds", now Miller/Howard Infrastructure) debuted in 1991, giving us more than 25 years of experience unique among many asset managers.
		

We engage in rigorous analysis of companies using ESG criteria, establishing and maintaining individual company profiles both before and after investment.
		

Our initial, pre-investment ESG research involves an extensive process that utilizes exclusion and preference screens as well as case-by-case analysis. A company must pass this evaluation in order to be eligible for investment in our SRI portfolios. We view this layer of due diligence as an essential SRI risk-control measure.
		

Our second stage of research is conducted on all SRI holdings quarterly: We update the company profiles, looking for best practices on ESG markers (e.g. ethical, transparent governance and established principles of environmental stewardship). We use these profiles to monitor company progress on the markers, and to identify opportunities for commendation and engagement.
		
 
Our shareholder advocacy program is multi-faceted and goes beyond the profiling of companies: We participate in shareholder activism, carefully vote proxies, regularly publish a shareholder advocacy newsletter, and support organizations or managers leading shareholder resolutions whenever in alignment with our portfolio holdings and policies. (See our Proxy Policy, which explains how a client can obtain the voting history.)

Fund Risks
		The market price of equity securities may be affected by financial market, industry, or issuer-specific events. Focus on a particular style or on small or medium-sized companies may enhance that risk.
The Miller/Howard High Income Equity Fund is a closed-end fund traded on the New York Exchange (Symbol HIE). Shares must be purchased through a professional financial advisor.

There is no guarantee that the portfolio will meet its objective.

Shares of closed-end investment companies such as the Fund may trade in the market above, at, or below net asset value. This characteristic is a risk separate and distinct from the
risk that the Fund’s net asset value could decline. The Fund is not able to predict whether its shares will trade above, below, or at net asset value in the future.

Leverage Risk. The use of leverage, which can be described as exposure to changes in price at a ratio greater than the amount of equity invested magnifies both the favorable and
unfavorable effects of price movements in the investments made by the Fund. The Fund’s use of leverage in its investment operations subjects it to substantial risk of loss.

Before investing you should carefully consider the Fund's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. The prospectus contains this and additional information regarding the Fund. To obtain a prospectus, please download from this site or call 1-844-MHFUNDS. The prospectus should be read carefully before investing.


An investment in the Miller/Howard Funds is subject to risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Funds risks also include, but are not limited to, the following:

	
			Companies that issue dividend yielding equity securities are not required to continue to pay dividends on such stock. The Funds may be exposed to liquidity risk that effect the Funds' ability to sell particular securities or close call option positions at an advantageous price or in a timely manner. The Funds invest in small and medium size companies, which carry greater risk than with larger, more established companies.
		
	
			MLP entities are typically focused in the energy, natural resources and real estate sectors of the economy. A downturn in the energy, natural resources or real estate sectors of the economy could have an adverse impact on the Fund. Changes to current tax law and regulations could affect the treatment of distributions, including (but limited to) ordinary income, capital gains or return of contribution. The Funds are new with limited operating history and there can be no assurance that the Funds will grow to or maintain an economically viable size.		
		
	
			An investment in the Miller/Howard Income-Equity Fund is also subject to the following: Non-US markets may be smaller, less liquid and more volatile than the major markets in the United States and, as a result, Fund share values may be more volatile. Trading in non-US markets typically involves higher expense than trading in the United States. The Fund may have difficulties enforcing its legal or contractual rights in a foreign country. These additional risks may be heightened for securities of companies located in, or with significant operations in emerging market countries.
		
	
			An investment in the Miller/Howard Drill Bit to Burner Tip® Fund is subject to the following: The Fund's focus on the securities that are the beneficiaries of the North American energy value chain presents more risk than if it were more broadly diversified over additional industries and sectors of the economy. General problems of energy companies include volatile fluctuations in price and supply of energy fuels, international politics, terrorist attacks, reserve and depletion risk and reduced demand.

Morningstar® Sustainability Rating™ 

	
				The Morningstar® Sustainability Rating™ is intended to measure how well the issuing companies of the securities within a fund's portfolio are managing their environmental, social, and governance ("ESG") risks and opportunities relative to the fund's Morningstar® category peers. The Morningstar Sustainability Rating™ calculation is a two-step process. First, each fund with at least 50% of assets covered by a company-level ESG score from Sustainalytics8 receives a Morningstar Portfolio Sustainability Score.™
			
	
				The Morningstar® Portfolio Sustainability Score™ is an asset-weighted average of normalized company-level ESG scores with deductions made for controversial incidents by the issuing companies, such as environmental accidents, fraud, or discriminatory behavior.
			
	
				The Morningstar® Sustainability Rating™ is then assigned to all scored funds within Morningstar® Categories in which at least ten (10) funds receive a Portfolio Sustainability Score and is determined by each fund's rank within the following distribution:




High (highest 10%)
Above Average (next 22.5%)




Average (next 35%)
Below Average (next 22.5%) and




Low (lowest 10%)




	
				The Morningstar Sustainability Rating™ is depicted by globe icons where High equals 5 globes and Low equals 1 globe.
			
	
				A Sustainability Rating is assigned to any fund that has more than half of its underlying assets rated by Sustainalytics and is within a Morningstar Category with at least 10 scored funds; therefore, the rating it is not limited to funds with explicit sustainable or responsible investment mandates. Morningstar updates its Sustainability Ratings monthly. Portfolios receive a Morningstar Portfolio Sustainability Score and Sustainability Rating one month and six business days after their reported as-of date based on the most recent portfolio. As part of the evaluation process, Morningstar uses Sustainalytics' ESG scores from the same month as the portfolio as-of date.
			
	
				Please visit http://corporate1.morningstar.com/SustainableInvesting/ for more detailed information about the Morningstar Sustainability Rating™ and its calculation. 
			

Sustainability Score and Sustainability Rating as of March 31, 2017. Sustainalytics provides company-level analysis used in the calculation of Morningstar's® Sustainability Score. Sustainability Mandate information is derived from the fund prospectus.

Strategies / Strategy Summary 
										



Miller/Howard Investment Strategies


 





Income-Equity Strategies






There are two versions of the strategy:




Income-Equity Strategy with exchange-traded Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs).
								

Income-Equity Strategy (No MLPs), which does not generate K-1 tax forms from MLPs.
								

 

Key features:




A multi-cap core portfolio of high-quality stocks
							focused on high current dividend income and dividend growth, composed of reliable companies from across the broad market.
								

Conservative stocks (average debt rating above investment grade) that are high yield and projected to have a rising stream of income.
								

Solid total returns that provide both income and growth, high current income that increases every year, and a lower federal tax rate on qualified dividends.							
								

 
 

 
 

MLP Strategy







A mid-large-cap portfolio primarily composed of high-quality pipelines and energy facilities with high annual distributions that we project will have strong prospects for growth of distributions. 
								

The portfolio comprises Master Limited Partnerships with long-life assets and projects as well as durable and stable business models that can generate substantial cash flow to provide attractive yields for the investor while allowing for long-term organic growth.
								Read more about the MLP Strategy.
								

 
 

 
 

Miller/Howard Infrastructure







A mid-large-cap portfolio of energy and utilities focusing on opportunities in the broad utilities sector: electric, gas, telephone, sanitation, water, and the suppliers that enable their transmission, operation, and growth.


Focused on opportunities in the broad, global utilities industry, this portfolio seeks to participate in the dynamic growth potential of the most important economic sector (essential services and infrastructure, worldwide).
								Read more about Miller/Howard Infrastructure.
							

 
 

 
 

Miller/Howard Utilities Plus







A mid-cap, opportunistic portfolio focused on distribution gas and electric utility companies that we believe are likely acquisition candidates.
							

Companies are conservative, largely regulated, old-style rate-of-return monopolies that pay and steadily grow dividends.
						Read more about Miller/Howard Utilities Plus.
							

 
 

 
 

Rising Dividend Plus







A large-cap core strategy invested in established and seasoned companies with high financial strength and high projected dividend growth.
							

Companies considered likely to provide steadily growing earnings and dividends. This fundamentally driven strategy utilizes momentum and technical analysis in the investment process.
						
Read more about Rising Dividend Plus.
							

 
 

 
 

High-Yield Equity







A high-yield equity portfolio invested in companies that have among the highest dividends in the market.
							

We created this strategy to produce the highest possible income from stocks with reasonable safety and without securities that generate K-1 reports. We expect stocks in this portfolio to continue to pay, and potentially raise, their dividends.					
							

Strategy is diversified by industry, quality, and financial strength.
					Read more about High-Yield Equity.					
							

 
 

 
 

Drill Bit to Burner Tip®







A single-themed, balanced equity strategy that takes advantage of diverse opportunities all along the natural gas value chain, including producers, processors, transporters, and users.
							

Rapid growth and expanding demand characterize this "bipartisan fuel," which is taking the place of coal as the best source of electric generation. Holdings provide steady and rising income, with numerous opportunities for capital appreciation.
						
					Read more about Drill Bit to Burner Tip®.
							

 
 

 
 

Miller/Howard General Partners Strategy







Midstream energy with No K-1s. Midstream companies are the link between energy production and energy use. This strategy invests in exchange-traded General Partners that customarily hold interests in midstream energy limited partnerships but are not subject to K-1 tax forms.
							

Above market yields with superior income growth. Master Limited Partnerships' recent distribution growth has averaged 6%–8%. But GPs have raised their distributions faster than that by virtue of an astute business structure.				
							

Stable industry with excellent future opportunities . In our view, the surge in the country's natural gas output and recent approval of new export facilities present enormous opportunities for natural gas infrastructure to meet the needs of both domestic and offshore markets in the years to come.

Firm / Our History 
										



Our History
Miller/Howard Investments Inc. was founded in 1984 as an institutional research firm providing quantitative and technical research on large-capitalization stocks to clients such as Fidelity, CIGNA, USF&G, Delta Airlines, John Templeton, George Soros, Federal Express, and many others.* In 1989, while investigating alternatives to traditional fixed-income vehicles, we conducted a landmark study of the long-term returns of utilities as an asset class. Our research revealed the income-generating, wealth-building potential of dividends over the long term. Based on these findings, we began managing our first utilities portfolio in 1991 founded on our philosophy that internal compounding (high current dividend income plus dividend growth) is the key to building long-term wealth. We hold to the adage, “slow and steady wins the race.”

Founder Lowell Miller, a leading expert on utilities, energy, and listed infrastructure as well as broad market dividend-growth companies, has been a keynote speaker and member of many industry panels, has appeared on Louis Rukeyser's Wall $treet Week and Bloomberg TV, and is regularly quoted in the national financial media. The strong investment team we have built has more than 150 years of combined investment experience.
Our evolution has been significantly influenced by the results of our utility study and the concept of a repeating-business model. In May 1997, we initiated the Income-Equity Strategy, which expands that model to nearly all sectors of the market and emphasizes stable companies that have a high current yield, rising dividend, and that may contain a hidden “growth kicker” that's not built into the stock's price.
Miller/Howard continues to evolve with development of disciplined investment strategies that provide investors with various levels of current income and dividend growth generated by companies with real assets, such as MLPs, companies that provide essential services, and broad market, dividend-focused stocks.

ESG / Environmental Social Governance 
										



Environmental Social Governance

Socially Responsible Investing (SRI) is a commonly used phrase that describes the integration of environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) criteria with financial standards when making investment decisions. Miller/Howard Investments Inc. believes, as do many others, that this integrated approach provides a framework for achieving better long-term investment returns while building sustainable global economies and markets.  Our first SRI strategy ("Better than Bonds", now Miller/Howard Infrastructure) debuted in 1991, giving us more than 25 years of experience unique among many asset managers.
		

We engage in rigorous analysis of companies using ESG criteria, establishing and maintaining individual company profiles both before and after investment.
		

Our initial, pre-investment ESG research involves an extensive process that utilizes exclusion and preference screens as well as case-by-case analysis. A company must pass this evaluation in order to be eligible for investment in our SRI portfolios. We view this layer of due diligence as an essential SRI risk-control measure.
		

Our second stage of research is conducted on all SRI holdings quarterly: We update the company profiles, looking for best practices on ESG markers (e.g. ethical, transparent governance and established principles of environmental stewardship). We use these profiles to monitor company progress on the markers, and to identify opportunities for commendation and engagement.
		
 
Our shareholder advocacy program is multi-faceted and goes beyond the profiling of companies: We participate in shareholder activism, carefully vote proxies, regularly publish a shareholder advocacy newsletter, and support organizations or managers leading shareholder resolutions whenever in alignment with our portfolio holdings and policies. (See our Proxy Policy, which explains how a client can obtain the voting history.)

The Miller/Howard High Income Equity CEF: Available For A Limited Time Only - Miller/howard High Income Equity Fund (NYSE:HIE) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»The Miller/Howard High Income Equity CEF: Available For A Limited Time OnlyMay.14.15 | About: Miller/howard High (HIE) Jason Van Steenwyk Value, event-driven, closed-end funds, newsletter providerSummaryThe Miller/Howard High Income Equity Fund has a pre-scheduled liquidation date in 10 years.Guarantees NAV at the end of that 10-year period, regardless of discounts in the interim.Focus is on dividend income, microcaps, with a substantial weight in MLPs.The 1967 novel Logan's Run, a science fiction book by William F. Nolan and George Clayton Johnston, envisioned a future in which rapid population growth threatened to overwhelm limited natural resources. In order to maintain the balance, government officials imposed an age cap: For the greater good of civilization, all citizens will be terminated upon reaching the age of 21.
Which, naturally, brings us to the world of Closed-End Funds. A recent fund offering from Miller/Howard Investments, the Miller/Howard High Income Equity Fund (NYSE:HIE), was just opened last November - and it's already a dead man walking: Miller/Howard won't even let this fund reach the ripe old age of 21 like the citizens in Logan's Run. Rather, this fund has its date with the executioner set for its tenth birthday.
Why Kill Off A Good Fund?
The logic behind setting an expiration date on a closed-end fund is this: If the fund trades at a chronic discount to NAV, long-term investors needn't worry: Once the fund reaches 10 years of age, the whole thing will be liquidated, and shareholders will be able to get the full NAV for their shares.
That fact will tend to narrow discounts all by itself: If the fund is trading at a discount to NAV in the final months before its liquidation, it will theoretically attract the interest of arbitragers, who will (again theoretically) bid the price back up toward parity with NAV.
In this regard, the fund is similar in concept to a Unit Investment Trust - which also come with a scheduled expiration or liquidation date.
Sure, it can be a bumpy ride. But investors know they will get NAV on November 24, 2024.
HIE isn't the first closed-end fund to have a built-in death date. But the concept is still extremely unusual. BlackRock has used it on a number of funds. It's also occasionally shown up in bond-heavy funds, as well, such as the Western Asset Investment Opportunity Trust (NYSE:IGI), which also has an execution date in late 2024.

"This term provision directly addresses what many consider the biggest risk of investing in CEFs - the risk of holding a fund in a persistent discount," explains Steve Chun, Director of Client Services at Miller/Howard Investments, "If you look at dividend equity CEFs, you will find that most have traded at a significant discount over the past 10 years. So what looked like good value became a value trap for investors who did not see the discount gap close much during the past 10-years." By combining an equity CEF with an expiration date (and an attractive 7.5% yield, by the way!) Miller/Howard seeks to offer CEF investors, the best of both worlds - the increased income opportunities that CEFs are known for combined with a measure protection from the discount mechanism that is a constant risk for CEF investors.
Comparisons With A UIT
This particular offering from Miller/Howard has the key advantage of a unit investment trust (UIT), in that there is a scheduled liquidation date, which acts as a reality check on whatever market mechanisms may create a discount from NAV in closed-end funds. Indeed, according to Mr. Chun, this particular offering "would be equivalent to a 10-year UIT but with the benefit of active management." The manager, dividend growth veteran Lowell Miller, can and doubtlessly will be trying to add value over time by buying and selling promising stocks
At press time, HIE had a closing share price of $17.94, closely tracking the NAV, with a discount of just 0.39%. Although the fund is still quite new, it is currently trading at less than 1% under par, a much narrower discount than most closed-end equity funds, currently trading at an average of 7.51% below NAV.
Zeroing In on HIE
The Miller/Howard High Equity Income Fund is designed as an income equity fund. As such, the thrust of the return strategy relies on dividends and distributions from the portfolio. The fund will invest at least 80% of total assets in stocks demonstrating high historic earnings quality and substantial yields compared to other alternatives.

Lowell Miller is the majority owner, with 51% under his ownership personally and another 11.7% under his direction as firm owner.
You can expect a substantial focus on master limited partnerships (MLPs), which are limited partnerships that are traded over the exchanges. This emphasis likely makes the fund highly correlated with the MLP-heavy energy industry, and helps give the fund a decidedly micro-cap spin.
While most mutual fund managers don't care much for MLPs, Lowell Miller and his team are old hands in the field, having devoted more analyst bandwidth to MLPs than most. In fact, Miller/Howard actually has a fund devoted to the master limited partnership world, the MLP Strategy Fund, which has been in operation since December 2008. Miller/Howard also operates a souped-up index fund in the MLP space, the Miller/Howard Fundamental MLP Index.
Unlike most funds in the income category, though, HIE features monthly dividend payouts. Most alternatives only distribute annually or semi-annually.
"A constructive approach to investing in HIE would be to see it as a consistent stream of income for the 10-year term generated by a basket of high-yield equities. The investor needs to consider where they think equities will be trading 10 years from now - higher or lower than today," says Chun.
Holdings
As of March 31, 2015, Miller/Howard is reporting holding 46 holdings, with a leverage level of 13%. The largest sector allocation in the portfolio, on paper, is REITs, representing 19.2% of the portfolio, followed by MLPs and financial stocks at 12.9 and 12.8% of the portfolio respectively.
Sector allocations are as follows:

REITs 19.2%
MLPs 12.9%
Financials 12.8%
Energy 11.3%
Industrials 10.1%
Utilities 7.8%
Consumer Discretionary 6.4%
Telecom 4.8%
Technology 4.5%
Health Care 3.5%
Cash 3.2%
Consumer Staples 2.5%
Materials 1.0%

Drill down a little bit, however, and you will find a few twists in the portfolio: First, if you combine the energy MLPs and the energy stocks in the portfolio, it's the energy industry that really commands the top slot in the fund portfolio weighting, according to Miller.

Further, they aren't holding the same plain-vanilla REITs that dominate the REIT indexes and larger REIT funds. That is, they're not just holding the same shopping malls and office buildings that everyone else is. HEI's strategy leads them onto paths less traveled by: Health care facilities and hotel properties, yes, but also such diverse activities as Billboards and server farm housing,
The fund's prospectus states that they could ramp up leverage as high as 20% depending on market conditions.
Life after Death
The fund's prospectus states that the fund will cease to exist as a CEF in November 2024. At that time, the fund is scheduled to liquidate. However, Miller/Howard has left hope for an afterlife of sorts: If it should die in a state of grace with investors (that is, if it happens to not be trading at a discount to NAV) the fund could convert to an open-end fund by shareholder vote.
Meanwhile, while the fund has the same market risk common to any equity fund, investors may be reasonably confident of getting NAV for their shares in November 2024, about 9½ years from now.

A prospectus, obtained by calling 800-669-3900 or by clicking on the prospectus link, contains this and other important information about an investment company. Read carefully before investing.*The Premier List represents what Morningstar Investment Management believes to be the “top picks” funds in each category from the universe of no-load funds with minimums less than $10,000 and open to new investors available on TD Ameritrade’s platform.A mutual fund is not FDIC-insured, may lose value, and is not guaranteed by a bank or other financial institution. Performance quoted represents past performance, is no guarantee of future results, and may not provide an adequate basis for evaluating the performance of the product over varying market conditions or economic cycles. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.TD Ameritrade receives remuneration from mutual fund companies, including those participating in its no-load, no-transaction-fee program, for recordkeeping, shareholder services, and other administrative and distribution services. The amount of TD Ameritrade's remuneration for these services is based in part on the amount of investments in such funds by TD Ameritrade clients. PLEASE ALSO SEE IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL FUND FEE DISCLOSURE INFORMATIONNo-transaction-fee funds and other funds offered through TD Ameritrade have other fees and expenses that apply to a continued investment in the fund and are described in the prospectus.Mutual funds, closed-end funds and exchange-traded funds are subject to market, exchange rate, political, credit, interest rate, and prepayment risks, which vary depending on the type of fund.  International investments involve special risks, including currency fluctuations and political and economic instability. Asset allocation and diversification do not eliminate the risk of experiencing investment losses.  Fund purchases may be subject to investment minimums, eligibility and other restrictions, as well as charges and expenses.Although certain money market funds seek to preserve their value of your investment at $1 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in such a fund.  Certain money market funds may impose liquidity fees and redemption gates in certain circumstances.Some mutual funds sold through TD Ameritrade impose a charge on the purchase of shares, called a “sales load.” An investor may be able to purchase fund shares through TD Ameritrade without paying a front-end sales load, but an investor  may be charged a fee, called a “contingent deferred sales charge,” when the investor sells or redeems shares.  TD Ameritrade may receive part or all of the sales load.Some mutual funds offer reductions in front-end sales loads (“breakpoints”) for purchases over certain amounts or purchases through Letters of Intent or Rights of Accumulation.  Some funds also offer waivers of those loads, often to retirement plans or charities.  Such breakpoints or waivers will be as further described in the prospectus. You, as the investor, should determine and obtain any breakpoints or waivers or provide TD Ameritrade with sufficient information to assist it in obtaining them.Most mutual funds charge 2.00% on the redemption of shares (including by exchange) held for less than a certain number of calendar days.  Performance figures reported do not reflect the deduction of this fee. If reflected, the fee would reduce the performance quoted. Please refer to the fund's prospectus for redemption fee information. TD Ameritrade may also charge its own short-term redemption fee.See the SEC Guide to Mutual Funds for more information.TD AMERITRADE RISKS OF INVESTING IN FUNDS: PLEASE READ IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL MUTUAL FUND, EXCHANGE-TRADED FUND, AND CLOSED-END FUND RISK DISCLOSURESResearch and planning tools are obtained by unaffiliated third-party sources deemed reliable by TD Ameritrade. However, TD Ameritrade does not guarantee their accuracy and completeness and makes no warranties with respect to results to be obtained from their use. The Investment Profile report is for informational purposes only.The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.Morningstar Investment Management LLC is a registered investment adviser and subsidiary of Morningstar, Inc.
