 Description of any Material Conflicts 
Conflicts of interest may arise in the allocation of investment opportunities and the allocation of aggregated orders among
the Fund and other accounts managed by the Funds portfolio manager. A portfolio manager potentially could give favorable treatment to some accounts for a variety of reasons, including favoring larger accounts, accounts that pay higher fees,
accounts that pay performance-based fees, accounts of affiliated companies and accounts in which the portfolio manager has an interest. Such favorable treatment could lead to more favorable investment opportunities or allocations for some accounts.
Loomis Sayles makes investment decisions for all accounts (including institutional accounts, mutual funds, hedge funds and affiliated accounts) based on each accounts availability of other comparable investment opportunities and Loomis
Sayles desire to treat all accounts fairly and equitably over time. Loomis Sayles maintains trade allocation and aggregation policies and procedures to address these potential conflicts. Conflicts of interest also may arise to the extent a
portfolio manager short sells a stock in one client account but holds that stock long in other accounts, including the Fund, or sells a stock for some accounts while buying the stock for others, and through the use of soft dollar arrangements. 
Compensation as of June 30, 2014 
Loomis Sayles believes that portfolio manager compensation should be driven primarily by the delivery of consistent and superior long-term
performance for its clients. Portfolio manager compensation is made up primarily of three main components: base salary, variable compensation and a long-term incentive program. Although portfolio manager compensation is not directly tied to assets
under management, a portfolio managers base salary and/or variable compensation potential may reflect the amount of assets for which the manager is responsible relative to other portfolio managers. Loomis Sayles also offers a profit sharing
plan. Base salary is a fixed amount based on a combination of factors, including industry experience, firm experience, job performance and market considerations. Variable compensation is an incentive-based component and generally represents a
significant multiple of base salary. Variable compensation is based on four factors: investment performance, profit growth of the firm, profit growth of the managers business unit and team commitment. Investment performance is the primary
component of total variable compensation and generally represents at least 60% of the total for fixed-income managers and 70% for equity managers. The other three factors are used to determine the remainder of variable compensation, subject to the
discretion of the Chief Investment Officer (CIO) and senior management. The CIO and senior management evaluate these other factors annually. 
Equity Managers. While mutual fund performance and asset size do not directly contribute to the compensation calculation,
investment performance for equity managers is measured by comparing the performance of Loomis Sayles institutional composites to the performance of the applicable Morningstar peer group and/or the Lipper universe. Generally speaking the
performance of the respective products fund is compared against the applicable Morningstar peer group and/or the Lipper universe. If the majority of the assets in the product are contained in the mutual fund that comparison will drive
compensation. To the extent the majority of assets managed in the fund 
  2 



strategy are for institutional separate accounts, the Evestment Alliance institutional peer group will also be used as an additional comparison. In situations where substantially all of the
assets for the strategy are institutional, the institutional peer group will be used as the primary method of comparison. A managers performance relative to the peer group for the 1, 3 and 5 year periods (or since the start of the
managers tenure, if shorter) is used to calculate the amount of variable compensation payable due to performance. The 1 year may be eliminated for some products. Longer-term performance (3 and 5 years or since the start of the managers
tenure, if shorter) combined is weighted more than shorter-term performance (1 year). In addition, the performance measurement for equity compensation will incorporate a consistency metric using longer term (3, 5, etc.) rolling excess return
compared to peer group over a sustained measurement period (5, 7, etc. years). The exact method may be adjusted to a products particular style. If a manager is responsible for more than one product, the rankings of each product are weighted
based on either relative revenue or asset size of accounts represented in each product. An external benchmark is used as a secondary comparison. 
Loomis Sayles uses either an institutional peer group as a point of comparison for equity manager performance, a Morningstar universe and/or
the Lipper universe. In cases where the institutional peer groups are used, Loomis Sayles believes they represent the most competitive product universe while closely matching the investment styles offered by the Loomis Sayles fund. 
Mutual funds are not included in Loomis Sayles composites, so unlike other managed accounts, fund performance and asset size do not
directly contribute to this calculation. However, each fund managed by Loomis Sayles employs strategies endorsed by Loomis Sayles and fits into the product category for the relevant investment style. Loomis Sayles may adjust compensation if there is
significant dispersion among the returns of the composite and accounts not included in the composite.  Loomis Sayles has developed and
implemented two distinct long-term incentive plans to attract and retain investment talent. The plans supplement existing compensation. The first plan has several important components distinguishing it from traditional equity ownership plans: 
 


 

 
 the plan grants units that entitle participants to an annual payment based on a percentage of company earnings above an established threshold;



 

 
 upon retirement, a participant will receive a multi-year payout for his or her vested units; and 


 

 
 participation is contingent upon signing an award agreement, which includes a non-compete covenant. 
The second plan is similarly constructed although the participants annual participation in company earnings is deferred for two years
from the time of award and is only payable if the portfolio manager remains at Loomis Sayles. In this plan, there is no post-retirement payments or non-compete covenants. 
Senior management expects that the variable compensation portion of overall compensation will continue to remain the largest source of income
for those investment professionals included in the plan. The plan is initially offered to portfolio managers and over time the scope of eligibility is likely to widen. Management has full discretion on what units are issued and to whom. 
Portfolio managers also participate in the Loomis Sayles profit sharing plan, in which Loomis Sayles makes a contribution to the retirement
plan of each employee based on a percentage of base salary (up to a maximum amount). The portfolio managers also participate in the Loomis Sayles defined benefit pension plan, which applies to all Loomis Sayles employees who joined the firm prior to
May 3, 2003. The defined benefit is based on years of service and base compensation (up to a maximum amount).  Ownership of Securities of the Fund

Effective September 1, 2014, information regarding Montag & Caldwell, LLC
contained in the section of the SAI Appendix D  Proxy Voting Policies is deleted and replaced with the following information relating to Loomis, Sayles & Company, L.P. 
LOOMIS, SAYLES & COMPANY, L.P. 
PROXY VOTING POLICY, PROCEDURES AND GUIDELINES   
Loomis Sayles uses the services of third parties (Proxy Voting Service(s)), to research and administer the vote on proxies for
those accounts and funds for which Loomis Sayles has voting authority. One of Loomis Sayles Proxy Voting Services, Glass, Lewis & Company (Glass Lewis) provides vote recommendations and/or analysis to Loomis Sayles based
on Glass Lewis own research. Loomis Sayles will generally follow its express policy with input from Glass Lewis unless Loomis Sayles Proxy Committee (the Proxy Committee) determines that the clients best interests are served
by voting otherwise.  All issues presented for shareholder vote will be considered under the oversight of the Proxy Committee. All
non-routine issues will be directly considered by the Proxy Committee and, when necessary, the equity analyst following the company and/or the portfolio manager of a Fund holding the security, and will be voted in the best investment interests of
the Fund. All routine issues will be voted according to Loomis Sayles policy approved by the Proxy Committee unless special factors require that they be considered by the Proxy Committee and, when necessary, the equity analyst following the
company and/or the portfolio manager of a Fund holding the security. Loomis Sayles Proxy Committee has established these routine policies in what it believes are the best investment interests of Loomis Sayles clients. 
The specific responsibilities of the Proxy Committee include (1) developing, authorizing, implementing and updating the Procedures,
including an annual review of the Procedures, existing voting guidelines and the proxy voting process in general, (2) oversight of the proxy voting process including oversight of the vote on proposals according to the predetermined policies in
the voting guidelines, directing the vote on proposals where there is reason not to vote according to the predetermined policies in the voting guidelines or where proposals require special consideration, and consultation with the portfolio managers
and analysts for the Fund(s) holding the security when necessary or appropriate and, (3) engagement and oversight of third-party vendors, including Proxy Voting Services. 
Loomis Sayles has established several policies to ensure that proxy votes are voted in its clients best interest and are not affected by
any possible conflicts of interest. First, except in certain limited instances, Loomis Sayles votes in accordance with its pre-determined policies set forth in the Procedures. Second, where these Procedures allow for discretion, Loomis Sayles will
generally consider the recommendations of Glass Lewis in making its voting decisions. However, if the Proxy Committee determines that Glass Lewis recommendation is not in the best interest of its clients, then the Proxy Committee may use its
discretion to vote against Glass Lewis recommendation, but only after taking the following steps: (1) conducting a review for any material conflict of interest Loomis Sayles may have and, (2) if any material conflict is found to
exist, excluding anyone at Loomis Sayles who is subject to that conflict of interest from participating in the voting decision in any way. However, if deemed necessary or appropriate by the Proxy Committee after full prior disclosure of any
conflict, that person may provide information, opinions or recommendations on any proposal to the Proxy Committee. In such event the Proxy Committee will make reasonable efforts to obtain and consider, prior to directing any vote information,
opinions or recommendations from or about the opposing position on any proposal.

Description of any Material Conflicts  As a general matter, certain conflicts of interest may arise in connection with a portfolio managers management of a funds investments, on the one hand, and the investments of other accounts
for which the portfolio manager is responsible, on the other. For example, it is possible that the various accounts managed could have different investment strategies that, at times, might conflict with one another to the possible detriment of the
Fund. Alternatively, to the extent that the same investment opportunities might be desirable for more than one account, possible conflicts could arise in determining how to allocate them. Other potential conflicts might include conflicts created by
specific portfolio manager compensation arrangements, and conflicts relating to selection of brokers or dealers to execute Fund portfolio trades and/or specific uses of commissions from Fund portfolio trades (for example, research or soft
dollars). Federated has adopted policies and procedures and has structured the portfolio managers compensation in a manner reasonably designed to safeguard the Fund from being negatively affected as a result of any such potential
conflicts.  Compensation 
Federateds portfolio managers are paid a fixed base salary and a variable annual incentive. Base salary is determined within a market competitive,
position-specific salary range, based on the portfolio managers experience and performance. The annual incentive amount is determined based primarily on Investment Product Performance (IPP) and, to a lesser extent, Financial Success, and may
be paid entirely in cash, or in a combination of cash and restricted stock of Federated Investors, Inc. (Federated). The total combined annual incentive opportunity is intended to be competitive in the market for this portfolio manager
role.  IPP is measured on a rolling one, three and five calendar year pre-tax gross total return basis versus the Funds designated peer
group of comparable accounts and versus the Funds benchmark (i.e., Morgan Stanley Capital International Europe, Australasia and Far East Index). Performance periods are adjusted if a portfolio manager has been managing an account for less than
five years; accounts with less than one year of performance history under a portfolio manager may be excluded. For purposes of calculating the annual incentive amount, each fund or account may be categorized into multiple IPP groups. Within each
performance measurement period and IPP group, IPP is calculated on the basis of an assigned weighting of each included account managed by the portfolio manager. Although the performance of each fund/account is considered in calculating the annual
incentive amount, the weighting of the IPP group weightings may differ. A portion of the bonus tied to the IPP score may be adjusted based on managements assessment of overall contributions to fund performance and any other factors deemed
relevant. The Financial Success category is designed to tie the portfolio managers bonus, in part, to Federateds overall financial results. Funding for the Financial Success category may be determined on a product or asset class basis,
as well as on corporate financial results. Senior Management determines individual Financial Success bonuses on a discretionary basis, considering overall contributions and any other factors deemed relevant. Additionally, portfolio managers may be
awarded a grant of restricted Federated stock. Awards of restricted stock are discretionary and are made in variable amounts based on the subjective judgment of Federated senior management.  Ownership of Securities of the Fund as of November 30, 2015

 Description of any Material Conflicts  Certain accounts have the ability to engage in shorts and options which can potentially create a conflict of interest if these types of transactions are undertaken in a security which the firm holds long
for other clients. Vaughan Nelson has developed rules and reports in the Charles River Development (CRD) compliance system to assist in identifying, researching and documenting the basis on which the affected accounts are undertaking its use of
shorts or options.  The firm votes proxies for those clients which have delegated this responsibility to the firm. A situation could arise
where the firm is required to vote a proxy for a publicly traded company which is a strategy holding and also client. In such a scenario, Vaughan Nelson defers to the recommendation provided by ISS when voting the proxy if not addressed in our proxy
voting guidelines in order to avoid a conflict of interest. The firms compliance department is involved in voting each proxy in order to help identify any conflicts of interests. 
Vaughan Nelson uses soft dollars to pay for proprietary research and 3rd party research services which benefit the Funds. A conflict of interest may arise if the firm is paying unjustifiably
high commissions in order to obtain the research and/or services and failing to obtain best execution for the clients. The firms compliance department reviews the use of soft dollars to ensure it falls under the parameters of 28(e) and that it
is disclosed in the firms Form ADV.  Vaughan Nelson manages three performance fee accounts. A conflict of interest may arise if the firm
is seen favoring the account with regards to allocating preferred investment decisions or the timing of the trades for the account. The performance fee accounts are traded along with all other accounts in the same investment strategy; trading as
part of a large block of accounts which minimizes any potential preferential treatment.  Compensation 
The compensation program at Vaughan Nelson is designed to align the interests of portfolio management professionals with the interests of clients and
Vaughan Nelson by retaining top-performing employees and creating incentives to enhance Vaughan Nelsons long-term success. Compensation of portfolio management professionals includes a fixed base salary, a variable bonus and deferral plan and
a contribution to the firms retirement plan. 
  5 


All portfolio management professionals (at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Vaughan
Nelson Board) participate in the variable bonus and deferral plan component which, as a whole, is based upon a percentage of Vaughan Nelsons net profit. Each portfolio management professionals participation in the variable bonus and
deferral plan is based upon many factors, including but not limited to:   


 

 
 Performance of the strategy managed (both absolute and relative to peers) 
 


 

 
 Amount of revenue derived from the strategy managed   


 

 
 Contribution to the development and execution of the firms investment philosophy and process 
 


 

 
 Participation and effectiveness in performing client service activities and marketing initiatives 
The degree to which any one factor influences participation in the bonus pool will vary between individuals and over time. A portion of the variable bonus
is subject to deferral and each participant has the option to invest the deferral into Vaughan Nelson managed product(s) while it vests. Each years deferral is paid out over a period of three years. Payments are conditioned upon compliance
with non-compete and non-solicitation arrangements.  The contribution to the firms retirement plan is based on a percentage (at the
discretion of the Vaughan Nelson Board) of total cash compensation (subject to the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) limits) and such percentage is the same for all firm personnel. Compensation at Vaughan Nelson is determined by
the Compensation Committee at the recommendation of the Chief Executive Officer.  There is no distinction for purposes of compensation between
the Fund and any other accounts managed.  Ownership of Securities of the Fund as of November 30, 2015

 *****  Information contained in the section of the SAI entitled Appendix D  Proxy Voting Policies hereby is revised to include the following information relating to Federated Global
Investment Management Corp. and Vaughan Nelson Investment Management  FEDERATED GLOBAL INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT
 PROXY VOTING POLICY, PROCEDURES AND GUIDELINES  The Sub-Advisers general policy is to cast proxy votes in favor of proposals that the Sub-Adviser anticipates will enhance the long-term value of the securities being voted. Generally, this will
mean voting for proposals that the Sub-Adviser believes will: (a) improve the management of a company; (b) increase the rights or preferences of the voted securities; and/or (c) increase the chance that a premium offer would be made
for the company or for the voted securities.  The following examples illustrate how these general policies may apply to proposals submitted by
a companys board of directors for approval or ratification by holders of the companys voting securities. However, whether the Sub-Adviser supports or opposes a proposal will always depend on the specific circumstances described in the
proxy statement and other available information. On matters of corporate governance, generally the Sub-Adviser will vote for the full slate of directors nominated in an uncontested election, but against any director who: (a) had
not attended at least 75% of the board meetings during the previous year; (b) serves as the companys chief financial officer; (c) has committed himself or herself to service on a large number of boards, such that we deem it unlikely
that the director would be able to commit sufficient focus and time to a particular company; (d) is the chair of the nominating committee when the roles of chairman of the board and CEO are combined, and there is no lead independent director;
and/or (e) served on the compensation committee during a period in which compensation appears excessive relative to performance and peers. In addition, the Sub-Adviser will vote for proposals to: require a companys audit committee
to be comprised entirely of independent directors; declassify the board of directors; require a majority voting standard in the election of directors; eliminate supermajority requirements in a companys bylaws; grant shareholders the right to
call a special meeting if owners of at least 25% of the outstanding stock agree; require independent tabulation of proxies and/or confidential voting by shareholders; ratify the boards selection of auditors (unless compensation for non-audit
services exceeded 50% of the total compensation received from the company, or the previous auditor was dismissed because of a disagreement with the company); and repeal a shareholder rights plan (also known as a poison pill). The
Sub-Adviser will generally vote against the adoption of such a plan (unless the plan is designed to facilitate, rather than prevent, unsolicited offers for the company).  On matters of capital structure, generally the Sub-Adviser will vote: against proposals to authorize or issue shares that are senior in priority or voting rights to the securities being voted; and
for proposals to: reduce the amount of shares authorized for issuance; authorize a stock repurchase program; and grant preemptive rights to the securities being voted. The Sub-Adviser will generally vote against proposals to eliminate
such preemptive rights.  On matters relating to management compensation, generally the Sub-Adviser will vote: for stock incentive plans
that align the recipients interests with the interests of shareholders without creating undue dilution; against proposals that would permit the amendment or replacement of outstanding stock

  7 



incentives with new stock incentives having more favorable terms; and against executive compensation plans that do not disclose the maximum amounts of compensation that may be awarded or
the criteria for determining awards.  On matters relating to corporate transactions, the Sub-Adviser will vote proxies relating to proposed
mergers, capital reorganizations, and similar transactions in accordance with the general policy, based upon its analysis of the terms, conditions and anticipated results of the proposed transaction. The Sub-Adviser will vote proxies in contested
elections of directors based upon its analysis of the opposing slates and their respective proposed business strategies. When the companys board, or another party involved in a proposed transaction or change in the board, submits proposals for
the purpose of facilitating or impeding such transaction or change, the Sub-Adviser will cast its proxies based on its evaluation of the proposed transaction or change to the board. In these circumstances, the Sub-Adviser may vote in a manner
contrary to its general practice for similar proposals made outside the context of such a proposed transaction or change in the board. For example, if the Sub-Adviser decides to vote against a proposed transaction, it may vote in favor of
anti-takeover measures reasonably designed to prevent the transaction.  The Sub-Adviser generally votes proxies against proposals
submitted by shareholders without the favorable recommendation of a companys board. The Sub-Adviser believes that a companys board should manage its business and policies, and that shareholders who seek specific changes should strive to
convince the board of their merits or seek direct representation on the board. However, the Sub-Adviser would vote for shareholder proposals not supported by the companys board that the Sub-Adviser regards as: (a) likely to result in an
immediate and favorable improvement in the total return of the voted security; and (b) unlikely to be adopted by the companys board in the absence of shareholder direction.  In addition, the Sub-Adviser will not vote any proxy if it determines that the consequences or costs of voting outweigh the potential benefit of voting. For example, if a foreign market requires
shareholders voting proxies to retain the voted shares until the meeting date (thereby rendering the shares illiquid for some period of time), the Sub-Adviser will not vote proxies for such shares. In addition, the Sub-Adviser is not
obligated to incur any expense to send a representative to a shareholder meeting or to translate proxy materials into English.  Proxy
Voting Procedures  The Sub-Adviser has established the Proxy Voting Committee (Proxy Committee), to exercise all voting
discretion granted to the Sub-Adviser by the Board in accordance with the proxy voting policies. The Sub-Adviser has hired a proxy voting service to obtain, vote and record proxies in accordance with the directions of the Proxy Committee. The Proxy
Committee has supplied the proxy voting service with general instructions (the Standard Voting Instructions) that represent decisions made by the Proxy Committee in order to vote common proxy proposals. As the Proxy Committee believes
that a shareholder vote is equivalent to an investment decision, the Proxy Committee retains the right to modify the Standard Voting Instructions at any time or to vote contrary to them at any time in order to cast proxy votes in a manner that the
Proxy Committee believes is: (a) in the best interests of the Sub-Advisers clients (including shareholders of the funds advised by the Sub-Adviser); and (b) will enhance the long-term value of the securities being voted. The proxy
voting service may vote any proxy as directed in the Standard Voting Instructions without further direction from the Proxy Committee. However, if the Standard Voting Instructions require case-by-case direction for a proposal, the proxy voting
service shall provide the Proxy Committee with all information that it has obtained regarding the proposal and the Proxy Committee will provide specific direction to the proxy voting service.  The Proxy Committee has created the Proxy Voting Management Group (PVMG) to assist it in carrying out the day-to-day operations related to proxy voting. The day-to-day operations related to proxy voting
are carried out by the Proxy Voting Operations Team (PVOT) and overseen by the PVMG. This work 
  8 



includes, but is not limited to: interacting with the proxy voting service on the Proxy Committees behalf; soliciting voting recommendations from the Sub-Advisers investment
professionals, as necessary, on case-by-case items referred to the Proxy Committee by the proxy voting service; bringing requests to the Proxy Committee from the Sub-Advisers investment professionals for voting contrary to the Standard Voting
Instructions; filing any required proxy voting reports; providing proxy voting reports to clients and investment companies as they are requested from time to time; keeping the Proxy Committee informed of any issues related to proxy voting; and
voting client shares as directed by the Proxy Committee.  Conflicts of Interest 
The Sub-Adviser has adopted procedures to address situations where a matter on which a proxy is sought may present a potential conflict between the
interests of the Fund (and its shareholders) and those of the Sub-Adviser or Distributor. This may occur where a significant business relationship exists between the Sub-Adviser (or its affiliates) and a company involved with a proxy vote. A company
that is a proponent, opponent or the subject of a proxy vote and which to the knowledge of the Proxy Committee has a significant business relationship with the Sub-Adviser, is referred to below as an Interested Company. 
The Sub-Adviser has implemented the following procedures in order to avoid concerns that the conflicting interests of the Sub-Adviser have influenced
proxy voting. Any employee of the Sub-Adviser who is contacted by an Interested Company regarding proxies to be voted by the Sub-Adviser must refer the Interested Company to a member of the Proxy Committee, and must inform the Interested Company
that the Proxy Committee has exclusive authority to determine how the Sub-Adviser will exercise its voting discretion. Any Proxy Committee member contacted by an Interested Company must report it to the full Proxy Committee and provide a written
summary of the communication. Under no circumstances will the Proxy Committee or any member of the Proxy Committee make a commitment to an Interested Company regarding the voting of proxies or disclose to an Interested Company how the Proxy
Committee has directed such proxies to be voted. If the Standard Voting Instructions already provide specific direction on the proposal in question, the Proxy Committee shall not alter or amend such directions. If the Standard Voting Instructions
require the Proxy Committee to provide further direction, the Proxy Committee shall do so in accordance with the proxy voting policies, without regard for the interests of the Sub-Adviser with respect to the Interested Company. If the Proxy
Committee provides any direction as to the voting of proxies relating to a proposal affecting an Interested Company, it must disclose annually to the Funds Board information regarding: the significant business relationship; any material
communication with the Interested Company; the matter(s) voted on; and how, and why, the Sub-Adviser voted as it did. Alternatively, the Proxy Committee may seek direction from the Funds Board on how a proposal concerning an Interested Company
shall be voted, and shall follow any such direction provided by the Board. In seeking such direction, the Proxy Committee will disclose the reason such company is considered an Interested Company and may provide a recommendation on how such proposal
should be voted and the basis for such recommendation.  If the Sub-Advisers client owns shares of an investment company for which the
Sub-Adviser (or an affiliate) is the investment Sub-Adviser, the Proxy Committee will vote the clients proxies for that investment company in the same proportion as the votes cast by shareholders who are not clients of the Sub-Adviser, unless
otherwise directed by the client (or in the case of an investment company, its board of directors or trustees).  Downstream Affiliates
 If the Proxy Committee gives further direction, or seeks to vote contrary to the Standard Voting Instructions, for a proxy relating to a
portfolio company in which an investment company client owns more than 10% of the portfolio companys outstanding voting securities at the time of the vote (Downstream Affiliate), the Proxy Committee must first receive guidance from
counsel to the Proxy 
  9 



Committee as to whether any relationship between the Sub-Adviser and the portfolio company, other than such ownership of the portfolio companys securities, gives rise to an actual conflict
of interest. If counsel determines that an actual conflict exists, the Proxy Committee must address any such conflict with the executive committee of the board of directors or trustees of any investment company client prior to taking any action on
the proxy at issue.  Vaughan Nelson Investment Management 
Investment Adviser Policies and Procedures Manual  Revised February 2015  Proxy Voting Policy and Procedures 
Introduction  Rule 206(4)-6 under
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 addresses an investment advisers duty with regard to the voting of proxies for clients. Under the rule an adviser must:   


a)
Adopt and implement written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that client securities are voted in the clients best interest and to
address procedures to be undertaken in the event a material conflict arises between the firms interest and that of our clients as to how a particular security or proxy issue is voted; 
 


b)
Disclose to clients how they may obtain information regarding how the firm voted with respect to the clients securities; and 
 


c)
Describe the firms policies and procedures to clients and, upon request, furnish a copy of the policies and procedures to the requesting client.
 The policy and procedures below have been reasonably designed to ensure proxies are voted in the best interest of our clients
and in compliance with Rule 206(4)-6. Our authority to vote proxies for our clients is established through either the advisory contract (if the contract is silent, implied by the overall delegation of discretionary authority), or our fiduciary
responsibility to ERISA clients under Department of Labor regulations.  Policy 
The firm undertakes to vote all client proxies in a manner reasonably expected to ensure the clients best interest is upheld and in a manner that
does not subrogate the clients best interest to that of the firms in instances where a material conflict exists or potentially exists.  The firm has created a proxy voting guideline (the Guideline) (see Exhibit N) reasonably believed to be in the best interest of clients relating to common and recurring issues found within
proxy voting material. In drafting this guideline the firm considered the nature of the firms business and the types of securities being managed. The firm created the Guideline to help ensure voting consistency on issues common amongst issuers
and to help serve as evidence that a vote was not the product of a conflict of interest but rather a vote in accordance with a predetermined policy.  Conflicts of Interest  The most common conflicts of interest result from a situation
involving a business relationship and/or a potential financial benefit to the firm. The firm envisions only rare situations where a conflict of interest would exist or potentially exist between the firm and its clients given the nature of the
firms business, clients, relationships and the types of securities managed. Notwithstanding, apparent or actual conflicts of interest may arise from time to time. In such instances the firm will undertake to vote such proxies in the continued
best interest of clients in accordance with the procedures put in place addressing potential or actual material conflicts. 
  10 


A potential conflict may be resolved in either of the following manners: 
 



 
 If the proposal that gives rise to an actual or potential conflict is specifically addressed in the Guideline, the firm may vote the proxy in
accordance with the pre-determined Guideline; provided that the pre-determined Guideline involves little or no discretion on the firms part; or   



 
 The firm may follow the recommendations of Institutional Shareholder Services, an independent third party, as to how the proxy should be voted.
 Limitations  There may be circumstances or situations that may preclude or limit the manner in which proxies are voted. This may include but is not limited to: 
 



 
 Mutual Funds  where voting may be controlled by restrictions within the fund or the actions of authorized persons 
 



 
 International Securities  where the perceived benefit of voting an international proxy does not outweigh the anticipated costs of doing so
  



 
 New Accounts  instances where security holdings assumed will be sold in the near term thereby limiting any benefit to be obtained by a vote of
proxy material   



 
 Unsupervised Securities  where the firm does not have a basis on which to offer advice 
 



 
 Unjustifiable Costs  where the firm may abstain from voting a client proxy in a specific instance if, in our good faith determination, the costs
involved in voting such proxy cannot be justified (e.g. total client holdings less than 10,000 shares and not held by a mutual fund; costs associated with obtaining translations of relevant proxy materials for non-U.S. securities) in light of the
benefits to the client of voting. In accordance with the firms fiduciary duties, the firm shall, in appropriate cases, weigh the costs and benefits of voting proxy proposals and shall make an informed decision with respect to whether voting a
given proxy proposal is prudent. The decision will take into account the effect that the vote, either by itself or together with other votes, is expected to have on the value of clients investment and whether this expected effect would
outweigh the cost of voting.   



 
 Securities out on loan   



 
 ERISA accounts  with respect to ERISA clients for whom we have accepted the responsibility for proxy voting, we vote proxies in accordance with
our duty of loyalty and prudence, compliance with the plan documents, and the firms duty to avoid prohibited transactions.  Guideline Formulation  The majority of proxy issues to be voted on are both
recurring in nature and common amongst issuers. This would include items ranging from the election of directors and ratification of auditors to cumulative voting and poison pills. A proxy voting guideline has been developed, (see Exhibit
N), to reflect how we believe a vote should normally be cast in order to support the best interest of our clients. The use of this guideline also facilitates a process that supports voting consistency and efficiency in administration. However, it
should be acknowledged that a blanket voting approach cannot be applied to many recurring and common issues. The guideline indicates that such issues will be addressed on a case-by-case basis in consultation with a portfolio manager to
determine how to vote the issue in our clients best interest. The guideline is the work product of the firms investment team which has the responsibility to determine how proxy issues should be voted to promote the interest of our
clients. The investment team draws on various sources of information in reviewing/formulating the guideline including, but not limited to, research provided by an independent research firm (Institutional Shareholder Services), internal research,
published information on corporate governance and experience. 
  11 


Disclosure to Clients  The disclosure/delivery to clients required by Rule 206(4)-6 includes a concise summary of the firms proxy voting process rather than a reiteration of the firms policies and
procedures and an indication that a copy of the policies and procedures is available on request. The method of delivering this summary is not stipulated, however, it must be clear, not hidden in a longer document and delivered
directly to the client. In addition, the disclosure should describe how the client may obtain information from the adviser on how it voted with respect to the clients securities.  Procedures  The procedures to be performed in the execution or our proxy voting duty
to clients will be as follows:  Oversight  The Compliance department will be responsible for the administration and oversight of the proxy voting process. The Compliance department will also: 
1. Review and update the firms policies and procedures as necessary.  2. Coordinate the review and update of the firms proxy voting guidelines by the investment team or its designee.  3. Consult with and coordinate the voting of proxies with the appropriate portfolio manager as needed.  The Compliance Individual (CI) and Proxy Administrator (PA) will oversee the use of Institutional Shareholder Services, an outside third-party vendor, who provides assistance with proxy research, proxy
voting and record retention.  Account Setup   


1.
New clients will receive a copy of the Description of Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures as part of information provided in connection with the
firms New Client Checklist.   


2.
At the time a contract is entered into a determination will be made as to whether the client will retain proxy voting responsibilities. A separate acknowledgement will
be obtained where the client elects to retain proxy voting responsibilities.   


3.
The PA will arrange for client proxy material to be forwarded to Institutional Shareholder Services for voting. 
Securities Lending  In many cases
Vaughan Nelsons clients participate in securities lending programs whereby the legal right to vote a proxy is transferred to the borrower as a result of the lending process. From time to time, circumstances may arise where Vaughan Nelson
desires to vote shares in an upcoming proxy (i.e. acquisition, contested election, etc.). In these cases, Vaughan Nelson, if the record date has not passed, will request the client to recall the security in question from loan until the
proxy record date in order for the client (and thereby Vaughan Nelson) to be the holder of record in order to cast the proxy vote.  Voting
Process   


1.
The PA uploads a file each day (on a settlement date basis) detailing all the securities held on behalf of our clients for which we own more than 10,000 shares to
Institutional Shareholder Services.   


2.
Institutional Shareholder Services is responsible for matching the proxy material received with this listing and following up with any custodian that has not forwarded
proxies within a reasonable time. 
  12 




3.
Through web access and the Institutional Shareholder Services software, the PA is able to determine for each security its record date, meeting date and whether
Institutional Shareholder Services has completed proxy research on the security.   


4.
The PA will download the Institutional Shareholder Services proxy research for each security along with a copy of the voting form and forward the package to the CI.
  


5.
The CI will make a determination as to whether a material conflict exists with regard to the proxy or an individual proxy issue. The results of this determination will
be documented and initialed on the proxy voting form.   


6.
The CI will review the proxy issues against the firms Guideline and cast each vote on the voting form, if able, and sign off on having voted those issues.
  


a)
If all issues were able to be voted within the Guideline the package will be returned to the PA for online voting. 
 


b)
If issues exist for which a case-by-case review must be made the package is forwarded to the appropriate manager. The manager will review the information within the
package and any other necessary information in order to formulate the vote to be cast. The rationale for any departures from the firms Guideline will be documented within the package. All votes will be indicated on the voting form and the
manager will sign off as to having voted those issues. The package will then be returned to the PA for voting.   


c)
As described under Conflicts of Interests, where a material conflict exists the firm may vote the issue 1) in accordance with the Guideline if the
application of such policy to the issue at hand involves little or no discretion on the part of the firm, or 2) as indicated by the independent third-party research firm, Institutional Shareholder Services. By voting conflicts in accordance with the
indication of an independent third-party, the firm will be able to demonstrate that the vote was not a product of a conflict of interest. An indication that this was the approach taken to vote the issue will be made and signed off on by the
Compliance Individual. The package will then be returned to the PA for voting.   


7.
Through the software interface with Institutional Shareholder Services the PA will indicate, review and submit our vote on individual securities. The PA is able to
re-submit our vote up until the day before the meeting which can accommodate cases where new information may come to light.   


8.
Institutional Shareholder Services will then process the vote with the issuer on behalf of the firm. 
Recordkeeping  The following
records relating to the voting of proxies will be maintained for a period of five years from the end of the fiscal year in which the entry was made, the first two onsite at the firm.
