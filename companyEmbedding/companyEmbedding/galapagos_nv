"I am emboldened by the execution of our strategy by the Galapagos teams that has resulted in great opportunities for our company. Galapagos now has a broad and deep pipeline with multiple product candidates across different indications. We have five proprietary clinical assets and the cash reserves to take these product candidates forward on our own into clinical development," said CEO Onno van de Stolpe.DARWIN 3 interim readout Patients who completed DARWIN 1 or 2 and enrolled in DARWIN 3 received filgotinib 200mg once daily or 100mg twice daily, depending on prior treatment assignment. A total of 559 patients completed week 60. Based on an observed case analysis 84%, 65%, 44%, and 51% of patients reached ACR20, ACR50, ACR70 and DAS28 (CRP) remission at Week 60 respectively. Overall exposure to filgotinib was 1314 patient-years (PYE). Safety was in line with the core studies. There were no clinically meaningful changes to male reproductive hormones measured. The totality of these safety data continues to reflect a favorable profile for filgotinib in the target population. Filgotinib is currently being investigated in three Phase 3 programs and six additional Phase 2 proof-of-concept studies: ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, cutaneous lupus erythematosus, Sjögren's syndrome, small bowel Crohn's, and fistulizing Crohn's. As filgotinib is currently in Phase 3 studies, the efficacy and safety of filgotinib have not yet been established.Cystic fibrosis triple combinationsGalapagos and AbbVie have developed a large portfolio of potentiators and correctors that provides the opportunity to develop distinct triple combination therapies for CF patients. Galapagos reports that Phase 1 results on GLPG2451, GLPG2222 and GLPG2737 showed favorable findings relating to safety and tolerability of the individual components that constitute our current most advanced potential triple combination therapy. These results lead Galapagos to initiate that triple combination program, including start of the regulatory review process in Europe next month, which should allow for a patient study with '2737 in combination with Orkambi[1] (#_ftn1) and the first patient study with the triple combination '2451, '2222, and '2737 to start in Q4 2017. In addition, Galapagos anticipates starting two triple studies in 2018: one with '3067, '2222, and '2737 and one with '3067, '2222, and '3221.Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: orphan drug status in US and topline data expected for GLPG1690 from FLORA studyGalapagos received orphan status for GLPG1690 in IPF from the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA). Galapagos has full commercial rights for '1690 and expects to announce topline results from an exploratory Phase 2a study with '1690 in IPF patients in the third quarter of 2017. Osteoarthritis: GLPG1972 being tested in patients in the US Galapagos is developing GLPG1972, targeting ADAMTS-5, as a potential disease-modifying therapy for osteoarthritis. Galapagos has full commercial rights in the US. Our collaboration partner Servier will be making its opt-in decision for further development and ex-US commercial rights later this year. Galapagos opened an Investigational New Drug (IND) dossier with the FDA for '1972 and achieved first dosing in a Phase 1b patient trial in the US. This exploratory dose escalation study will investigate the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of '1972 in 30 patients with hip and/or knee osteoarthritis after 4 weeks of oral administration. Completion of patient recruitment is expected by the end of 2017.Additional pipeline progressGalapagos expects to report topline results with MOR106, a human monoclonal antibody targeting IL-17C, in a Phase 1b trial in atopic dermatitis patients later in 2017. Furthermore, Galapagos expects to initiate a new study with GPR84 inhibitor GLPG1205 in an undisclosed indication later in 2017. Galapagos nominated GLPG2384 in an undisclosed indication and GLPG3121 in psoriasis, increasing the number of fully proprietary clinical stage assets to five. Webcast presentation and conference callGalapagos will webcast the R&D Update tomorrow (20 June 2017) at 8.00 Eastern Time (ET) and 14:00 Central European Time (CET), together with a conference call.

R&D Update 2017.pdf




 Filgotinib  Darwin 3: improved activity, consistent safety parameters for filgotinib  Ph2 studies initiated in 6 new indications   Cystic fibrosis  Three different triple combos in development  Successful completion of Ph1 with three individual combo components   Start of regulatory process next month, patient study with first triple combo expected to begin in Q4 '17 in Europe   Topline data for GLPG1690 in IPF in Q3 '17  Opening of US IND and dosing of first osteoarthritis patient in Phase 1b trial with GLPG1972  Growing number of clinical stage proprietary programs in fibrosis, psoriasis, and other indications  Webcast from NY at 14.00 CET/8AM ET tomorrowvia www.glpg.com, +32 2 404 0659, code 8093710 Mechelen, Belgium; 20 June 2017; 7.30 CET, regulated information - Galapagos NV (Euronext & NASDAQ: GLPG) announces progress made in its R&D strategy and portfolio at its Annual R&D Update on 20 June at 8 AM EDT at the Yale Club in New York City.  "I am emboldened by the execution of our strategy by the Galapagos teams that has resulted in great opportunities for our company. Galapagos now has a broad and deep pipeline with multiple product candidates across different indications. We have five proprietary clinical assets and the cash reserves to take these product candidates forward on our own into clinical development," said CEO Onno van de Stolpe. DARWIN 3 interim readout Patients who completed DARWIN 1 or 2 and enrolled in DARWIN 3 received filgotinib 200mg once daily or 100mg twice daily, depending on prior treatment assignment. A total of 559 patients completed week 60. Based on an observed case analysis 84%, 65%, 44%, and 51% of patients reached ACR20, ACR50, ACR70 and DAS28 (CRP) remission at Week 60 respectively. Overall exposure to filgotinib was 1314 patient-years (PYE). Safety was in line with the core studies. There were no clinically meaningful changes to male reproductive hormones measured. The totality of these safety data continues to reflect a favorable profile for filgotinib in the target population. Filgotinib is currently being investigated in three Phase 3 programs and six additional Phase 2 proof-of-concept studies: ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, cutaneous lupus erythematosus, Sjögren's syndrome, small bowel Crohn's, and fistulizing Crohn's. As filgotinib is currently in Phase 3 studies, the efficacy and safety of filgotinib have not yet been established. Cystic fibrosis triple combinationsGalapagos and AbbVie have developed a large portfolio of potentiators and correctors that provides the opportunity to develop distinct triple combination therapies for CF patients. Galapagos reports that Phase 1 results on GLPG2451, GLPG2222 and GLPG2737 showed favorable findings relating to safety and tolerability of the individual components that constitute our current most advanced potential triple combination therapy. These results lead Galapagos to initiate that triple combination program, including start of the regulatory review process in Europe next month, which should allow for a patient study with '2737 in combination with Orkambi[1] and the first patient study with the triple combination '2451, '2222, and '2737 to start in Q4 2017. In addition, Galapagos anticipates starting two triple studies in 2018: one with '3067, '2222, and '2737 and one with '3067, '2222, and '3221. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: orphan drug status in US and topline data expected for GLPG1690 from FLORA studyGalapagos received orphan status for GLPG1690 in IPF from the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA). Galapagos has full commercial rights for '1690 and expects to announce topline results from an exploratory Phase 2a study with '1690 in IPF patients in the third quarter of 2017.  Osteoarthritis: GLPG1972 being tested in patients in the US Galapagos is developing GLPG1972, targeting ADAMTS-5, as a potential disease-modifying therapy for osteoarthritis. Galapagos has full commercial rights in the US. Our collaboration partner Servier will be making its opt-in decision for further development and ex-US commercial rights later this year. Galapagos opened an Investigational New Drug (IND) dossier with the FDA for '1972 and achieved first dosing in a Phase 1b patient trial in the US. This exploratory dose escalation study will investigate the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of '1972 in 30 patients with hip and/or knee osteoarthritis after 4 weeks of oral administration. Completion of patient recruitment is expected by the end of 2017. Additional pipeline progressGalapagos expects to report topline results with MOR106, a human monoclonal antibody targeting IL-17C, in a Phase 1b trial in atopic dermatitis patients later in 2017. Furthermore, Galapagos expects to initiate a new study with GPR84 inhibitor GLPG1205 in an undisclosed indication later in 2017. Galapagos nominated GLPG2384 in an undisclosed indication and GLPG3121 in psoriasis, increasing the number of fully proprietary clinical stage assets to five.  Webcast presentation and conference callGalapagos will webcast the R&D Update tomorrow (20 June 2017) at 8.00 Eastern Time (ET) and 14:00 Central European Time (CET), together with a conference call.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Webcast from NY at 14.00 CET/8AM ET tomorrowvia www.glpg.com, +32 2 404 0659, code 8093710
Mechelen, Belgium; 20 June 2017; 7.30 CET, regulated information -Galapagos NV (Euronext & NASDAQ:GLPG) announces progress made in its R&D strategy and portfolio at its Annual R&D Update on 20 June at 8 AM EDT at the Yale Club in New York City. 
"I am emboldened by the execution of our strategy by the Galapagos teams that has resulted in great opportunities for our company. Galapagos now has a broad and deep pipeline with multiple product candidates across different indications. We have five proprietary clinical assets and the cash reserves to take these product candidates forward on our own into clinical development," said CEO Onno van de Stolpe.
DARWIN 3 interim readout Patients who completed DARWIN 1 or 2 and enrolled in DARWIN 3 received filgotinib 200mg once daily or 100mg twice daily, depending on prior treatment assignment. A total of 559 patients completed week 60. Based on an observed case analysis 84%, 65%, 44%, and 51% of patients reached ACR20, ACR50, ACR70 and DAS28 (CRP) remission at Week 60 respectively. Overall exposure to filgotinib was 1314 patient-years (PYE). Safety was in line with the core studies. There were no clinically meaningful changes to male reproductive hormones measured. The totality of these safety data continues to reflect a favorable profile for filgotinib in the target population. Filgotinib is currently being investigated in three Phase 3 programs and six additional Phase 2 proof-of-concept studies: ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, cutaneous lupus erythematosus, Sjögren's syndrome, small bowel Crohn's, and fistulizing Crohn's. As filgotinib is currently in Phase 3 studies, the efficacy and safety of filgotinib have not yet been established.
Cystic fibrosis triple combinationsGalapagos and AbbVie have developed a large portfolio of potentiators and correctors that provides the opportunity to develop distinct triple combination therapies for CF patients. Galapagos reports that Phase 1 results on GLPG2451, GLPG2222 and GLPG2737 showed favorable findings relating to safety and tolerability of the individual components that constitute our current most advanced potential triple combination therapy. These results lead Galapagos to initiate that triple combination program, including start of the regulatory review process in Europe next month, which should allow for a patient study with '2737 in combination with Orkambi[1] and the first patient study with the triple combination '2451, '2222, and '2737 to start in Q4 2017. In addition, Galapagos anticipates starting two triple studies in 2018: one with '3067, '2222, and '2737 and one with '3067, '2222, and '3221.
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: orphan drug status in US and topline data expected for GLPG1690 from FLORA studyGalapagos received orphan status for GLPG1690 in IPF from the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA). Galapagos has full commercial rights for '1690 and expects to announce topline results from an exploratory Phase 2a study with '1690 in IPF patients in the third quarter of 2017. 
Osteoarthritis: GLPG1972 being tested in patients in the US Galapagos is developing GLPG1972, targeting ADAMTS-5, as a potential disease-modifying therapy for osteoarthritis. Galapagos has full commercial rights in the US. Our collaboration partner Servier will be making its opt-in decision for further development and ex-US commercial rights later this year. Galapagos opened an Investigational New Drug (IND) dossier with the FDA for '1972 and achieved first dosing in a Phase 1b patient trial in the US. This exploratory dose escalation study will investigate the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of '1972 in 30 patients with hip and/or knee osteoarthritis after 4 weeks of oral administration. Completion of patient recruitment is expected by the end of 2017.
Additional pipeline progressGalapagos expects to report topline results with MOR106, a human monoclonal antibody targeting IL-17C, in a Phase 1b trial in atopic dermatitis patients later in 2017. Furthermore, Galapagos expects to initiate a new study with GPR84 inhibitor GLPG1205 in an undisclosed indication later in 2017. Galapagos nominated GLPG2384 in an undisclosed indication and GLPG3121 in psoriasis, increasing the number of fully proprietary clinical stage assets to five. 
Webcast presentation and conference callGalapagos will webcast the R&D Update tomorrow (20 June 2017) at 8.00 Eastern Time (ET) and 14:00 Central European Time (CET), together with a conference call.

Cystic fibrosis programs
CF is a rare, life-threatening, genetic disease that affects approximately 80,000 patients worldwide and approximately 30,000 patients in the United States. CF is a chronic disease that affects the lungs and digestive system. CF patients, with significantly impaired quality of life, have an average lifespan approximately 50% shorter than the population average, with the median age of death at 40. There currently is no cure for CF. CF patients require lifelong treatment with multiple daily medications, frequent hospitalizations and ultimately lung transplant, which is life-extending but not curative. CF is caused by a mutation in the gene for the CFTR protein, which results in abnormal transport of chloride across cell membranes. Transport of chloride is required for effective hydration of epithelial surfaces in many organs of the body. Normal CFTR channel moves chloride ions to outside of the cell. Mutant CFTR channel does not move chloride ions, causing sticky mucous to build up on the outside of the cell. CFTR dysfunction results in dehydration of dependent epithelial surfaces, leading to damage of the affected tissues and subsequent disease, such as lung disease, malabsorption in the intestinal tract and pancreatic insufficiency. 
Galapagos and AbbVie entered into a global alliance to discover, develop and commercialize novel therapies in cystic fibrosis (CF) in September 2013. Galapagos and AbbVie aim to develop a triple CFTR combination therapy to address 90% of patients with CF. In order to bring a more effective therapy to patients, the companies have developed multiple candidates and backups for each of the three components of a potential triple combination. Triple combinations of CF compounds in the portfolio have consistently shown restoration of healthy activity levels in in vitro assays with human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells of patients with the F508del mutation. These combinations result in a statistically significant increase in chloride transport over Orkambi[1] in HBE cells with the homozygous F508del mutation. It is expected that a triple combination therapy patient study will start in 2017.
[1] Orkambi® is a prescription medicine sold by Vertex Pharmaceuticals, used for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients age 12 years and older who have two copies of the F508del mutation (F508del/F508del) in their CFTR gene.
