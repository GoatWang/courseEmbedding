Advance refunding
A financing structure under which new bonds are issued to repay an outstanding bond issue prior to its first call date. Generally, the proceeds of the new issue are invested in government securities, which are placed in escrow. The interest and principal repayments on these securities are then used to repay the old issue, usually on the first call date.
Bid
The price at which a buyer will purchase a security.
Bearer security
A security that has no identification as to owner. It is presumed to be owned, therefore, by the bearer or the person who holds it. Bearer securities are freely and easily negotiable, since ownership can be quickly transferred from seller to buyer.
Bond funds
Registered investment companies whose assets are invested in diversified portfolios of bonds.
Callable bonds
Bonds, which are redeemable by the issuer prior to the specified maturity date at a specified price at or above par.
Call premium
A dollar amount, usually stated as a percentage of the principal amount called, paid as a “penalty” or a “premium” for the exercise of a call provision.
Coupon
This part of a bond denotes the amount of interest due, and on what date and where the payment is to be made. Bearer coupons are presented to the issuer’s designated paying agent or deposited in a commercial bank for collection. In the case of registered coupons (see “Registered bond”), the interest payment is mailed directly to the registered holder. Coupons are generally payable semiannually.
Current refunding
A financing structure under which the old bonds are called or mature within 90 days of the issuance of the new refunding bonds.
Current yield
The ratio of interest to the actual market price of the bond stated as a percentage. For example, a $1,000 bond that pays $80 per year in interest would have a current yield of 8%.
CUSIP
The Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures, which was established under the auspices of the American Bankers Association to develop a uniform method of identifying municipal, U.S. government, and corporate services.
Dated date (or issue date)
The date of a bond issue from which the bondholder is entitled to receive interest, even though the bonds may actually be delivered at some other date.
Default
Failure to pay principal or interest promptly when due
Discount
The amount by which the purchase price of a security is less than the principal amount or par value.
Double exemption
Securities that are exempt from state as well as federal income taxes are said to have double exemption.
Extraordinary redemption
This is different from optional redemption or mandatory redemption in that it occurs under an unusual circumstance such as destruction of the facility financed.
Face amount
The par value (i.e. principal or maturity value) of a security appearing on the face of the instrument.
Fixed rate bond
A long-term bond with an interest rate fixed to maturity.
Floating rate bond
A long-term bond for which the interest rate is adjusted periodically according to a predetermined formula, based upon specific market indicators.
Interest
Compensation paid or to be paid for the use of money. Interest is generally expressed as an annual percentage rate.
Issuer
A state, political subdivision, agency or authority, which borrows money through the sale of bonds or notes.
Legal opinion
An opinion concerning the validity of a securities issue with respect to statutory authority, constitutionality, procedural conformity and usually the exemption of interest from federal income taxes. The legal opinion is usually rendered by a law firm recognized as specializing in public borrowings, often referred to as “bond counsel.”
Limited tax bond
A bond secured by a pledge of a tax or category of taxes limited as to rate or amount.
Marketability
A measure of the ease with which a security can be sold in the secondary market
Maturity
The date when the principal amount of a security becomes due and payable.









Moral obligation bond
A revenue bond which, in addition to its primary source of security, possesses a structure whereby a state pledges to make up shortfalls in a debt service reserve fund, subject to legislative appropriation. There is no legal obligation for the state to make such a payment, but market participants recognize that failure to honor the “moral” pledge would have negative consequences for the state’s own creditworthiness.
Non callable bond
A bond that cannot be called either for redemption by or at the option of the issuer before its specified maturity date.
Notes
Short-term promises to pay specified amounts of money, secured by specified sources of future revenues, such as taxes, federal and state aid payments and bond proceeds.
Offering price
The price at which members of an underwriting syndicate for a new issue will offer securities to investors.
Official statement
Document prepared by the issuer that gives in detail security and financial information about the issue.
Optional redemption
A right to retire all or part of an issue prior to the stated maturity during a specified period of years, often at a premium. The right can be exercised at the option of the issuer.
Original issue discount
A bond, issued at a dollar price less than par which qualifies for special treatment under federal tax law. Under that law, the difference between the issue price and par is treated as tax-exempt income rather than a capital gain, if the bonds are held to maturity.
Par value
The principal amount of a bond or note due at maturity.
Paying agent
Place where principal and interest are payable. Usually a designated bank or at the office of the treasurer of the issuer.
Premium
The amount by which the price of a security exceeds its principal amount.
Principal
The face amount of a bond exclusive of accrued interest and payable at maturity.
Ratings
Designations used by rating services designed to give relative indications of credit quality.
Registered bond
A bond whose owner is registered with the issuer or its agent either as to both principal and interest or as to principal only. Transfer of ownership can only be accomplished when the securities are properly endorsed by the registered owner.
Special tax bond
A bond secured by a special tax, such as a gasoline tax.
Swap
Simply, the sale of a block of bonds and the purchase of another block of similar market value. Swaps may be made to achieve many goals, including establishing a tax loss, upgrading credit quality, extending or shortening maturity, etc.
Trade date
The date when a bond transaction is executed.
Trustee
A bank designated by the issuer as the custodian of funds and official representative of bondholders. Trustees are appointed to ensure compliance with the trust indenture and represent bondholders to enforce their contract with the issuers.
Unit investment trust (municipal)
A fixed portfolio of tax-exempt bonds sold in fractional, undivided interests.
Unlimited tax bond
A bond secured by the pledge of taxes that are not limited by rate or amount.
Yield to call
A yield on a security calculated by assuming that interest payments will be paid until the call date, when the security will be redeemed at the call price.
Yield to maturity
A yield concept designed to give the investor the average annual yield on a security. It is based on the assumption that the security is held to maturity and that all interest received over the life of the security can be reinvested at the yield to maturity.
Zero coupon bond
A bond for which no periodic interest payments are made. The investor receives one payment at maturity. The maturity value an investor receives is equal to the principal invested plus interest earned compounded semiannually at the original interest rate to maturity.

Asset Management and Investment Advice









Our team of experienced professionals strives to build wealth by providing a well-diversified portfolio for investors of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. We provide strategies to our clients to assist them in achieving their financial goals.
Bonds
We provide clients with a wide selection of corporate, government, and municipal bonds. Our firm will act either as a principal or an agent in executing trades. The principals of the firm are active in the municipal market on a daily basis and update the offerings weekly as the market changes.
College Savings
Investing in a 529 plan is a vital tool in college preparation. Here in our firm, we work with a variety of 529 plans such as the CollegeAdvantage plan administered by the Ohio Tuition Trust Authority.















Mutual Funds
Mutual Fund investing is for our clients who are interested in balancing their stock and bond portfolios. Our firm uses fund companies such as The American Funds, Franklin Templeton, Fidelity Advisor, and Thornburg in advising clients on mutual fund investing.
Retirement Plans: 401(k)s and IRAs
Sweney Cartwright & Co. works with individual trust departments and outside investment counsel with the management of retirement plans. In addition, we provide our clients with IRAs and other retirement accounts through RBC and many mutual fund families.
SIPC
We chose RBC Correspondent Services as our clearing firm. They are a division of RBC Capital Markets, LLC who is affiliated with the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC). This nonprofit membership corporation draws funding from its member security broker-dealers.
SIPC provides protection for the securities of the clients of its members. If a member firm fails, SIPC reimburses that firm’s clients. Up to $500,000 of the cash value of a client’s securities can be recovered this way. Additionally, up to $250,000 of the cash in a client’s account would be reimbursed by SIPC. This reduces the $500,000 above.
Aside from the protection given by SPIC, RBC Capital Markets, LLC, has purchased an additional policy. The latter covers extra securities and cash up to $99.5 million per client. Up to $900,000 of this amount may be in cash. This additional policy has an aggregate limit of $400 million.
RBC Capital Markets also protects client’s assets from loss due to theft or fraud. This covers computer fraud and theft by an outsider or employee for personal gain. The firm will cover the client’s losses in such cases using their CAN$310 million Financial Institution Bond. Coverage is subject to that policy’s conditions, limits, and terms.
Note: Deprecation of value of a client’s assets due to market loss is covered by neither SIPC protection, nor the additional policy. You can get more information by visiting www.sipc.org.
Stocks
Our firm transacts client’s orders through our relationship with RBC Correspondent Services.
OTC Bank Stocks
Our team of experienced traders makes markets in more than 25 community banks trading on the NASDAQ and the Bulletin Board. Our approach to making markets is to act as both a consultant and market-maker to the banks we serve.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

About Our Securities Company
Read on to learn more about Sweney Cartwright & Co. in Columbus, OH. You can also get more information about our staff and business continuity plan by browsing this page.









Our History
Sweney Cartwright & Co. and its forerunner, Lowry Sweney, Inc., have built over 83 years of trust in the Central OH area, the most important aspect of the securities business.
The company operates from an office in the Huntington National Bank building and is the city’s only locally owned, full-service securities firm. It is from this office that functions are handled—customer investments, operations, underwriting, and trading. Customer securities are held at the Depository Trust Company.
Our firm offers clients conservative investments for both income and growth. The company specializes in tax-free municipal bonds for conservative investors. For those looking for taxable income, we offer high-quality corporate, U.S. Treasury, and U.S. Government agency bonds.
For equity investors, our firm offers access to multiple exchanges, giving us access to all equity securities. Sweney Cartwright also makes markets in over 25 community banks trading on the NASDAQ stock market.
We have our roots in the Huntington National Bank. This is where Lowry Sweney managed the investment department and was the first manager of Huntington Securities. In 1933, the Roosevelt administration passed the Glass-Steagell Act, which made banks divest themselves of their broker-dealer departments.
In response to the impositions of the Glass-Steagell Act, Sweney left the bank in 1934. He purchased the assets of Huntington Securities to form Lowry Sweney, Inc. His new company operated for more than a decade.
In 1946, Todd Cartwright, a longtime business associate, returned from Chicago, and, with Lowry Sweney and Ralph Elam, formed Sweney Cartwright & Co. Stephen Sweney joined the firm in 1956 and Stephen Cartwright in 1959. Today, our firm is operated by the following principals and stockholders:
