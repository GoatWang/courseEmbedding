	Forward-Looking Statements




	 


	This Current Report on Form 8-K and other written and oral statements made from time to time by us may contain so-called "forward-looking statements," all of which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as "expects," "plans," "will," "forecasts," "projects," "intends," "estimates," and other words of similar meaning. One can identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements are likely to address our growth strategy, financial results and product and development programs. One must carefully consider any such statement and should understand that many factors could cause actual results to differ from our forward looking statements. These factors may include inaccurate assumptions and a broad variety of other risks and uncertainties, including some that are known and some that are not. No forward looking statement can be guaranteed and actual future results may vary materially.


	 


	Information regarding market and industry statistics contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K is included based on information available to us that we believe is accurate. It is generally based on industry and other publications that are not produced for purposes of securities offerings or economic analysis. We have not reviewed or included data from all sources, and cannot assure investors of the accuracy or completeness of the data included in this Current Report. Forecasts and other forward-looking information obtained from these sources are subject to the same qualifications and the additional uncertainties accompanying any estimates of future market size, revenue and market acceptance of products and services. We do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statement. As a result, investors should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.










	Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement





	On March 1, 2017, the Company notified SH Franchising & Licensing, LLC, that the Company and related franchisees would no longer continue to operate the Company's restaurants under the Southern Hospitality franchise agreement.  The Company was required to give notice of its intention not to continue operating under the Southern Hospitality name pursuant to the terms of the franchise agreement.











	Item 8.01 Other Events.





	On February 24, 2017, the Company received a notice of default related to a promissory note in an amount of $150,000 dated February 3, 2016, which matured on February 3, 2017.  The promissory note contains a thirty day cure period, and the Company is currently determining if it will be possible to cure the default of the promissory note.





	On February 28, 2017, the Company received a default notice related to a note conversion agreement with Bourbon Brothers #14, LLC dated December 29, 2016.  The default notice states that pursuant to the note conversion agreement, the Company was required to hold a shareholders meeting, or file a proxy statement within sixty days of the note conversion agreement in order to effect various corporate changes.  The default notice demands payment of the debt owed to Bourbon Brothers #14, LLC, in an amount of $1,300,000.  In exchange for repayment, Bourbon Brothers #14, LLC would return the 20,000,000 shares of common stock issued pursuant to the note conversion agreement.  The Company is currently deciding how to proceed and respond to the default notice.





	On February 28, 2017, the Company received a default notice related to a licensing agreement with Hospitality Income & Asset, LLC, whereby the Company was granted the exclusive right to use the Bourbon Brothers federal trademark and associated trademarks, trade names, service marks, logos, brands, slogans, domain names and identifying features (the "Marks") owned by Hospitality Income & Asset, LLC.  The default notice states that the Company is in violation of Section 11 of the first amendment to the licensing agreement related to insolvency, and Hospitality Income & Asset, LLC is therefore invoking such section 11 in order to terminate the rights, grants and any usage of the Marks by the Company.  The default notice states that the notice of termination shall take effect thirty days from the date of the default notice, and that the Company must begin to return all intellectual property containing the Marks, and transfer all domain names making reference to the Marks to Hospitality Income & Asset, LLC.

Southern Concepts Restaurant Group Inc. is putting a renewed focus on its sit-down restaurant, Southern Hospitality, rather than just concentrating on its Carve fast-casual barbecue concept, hoping to rise out of the doldrums facing much of the restaurant industry now.
CEO Jim Fenlason took over his position with the Colorado Springs-based company (OTCQB: RIBS) on Aug. 3, replacing former CEO Mitchell Roth. He said company executives, who have had mixed success at their four Colorado restaurants, are trying to streamline the organization and fine-tune their menus to increase revenue.

They have decided to pull back on previous plans to grow only Carve and expand it quickly out of state, replacing that idea with a goal to undertake “smart growth” in Colorado and to add a third concept to the mix.




“We didn’t do anything wrong. It’s just time to take that next step on our progression,” said Fenlason, a restaurant-industry veteran who served on the board of the company before assuming day-to-day oversight of it. “I just don’t think we’ve taken full advantage of our brand.”
Southern Hospitality, a sit-down barbecue joint, launched nine years ago in New York with celebrity investors like Justin Timberlake behind it. Southern Concepts bought the franchise rights for Colorado and now operates locations in Denver, Lone Tree and Colorado Springs, plus the fast-casual spin-off Carve Barbecue on Colorado Boulevard in Denver — the only such restaurants outside of New York.




 


Fenlason said that some of the four locations are profitable, while others are not, and he acknowledged that the concepts, like most of the restaurant industry, struggled this summer.
His first major action as CEO was to eliminate most of the corporate staff for the chain, allowing him to work directly with restaurant general managers and bartenders. That’s led to the roll-out of new menu dishes in recent months, ranging from chicken-fried steak, to smoked meatloaf, to whiskey wiggle cake with bourbon butterscotch ice cream.
Fenlason wants to open up one or two more locations of each concept along the Front Range in the coming years, and he wants to add a third brand — a smaller eatery that serves a limited menu of Memphis-style barbecue sandwiches smoked in a central kitchen. That would allow the company to take full advantage of rising commercial rent in the Denver area, he said.

Only after about a five-year build-out will the company look at franchising or going out of state, he said. In that time, he believes it can nail down its marketing to convince people that Southern food doesn’t equal unhealthy food and promote unusual features such as its bourbon bar.
“In the right market with the right demographics, there’s still a demand for our product,” Fenlason said. “We’re not a sit-down hamburger restaurant ... A good, high-quality Southern restaurant is still hard to find.”
