NRG Yield Operating LLC Announces Pricing Of $500.0 Million “Green Bond” Due 2024






Business Wire




Jul 31, 2014 1:51 PM EDT













 




























































  NRG Yield Operating LLC (“Yield Operating”), an indirect subsidiary of NRG Yield, Inc. (NYSE:NYLD)(“NRG Yield”), has priced its previously announced offering of $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.375% senior notes due 2024 (the “Notes”). The Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of Yield Operating and will be guaranteed by NRG Yield LLC, Yield Operating’s parent company, and by each of Yield Operating’s wholly owned current and future subsidiaries that guarantees indebtedness under its credit agreement.  The Notes will mature on August 15, 2024, unless earlier repurchased in accordance with their terms. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing on February 15, 2015. The offering of the Notes is expected to close on August 5, 2014, subject to customary conditions.  Yield Operating intends to use the proceeds of the offering to fund, in whole or in part, renewable energy projects (“Eligible Green Projects”). Specifically, Yield Operating intends to use the proceeds from the offering, together with cash on hand, including the net proceeds from the issuance of Class A common stock by NRG Yield, which proceeds were contributed to Yield Operating, to fund the aggregate $870 million cash purchase price of the previously announced acquisition of the Alta Wind Facility (the “Alta Acquisition”). However, this offering is not conditioned upon the completion of the Alta Acquisition and, to the extent the Alta Acquisition is not completed, Yield Operating expects that the net proceeds from this offering will be allocated by it to future acquisitions of Eligible Green Projects, which include the financing of, or investments in, equipment and systems that generate or facilitate the generation of energy from renewable sources, such as solar, wind and geothermal energy.  The Notes and related guarantees are being offered only to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or outside the United States to persons other than “U.S. persons” in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Notes and related guarantees have not been registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements. This notice is issued pursuant to Rule 135c of the Securities Act, and does not constitute an offer to sell, nor a solicitation for an offer to purchase the Notes.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
