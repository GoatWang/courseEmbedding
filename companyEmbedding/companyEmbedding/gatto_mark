California Homemade Food: New Law Allows People To Make Food At Home And Sell It In Stores






By Aaron Sankin










100


























Would you go to a restaurant to buy food someone made in their kitchen at home? 
That's the question millions of Californians are going to have to ask themselves now that a new law, which went into effect on January 1, allows Golden State residents to sell their own products at restaurants and grocery stores without going through the onerous process of getting a commercial kitchen license.
Signed into law by California governor Jerry Brown last year, the California Homemade Food Act allows people to register themselves at "cottage food operations" after taking a food safety class, passing a state examination, paying a registration fee, labeling their food as homemade and submitting their kitchens to an annual inspection. 
The law is aimed at stimulating the growth of small businesses as well as increasing access to the types of healthy food options, especially in low-income and rural communities.
"Up until now, people who wanted to turn their passion into a small business were faced with stifling red tape," the bill's author, Assemblyman Mike Gatto (D-Los Angeles), told Capital Public Radio.
Gatto introduced the bill after the bread Los Angeles-area amateur baker Mark Stambler sold to some local restaurants drew the ire of public heath officials.
"If I...[wanted] to sell bread in a store anywhere in Los Angeles County, I basically have to own a wholesale food processing facility. Period," Stambler told Southern California Public Radio, noting that the costs for setting up a facility could easily reach hundreds of thousands of dollars.
There are some limitations on what home food producers are allowed to produce: meat, dairy and other perishable products are strictly off-limits. The list of approved foods includes non-cream filled goods, candy, dried fruit, pastas, granola, roasted coffee, jams, jellies, preserves and popcorn. 
Additionally, since legislators didn't want the law to become a loophole through which large-scale food producers could skirt health code regulations, cottage operators have a revenue limit set at $35,000 (rising to $50,000 in 2015) and can only employ one full-time equivalent worker.
At least 32 other states, such as Texas, Michigan and Oregon, have passed similar laws allowing small businesses to prepare non-hazardous food for sale in home kitchens

Michael A. Reisner and Mark Gatto are Co-Presidents and Co-Chief Executive Officers of ICON Investments. They additionally hold the titles of Co-Presidents and Co-CEOs of CÄŞON Investment Management 
Collectively Messrs. Reisner and Gatto have approximately 20 years of experience at ICON and have each been in executive positions since 2005. When they acquired ICON in March of 2008, the company and those it serves gained leaders with a wealth of knowledge and experience in capital formation, risk management and operations, business development, financial management, and business and legal affairs. Since 1999, whether it was managing the legal department; improving financial reporting processes; sourcing, negotiating and executing complex transactions; or establishing ICON’s international presence, one or both of Messrs. Reisner and Gatto have done it all. Their broad based skill sets and vast experience in all facets of ICON’s business are the company’s greatest assets. 

Messrs. Reisner’s and Gatto’s vision and resolve has transformed ICON from a sponsor and manager of solely equipment finance funds to a diversified investment manager of alternative investments for the intermediate broker-dealer channel, institutions and family offices. Under their leadership, ICON consolidated all major operational functions to its new Park Avenue headquarters in New York City and firmly established representative offices in Boston, Tulsa, London, and Singapore. In addition, Messrs. Reisner and Gatto rebranded the company to ICON Investments in January  2011 to better reflect their vision and the evolution of the company since they acquired it in 2008. Today, ICON Investments is a leader in both the investment management and financial services industries and at the forefront of innovation, integrity, transparency and performance. 

Mr. Reisner started his career as a lawyer, where he worked in private practice in New York from 1996-2001. Mr. Reisner graduated cum laude from New York Law School and received his B.A. degree from the University of Vermont.

Mr. Gatto started his career as a lawyer, where he worked in private practice concentrating on commercial transactions and general litigation matters. Additionally, he was an executive for a leading international product development and marketing company and later, co-founded a specialty business-consulting firm in New York City where he served as its managing partner before re-joining ICON in 2005. Mr. Gatto received an M.B.A from the W. Paul Stillman School of Business at Seton Hall University, a J.D. from Seton Hall University School of Law, and a B.S. from Montclair State University.
Harry Giovani, Managing Director & Chief Credit Officer
Mr. Giovani, Managing Director – Chief Credit Officer, joined ICON in  2008. Most recently he was Vice President for FirstLight Financial  Corporation, responsible for underwriting and syndicating middle market  leveraged loan transactions. Previously, he spent three years at GE  Commercial Finance, initially as an Assistant Vice President in the  Intermediary Group, where he was responsible for executing middle market  transactions in a number of industries including manufacturing, steel,  paper, pharmaceutical, technology, chemicals and automotive, and later  as a Vice President in the Industrial Project Finance Group where he  originated highly structured project finance transactions. He started  his career at Citigroup’s Citicorp Securities and CitiCapital divisions,  where he spent six years in a variety of roles of increasing  responsibility including underwriting, origination and strategic  marketing / business development. Mr. Giovani graduated from Cornell  University in 1996 with a B.S. in Finance.
Jason Braunstein, Senior Director
Mr. Braunstein joined ICON in 2010 and is a Senior Director in ICON's acquisitions department focusing on shipping, offshore oilfield services and other industrial markets.  In his current capacity, Mr. Braunstein works on developing, structuring and pricing transactions, leading investment analysis and coordinating with co-investors.  Prior to his current role, Mr. Braunstein worked as a Director in 2014, Associate Director in 2013 and Associate from 2010-2012 at ICON.  Before joining ICON, Mr. Braunstein worked as an account representative at All-Ways Forwarding Int'l Inc in 2008-2009.  He received his B.A. in Economics and Government from Connecticut College and his M.Sc. in Shipping, Trade and Finance from Cass Business School.
