Elizabeth Anthony 


From the article:  Glam evening with fab designer draws fashionable crowd to glittery runway show












 Photo by Anthony A. Hynes



	For the Pamella Roland spring 2015 collection runway show and cocktail party at Elizabeth Anthony, Hallie Vanderhider chose a black lambskin dress with black and sable lurel panels created by the designer. "Pamella Roland is one of my favorite designers and this dress was one of my favorite designs, so I wanted to honor her by wearing it," Vanderhider said via email.

	She accessorized the dress with a black mother-of-pearl cuff and sterling silver geode earrings with black mother-of-pearl and white sapphires, both by Kara Ross, and Jimmy Choo pumps. The dress and jewelry were purchased from Elizabeth Anthony; the shoes came from Joseph.

	Vanderhider, who has worked as an executive in the oil and gas industry through much of her career and currently is a consultant at Catalyst Partners LLC, says her style varies to fit the occasion — sometimes very "feminine" and other times "classic with an edge."
