    See all 5 reviews3.0 out of 5 starsI can't decide if the author is highly intelligent, wants me to think he is highly intelligent ...ByCallie EMbryon July 24, 2017Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseI had to have this for class.  It is crazy wordy.  I can't decide if the author is highly intelligent, wants me to think he is highly intelligent or wants me to believe the material is incredibly complicated.  One third of the book is reference citations. (literally).  It is a book about research but if you are going to include every reference at the end then there is no need to add them in the text with parenthesis; which makes it very hard to follow.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.2.0 out of 5 starsEven topics I already know about like cognitive dissonance are hard to read throughByShelby Raffion October 28, 2015Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseGod this book is dry. Reading it for class is just a pain to get though. Even topics I already know about like cognitive dissonance are hard to read through. Not because it doesn't make sense, but O'Keefe just has this way of using big words and filling every sentence with interjections and it just doesn't need to be this difficult. These topics are fun, but they don't read that way. He also ends most chapters by saying (basically) that we really don't know anything about the topic he just told us about because research shows it not to be true or hasn't been conducted or the terms aren't defined well or consistently and it leaves me wondering why I am bothering to learn it in the first place.0Comment|

Simpler examples would help, but overall is an excellent reference and easy to apply for everyday attempts on creating persuasive messages. The chapter on ELM was very good! Never did I see theory explained so clearly before!0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

 Persuasion: Theory and Research, Third Edition is a comprehensive overview of social-scientific theory and research on persuasion. Written in a clear and accessible style that assumes no special technical background in research methods, the Third Edition has been thoroughly revised to reflect developments in persuasion studies. New discussions of subjects such as reactance and the use of narratives as vehicles for persuasion, revised treatments of the theories of reasoned action and planned behavior, and two new chapters on social judgment theory and stage models provide your students with the most current work on persuasion in a clear, straightforward manner. In this edition, author Daniel J. O′Keefe has given special attention to the importance of adapting (tailoring) messages to audiences to maximize persuasiveness. Each chapter has a set of review questions to guide students through the chapter’s material and quickly master the concepts being introduced.

It is crazy wordy.  I can't decide if the author is highly intelligent, wants me to think he is highly intelligent or wants me to believe the material is incredibly complicated.  One third of the book is reference citations. (literally).  It is a book about research but if you are going to include every reference at the end then there is no need to add them in the text with parenthesis; which makes it very hard to follow.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse2.0 out of 5 starsEven topics I already know about like cognitive dissonance are hard to read throughByShelby Raffion October 28, 2015Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseGod this book is dry. Reading it for class is just a pain to get though. Even topics I already know about like cognitive dissonance are hard to read through. Not because it doesn't make sense, but O'Keefe just has this way of using big words and filling every sentence with interjections and it just doesn't need to be this difficult. These topics are fun, but they don't read that way. He also ends most chapters by saying (basically) that we really don't know anything about the topic he just told us about because research shows it not to be true or hasn't been conducted or the terms aren't defined well or consistently and it leaves me wondering why I am bothering to learn it in the first place.Read more0Comment|

A book is the nearest thing we have to telepathy, sending thoughts from the author's mind directly to the readers even over a gap of two thousand years. Even with all our technology, there is no better way to make a brain to brain connection than by simply reading a book. Go Way Back to the BeginningAntique books and manuscripts offer an amazing look into history, you can see the thoughts of the past as they saw them themselves. Antiquarian and collectible books don't just look good on the shelf, they also grow in value. There is nothing like picking up an old book to really feel the past. Explore the Human ConditionThe beauty of fiction and literature is that it lets you explore the human condition in a way that mere recitations of fact can never duplicate. Rather than focusing on the mundane, these books bring out the emotional truth of human experience. They show you who you really are by exposing you to other experiences you could never have discovered yourself. These books are the underpinnings of human culture. See how someone else sees the world. Discover the World Around YouNon fiction books offer the widest range of human experience, joined only by their commitment to the truth. From self-help to space travel, they run the gamut of human thought. Learn how to deal with your family, how to save money for that trip, or how the Egyptians built the pyramids. Follow famous lives, or study esoteric philosophies. It's all there for you to find. Non fiction gives us the foundations of human civilization, the story of how everything works. Keep Learning for LifeEducation is the gateway to success, and textbooks are your key to that door. From elementary readers to calculus texts, these books are the doors to our full potential. Textbooks not only give us facts, they give us the tools to interpret and make use of those facts. They are the key to organizing our thoughts and making our brains work for us. It's not just academia either, mechanics textbooks can help you learn how to fix your car.Tell us what you think - opens in new window or tabSide Refine PanelShop by CategoryAntique Books and ManuscriptsAudiobooksBook & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsSee all in Book & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsBook Wholesale LotsOther Book & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsWholesale AudiobooksWholesale MagazinesBook AccessoriesSee all in Book AccessoriesAddress BooksBlank Diaries & JournalsBook CoversBook LightsBook PlatesBook Stands & HoldersBookendsBookmarksOther Book AccessoriesCatalogsSee all in CatalogsAgriculture CatalogsArt & Exhibitions CatalogsAuction CatalogsClothing & Fashion CatalogsDepartment Stores CatalogsMusic & Instruments CatalogsOther CatalogsOwner's Manuals CatalogsToys & Hobbies CatalogsChildren & Young Adult BooksSee all in Children & Young Adult BooksChildren & YA Non-Fiction BooksChildren's Fiction BooksChildren's Picture BooksOther Children & Young Adult BooksYoung Adult Fiction BooksCookbooksFiction & Literature BooksMagazine Back IssuesNonfiction BooksOther BooksTextbooks & Educational Books

One reason is simple, while the Internet may be everywhere, it's not always accurate, and when it comes to educating people you need to have accurate information. That's why approved textbooks are so important; they give you the facts, not the opinions of someone on the Internet.Help for the Home SchooledNo one needs textbooks more than the parent who home schools their children. There is a growing movement toward home schooling so that parents can focus their children's education on the aspects Engl are most important to them, and tailor the curriculum to their own child's individual learning styles. From science and mathematics to English and history, textbooks are a vital part of any education program.For Every Age LevelNo matter what age or grade level your student is at, there are education textbooks to cover their needs.  Even if they go to a regular grade school, there are supplementary textbooks you can pick up to help them if they need it. Not every book is the right fit for every student, and sometimes the one who is having the most trouble with math in school is the one who flourishes the most as soon as you expose them to a different textbook.Explore Adult EducationEducation isn't just for children; many adults have a need for textbooks too. From those who left school early and are now looking for textbooks so they can get their GED, to professionals looking to further their development, there's a huge demand for textbooks from people in all walks of life. It's not just academic textbooks. You can also get textbooks on practical subjects from financial management, to woodworking, and auto repair.Control Your College EducationCollege is more than just an investment in your future; it's an investment. One way to take charge of your college costs is to look outside your college bookstore for your textbooks. Many textbooks, especially in fields such as English and history do not change much from year to year, so grabbing last  year's engineering handbook may be the best way to go.Tell us what you think - opens in new window or tabSide Refine PanelShop by CategoryBooksTextbooks & Educational BooksBook AccessoriesAntique Books and ManuscriptsAudiobooksCatalogsChildren & Young Adult BooksCookbooksFiction & Literature BooksMagazine Back IssuesNonfiction BooksBook & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsOther BooksFormatsee allHardcoverMixed LotPaperbackNot SpecifiedPublication Yearsee all1900-19491950-19992000-20102011-NowSubjectsee allBusiness & EconomicsEducation, TeachingEngineeringHistoryMathMedicinePerforming ArtsScience & TechLanguagesee allConditionsee allBrand NewLike NewVery GoodGoodAcceptableNot SpecifiedPricePlease provide a valid price range$-$Buying Formatsee allAll ListingsAuctionBuy It NowItem Locationsee allDefaultWithindistance2 miles5 miles10 miles15 miles20 miles50 miles75 miles100 miles150 miles200 miles500 miles750 miles1000 miles1500 miles2000 milesofGoUS OnlyNorth AmericaWorldwideDelivery Optionssee allFree ShippingFree In-store PickupShow onlysee allReturns AcceptedCompleted ItemsSold ItemsDeals & SavingsMore refinements...

Daniel J Keefe's Experience
Title: 
               Company: NATO
Job Details
               Within NATO, we have made good progress in modernising our forces, making them more agile and usable for modern operations. We have, for example, streamlined the Alliance's military command structure. We have also established a NATO Response Force to be able to react quickly to any emerging crises, including natural disasters. And we are looking into ways to better plan and resource future operational engagements. Of course, military transformation never happens quite as quickly and comprehensively as we all would like to see it. There is always room for improvement. But the overall direction of our military modernisation is very clear indeed. The third area of NATO's transformation relates to our relationship with other institutions. In order to tackle today's complex security challenges, we must apply military, political, economic, and other instruments in a well-coordinated way. This means that NATO will increasingly act in concert with other institutions. On the ground, whether in the Balkans, Afghanistan, Iraq or Darfur, this is already a reality. But we also need structured relationships at the institutional level to be able to coordinate strategically, not just tactically. And this is a major dimension of NATO's current transformation as well. We have made good progress in developing our cooperation with the United Nations. What we need above all, however, is a much stronger partnership between NATO and the European Union. A former US Ambassador to NATO once said that, even though NATO and the EU were based in the same city, it often seemed as though they were on different planets. And it is true that, in the past, our relationship has been characterised by considerable nervousness, and even a degree of suspicion. I think we are seeing greater realism now on all sides. A realisation that, the Union is bound to become a stronger security actor. But a realisation, also, that the EU can only be an effective security actor when it is a partner for NATO, and not a counterweight. Where that should lead to is a much more pragmatic, transparent partnership between the EU and NATO, which extends well beyond crisis management to cover the full range of security issues before us. This will be a boon for all of us NATO and EU members alike. The fourth area of NATO's transformation that I wish to highlight is the geographic dimension. Now more than ever before, we need to look at certain countries and regions through a common transatlantic lens. This is true for Russia and Ukraine, for the Caucasus and Central Asia, as well as for Northern Africa and the so-called Broader Middle East. Finding ways to help positive change in these different regions, to foster democracy and stability, should be a joint transatlantic effort or it won't stand much chance of success. Again, we are using NATO to promote this common transatlantic approach. We are intensifying our cooperation with Russia and Ukraine, and indeed have opened an intensified dialogue with Ukraine on its aspiration to join the Alliance. We are deepening relations with our Partners in the Caucasus and Central Asia, which are both regions of vital strategic importance. We are enhancing our dialogue and cooperation with a string of countries in Northern Africa and the Middle East ranging from Morocco to Israel. We are building new ties with countries from the Gulf region. And we are developing closer contacts with countries in Asia and the Pacific to work together in meeting security challenges that affect them as much as they affect us. These four key areas of NATO's transformation that I have highlighted conceptual, military, institutional, and geographic all underscore the comprehensive approach to security that NATO has adopted. But I would like to mention yet another aspect of transformation a challenge that in fact cuts across all other areas of NATO's evolution: I am talking about the challenge of making NATO more political. We face new, complex and truly global threats to our security. Parts of the world that used to be well beyond NATO's radar screens are rapidly growing in relevance. We must discuss new approaches to the broader Middle East, the Caucasus and other regions. And we must take our cooperation with other nations and organisations to a new level. Those are all enormous challenges. They demand that we exploit NATO's unique role as a structured, permanent forum for transatlantic political discussion to the maximum extent possible. Ever since I took office, I have been promoting such an enhanced political role for NATO, and I am pleased that the Alliance is now moving in that direction. Over the past year, we have had more regular, and increasingly constructive, political discussions at different levels on issues such as Iraq, Darfur and the Middle East. And I am pleased that NATO is also increasingly seen and respected as a political player for example in the discussions on the future of Kosovo and Afghanistan. I believe that there are many more issues that we should consider bringing to the NATO table. And one that leaps to mind is energy security. NATO's Strategic Concept includes elements of the protection of vital supply lines as one area critical to the security of Allies. Today, for reasons that are obvious including the potential of terrorists targeting our energy supplies it makes sense to me that the Allies should discuss this issue. Of course, here in Norway I don't have to explain at length why this is an important subject. But I want all Allies to engage in a frank and open discussion. To anticipate future trends. And to develop a common perspective.

His career in organized labor continued as he served as President of the National Longshoremen's Association from 1893 to 1908 and as a member of the executive council of the American Federation of Labor (AFL) from 1903 to 1908.President Theodore Roosevelt appointed Keefe as Commissioner-General of Immigration on December 1, 1908. Upon taking office, President Taft reappointed Keefe. As Commissioner General Keefe oversaw the Immigration Service during a period of mass immigration and he lobbied for strengthened immigration restrictions.After leaving office in May 1913, Keefe was a Conciliation Commissioner for the U.S. Department of Labor, where he worked to prevent and settle labor disputes for the U.S. Shipping Board Merchant Fleet Corporation from 1921 to 1925. Daniel Keefe died on January 2, 1929, at Elmhurst, Illinois.  << back to Commissioners and Directors

Our History 


 On March 1, 2003, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) assumed responsibility for the immigration service functions of the federal government. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Pub. L. No. 107–296, 116 Stat. 2135) dismantled the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and separated the agency into three components within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).The Homeland Security Act created USCIS to enhance the security and efficiency of national immigration services by focusing exclusively on the administration of benefit applications. The law also formed Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to oversee immigration enforcement and border security.USCIS benefits from a legacy of more than 100 years of federal immigration and naturalization administration.  The USCIS History Office website provides information about our agency’s history, presents research from the Office’s historians, and makes selected historical documents available electronically.For an overview of INS history please see our Agency History page.  Be sure to check for updates to the Historian's Mailbox, which regularly features new historical articles. Students and scholars interested in conducting in-depth research on the history of federal immigration and nationality administration should consult our Research Guide.Agency HistoryOrganizational Timeline Overview of INS History Commissioners and DirectorsHistorian's Mailbox   Who's #1?

What Makes Us Different?
Property Data + People Data
Our reports include the traditional info you’d expect to find about a property (ownership, deeds, tax info, etc.), but we dig deeper and offer background records on people too.
Find criminal background records on owners, registered sex offenders in the neighborhood, and more.










The Extras We Include, for FREE


Run criminal background checks on previous owners, their associates, or the neighbors. Get to know the whole story.



Know your new neighborhood by seeing sex offender information, which may include names, addresses, and criminal convictions.



Easy to use reporting. Just enter an address, a name, or even a phone number and we will give you all the information we have.

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."
