About Us
A New Kind of
Medical Device Company.
At Nuvectra™, we focus not only on what our devices do, but also on reducing their complexity for clinicians and patients. We are committed to developing products with intelligent innovations and technologies that provide improved outcomes and long-term solutions for our customers.

About Us
A New Kind of
Medical Device Company.




At Nuvectra™, we focus not only on what our devices do, but also on reducing their complexity for clinicians and patients. We are committed to developing products with intelligent innovations and technologies that provide improved outcomes and long-term solutions for our customers.



We Don’t Stop There.
At Nuvectra, we know medical technology is complicated and can be difficult to use. Our commitment also includes developing products with intuitive designs and simplified features that make using our systems easier for clinicians and patients.
 Although Nuvectra is new to the market, we were built from the more than 40 years of experience of Greatbatch, Inc., a leading supplier of critical technologies to the largest medical device companies in the world. Nuvectra’s leadership and product development (R&D) teams consist of experienced and recognized leaders in the medical device industry, including key opinion-leading physicians. Our promise is to listen to and work closely with healthcare professionals and patients to improve the outcomes and usability of medical devices.










Nuvectra: A Publicly Traded Company.
On March 14, 2016, Nuvectra Corporation completed its spin-off from Greatbatch, Inc. into an independent, publicly-traded neurostimulation medical device company. The company is headquartered in Plano, Texas, with additional locations in Denver, Ann Arbor, and Minneapolis. Nuvectra currently trades on the NASDAQ Global Market (NASDAQ) under the ticker symbol “NVTR.”

Nuvectra: Post Spin-Off - Nuvectra Corporation (NASDAQ:NVTR) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Nuvectra: Post Spin-OffOct. 4.16 | About: Nuvectra Corporation (NVTR) Eric Nickolaison Long only, Deep Value, special situations, event-drivenSummaryNuvectra has gone nowhere post spin-off.The company is at its initial stage of trying to build out its sales infrastructure.Investors should wait a few more quarter to have a better understanding of revenue growth and cash burn.Nuvectra (NASDAQ: NVTR) has gone nowhere since it was spun-off from its parent company Integer Holdings Corp (NYSE: ITGR), formerly known as Greatbatch. In fact, its down around 7% from the initial first trading day. There was a major sell off right after the first days of trading, probably due to institutional investors having to sell since the company is considered a microcap trading at $70 million. It has rallied since than, but there is still some interesting quantitative metrics that make it look attractive. 

 Overview Nuvectra basically has one products on the market. The product is called Algovita. It treats chronic pain through neurostimulation technology. The technology is used in the spinal cord, sacral nerve and the deep brain stimulation markets. The market as a whole for neurostimulation technology is estimated to be $2.6 billion. Here is what management has to say about their competitive advantages for their product from form 10:    Differentiated neurostimulation technology platform. Broad range of Algovita capabilities. Algovita's robust design helps minimize therapy failures and enables greater control and precision in providing therapy. Algovita's upgradeable technology enables next generation offerings.   This is an interesting investment opportunity. The company is in the initial setup phase of ramping up sales and marketing. So basically, an investor is getting in on the ground floor of a medical device company. With this though, comes risk, but with some protection. Management is hoping to focus on strategic markets here in the U.S. for SCS treatments and develop a network of distributors and independent sales agents for sales internationally.
 Valuation and Financial Metrics Market Capitalization = $70 Million Market Price Per Share (10/3/16) = $6.59 Shares Outstanding = 10,268,912 

 Source: SEC Filing The company trades slightly above NCAV and below book value. Also, the majority of the current assets is cash at $83.5 million which is greater than the current value of the company. Revenue for the last quarter came in at $2.56 million which is a 70% increase from prior year. This past year services revenue has started to show up. For the first 6 month services revenue was $1.2 million. As more devices are sold this should correlate to increased services revenue. There is a long ways to go though for the company to be profitable. The first 6 months the company lost $16 million and will continue to add up losses until they finish ramping up sales to meet their breakeven point (this could take a while). They should have 38 active sales territories and 50 by the end of this quarter. Currently, the product margins are 50% and service margins are 51%. These should expand as economies of scale kicks in. Piper Jaffray has a $10 price target which is right around book value and 52% above today's price. I think the company is fairly valued currently, even with it selling close to NCAV. This is an early stage medical device company that trades in a volatile market. The ramp up of sales seems to be slow with Algovita which is their main product. To protect downside risk investors should wait to atleast purchase shares at or below NCAV. The company is well capitalized and the balance sheet looks strong. This is offset though, by the earnings losses the company will have to manage while building out its sales infrastructure, and continues to do research and development. Its on track to produce operating cash flow losses of $16 million for 2016. There's plenty of cash on the balance sheet to counteract this for the next few years and for management to have ample time to see if they can create a viable company. If they can't, downside risk is the operating business is worth nothing and shareholders are left with just technology patents and PP&E worth around $7 million. This isn't a risk I'm will to take currently, investors need to see more clarity in the coming quarterly reports on how the sales growth is materializing.
 Management Compensation The company has tried to incentivize its directors and top executives through ownership of stock to directly align them with shareholders. Scott Dree is the CEO of the company with years of experience in the neurostimulation market. His base salary will be around $400,000, but after the spin-off he received a one time 2% equity position in the company. Those shares are currently worth $1.4 million, but has the potential to be worth significantly more. The CFO Walter Berger received a similar incentive, but only received a 1% equity position. Takeaway Investors need to see a few more quarters to understand the revenue growth and net income losses going forward. The cash burn could be extreme if management can't slow down the earnings losses, which will just eat away at NCAV and book value. Revenue growth will be the factor in valuing the company going forward. This company has the feel to me that it would be a good strategic purchase to competitors, especially once it gains product traction in these strategic markets it wants to focus on. The best way to judge this is through product and service revenue growth. By waiting a few more quarters, this will allow us to see a clearer picture in how physicians, hospitals and other healthcare providers are responding to the product. This is a unique opportunity, but right now, I can't tell if the odds are in Nuvectra shareholders favor, and I like to invest when I know they are.
