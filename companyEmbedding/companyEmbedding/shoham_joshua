Comparison of Robot force-control methodsArticle · January 1998 with 2 Reads1st E. Shaki2nd Joshua Dayan25.77 · Technion - Israel Institute of Technology3rd Moshe Shoham33.44 · Technion - Israel Institute of TechnologyAbstractFour different methods of robot force control - explicit, implicit, stiffness, and impedance - are compared quantitatively by simulation. Criteria and coat functions weighing these criteria were formulated. Three models were selected and used in the simulations: a simple, one-degree-of-freedom single rigid-link manipulator, a flexible link, and a macro-micro configuration. For all three systems, the performance of the impedance control method was most satisfying with respect to the chosen criterion. The flexible-arm system yielded better results than the rigid-arm model, owing to "softening" of the interaction with the environment. In combined tracking and force-applying tasks the macro-micro configuration with impedance control resulted in the best performance - especially for hard-to-follow surfaces - owing to the agility of the configuration and its ability to adapt itself to varying interaction conditions.Do you want to read the rest of this article?Request full-text

Copyright by the author. Thesis (Ph. D.) -- Stanford University, 2000. Full-text · Article · RoboticaHeidi C. SchubertJonathan HowJonathan PadvisoradvisorRead full-textModeling and simulation of planar flexible link manipulators with rigid tip connections to revolute joints[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: This paper presents the basis of a mathematical model for simulation of planar flexible-link manipulators, taking into consideration the effect of higher stiffness zones at the link tips. The proposed formulation is a variation of the finite segment multi-body dynamics approach. The formulation employs a consistent mass matrix in order to provide better approximation than the traditional lumped masses often encountered in the finite segment approach. The formulation is implemented into a computational code and tested through three examples; cantilever beam, rotating beam and three-link manipulator. In these examples, the length of the rigid tips at both sides of each link ranges from 0% to 6.25% of the whole link length. The zones of higher stiffness at the link tips are treated as short rigid zones. The effect of the rigid zones is averaged along with some portions of the flexible links, thereby allowing further simplification of the dynamic equations of motion. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modeling technique and show the importance of not ignoring the effect of the rigid tips.Article · Jun 2004 Said MegahedKarim HamzaReadComparison of adaptive control methods for trajectory tracking robots[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: The present paper compares sixteen different adaptive control methods for robot manipulators representatives of the different approaches published during the last two decades. The comparison is based on simulated results of the selected algorithms implemented on an industrial robot, the Mitsubishi RV-M2. The simulation emulates tracking control along two trajectories with different conditions: ideal implementation without disturbances, changes in system parameters, external disturbances, unmodeled dynamics and speed of motion. Two different cost functions were defined and weights assigned to errors, moments, computation cost and margin of stability. These functions are calculated for the different control algorithms considered; these are then served as the basis for the comparison. Several algorithms performed better than the others, achieving better results for certain operations under different conditions, and, therefore, were selected and recommended for similar tasks.Article · Jan 2005 · RoboticaA.

   Books  Social Science

Social Science Books

If there's one thing you can say about us humans, it's that we always keep things interesting! From our ancient civilizations to our modern-day struggles, from our diverse languages to our common history, we've been giving social scientists ample material to think—and write—about for centuries. And what material! Within our Social Science category, you'll find countless captivating studies of who we humans are, what we do, and how we interact, written by everyone from Karl Marx to Helen Gurley Brown. So start wandering our virtual shelves and seek out what intrigues you; from Campbell's Power of Myth to Gladwell's Tipping Point, we've got something.




Control: Exposing the Truth About Guns
Not just a shot in the dark. In a world where people's feelings about public figures tend to ebb and flow with each news cycle, no one is dispassionate about conservative uber-pundit Glenn Beck. Whether through TV, books, or other media, his uncompromising stances on hot-button sociopolitical issues tend to elicit a love-him-or-hate-him response from just about everyone in America. So when the man who makes liberals foam at the mouth and gets conservatives feeling all warm and fuzzy inside takes on a topic as close to our nation's heart as gun control in this controversial Social Science tome, heads (and pages) are bound to turn. So get set for fuming or fist-pumping while reading, depending on your own ideology.

 Find your own copy of Control: Exposing the Truth About Guns
