Monday 7/10 Insider Buying Report: NYMX, CLSN


July 10, 2017, 10:31:31 AM EDT
By DividendChannel.com, BNK Invest

As the saying goes, there are many possible reasons for an insider to sell a stock, but only one reason to buy -- they expect to make money. So let's look at two noteworthy recent insider buys.      On Friday, Nymox Pharmaceutical Corp ( NYMX  )'s Director, James George Robinson, made a $46,030 buy of NYMX, purchasing 11,500 shares at a cost of $4.00 a piece. Robinson was up about 6.4% on the purchase at the high point of today's trading session, with NYMX trading as high as $4.26 in trading on Monday. Nymox Pharmaceutical Corp is trading up about 0.2% on the day Monday. Before this latest buy, Robinson bought NYMX on 9 other occasions during the past twelve months, for a total investment of $680,922 at an average of $3.72 per share.      And at Celsion Corp ( CLSN  ), there was insider buying on Friday, by Director Frederick J. Fritz who purchased 13,000 shares at a cost of $1.89 each, for a trade totaling $24,570. This purchase marks the first one filed by Fritz in the past year. Celsion Corp is trading off about 0.5% on the day Monday.        VIDEO: Monday 7/10 Insider Buying Report: NYMX,     CLSN

Commit To Purchase Nymox Pharmaceutical Corp At $3, Earn 25% Using Options






StockOptionsChannel.com




Jul 5, 2017 11:53 AM EDT













 


















































 Investors considering a purchase of Nymox Pharmaceutical Corp ( NYMX) shares, but cautious about paying the going market price of $4.11/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2019 put at the $3 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of 75 cents. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 25% return against the $3 commitment, or a 16.2% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost).     START SLIDESHOW:Top YieldBoost Puts of the S&P 500 »   Selling a put does not give an investor access to NYMX's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $3 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. ( Do options carry counterparty risk? This and six other common options myths debunked). So unless Nymox Pharmaceutical Corp sees its shares fall 23.7% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $2.25 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the 75 cents from $3), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 16.2% annualized rate of return.

About Nymox
Nymox Pharmaceutical Corporation specializes in the research and development of therapeutics and diagnostics, with a particular emphasis on products targeted for the unmet needs of the aging population. The Company’s new drug for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is in Phase 3 development. Nymox has drug technology for other indications such as E. coli infection, Alzheimer’s disease, oncology, and infectious disease. BPH is a chronic condition that is a common affliction of older men. There is an unmet medical need for an effective treatment for BPH without the side effects associated with currently approved drugs or the complications associated with surgical procedures.NX-1207 is administered by a urologist in an office setting without the need for anaesthetics or sedation or for catheterization.  Patients report little or no pain or discomfort from the procedure.  Open label follow-up studies have shown evidence of long lasting benefit from NX-1207 treatment with a significant proportion of men who received a single dose of NX-1207 reporting maintained improvement in BPH symptoms without other treatments for up to five years or more.BPH is one of the most commonly diagnosed diseases in the male U.S. population. The condition can seriously impact the health and quality of life of older men and can lead to acute urinary retention, incontinence, and other serious consequences. It is estimated that 50% of men in their 50s have pathological signs of prostatic hyperplasia and from 26 to 46% of men between the ages of 40 to 79 years suffer from moderate to severe urinary problems and symptoms associated with BPH.The Company offers NicAlert® and TobacAlert® tests for measuring tobacco product exposure.Nymox’s stock is traded on NASDAQ under the symbol NYMX. The Company has two subsidiaries, Nymox Corp. and Serex Inc., and facilities in Hasbrouck Heights, NJ and Montreal, QC.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.
