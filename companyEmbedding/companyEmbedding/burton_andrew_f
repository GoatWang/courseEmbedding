Overview



Do you want to set up an E-commerce site with WooCommerce and WordPress in multiple languages without getting migraines? Well, look no further! This book will show you the complete process step by step, with nothing but freely available open source WordPress plugins.About This Book- A step-by-step guide on how to set up a multilingual online store with WooCommerce, the most popular E-commerce solution for WordPress, and the free WordPress plugin Polylang.- With open source code that you can apply directly to your WordPress website. The code snippets are also available for download from a supporting website.- With a comprehensive index- The author is open for feedback, so you can make this book better by contributing to it!Who Is This Book For?You already know the basics of WooCommerce (and, naturally, WordPress), and now you want to create a multilingual store, so you wonder how to achieve that with free WordPress plugins. You're not looking for any dry theory or a WooCommerce general beginner's book, but a practical step-by-step guide.What Will You Learn?- Step-by-step you create an E-commerce site with WordPress and WooCommerce in multiple languages.- You create a Child WordPress theme and the theme functions.php file, so you can add all the code needed to make multilingual work.- Installing and configuring WooCommerce and create a product that's ready for translation.- Installing and working extensively with Polylang, a free WordPress that turns your WordPress site and your WooCommerce store multilingual.- Fixing issues by adding custom code to your theme's functions.php file.- How to edit WooCommerce language files directly.Author Bio:Have you ever had that feeling of being stuck in an unfulfilling professional life? The author knows this sounds awfully corny, but working with WordPress, and the great open source community surrounding it, gave his life the kick it thankfully needed.Andrew F. Burton received his initial professional training at Zurich Business School, and worked for decades in banking and finance-related industries when he wasn't backpacking around the world way back before the lame Lonely Planet days. When the web came along, he set up an Internet startup soon after the first web browser became popular. However, being an Internet pioneer in a small place like Switzerland didn't quite turn out the way he had wanted it to be, so he switched back to finance. He regrets not moving to the U.S. instead.When he discovered open source CMS and WordPress 3.0 that came out in 2010, he was instantly hooked. Always interested in getting the best out of WordPress for his clients, he now works as an independent consultant for all things Web in Switzerland, a country where being multilingual is part of an everyday life.He loves learning about web technologies, so over the years he has become quite familiar with the classic tools like HTML, CSS, PHP, jQuery, but also more recent ones like AngularJS and Ionic Framework.Last, but not least: The author feels that WordPress has one of the coolest communities, developers, designers and users, among others, that he's ever been in. He tries to take part in its local community in Switzerland whenever he has time to spare. He's also a member of the WordPress Meetup and WooCommerce Meetup in Zurich. He can be contacted via Twitter at woomultilingual.

Andrew F. Burton
              Biography
                

        Have you ever had that feeling of being stuck in an unfulfilling professional life? The author knows this sounds awfully corny, but working with WordPress, and the great open source community surrounding it, gave his life the kick it thankfully needed.

Andrew F. Burton received his initial professional training at Zurich Business School, and worked for decades in banking and finance-related industries when he wasn't backpacking around the world way back before the lame Lonely Planet days. When the web came along, he set up an Internet startup soon after the first web browser became popular. However, being an Internet pioneer in a small place like Switzerland didn't quite turn out the way he had wanted it to be, so he switched back to finance. He regrets not moving to the U.S. instead.

When he discovered open source CMS and WordPress 3.0 that came out in 2010, he was instantly hooked. Always interested in getting the best out of WordPress for his clients, he now works as an independent consultant for all things Web in Switzerland, a country where being multilingual is part of an everyday life.

He loves learning about web technologies, so over the years he has become quite familiar with the classic tools like HTML, CSS, PHP, jQuery, but also more recent ones like AngularJS and Ionic Framework.

Last, but not least: The author feels that WordPress has one of the coolest communities, developers, designers and users, among others, that he's ever been in. He tries to take part in its local community in Switzerland whenever he has time to spare. He's also a member of the WordPress Meetup and WooCommerce Meetup in Zurich. He can be contacted via Twitter @woomultilingual.

Hi, we’re Co-op Cycles

We’re bikes born from a love of adventure, cooperatively designed with REI members and built for riders who seek the fun and freedom that comes from exploring the world on two wheels.



























Mountain

When fat tires and dirt trails combine, it’s magic, plain and simple. These low-maintenance fun machines have proven technologies and upgradability that’ll let you dial in a ride all your own.




Explore mountain bikes





























All-road

Road bikes for the adventurous, who know the ride shouldn’t end just because the pavement does. These are built strong and light, providing true versatility from pavement to gravel and beyond.




Explore all-road bikes





























Adventure

Made for loaded tours in ever-changing terrain, these are the bikes from which great stories come. Each model is purpose-built, fully rackable and ready to roll wherever you want to take it.




Explore adventure bikes





























City

Ditch the car and start living, people. Commuting, errands, beer runs and nights out are all made better when done on two wheels. Being part of the solution has never been so much fun.




Explore city bikes





























Kids

When you're a kid, your bike is your freedom. Start 'em out right with sturdy and reliable bikes that will take them from training wheels to singletrack in no time.




Explore kids' bikes














BIKES WORTH RIDING

BIKES WORTH RIDING

Adventure ready

Our bikes are adventure ready and built for versatility. Our members told us that their adventures don’t always fit into exact categories, so we made it easy to accessorize and upgrade.

























Built with great parts

We consciously choose high-quality components over just the latest-and-greatest tech. Meaning, spec-for-spec, our bikes are some of the best values around, and they’ll keep you riding happy for years.

























Cooperatively designed

We start our design process by talking with our riders. They tell us what matters most to them, and we use their feedback to build nothing but great bikes worth riding.
