 Asia is home to two of the world’s largest economies by nominal GDP – China and Japan – and two of the largest growth economies, China and India. That makes it a critical player in addressing climate change, particularly given the uncertainty around US participation in the 2015 Paris Agreement. Ankur Sahu, co-head of the Goldman Sachs Merchant Banking Division in Asia Pacific, explains how these three countries – China, India and Japan – are reaffirming their commitments and investing in clean energy technologies.

Presentation

The
financial statements of the Company have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States of America and are presented in US dollars. The
Company has adopted a December 31 fiscal year end.

 

Unaudited
Interim Financial Statements

The
accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States of America for interim financial information and with
the instructions to Form 10-Q. Accordingly, the financial
statements do not include all of the information and footnotes
required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete
financial statements.

 

In the
opinion of management, all adjustments consisting of normal
recurring entries necessary for a fair statement of the periods
presented for: (a) the financial position; (b) the result of
operations; and (c) cash flows, have been made in order to make the
financial statements presented not misleading. The results of
operations for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative
of operations for a full year.

 

While
management of the Company believes that the disclosures presented
herein are adequate and not misleading, these condensed interim
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited
financial statements and the footnotes thereto for the year ended
December 31, 2015.

 

Use of
Estimates and Assumptions

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

 

Prepaid
Expenses

 

Prepaid
expenses consist of prepaid filing fees. Prepaid expenses are
amortized as the related expense is incurred.

Basic
Income (Loss) Per Share

The
Company computes loss per share in accordance with
“ASC-260”, “Earnings per Share” which
requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share
on the face of the statement of operations.

 

Basic loss
per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common
shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common
shares during the period. Diluted loss per share gives effect to
all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period.
Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if
their effect is anti-dilutive.

 

For the
nine month period ended to September 30, 2016 there were no
potentially dilutive debt or equity instruments issued or
outstanding and any such shares would have been excluded from the
computation because they would have been anti-dilutive as the
Company incurred losses in this period.

 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

The
Company reviewed all the recently issued, but not yet effective,
accounting pronouncements and we do not believe any of these
pronouncements will have a material impact on the
Company.

 

NOTE 3
– GOING CONCERN

 

The
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis
which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and
discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the
foreseeable future. The Company has incurred a loss since Inception
(October 28, 2014) resulting in an accumulated deficit of $59,883
as of September 30, 2016 and further losses are anticipated in the
development of its business. Accordingly, there is substantial
doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going
concern.

 

The
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the
Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or
obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay
its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they
come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the
next twelve months with existing cash on hand and loans from
directors and/or private placement of common stock.

 

NOTE 4
– RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

 

In support
of the Company’s efforts and cash requirements, it may rely
on advances from related parties until such time that the Company
can support its operations or attains adequate financing through
sales of its equity or traditional debt financing. There is no
formal written commitment for continued support by shareholders or
directors. Amounts represent advances or amounts paid in
satisfaction of liabilities. The advances were considered temporary
in nature and were not formalized by a promissory note.

 

During the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 a previous shareholder forgave
loans to the Company in the amount of $11,074. The transaction was
recorded to additional paid in capital.

 

During the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company was provided
loans of $37,747 by a new shareholder.

 

Loans to
shareholders at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were
$37,747 and $11,074, respectively. The advances are non-interest
bearing, due upon demand and unsecured.

 

NOTE 5
– INCOME TAXES

 

As of
September 30, 2016, the Company had net operating loss carry
forwards of approximately $59,883 that may be available to reduce
future years' taxable income in varying amounts through 2036.
Future tax benefits which arise as a result of these losses have
not been recognized in these financial statements, as their
realization is determined not likely to occur and accordingly, the
Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax
asset relating to these tax loss carry-forwards.

 


NOTE 6 -
SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

 

The
Company has evaluated subsequent events from September 30, 2016 to
the date the financial statements were issued and has determined
that there are no items to disclose.

FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS

 

This
quarterly report contains forward-looking statements. These
statements relate to future events or our future financial

statements by terminology such as “may”,
“should”, “expects”, “plans”,
“anticipates”, “believes”,
“estimates”, “predicts”,
“potential” or “continue” or the negative
of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements
are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks,
uncertainties and other factors that may cause our or our
industry's actual results, levels of activity, performance or
achievements to be materially different from any future results,
levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or
implied by these forward-looking statements. Although we believe
that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements
are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of
activity, performance or achievements. Except as required by
applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States,
we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to
conform these statements to actual results.

 

Our
unaudited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars
(US$) and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles. The following discussion should be
read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related
notes that appear elsewhere in this quarterly report. The following
discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our
plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ
materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements.
Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include,
but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this
quarterly report.

 

Unless
otherwise specified in this quarterly report, all dollar amounts
are expressed in United States dollars and all references to
“common stock” refer to shares of our common
stock.

 

As used in
this quarterly report, the terms “we”,
“us”, “our” and “our company”
mean ME Renewable Power Corporation., unless otherwise
indicated.

 

Corporate
History

 

ME
Renewable Power Corporation (the "Company") was incorporated in the
State of Nevada under the name Jarex Solutions Corp. on October 28,
2014 ("Inception") and originally intended to commence operations
in the business of Automatic Number Plate Recognition
(“ANPR’) software development for businesses which have
parking zones or access control on their sites. Jarex Solutions
Corp. intended to develop software based on the ANPR technologies
in Latvia.

 

Our
principal office address is located at Puces iela 47 dz.40, Riga,
Latvia, LV-1082.

 

On May 31,
2016, our board of directors approved an agreement and plan of
merger to merge with our wholly-owned subsidiary ME Renewable Power
Corporation, a Nevada corporation, to effect a name change from
Jarex Solutions Corp. to ME Renewable Power Corporation. Our
company will remain the surviving company. ME Renewable Power
Corporation was formed solely for the change of name.

 

Articles
of Merger to effect the merger and change of name were filed with
the Nevada Secretary of State on June 7, 2016, with an effective
date of June 14, 2016.

 

The name
change became effective with the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board at
the opening of trading on June 21, 2016. In addition to the
change of name, our trading symbol changed to MEPW. Our CUSIP
number is 552745 101.
