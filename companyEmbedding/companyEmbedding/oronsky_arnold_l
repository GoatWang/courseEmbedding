Arnie's Buzz
Arnie's video
 
 Arnie has been a full-time member of InterWest's healthcare team since 1994. He is a board member of Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation (AGTC), Centrexion, Drais Pharmaceuticals, Dynavax Technologies (DVAX), EpicentRx, Integrated Diagnostics,  KalVista Pharmaceuticals (KALV), PMV Pharma, Potenza Theraputics, Sera Prognostics, TESARO (TSRO) and Tizona Therapeutics.As a Ph.D. in immunology and senior lecturer at the Department of Medicine at Johns Hopkins Medical School, Arnie brings a deep understanding of medical research to finding and investing in successful healthcare companies.Prior to joining InterWest, Arnie was vice president for discovery research of the Lederle Laboratories division of American Cyanamid Company where he directed the research for new drugs.Arnie received a Ph.D. in immunology from Columbia University and has published more than 125 articles in scientific journals.Sample of Prior Investments AkaRx (Acquired by Eisai Pharamaceuticals in 2009), Amplimmune (Acquired by Astrazeneca in 2013), Aspreva Pharmaceuticals (IPO 2006, ASPV), Corixa (IPO 1997, CRXA), Coulter Pharmaceuticals (Acquired by Corixa in 2000), Cubist (IPO 1996, CBST), Myogen (IPO 2003), Salmedix (Acquired by Cephalon in 2005), Signal Pharmaceuticals (Acquired by Celgene in 2000) 
 I came to InterWest after leading a large research organization at Lederle Laboratories. It's one thing to understand the science and its potential, but quite a different challenge to turn that science into a profitable company that meets real market and health care needs. Through my years at InterWest, I have found that my greatest challenge and greatest achievement is to marry outstanding science to outstanding management in order to build a durable, successful company.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/21/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

                                                    The Dark Side of Good News in Biotech
                                                


                                                    MarketWatch – 
                                                    9:29 AM ET 06/21/2017
                                                


Deal making is a staple of the biotech industry, but betting on mergers and acquisitions is much harder than it looks for investors. Fresh cancer data from Clovis Oncology (CLVS) illustrate this point. The company announced Monday that its late-stage clinical trial for cancer treatment Rubraca was a success in patients with ovarian cancer.

















                                                    Clovis Oncology stock surges 50% on positive late-stage cancer trial results
                                                


                                                    MarketWatch – 
                                                    8:51 AM ET 06/19/2017
                                                


Clovis Oncology Inc. (CLVS) shares surged 50% in premarket trade Monday after the company said its late-stage trial for a cancer drug met its primary endpoint and a key secondary endpoint. Clovis said it plans to try for Food and Drug Administration approval for the drug, rucaparib, within the next four months for second line and later maintenance treatment for women with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer who have responded to their most recent platinum therapy.

















                                                    Clovis's ovarian cancer drug set for label expansion, shares soar
                                                


                                                    Reuters – 
                                                    5:46 AM ET 06/19/2017
                                                


* Co to apply for U.S. label expansion within 4 mths. * Shares surge more than 50 pct. * Rival Tesaro's shares slip 3 pct. By Natalie Grover. Clovis Oncology Inc (CLVS) said on Monday late-stage data on its already-approved ovarian cancer drug showed that the treatment could benefit four times as many patients, sending shares of the U.S. biotech soaring 50 percent.

















                                                    Clovis Oncology's cancer drug Rubraca succeeds in key study
                                                


                                                    Reuters – 
                                                    3:56 AM ET 06/19/2017
                                                


Clovis Oncology Inc (CLVS) said its ovarian cancer drug Rubraca slowed disease progression in a late-stage trial involving patients with various gene mutations who had undergone initial therapy.

















                                                    New test may turn AZ's Lynparza into precision drug for prostate cancer
                                                


                                                    Reuters – 
                                                    7:01 PM ET 06/18/2017
                                                


Scientists have developed a new three-in-one blood test that has the potential to turn AstraZeneca's (AZN) drug Lynparza into a precision medicine for prostate cancer. Lynparza, which is already approved for ovarian and recently produced good results in breast cancer, is currently in clinical development against prostate tumours.

The company said that the development meant nothing and was purely procedural. Tesaro Inc. (TSRO) shares plummeted abruptly and briefly Friday morning, dropping as much as 10.5% at the intraday low on Friday. The decline, which lasted about an hour, was prompted by recruitment for a clinical trial getting suspended.

Arnold L. Oronsky, Ph.D., Joins Sera’s Board of Directors
SALT LAKE CITY, February 24, 2015–Sera Prognostics, Inc., a women’s healthcare company, today announced that Arnold L. Oronsky, Ph.D., General Partner at InterWest Partners, LLC, was appointed to its Board of Directors.  Dr. Oronsky’s addition to the Sera board occurs as the company is in the final stages of developing PreTRM™, its novel proteomic predictor for preterm birth risk, prior to its commercial launch.
“Dr. Oronsky is accomplished as a business leader and investor in innovative medical technologies.  We are very pleased that he has joined Sera’s Board,” said Gregory C. Critchfield, M.D., M.S., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Sera Prognostics.   “Arnie’s broad experience has particular relevance for Sera at this time, as we complete the development of our PreTRM™ test. His acknowledged success as a strategic thinker further adds to the depth of our board as we transition Sera from research and development into a revenue stage company.”
As General Partner leading healthcare investments at InterWest Partners, Dr. Oronsky has significant experience investing in diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies.  He has served on numerous boards of successful healthcare companies that address significant unmet medical needs through innovative technologies.  Prior to joining InterWest Partners in 1994, Dr. Oronsky led pharmaceutical research as vice president for discovery research of the Lederle Laboratories division of American Cyanamid Company.  He earned a Ph.D. in immunology from Columbia University and is currently a senior lecturer at the Department of Medicine at Johns Hopkins Medical School.
“Sera’s strategy employs cutting-edge diagnostic science to address some of the biggest problems in maternal fetal medicine worldwide,” commented Dr. Oronsky.  “I am pleased to work with Sera’s exceptional team to realize the promise of its technology and transform the company into a commercial business that creates lasting value and makes an important difference in the lives of patients and families globally.”
Sera today also announced that Douglas Fisher, M.D., has recently resigned his position as a director on Sera’s Board to join the company’s management team as Chief Business Officer.
“I thank Doug Fisher for his conscientious service on our Board and now look forward to working closely with him as our Chief Business Officer as we further develop and execute the company’s strategy to become a global leader in maternal fetal medicine,” said Critchfield.
Dr. Fisher has been a partner at InterWest Partners, serving on Sera’s Board of Directors since November 2011.  He received his M.D. and M.B.A. from the School of Medicine and the Wharton School, respectively, at the University of Pennsylvania.  Dr. Fisher has focused on biopharmaceutical, diagnostic and medical device investments throughout his career, working in venture capital, consulting and pharmaceutical industries.
“It has been a privilege to be involved with the Company since its Series A funding in 2011 and to serve on Sera’s Board,” said Dr. Fisher.  “I have tremendous confidence in the approach that our team is diligently pursuing to develop its first-to-market proteomic PreTRM™ test that has high potential to significantly impact pregnancy care.  I look forward to contributing further to Sera’s success as its business and strategy development executive.”

World's best overall value for natural products!


                        Since 1996, iHerb has made great efforts to enhance your online shopping experience.  Initially, our
                        company promoted the benefits of St. John's Wort; hence the name: iHerb.  We carry one of the
                        largest selections of high-quality natural products at the best overall value.  Consider iHerb your own
                        California-based natural products store!
                    










Top 10 reasons to make iHerb your number one choice!




1. Shop directly and save!

            iHerb.com is one of the world's largest online stores for natural products.
            We have been in business since 1996 and have two distribution centers, based
            in California and Kentucky.
        

            Browse our site and you'll find over 1,200 brands and 35,000 brand name products that you may also find at health food stores and natural
            pharmacies -- with one important difference: Our prices are typically 30 - 40% less. Also, don't forget to check our  Specials page for
            additional discounts on some best-selling products.
        


2. Free or discounted shipping

            Every iHerb order is eligible to receive discounted or free shipping! In general, the more products you add to your cart, the greater the likelihood that you will receive free shipping. In some cases you’ll even find that ordering one product alone may result in free shipping. We encourage you to experiment with different product combinations in order to find the best value, and share your cart with others! iHerb is the world's leader in bringing the best overall value in natural products to its customers.
        


3. Honest customer product reviews

            Unlike retailers that display third-party reviews, all of our reviews are written by iHerb customers. In order to write a review, you must
            have ordered the product from iHerb first. This means you receive honest and candid reviews, thereby helping you make a smarter buying decision.
        


4. Assurance of freshness with expiration dates

            Because we have one of the highest product turnover rates in the industry, iHerb is able to offer you the FRESHEST products possible!
            Our inventory turnover rate averages to 8.1 times per year; among the highest turnover rates, if not the highest, in our industry. This means that iHerb products are on the shelf an average of only 45 days!
        

            Plus, most products we carry have expiration or best-by dates, which can be accessed on the product page. It's like holding the real bottle or package in your hand, as you would in a typical "brick and mortar" store.
        


5. Air-conditioned, super clean warehouses

            iHerb’s distribution centers  are entirely climate-controlled, which protects the products from such conditions as humidity, heat and cold. This level of quality control is employed by iHerb to ensure product effectiveness for the customer.
            In addition, our distribution centers are industry certified by NSF International, earning Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) certification.
        


6. Solid personal privacy commitment

            Personal privacy is critically important to us. Since 1996, iHerb has never sold, leased or shared any customer information with third parties. Your personal information remains entirely confidential.
        


7. Enhanced 256-bit encryption with tokenization

            Simply put, we only store the last 4 digits and the expiration date of your credit card, so you can identify what card you are using.
        


8. 24 hour/7 day customer service

            One of the ways iHerb can offer such low prices is by automating the whole ordering process. While our customer service agents don't
            actually take orders, they do offer live  customer support from our California facility, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. (Pacific Time), Monday - Friday.
            We are also reachable 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, by chat and email to answer questions and resolve issues with your order. Of course,
            nobody's perfect. We may get quite busy at times and we ask for a little patience. We'll do our best to take care of things promptly, efficiently
            and courteously -- this is what our customers deserve!
        


9. Save even more by helping others save!

            As an iHerb customer, share your favorite iHerb products or categories, or even a shopping cart containing multiple products with others via simple Rewards links, and you will save even more!



10. A greener way to shop

            When you shop with us, you're part of a global solution. iHerb uses 100% post-consumer recycled paper for 90% of all shipping boxes. Our bubble wrap is 40% recyclable, and we recycle virtually all packing materials received 
            from manufacturers. All in the interest of a healthier, more sustainable planet!  Read more.
