Nordson Corporation Board of Directors Elects Stephen P. Lovass as Corporate Vice President for Industrial Coating Systems
28 Nov 2016
 

Corporate Vice President Douglas C. Bloomfield to retire after nearly 30 years of service 

 
Westlake, Ohio, USA – November 28, 2016 – The Nordson Corporation (Nasdaq: NDSN) Board of Directors has elected Stephen P. Lovass as Corporate Vice President for its Industrial Coating Systems (ICS) business segment, replacing Douglas C. Bloomfield who will retire at the end of 2016 after nearly 30 years of service.
 
Mr. Lovass, 47, most recently served as president for one of the global sensors and controls businesses at Danaher Corporation (NYSE: DHR), a $21 billion Fortune 200 diversified science and technology company. Prior to Danaher, Mr. Lovass spent ten years with Gerber Scientific Inc. moving from product management and marketing roles to run three of the company’s four businesses, ultimately becoming a senior vice president and corporate officer. His experience also includes roles at FMC Corporation and Arthur Andersen.  He holds an MBA degree from the University of Michigan, a Bachelor of Commerce degree from the University of Melbourne (Australia), and the Australian equivalent of the Certified Public Accountant designation. 
 
“Stephen brings 25 years of diversified global business experience to the ICS role, including P&L responsibility for engineered solutions and capital equipment companies, strategy development and implementation, mergers and acquisitions, and process improvement,” said Michael F. Hilton, Nordson President and Chief Executive Officer.  “His experience spans several end markets that are very relevant to Nordson, including industrial, medical, food, process, HVAC and electronics.  We are delighted to add somebody of his caliber to what is already a strong management team.”    
 
Mr. Bloomfield, 57, was named Corporate Vice President of ICS in 2005 after progressing through several roles of increasing responsibility.  Under his leadership between 2005 and 2016, ICS sales and operating margin improved significantly. Mr. Bloomfield was also responsible for introducing dozens of successful new products, driving significant expansion in emerging markets, and serving as a champion for lean and other continuous improvement initiatives.  In addition to his business acumen, Mr. Bloomfield served as a Board member of the Nordson Corporation Foundation and played a leading role in supporting numerous charitable activities throughout Northeast Ohio.  
 
“Doug led the ICS business through a period of excellent growth and improved profitability, and he leaves Stephen with a strong, capable team and a healthy business that is well-positioned for ongoing success,” said Hilton. “I wish him a fulfilling retirement and thank him for his many years of service and his assistance transitioning ICS to new leadership.”
 
Nordson Corporation engineers, manufactures and markets differentiated products and systems used to dispense, apply and control adhesives, coatings, polymers, sealants, biomaterials, and other fluids, to test and inspect for quality, and to treat and cure surfaces.  These products are supported by application expertise and direct global sales and service.  Nordson serves a wide variety of consumer non-durable, durable and technology end markets including packaging, nonwovens, electronics, medical, appliances, energy, transportation, construction, and general product assembly and finishing.  Founded in 1954 and headquartered in Westlake, Ohio, the company has operations and support offices in nearly 40 countries.  Visit Nordson on the web at www.nordson.com, www.twitter.com/Nordson_Corp or www.facebook.com/nordson.

Nordson Corporation Board of Directors Elects Stephen P. Lovass as 
      Corporate Vice President for Industrial Coating Systems





Corporate Vice President Douglas C. Bloomfield to retire after 
        nearly 30 years of service







November 28, 2016 09:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



WESTLAKE, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Nordson 
      Corporation (Nasdaq:NDSN) Board of Directors has elected Stephen P. 
      Lovass as Corporate Vice President for its Industrial Coating Systems 
      (ICS) business segment, replacing Douglas C. Bloomfield who will retire 
      at the end of 2016 after nearly 30 years of service.
    


      Mr. Lovass, 47, most recently served as president for one of the global 
      sensors and controls businesses at Danaher 
      Corporation (NYSE:DHR), a $21 billion Fortune 200 diversified 
      science and technology company. Prior to Danaher, Mr. Lovass spent ten 
      years with Gerber Scientific Inc. moving from product management and 
      marketing roles to run three of the company’s four businesses, 
      ultimately becoming a senior vice president and corporate officer. His 
      experience also includes roles at FMC Corporation and Arthur Andersen. 
      He holds an MBA degree from the University of Michigan, a Bachelor of 
      Commerce degree from the University of Melbourne (Australia), and the 
      Australian equivalent of the Certified Public Accountant designation.
    

      “Stephen brings 25 years of diversified global business experience to 
      the ICS role, including P&L responsibility for engineered solutions and 
      capital equipment companies, strategy development and implementation, 
      mergers and acquisitions, and process improvement,” said Michael F. 
      Hilton, Nordson President and Chief Executive Officer. “His experience 
      spans several end markets that are very relevant to Nordson, including 
      industrial, medical, food, process, HVAC and electronics. We are 
      delighted to add somebody of his caliber to what is already a strong 
      management team.”
    

      Mr. Bloomfield, 57, was named Corporate Vice President of ICS in 2005 
      after progressing through several roles of increasing responsibility. 
      Under his leadership between 2005 and 2016, ICS sales and operating 
      margin improved significantly. Mr. Bloomfield was also responsible for 
      introducing dozens of successful new products, driving significant 
      expansion in emerging markets, and serving as a champion for lean and 
      other continuous improvement initiatives. In addition to his business 
      acumen, Mr. Bloomfield served as a Board member of the Nordson 
      Corporation Foundation and played a leading role in supporting numerous 
      charitable activities throughout Northeast Ohio.
    

      “Doug led the ICS business through a period of excellent growth and 
      improved profitability, and he leaves Stephen with a strong, capable 
      team and a healthy business that is well-positioned for ongoing 
      success,” said Hilton. “I wish him a fulfilling retirement and thank him 
      for his many years of service and his assistance transitioning ICS to 
      new leadership.”
    

      Nordson Corporation engineers, manufactures and markets differentiated 
      products and systems used to dispense, apply and control adhesives, 
      coatings, 
      polymers, 
      sealants, 
      biomaterials, 
      and other fluids, 
      to 
      test and inspect for quality, and to treat 
      and cure surfaces. These products are supported by application 
      expertise and direct global sales and service. Nordson serves a wide 
      variety of consumer non-durable, durable and technology end markets 
      including packaging, nonwovens, electronics, medical, appliances, 
      energy, transportation, construction, and general product assembly and 
      finishing. Founded in 1954 and headquartered in Westlake, Ohio, the 
      company has operations and support offices in nearly 40 countries. Visit
