GodStories provides an overview of the entire Bible from creation to redemption in sixty short narratives that explore the beautiful, triumphant, often heartbreaking, and always glorious stories that make up the gospel of God GodStories.Just as we have one God in three persons, and one church made up of many people, so in Scripture we have one gospel made up of many stories. Inside readers will rediscover the glorious mission of God, freedom from sin, and how the promises of God never fail.Andrew Wilson brings these GodStories to life with fresh and relevant insights on how the stories of Scripture profoundly affect your faith and theology. Prepare to be stunned at the many-faceted gospel story, the greatest story ever told.

Product Details
Previews


A Thousand-Mile Pilgrimage with Martin Luther In 2010, Andrew Wilson and his wife, Sarah, walked in the footsteps of Martin Luther, re-creating his famous pre-Reformation pilgrimage from Erfurt to Rome. Their trek was well publicized, with coverage in the "Christian Century," "First Things," the "Wall Street Journal," and "Books & Culture." As they walked their journey of a thousand miles over seventy days, thousands of readers followed along on the Wilsons' blog. This engaging narrative brings readers along as Andrew and Sarah traverse Europe, visiting highlights such as Coburg Castle, Ulm's MUnster, the Alps, Milan, Florence, and Rome. Their journey provides a unique window into the history of the Protestant Reformation and a creative entryway into the life of Luther. The book also reflects on the contemporary ecumenical significance of the events of the Reformation, exploring what the changes of the past 500 years mean for the Christian present and future. Beautifully written and enjoyable to read, "Here I Walk" offers a unique combination of firsthand travel narrative, fascinating explorations in history, and theological and spiritual reflection. Pictures, maps, and an afterword by Sarah Hinlicky Wilson are included.

About us
Wilson Agri was the first importer of cow mattresses into Europe in 1994. By the late 1998 the company were viewing the first time lapse video comparisons of low and high neck bar cubicles in the USA with open fronts so no bars which restricted natural lunging.  The company became increasingly interested as to how far they could take the vision of making an indoor environment for cows which could replicate natural pasture and the outdoors.
‘It’s all about the cow!’ exclaimed Andrew Wilson it doesn’t matter if new product looks better and more developed if it doesn’t improve conditions for her we are wasting our time in product development and in the advice that we give to our customers when they renovate their existing dairy or building a new one.
 
Today Wilson Agri specialises in the happiness of cows, through not only cow comfort in the cubicle, but in the design of the building using correct dimensions where we measure cows to ensure that the building is built to suit your herd and your goals.  We supply everything for the internals of the building, from cow mattresses, cubicles, passageway rubber, tip-over water drinkers, lights & ventilation curtain.  All of these to ensure that the cow has a clean dry comfortable bed, with clean fresh water and air, with reduced pressure on the hooves when turning at the feed barrier.

Publisher's Description▼▲
In fifty-six short narratives, GodStories explores the beautiful, triumphant, often heartbreaking and always glorious stories that make up the gospel of GodGodStories.  Just as we have one God in three persons, and one church made up of many people, so in Scripture we have one gospel made up of many stories.  Inside readers will rediscover the glorious mission of God, freedom from sin, and how the promises of God never fail. Andrew Wilson brings these GodStories to life with fresh and relevant insights on how the stories of Scripture profoundly affect your faith and theology. Prepare to be stunned and in total amazement at the many-faceted gospel story, the greatest story ever told. 


Author Bio▼▲
Andrew Wilson holds degrees in theology from Cambridge University and London School of Theology. His passion is to communicate the extraordinary truths of God. Andrew teaches internationally and is a deacon at Kings Church Eastbourne in the United Kingdom, where he leads training and development. He is also the author of Deluded by Dawkins.


Publisher's Description▼▲
Just as we have one God in three persons, and one church made up of many people, so in Scripture we have one gospel made up of many stories. In fifty-six short narratives, Andrew Wilson examines these beautiful, triumphant, often heartbreaking, and always magnificent stories that make up the gospel of God--GodStories. Inside readers will rediscover the glorious mission of God, freedom from sin, and how the promises of God never fail. 

Written in a devotional-style perfect for morning or evening reading, GodStories includes reflection sections that will give additional food for thought in the form of questions, scriptures and psalms, hymns, quotes from important church figures, prayers, etc. With winsome language and a solid biblical foundation, Wilson also introduces and walks through, in layman's terms, some heavier points of theology, such as atonement, justification by faith, penal substitution, open theism, and the new covenant.

            This book was not what I expected. I expected to have the gospel told in short stories. It is not that type of book, rather it is a book of short chapters that take a passage and apply it to our lives making us look at our stories in different ways and especially in ways that God looks at them. It was really neat once I got into it and I found the last two-thirds much better than the first third. Every three or four chapters there was a break which encouraged the reader to stop and study something more carefully or to pause and pray or to review a passage written by a scholar and see how it pertained to the reader's spiritual life. It was refreshing to look at many spiritual thoughts in a different manner holding them up for new appraisals renewing my perspective on parts of the gospel that I had assumed meant one thing only to see another nugget deep inside. This is an excellent book to use as a short thought provoking read when one wants to think on spiritual matters but not get involved in a long drawn out dissertation.

            Andrew Wilson has broken the gospel down into bite size, you could say.  Nuggets of truth, written in small stories, he calls God Stories.  God Stories is a book full of such nuggets. Written in a style similar to the Bible, you begin with Old Testament God Stories and on into the New Testament.  Andrew, however breaks his book up into Acts One through Five rather than into Old and New Testament sections.  He does a wonderful job of clarifying Bible stories, that might have been confusing to some in King James English.  A wonderful book, full of God's truth!  Definitely a great read!  Sections end with a coffee break, and who can pass up a coffee break?  The coffee breaks, give us time for reflection over what we have read and also information to meditate and pray over.  Some God Stories titles,  The Image of God, The Blueprint, The City and the Tower,  The Battle for Beauty, The Wedding, and many many more.  This book is not a Bible, and cannot replace a Bible, but it is a book that can help people who struggle to understand the Bible.  Definitely a book to recommend to others.

            Finally! The kind of devotional book I've always wanted to see. Andrew Wilson has a fresh perspective on many passages and verses of scripture. He starts off with one of them and then he expounds upon it in such a way as to entertain the reader and get you to think all at the same time. Some of the chapters have endnotes that allow you to go a little deeper. And then about every 3 chapters there are "coffee breaks" that are different short things like "stop and study" or "pause and pray" that break the flow nicely and give you a chance to ponder and reflect. Andrew's outlook on life, the Bible and God are thoughtful, insightful and a joy to delve into. This book is perfect on my bedside table next to my alarm clock where I can pick it up and read a chapter or two anytime I need a break, or where I can read the book start to finish. I've waited a long time for someone to write a devotional that doesn't feel like a devotional!

            Andrew Wilsons God Stories  Explorations of the Gospel of God is a wonderfully thought-provoking non-fiction book.  The powerful content is broken into short chapter reads that really have a significant impact.  The table of contents is put together with terrific descriptions so it is easy to go back and find a specific story to re-read.  The coffee breaks located throughout the book are cool moments to reflect, pray, study and worship God.  The only thing I would have liked to see would be some visuals:  maps, drawings, photos.  This is a terrific book!

Product DescriptionA Thousand-Mile Pilgrimage with Martin Luther.In 2010, Andrew Wilson and his wife, Sarah, walked in the footsteps of Martin Luther, re-creating his famous pre-Reformation pilgrimage from Erfurt to Rome. Their trek was well publicized, with coverage in the Christian Century, First Things, the Wall Street Journal, and Books & Culture. As they walked their journey of a thousand miles over seventy days, thousands of readers followed along on the Wilsons' blog. This engaging narrative brings readers along as Andrew and Sarah traverse Europe, visiting highlights such as Coburg Castle, Ulm's MUnster, the Alps, Milan, Florence, and Rome. Their journey provides a unique window into the history of the Protestant Reformation and a creative entryway into the life of Luther. The book also reflects on the contemporary ecumenical significance of the events of the Reformation, exploring what the changes of the past 500 years mean for the Christian present and future. Beautifully written and enjoyable to read, Here I Walk offers a unique combination of firsthand travel narrative, fascinating explorations in history, and theological and spiritual reflection. Pictures, maps, and an afterword by Sarah Hinlicky Wilson are included.More Product InformationPublisher: Brazos Press
