			James L. Whims has been a director of our company since October of 2007. Mr. Whims has been a partner at Alsop-Louie Partners, a venture capital firm focused on identifying promising entrepreneurs, since February 2010. From 1996 to 2007, Mr. Whims was a Managing Director of Techfund Capital l, LP and Techfund Capital II, LP and since 2001, a Managing Director and Venture Partner at Techfund Capital Europe, which are venture capital firms concentrating on high-technology enterprises. Mr. Whims also serves on the Board of Directors of numerous private companies, including DigiLens, Phizzle, Twitch TV, and Keyssa. Mr. Whims was formerly a member of the Board of Directors of THQ, Inc., a formerly NASDAQ Global Select Market-listed independent developer and publisher of interactive entertainment software. Mr. Whims was Executive Vice President of Sony Computer Entertainment of America from 1994 to 1996, where he was responsible for the North American launch of the Playstation and was the winner of the Brandweek/Ad Week marketing executive of the year. From 1990 to 1994, Mr. Whims was Executive Vice President of Software Toolworks. Mr. Whims co-founded Worlds of Wonder, an American toy company that launched Teddy Ruxpin, Lazer Tag and the United States launch of Nintendo, where he was an executive from 1985 to 1988. Mr. Whims holds a Bachelor of Science degree from Northwestern University and a Master's degree in Business Administration from the University of Arizona. We believe Mr. Whims' senior executive positions with major companies, his experience as an investor in high-technology companies, his service as a director of multiple companies, and his expertise in e-communications and marketing provide the requisite qualifications, skills, perspectives, and experiences that make him well qualified to serve on our Board of Directors.
