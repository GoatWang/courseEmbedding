UVC Sterilization Box Electronics Devices



Publication number:  20160158395
                                            

Abstract:  A sterilization method and apparatus for cleaning multiple devices of different sizes on all surfaces at one time. This apparatus allows for the cleaning of electronic devices which are corded and cordless/wireless without allowing ozone which is generated from the UV lights to escape from the product or allowing humans eyes to be effected by direct exposure to the UV light generated by the apparatus. This apparatus enables devices to be charged while they are being sterilized.
                        

Type: 
                                                    Application
                                            

Filed: 
                        March 18, 2014
                    

Publication date: 
                                                        June 9, 2016
                        

Inventors: 
                                                                
                                Kenneth Gregory Sweeney, Louis Sylvester Hughes
                            





EMI containment apparatus



Patent number:  6624432
                                            

Abstract:  An EMI and RFI shield mounting system includes a compartmented EMI shield constructed of a vacuum metallized thermoform having upright hollow walls separating and surrounding the compartments. The shield conforms to the interior of a housing for electronic equipment, with the upright walls overlying ridges formed in the interior of the housing. A compressible gasket is placed between the ridges of the housing and the inner reaches of the hollow walls of the shield. The free sides of the walls of the shield may be abutted against ground traces on a printed circuit board on which the shield and housing are placed. The gasket urges the metallized free edges of the walls of the shield against the ground trace of the printed circuit board to provide electrical conductivity between the printed circuit board and the shield. Dimples, tabs or protruding punctures may be formed in the free sides of the walls to ensure conductive contact with the ground trace.
                        

Type: 
                                                    Grant
                                            

Filed: 
                        October 6, 2000
                    

Date of Patent: 
                                                        September 23, 2003
                        

Assignee:
