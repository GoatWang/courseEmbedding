                        pp 153–161Optimism, hardiness, and explanatory style as predictors of general well-being among attorneysAuthorsAuthors and affiliationsMary E. SweetmanDavid C. MunzRobert J. WheelerArticleAccepted: 07 October 1992AbstractThree personality constructs, optimism, hardiness, and explanatory style have been identified as dispositions that bolster health (Roben and Salovey, 1989). This research focused on individual differences in optimism, hardiness, and explanatory style among professional adults and their relative contribution to general well-being. A survey was mailed to attorneys, who were members of the County Bar Association, in a large midwestern city. The results showed only optimism and the positive internal facet of explanatory style to be significantly related to general well-being. Canonical analysis indicated that this relationship was mainly due to the components of general well-being that are traditionally psychological in nature. The experiential and physical components were significantly related but of less importance.PreviewUnable to display preview. Download preview PDF.Unable to display preview. Download preview PDF.BibliographyAbramson, L.
