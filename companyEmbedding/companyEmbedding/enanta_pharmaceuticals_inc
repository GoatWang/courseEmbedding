Enanta’s research and development is currently focused on the following disease targets:  Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH)/PBC and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV).
Enanta has discovered novel protease inhibitors that are members of the direct-acting-antiviral (DAA) inhibitor classes designed for use against the hepatitis C virus (HCV).  These protease inhibitors, developed through Enanta’s collaboration with AbbVie, include paritaprevir, which is contained in AbbVie’s marketed DAA regimens for HCV, and glecaprevir, Enanta’s second protease inhibitor product, which AbbVie is developing as part of an investigational, pan-genotypic, once-daily, ribavirin-free, fixed-dose combination with pibrentasvir, AbbVie’s second NS5A inhibitor.
Enanta has discovered EDP-305, an FXR agonist product candidate for NASH and PBC, currently in Phase 1 clinical development, and has identified a clinical candidate for RSV, EDP-938, now, in preclinical development.  Enanta is also developing early lead candidates for HBV.

Enanta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced new data on EDP-938, Enanta’s lead compound being developed for the treatment of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). This new data was presented by Kai Lin, Ph.D., Director of Virology, Enanta Pharmaceuticals, Inc., in an oral presentation titled “EDP-938, a Novel Non-Fusion Replication Inhibitor of Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Demonstrates Potent Antiviral Activities both In Vitro and In Vivo,” at the XIX International Symposium on Respiratory Viral Infections, Berlin, Germany. In vitro data demonstrated that EDP-938 is a potent inhibitor of both RSV-A and RSV-B activity, maintaining antiviral activity post-infection while presenting a high barrier to resistance. Further, EDP-938 maintained antiviral potency across all clinical isolates tested as well as virus that was resistant to fusion inhibitors. The compound inhibited RSV at a post-entry, replication step and maintained its activity in vitro when given 24 hours post infection. In addition, combination studies of EDP-938 with other types of RSV inhibitors, e.g. fusion inhibitors, showed synergistic antiviral effects. New in vivo data consistent with potent inhibition of the RSV virus were also presented. EDP-938 demonstrated a greater than 4-log reduction in viral load in an animal model challenged with RSV virus.


Enanta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Announces that AbbVie Receives CHMP Positive Opinion for MAVIRET (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir) for the Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis C in All Major Genotypes (GT1-6)
Jun 23 17
Enanta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced that the European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has granted AbbVie a positive opinion recommending marketing authorization of MAVIRET™ (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir), an investigational, pan-genotypic treatment for adults with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. If approved, MAVIRET will be a once-daily, ribavirin-free, 8-week treatment option for HCV patients across all genotypes (GT1-6) without cirrhosis and new to treatment, who comprise the majority of people living with HCV. The European Commission will now review the CHMP opinion and a final decision is expected in the next quarter. Glecaprevir is Enanta’s second protease inhibitor being developed through its collaboration with AbbVie and is one of the two new direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) combined in MAVIRET. The CHMP positive opinion is supported by 97.5% (n=807/828) SVR12 rates with 8 weeks of MAVIRET across GT1-6 chronic HCV-infected patients without cirrhosis and new to treatment, with varied patient and viral characteristics. In an integrated analysis (n=2,265), less than 0.4% of patients discontinued treatment. The reported adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 10%) were headache and fatigue. The type and severity of adverse reactions in patients with cirrhosis were comparable overall to those seen in patients without cirrhosis.

					Full Description



Enanta Pharmaceuticals, Inc., incorporated on July 25, 1995, is a research and development-focused biotechnology company. The Company uses chemistry-driven approach and drug discovery solutions to create small molecule drugs for the treatment of viral infections and liver diseases. Its research and development programs are focused on three disease targets: non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)/ primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV). It has discovered novel protease inhibitors that are members of the direct-acting-antiviral (DAA) inhibitor classes designed for use against the hepatitis C virus (HCV). These protease inhibitors, developed through its collaboration with AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie), include paritaprevir and glecaprevir (ABT-493). Its product candidates also include EDP-305 and EDP-938. Paritaprevir The Company's Paritaprevir product is an NS3/4A protease inhibitor. The Company's product, Paritaprevir, is a DAA in VIEKIRA PAK and the other treatment regimens. ABT-493 The Company is developing its second protease inhibitor, glecaprevir (ABT-493). AbbVie has co-formulated ABT-493 with its second NS5A inhibitor, pibrentasvir (ABT-530), and is developing them as its next combination, which is referred to as G/P, for HCV treatment. G/P would be a pan-genotypic, once daily, all oral, fixed-dose combination treatment for HCV. ABT-493 has completed various Phase III registrational studies in combination with ABT-530. EDP-305 The Company's EDP-305 is a farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist product candidate for NASH and PBC. EDP-305 is in Phase I clinical development. EDP-938 The Company's EDP-938 is a clinical candidate for RSV. EDP-938 is in preclinical development. The Company competes with Gilead, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck, Johnson & Johnson, Co-Crystal Pharma, Microbio Co., Regulus, Roche, Taigen, Trek, Alberio, Arisaph, Astra-Zeneca, BMS, Cempra, Conatus, Galectin, Galmed, GlaxoSmithKline, Immuron, Medicinova, Novartis, NGM, Novo Nordisk, Octeta, Shire, Tobira/Allergan, Boehringer Ingelheim, Can-Fite Biopharma, Cymabay, Durect, Genkyotex, Ionis, Islet, Viking, Ablynx, Ark Biosciences, Medivir, Pulmocide, ReViral, Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Maxwell, Janssen, Replicor, Spring Bank, Alnylam, Arbutus, Assembly, Enyo and Benitec.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We cannot take progress for granted

















We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.

FlashRatings - All research for my stocks!

The most comprehensive equity research coverage available online.


          Never miss a single piece of research, upgrade, downgrade or target price change by any analyst firm on any stock!

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
