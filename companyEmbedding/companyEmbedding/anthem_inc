Voluntary Coverage
Sometimes one-size-fits-all employee benefit programs don’t quite fit what anybody really wants. Voluntary products let each employee choose coverages and benefit amounts to meet their own needs.  
The coverage is employer-sponsored, expanding the range of benefits the employer offers. Employees make their own benefit choices then pay for whatever coverage they select. The employer collects the premiums through payroll deduction, making the employee’s premium payments easy and automatic.  
  
This section includes:
  
 Voluntary Group Term Life Insurance (VGTL) 
 Voluntary Disability Insurance (VSTD and VLTD) 
 Voluntary Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance (VADD) 
  
Voluntary group term life insurance 
Anthem Life’s voluntary group term life (VGTL) plans offer generous amounts of insurance at affordable rates. Employees can select group term life coverage for themselves, and may also include coverage for their spouse and children. Employee coverage includes waiver of premium and living benefit features.   
The employer chooses whether to include accidental death benefits in the VGTL plan offering. If included, each employee is covered for an accidental death benefit equal to his or her voluntary group term life insurance benefit amount.   
Our VGTL coverage keeps working for employees even if they move on. Coverage is portable, so employees who leave the company can take it with them. We will bill them at home or automatically deduct each premium from their checking account. It’s an easy and affordable way to buy some peace of mind.

Voluntary disability insurance 
As medical costs rise, the need to focus fringe benefit dollars on providing good health insurance coverage has made it increasingly difficult for employers to include disability coverage in their benefit packages. Offering voluntary disability insurance products is an excellent way to keep a company’s benefit package comprehensive, so employees can have protection for both their health and their earnings.  
Anthem Life offers voluntary short term disability (VSTD) and voluntary long term disability (VLTD) plans. Today, those products are available in our Western marketing region. During 2003 we will introduce voluntary disability coverage throughout our marketing regions.  
  
Back to top  
  
Voluntary accidental death and dismemberment insurance 
Voluntary accidental death and dismemberment (VADD) coverage is one of the best bargains around. Employees can buy large amounts of protection for themselves and their family, for a very reasonable price, without having to answer health questions to determine their insurability. Currently, Anthem Life’s VADD product is offered only in our Western marketing region.

History[edit]
Anthem Insurance Company[edit]
Anthem Insurance Company grew out of two Indianapolis, Indiana based mutual insurance companies, Mutual Hospital Insurance Inc. and Mutual Medical Insurance Inc. formed in 1944 and 1946.[5] The companies grew significantly, controlling 80% of the medical insurance market in Indiana by the 1970s. In 1972 they came together to create a joint operating agreement,[6] and merged in 1985 as parent company, Associated Insurance Companies, Inc, to form Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Indiana.[6][7][8]
In 1986 Associated Insurance Companies changed its name to The Associated Group (TAG) to reflect its expanded focus,[7] and began heavily expanding outside Indiana, acquiring numerous insurance companies and creating new subsidiaries throughout the late 1980s through the mid-1990s.
Formerly Anthem Inc. was an insurance company which began in the 1980s as a spin-off of the group insurance operations of American General Insurance.
Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield was created as part of the merger of The Associated Group with Community Mutual Insurance Co. of Cincinnati.[9]
From its move to a publicly traded company in 2001 until its final merger in 2004, it merged the Blue Cross Blue Shield organizations of several states to achieve economy of scale, converting them in the process from non-profit to for-profit status. In late 2004, Anthem and WellPoint merged, with the combined company taking the WellPoint name. That Anthem no longer exists as a company, but the Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield brand name is used by WellPoint in 11 states.
In October 2001, Anthem demutualized and conducted an initial public offering of common stock. WellPoint, Inc. (formerly Anthem, Inc.) was formed when WellPoint Health Networks Inc. and Anthem, Inc. merged in 2004 to become the nation's leading health benefits company.
WellPoint Health Network Inc.'s predecessor was Blue Cross of California, which was founded in 1982 with the consolidation of Blue Cross of Northern California (established in 1936) and Blue Cross of Southern California (established in 1937). WellPoint was formed in 1992 to operate Blue Cross of California's managed care business. In 1993, Blue Cross of California spun off its managed care business into a separate publicly traded entity, WellPoint Health Networks Inc. In 1996, Blue Cross of California completed the conversion of all its business to for-profit status, resulting in a restructuring that designated WellPoint Health Networks Inc. as the parent organization. Anthem and WellPoint achieved a portion of this growth through mergers and acquisitions.
Wellpoint, Inc. was formed in November 2004 following a merger of Anthem and WellPoint Health Networks Inc.[5] The merger was structured as Anthem acquiring WellPoint Health Networks and rebranding itself WellPoint, Inc. When the deal was originally announced in October 2003, the merger was set at $16.5 billion.[10] The fair market value of the merger when completed in December 2004 was approximately $20.8 billion.[10] At the time of the merger's completion, WellPoint was the largest American insurer.[10]
In December 2014: WellPoint changed its corporate name to Anthem Inc..

It sold its Blue Cross and Blue Shield products in 11 states. Ultimately, Anthem became the name that consumers knew the company as.[21]
December 2004: The Anthem and WellPoint Health Networks deal was completed.[10] The fair market value of the acquisition at time of its completion was approximately $20.8 billion.[10] The newly merged company was renamed WellPoint, Inc.[10]
2005: WellPoint acquired Alexandria, Va.-based Lumenos, a provider of consumer-driven health plans, for $185 million.[22] Lumenos was the pioneer and market leader in consumer-driven health plans.

December 2005: WellPoint acquired WellChoice, a New York-based Blue Cross Blue Shield provider, for approximately $6.5 billion.[23]

February 2017: A US District Court ruling blocked the Cigna merger on anticompetitive grounds.[34] In February 14, 2017, Cigna Corp. called off its $48 billion merger agreement with Anthem Inc., with Anthem stating it would "continue to enforce its rights under the merger agreement and remains committed to closing the transaction."[35]

Quality of care[edit]
In the category of "Meeting National Standards of Care" California's state patient advocacy office gave Anthem a rating of 2 out of 4 stars in its 2011 annual report card.[36] In 2014 it received 3 out of 4 stars in the same category.[37]
Controversies[edit]
Giving for uninsured[edit]
In 2007, WellPoint pledged to spend $30 million over three years, through the company's charitable foundation, to help the uninsured. In March 2010, the Los Angeles Times reported that WellPoint's tax records and website showed that the company gave only $6.2 million by 2009. The company disputed that, saying that the foundation did fulfill its $30-million commitment by mid-2009, but declined to provide any financial details to support its position.[38]
Policy cancellations[edit]
In 2007, the California Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC), a California state regulatory agency, investigated Anthem Blue Cross's policies for revoking (rescinding) health care insurance policies. The DMHC randomly selected 90 instances where Anthem Blue Cross canceled the insurance of policy holders who had been diagnosed with costly or life-threatening illnesses, to find how many of these cancellations were legal. The agency concluded that all these cancellations were illegal. "In all 90 files, there was no evidence [that Blue Cross], before rescinding coverage, investigated or established that the applicant's omission/misrepresentation was willful," the DMHC report said.[39][40]
In July 2008, Anthem Blue Cross agreed to a settlement with the California Department of Managed Health Care. To resolve allegations of improper policy rescissions (cancellations), WellPoint paid $10 million and reinstated 1,770 policy-holders whose plans they had cancelled. They also agreed to provide compensation for any medical debts incurred by these policy-holders in the meantime. However, WellPoint did not officially admit liability.
In April 2010, a report in Reuters alleged that Wellpoint "using a computer algorithm, identified women recently diagnosed with breast cancer and then singled them out for cancellation of their policies."[41][42] The story not only caused considerable public outrage, but led Secretary of Health and Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius, and President Barack Obama, to call on WellPoint to end the practice.[43]
In 2011 Anthem Blue Cross began cancelling policies of members who had been paying premiums with credit cards, sometimes without calling or emailing the member ahead of time.[44]
Opposition to health care reform[edit]
The former Vice President for Public Policy and External Affairs at WellPoint, Elizabeth Fowler, is the Senior Counsel to Max Baucus, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and a leading opponent of the public option in health care reform.[45]
In August 2009, WellPoint’s Anthem Blue Cross unit, the largest for-profit insurer in California, contacted its employees and urged them to get involved to oppose Congress' plan for health care reform. Consumer Watchdog, a nonprofit watchdog organization in Santa Monica, asked California Atty. Gen. Jerry Brown to investigate its claim that WellPoint had illegally pushed workers to write to their elected officials, attend town hall meetings and enlist family and friends to ensure an overhaul that matches the firm’s interests. According to Consumer Watchdog, California's labor code directly prohibits coercive communications, including forbidding employers from controlling, coercing or influencing employees' political activities or affiliations. WellPoint had not been contacted by the California attorney general and had not seen any complaint.[46]
Through 2010 and into 2011, WellPoint senior executives met monthly with executives of other major health insurers to blunt the effect of the health care reform law.[47]
2009 premium increase in Maine[edit]
In 2009, Anthem Health Plans of Maine, a WellPoint subsidiary, sued the state of Maine for the right to increase premiums further.[48] Since Maine licenses insurance companies through its Department of Insurance, Anthem would need the state's permission to raise rates.[49] The Court disagreed with Anthem and found that, unlike other forms of insurance, the Maine Insurance Code does not require the Superintendent to consider profits at all.[50]
2010 premium increase in California[edit]
In February 2010, WellPoint announced that some Anthem Blue Cross individual policies in California would see a rate increase as high as 39%. This announcement resulted in an investigation by the US Federal and California government regulators.[13] Because of this, Anthem Blue Cross gained worldwide media attention and became a poster child for the problem of rising US health costs, when it announced that it was raising rates on some individual policy holders by as much as 39% as of March 2010.[13] The rate increase came one year after Anthem had raised rates 68% on individual policy holders.[51] This announcement resulted in an investigation by the US Federal and California government regulators.[13]
To explain the latest rate increases, some which were four times the rate of medical inflation, Anthem said the company has experienced a death spiral, as unemployment and declining wages led healthy customers to drop their insurance, the remaining risk pool becomes sicker and more expensive to insure, and, in turn, prices are forced up and push more people out of the market.[52]
In response to the outrage from politicians and consumers, Anthem postponed the rate increase until May 1, 2010.[53] Given Anthem’s rate increase plans, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democratic Senator of California, has proposed giving the federal government authority to block insurance premium hikes considered to be "unjustified".[54]
Reclassifying expenses[edit]
On 17 March 2010, WellPoint announced it was reclassifying some of its administrative costs as medical care costs in order to meet new loss ratio requirements under the health care law, which requires insurers to spend at least 80% or 85% of customer premiums on health care services, depending on the type of plan.[55]
2009-10 security breach[edit]
In June 2010, Anthem sent letters to 230,000 customers in California warning them that their personal data might have been accessed online. After a routine upgrade in October 2009, a third-party vendor stated that all security measures had been properly reinstated, when in fact they had not. As a result, personal information of thousands of coverage applicants who were under the age of 65 was exposed in the open. After a Los Angeles-area woman found that her application for coverage was publicly available, she filed a class-action lawsuit against Anthem. While gathering evidence for the proceeding, the woman's lawyers downloaded some confidential customer information from Anthem's website and alerted Anthem about the breach. According to the lawyers, confidential information had remained out in the open for five months.[56][57]
Denying benefits[edit]
In May 2014, Anthem Blue Cross refused to pay for the hospitalization of a Sonoma County, California man for stage four cancers, although he had paid Anthem over $100,000.00 in premiums.[58][59] Anthem ended up paying for coverage following public outcry.[60]
2015 medical data breach[edit]
Main article: Anthem medical data breach
On February 4, 2015, Anthem, Inc. disclosed that criminal hackers had broken into its servers and potentially stolen over 37.5 million records that contain personally identifiable information from its servers. According to Anthem, Inc., the data breach extended into multiple brands Anthem, Inc. uses to market its healthcare plans, including, Anthem Blue Cross, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia, Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Amerigroup, Caremore, and UniCare.[61] Healthlink says it was also a victim.[62] Anthem says the medical information and financial data was not compromised. Anthem has offered free credit monitoring in the wake of the breach.[63] According to Bloomberg News, China may be responsible for this data breach. Michael Daniel, chief adviser on cybersecurity for President Barack Obama, said he would be changing his own password.[64] According to The New York Times about 80 million company records were hacked, and there is fear that the stolen data will be used for identity theft.[65] On February 7, 2015 Elizabeth Weise wrote in USA Today that the compromised information contained names, birthdays, medical IDs, social security numbers, street addresses, e-mail addresses and employment information, including income data.[66]

History[edit]
Anthem Insurance Company[edit]
Anthem Insurance Company grew out of two Indianapolis, Indiana based mutual insurance companies, Mutual Hospital Insurance Inc. and Mutual Medical Insurance Inc. formed in 1944 and 1946.[5] The companies grew significantly, controlling 80% of the medical insurance market in Indiana by the 1970s. In 1972 they came together to create a joint operating agreement,[6] and merged in 1985 as parent company, Associated Insurance Companies, Inc, to form Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Indiana.[6][7][8]
In 1986 Associated Insurance Companies changed its name to The Associated Group (TAG) to reflect its expanded focus,[7] and began heavily expanding outside Indiana, acquiring numerous insurance companies and creating new subsidiaries throughout the late 1980s through the mid-1990s.
Formerly Anthem Inc. was an insurance company which began in the 1980s as a spin-off of the group insurance operations of American General Insurance.
Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield was created as part of the merger of The Associated Group with Community Mutual Insurance Co. of Cincinnati.[9]
From its move to a publicly traded company in 2001 until its final merger in 2004, it merged the Blue Cross Blue Shield organizations of several states to achieve economy of scale, converting them in the process from non-profit to for-profit status. In late 2004, Anthem and WellPoint merged, with the combined company taking the WellPoint name. That Anthem no longer exists as a company, but the Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield brand name is used by WellPoint in 11 states.
In October 2001, Anthem demutualized and conducted an initial public offering of common stock. WellPoint, Inc. (formerly Anthem, Inc.) was formed when WellPoint Health Networks Inc. and Anthem, Inc. merged in 2004 to become the nation's leading health benefits company.
WellPoint Health Network Inc.'s predecessor was Blue Cross of California, which was founded in 1982 with the consolidation of Blue Cross of Northern California (established in 1936) and Blue Cross of Southern California (established in 1937). WellPoint was formed in 1992 to operate Blue Cross of California's managed care business. In 1993, Blue Cross of California spun off its managed care business into a separate publicly traded entity, WellPoint Health Networks Inc. In 1996, Blue Cross of California completed the conversion of all its business to for-profit status, resulting in a restructuring that designated WellPoint Health Networks Inc. as the parent organization. Anthem and WellPoint achieved a portion of this growth through mergers and acquisitions.
Wellpoint, Inc. was formed in November 2004 following a merger of Anthem and WellPoint Health Networks Inc.[5] The merger was structured as Anthem acquiring WellPoint Health Networks and rebranding itself WellPoint, Inc. When the deal was originally announced in October 2003, the merger was set at $16.5 billion.[10] The fair market value of the merger when completed in December 2004 was approximately $20.8 billion.[10] At the time of the merger's completion, WellPoint was the largest American insurer.[10]
In December 2014: WellPoint changed its corporate name to Anthem Inc..

When the deal was originally announced in October 2003, the merger was set at $16.5 billion.[10] WellPoint still used Anthem as the brand name under which it operated. It sold its Blue Cross and Blue Shield products in 11 states. Ultimately, Anthem became the name that consumers knew the company as.[21]

Quality of care[edit]
In the category of "Meeting National Standards of Care" California's state patient advocacy office gave Anthem a rating of 2 out of 4 stars in its 2011 annual report card.[36] In 2014 it received 3 out of 4 stars in the same category.[37]
Controversies[edit]
Giving for uninsured[edit]
In 2007, WellPoint pledged to spend $30 million over three years, through the company's charitable foundation, to help the uninsured. In March 2010, the Los Angeles Times reported that WellPoint's tax records and website showed that the company gave only $6.2 million by 2009. The company disputed that, saying that the foundation did fulfill its $30-million commitment by mid-2009, but declined to provide any financial details to support its position.[38]
Policy cancellations[edit]
In 2007, the California Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC), a California state regulatory agency, investigated Anthem Blue Cross's policies for revoking (rescinding) health care insurance policies. The DMHC randomly selected 90 instances where Anthem Blue Cross canceled the insurance of policy holders who had been diagnosed with costly or life-threatening illnesses, to find how many of these cancellations were legal. The agency concluded that all these cancellations were illegal. "In all 90 files, there was no evidence [that Blue Cross], before rescinding coverage, investigated or established that the applicant's omission/misrepresentation was willful," the DMHC report said.[39][40]
In July 2008, Anthem Blue Cross agreed to a settlement with the California Department of Managed Health Care. To resolve allegations of improper policy rescissions (cancellations), WellPoint paid $10 million and reinstated 1,770 policy-holders whose plans they had cancelled. They also agreed to provide compensation for any medical debts incurred by these policy-holders in the meantime. However, WellPoint did not officially admit liability.
In April 2010, a report in Reuters alleged that Wellpoint "using a computer algorithm, identified women recently diagnosed with breast cancer and then singled them out for cancellation of their policies."[41][42] The story not only caused considerable public outrage, but led Secretary of Health and Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius, and President Barack Obama, to call on WellPoint to end the practice.[43]
In 2011 Anthem Blue Cross began cancelling policies of members who had been paying premiums with credit cards, sometimes without calling or emailing the member ahead of time.[44]
Opposition to health care reform[edit]
The former Vice President for Public Policy and External Affairs at WellPoint, Elizabeth Fowler, is the Senior Counsel to Max Baucus, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and a leading opponent of the public option in health care reform.[45]
In August 2009, WellPoint’s Anthem Blue Cross unit, the largest for-profit insurer in California, contacted its employees and urged them to get involved to oppose Congress' plan for health care reform. Consumer Watchdog, a nonprofit watchdog organization in Santa Monica, asked California Atty. Gen. Jerry Brown to investigate its claim that WellPoint had illegally pushed workers to write to their elected officials, attend town hall meetings and enlist family and friends to ensure an overhaul that matches the firm’s interests. According to Consumer Watchdog, California's labor code directly prohibits coercive communications, including forbidding employers from controlling, coercing or influencing employees' political activities or affiliations. WellPoint had not been contacted by the California attorney general and had not seen any complaint.[46]
Through 2010 and into 2011, WellPoint senior executives met monthly with executives of other major health insurers to blunt the effect of the health care reform law.[47]
2009 premium increase in Maine[edit]
In 2009, Anthem Health Plans of Maine, a WellPoint subsidiary, sued the state of Maine for the right to increase premiums further.[48] Since Maine licenses insurance companies through its Department of Insurance, Anthem would need the state's permission to raise rates.[49] The Court disagreed with Anthem and found that, unlike other forms of insurance, the Maine Insurance Code does not require the Superintendent to consider profits at all.[50]
2010 premium increase in California[edit]
In February 2010, WellPoint announced that some Anthem Blue Cross individual policies in California would see a rate increase as high as 39%. This announcement resulted in an investigation by the US Federal and California government regulators.[13] Because of this, Anthem Blue Cross gained worldwide media attention and became a poster child for the problem of rising US health costs, when it announced that it was raising rates on some individual policy holders by as much as 39% as of March 2010.[13] The rate increase came one year after Anthem had raised rates 68% on individual policy holders.[51] This announcement resulted in an investigation by the US Federal and California government regulators.[13]
To explain the latest rate increases, some which were four times the rate of medical inflation, Anthem said the company has experienced a death spiral, as unemployment and declining wages led healthy customers to drop their insurance, the remaining risk pool becomes sicker and more expensive to insure, and, in turn, prices are forced up and push more people out of the market.[52]
In response to the outrage from politicians and consumers, Anthem postponed the rate increase until May 1, 2010.[53] Given Anthem’s rate increase plans, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democratic Senator of California, has proposed giving the federal government authority to block insurance premium hikes considered to be "unjustified".[54]
Reclassifying expenses[edit]
On 17 March 2010, WellPoint announced it was reclassifying some of its administrative costs as medical care costs in order to meet new loss ratio requirements under the health care law, which requires insurers to spend at least 80% or 85% of customer premiums on health care services, depending on the type of plan.[55]
2009-10 security breach[edit]
In June 2010, Anthem sent letters to 230,000 customers in California warning them that their personal data might have been accessed online. After a routine upgrade in October 2009, a third-party vendor stated that all security measures had been properly reinstated, when in fact they had not. As a result, personal information of thousands of coverage applicants who were under the age of 65 was exposed in the open. After a Los Angeles-area woman found that her application for coverage was publicly available, she filed a class-action lawsuit against Anthem. While gathering evidence for the proceeding, the woman's lawyers downloaded some confidential customer information from Anthem's website and alerted Anthem about the breach. According to the lawyers, confidential information had remained out in the open for five months.[56][57]
Denying benefits[edit]
In May 2014, Anthem Blue Cross refused to pay for the hospitalization of a Sonoma County, California man for stage four cancers, although he had paid Anthem over $100,000.00 in premiums.[58][59] Anthem ended up paying for coverage following public outcry.[60]
2015 medical data breach[edit]
Main article: Anthem medical data breach
On February 4, 2015, Anthem, Inc. disclosed that criminal hackers had broken into its servers and potentially stolen over 37.5 million records that contain personally identifiable information from its servers. According to Anthem, Inc., the data breach extended into multiple brands Anthem, Inc. uses to market its healthcare plans, including, Anthem Blue Cross, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia, Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Amerigroup, Caremore, and UniCare.[61] Healthlink says it was also a victim.[62] Anthem says the medical information and financial data was not compromised. Anthem has offered free credit monitoring in the wake of the breach.[63] According to Bloomberg News, China may be responsible for this data breach. Michael Daniel, chief adviser on cybersecurity for President Barack Obama, said he would be changing his own password.[64] According to The New York Times about 80 million company records were hacked, and there is fear that the stolen data will be used for identity theft.[65] On February 7, 2015 Elizabeth Weise wrote in USA Today that the compromised information contained names, birthdays, medical IDs, social security numbers, street addresses, e-mail addresses and employment information, including income data.[66]

History[edit]
Anthem Insurance Company[edit]
Anthem Insurance Company grew out of two Indianapolis, Indiana based mutual insurance companies, Mutual Hospital Insurance Inc. and Mutual Medical Insurance Inc. formed in 1944 and 1946.[5] The companies grew significantly, controlling 80% of the medical insurance market in Indiana by the 1970s. In 1972 they came together to create a joint operating agreement,[6] and merged in 1985 as parent company, Associated Insurance Companies, Inc, to form Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Indiana.[6][7][8]
In 1986 Associated Insurance Companies changed its name to The Associated Group (TAG) to reflect its expanded focus,[7] and began heavily expanding outside Indiana, acquiring numerous insurance companies and creating new subsidiaries throughout the late 1980s through the mid-1990s.
Formerly Anthem Inc. was an insurance company which began in the 1980s as a spin-off of the group insurance operations of American General Insurance.
Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield was created as part of the merger of The Associated Group with Community Mutual Insurance Co. of Cincinnati.[9]
From its move to a publicly traded company in 2001 until its final merger in 2004, it merged the Blue Cross Blue Shield organizations of several states to achieve economy of scale, converting them in the process from non-profit to for-profit status. In late 2004, Anthem and WellPoint merged, with the combined company taking the WellPoint name. That Anthem no longer exists as a company, but the Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield brand name is used by WellPoint in 11 states.
In October 2001, Anthem demutualized and conducted an initial public offering of common stock. WellPoint, Inc. (formerly Anthem, Inc.) was formed when WellPoint Health Networks Inc. and Anthem, Inc. merged in 2004 to become the nation's leading health benefits company.
WellPoint Health Network Inc.'s predecessor was Blue Cross of California, which was founded in 1982 with the consolidation of Blue Cross of Northern California (established in 1936) and Blue Cross of Southern California (established in 1937). WellPoint was formed in 1992 to operate Blue Cross of California's managed care business. In 1993, Blue Cross of California spun off its managed care business into a separate publicly traded entity, WellPoint Health Networks Inc. In 1996, Blue Cross of California completed the conversion of all its business to for-profit status, resulting in a restructuring that designated WellPoint Health Networks Inc. as the parent organization. Anthem and WellPoint achieved a portion of this growth through mergers and acquisitions.
Wellpoint, Inc. was formed in November 2004 following a merger of Anthem and WellPoint Health Networks Inc.[5] The merger was structured as Anthem acquiring WellPoint Health Networks and rebranding itself WellPoint, Inc. When the deal was originally announced in October 2003, the merger was set at $16.5 billion.[10] The fair market value of the merger when completed in December 2004 was approximately $20.8 billion.[10] At the time of the merger's completion, WellPoint was the largest American insurer.[10]
In December 2014: WellPoint changed its corporate name to Anthem Inc..

Quality of care[edit]
In the category of "Meeting National Standards of Care" California's state patient advocacy office gave Anthem a rating of 2 out of 4 stars in its 2011 annual report card.[36] In 2014 it received 3 out of 4 stars in the same category.[37]
Controversies[edit]
Giving for uninsured[edit]
In 2007, WellPoint pledged to spend $30 million over three years, through the company's charitable foundation, to help the uninsured. In March 2010, the Los Angeles Times reported that WellPoint's tax records and website showed that the company gave only $6.2 million by 2009. The company disputed that, saying that the foundation did fulfill its $30-million commitment by mid-2009, but declined to provide any financial details to support its position.[38]
Policy cancellations[edit]
In 2007, the California Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC), a California state regulatory agency, investigated Anthem Blue Cross's policies for revoking (rescinding) health care insurance policies. The DMHC randomly selected 90 instances where Anthem Blue Cross canceled the insurance of policy holders who had been diagnosed with costly or life-threatening illnesses, to find how many of these cancellations were legal. The agency concluded that all these cancellations were illegal. "In all 90 files, there was no evidence [that Blue Cross], before rescinding coverage, investigated or established that the applicant's omission/misrepresentation was willful," the DMHC report said.[39][40]
In July 2008, Anthem Blue Cross agreed to a settlement with the California Department of Managed Health Care. To resolve allegations of improper policy rescissions (cancellations), WellPoint paid $10 million and reinstated 1,770 policy-holders whose plans they had cancelled. They also agreed to provide compensation for any medical debts incurred by these policy-holders in the meantime. However, WellPoint did not officially admit liability.
In April 2010, a report in Reuters alleged that Wellpoint "using a computer algorithm, identified women recently diagnosed with breast cancer and then singled them out for cancellation of their policies."[41][42] The story not only caused considerable public outrage, but led Secretary of Health and Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius, and President Barack Obama, to call on WellPoint to end the practice.[43]
In 2011 Anthem Blue Cross began cancelling policies of members who had been paying premiums with credit cards, sometimes without calling or emailing the member ahead of time.[44]
Opposition to health care reform[edit]
The former Vice President for Public Policy and External Affairs at WellPoint, Elizabeth Fowler, is the Senior Counsel to Max Baucus, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and a leading opponent of the public option in health care reform.[45]
In August 2009, WellPoint’s Anthem Blue Cross unit, the largest for-profit insurer in California, contacted its employees and urged them to get involved to oppose Congress' plan for health care reform. Consumer Watchdog, a nonprofit watchdog organization in Santa Monica, asked California Atty. Gen. Jerry Brown to investigate its claim that WellPoint had illegally pushed workers to write to their elected officials, attend town hall meetings and enlist family and friends to ensure an overhaul that matches the firm’s interests. According to Consumer Watchdog, California's labor code directly prohibits coercive communications, including forbidding employers from controlling, coercing or influencing employees' political activities or affiliations. WellPoint had not been contacted by the California attorney general and had not seen any complaint.[46]
Through 2010 and into 2011, WellPoint senior executives met monthly with executives of other major health insurers to blunt the effect of the health care reform law.[47]
2009 premium increase in Maine[edit]
In 2009, Anthem Health Plans of Maine, a WellPoint subsidiary, sued the state of Maine for the right to increase premiums further.[48] Since Maine licenses insurance companies through its Department of Insurance, Anthem would need the state's permission to raise rates.[49] The Court disagreed with Anthem and found that, unlike other forms of insurance, the Maine Insurance Code does not require the Superintendent to consider profits at all.[50]
2010 premium increase in California[edit]
In February 2010, WellPoint announced that some Anthem Blue Cross individual policies in California would see a rate increase as high as 39%. This announcement resulted in an investigation by the US Federal and California government regulators.[13] Because of this, Anthem Blue Cross gained worldwide media attention and became a poster child for the problem of rising US health costs, when it announced that it was raising rates on some individual policy holders by as much as 39% as of March 2010.[13] The rate increase came one year after Anthem had raised rates 68% on individual policy holders.[51] This announcement resulted in an investigation by the US Federal and California government regulators.[13]
To explain the latest rate increases, some which were four times the rate of medical inflation, Anthem said the company has experienced a death spiral, as unemployment and declining wages led healthy customers to drop their insurance, the remaining risk pool becomes sicker and more expensive to insure, and, in turn, prices are forced up and push more people out of the market.[52]
In response to the outrage from politicians and consumers, Anthem postponed the rate increase until May 1, 2010.[53] Given Anthem’s rate increase plans, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democratic Senator of California, has proposed giving the federal government authority to block insurance premium hikes considered to be "unjustified".[54]
Reclassifying expenses[edit]
On 17 March 2010, WellPoint announced it was reclassifying some of its administrative costs as medical care costs in order to meet new loss ratio requirements under the health care law, which requires insurers to spend at least 80% or 85% of customer premiums on health care services, depending on the type of plan.[55]
2009-10 security breach[edit]
In June 2010, Anthem sent letters to 230,000 customers in California warning them that their personal data might have been accessed online. After a routine upgrade in October 2009, a third-party vendor stated that all security measures had been properly reinstated, when in fact they had not. As a result, personal information of thousands of coverage applicants who were under the age of 65 was exposed in the open. After a Los Angeles-area woman found that her application for coverage was publicly available, she filed a class-action lawsuit against Anthem. While gathering evidence for the proceeding, the woman's lawyers downloaded some confidential customer information from Anthem's website and alerted Anthem about the breach. According to the lawyers, confidential information had remained out in the open for five months.[56][57]
Denying benefits[edit]
In May 2014, Anthem Blue Cross refused to pay for the hospitalization of a Sonoma County, California man for stage four cancers, although he had paid Anthem over $100,000.00 in premiums.[58][59] Anthem ended up paying for coverage following public outcry.[60]
2015 medical data breach[edit]
Main article: Anthem medical data breach
On February 4, 2015, Anthem, Inc. disclosed that criminal hackers had broken into its servers and potentially stolen over 37.5 million records that contain personally identifiable information from its servers. According to Anthem, Inc., the data breach extended into multiple brands Anthem, Inc. uses to market its healthcare plans, including, Anthem Blue Cross, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia, Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Amerigroup, Caremore, and UniCare.[61] Healthlink says it was also a victim.[62] Anthem says the medical information and financial data was not compromised. Anthem has offered free credit monitoring in the wake of the breach.[63] According to Bloomberg News, China may be responsible for this data breach. Michael Daniel, chief adviser on cybersecurity for President Barack Obama, said he would be changing his own password.[64] According to The New York Times about 80 million company records were hacked, and there is fear that the stolen data will be used for identity theft.[65] On February 7, 2015 Elizabeth Weise wrote in USA Today that the compromised information contained names, birthdays, medical IDs, social security numbers, street addresses, e-mail addresses and employment information, including income data.[66]

History[edit]
Anthem Insurance Company[edit]
Anthem Insurance Company grew out of two Indianapolis, Indiana based mutual insurance companies, Mutual Hospital Insurance Inc. and Mutual Medical Insurance Inc. formed in 1944 and 1946.[5] The companies grew significantly, controlling 80% of the medical insurance market in Indiana by the 1970s. In 1972 they came together to create a joint operating agreement,[6] and merged in 1985 as parent company, Associated Insurance Companies, Inc, to form Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Indiana.[6][7][8]
In 1986 Associated Insurance Companies changed its name to The Associated Group (TAG) to reflect its expanded focus,[7] and began heavily expanding outside Indiana, acquiring numerous insurance companies and creating new subsidiaries throughout the late 1980s through the mid-1990s.
Formerly Anthem Inc. was an insurance company which began in the 1980s as a spin-off of the group insurance operations of American General Insurance.
Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield was created as part of the merger of The Associated Group with Community Mutual Insurance Co. of Cincinnati.[9]
From its move to a publicly traded company in 2001 until its final merger in 2004, it merged the Blue Cross Blue Shield organizations of several states to achieve economy of scale, converting them in the process from non-profit to for-profit status. In late 2004, Anthem and WellPoint merged, with the combined company taking the WellPoint name. That Anthem no longer exists as a company, but the Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield brand name is used by WellPoint in 11 states.
In October 2001, Anthem demutualized and conducted an initial public offering of common stock. WellPoint, Inc. (formerly Anthem, Inc.) was formed when WellPoint Health Networks Inc. and Anthem, Inc. merged in 2004 to become the nation's leading health benefits company.
WellPoint Health Network Inc.'s predecessor was Blue Cross of California, which was founded in 1982 with the consolidation of Blue Cross of Northern California (established in 1936) and Blue Cross of Southern California (established in 1937). WellPoint was formed in 1992 to operate Blue Cross of California's managed care business. In 1993, Blue Cross of California spun off its managed care business into a separate publicly traded entity, WellPoint Health Networks Inc. In 1996, Blue Cross of California completed the conversion of all its business to for-profit status, resulting in a restructuring that designated WellPoint Health Networks Inc. as the parent organization. Anthem and WellPoint achieved a portion of this growth through mergers and acquisitions.
Wellpoint, Inc. was formed in November 2004 following a merger of Anthem and WellPoint Health Networks Inc.[5] The merger was structured as Anthem acquiring WellPoint Health Networks and rebranding itself WellPoint, Inc. When the deal was originally announced in October 2003, the merger was set at $16.5 billion.[10] The fair market value of the merger when completed in December 2004 was approximately $20.8 billion.[10] At the time of the merger's completion, WellPoint was the largest American insurer.[10]
In December 2014: WellPoint changed its corporate name to Anthem Inc..

Quality of care[edit]
In the category of "Meeting National Standards of Care" California's state patient advocacy office gave Anthem a rating of 2 out of 4 stars in its 2011 annual report card.[36] In 2014 it received 3 out of 4 stars in the same category.[37]
Controversies[edit]
Giving for uninsured[edit]
In 2007, WellPoint pledged to spend $30 million over three years, through the company's charitable foundation, to help the uninsured. In March 2010, the Los Angeles Times reported that WellPoint's tax records and website showed that the company gave only $6.2 million by 2009. The company disputed that, saying that the foundation did fulfill its $30-million commitment by mid-2009, but declined to provide any financial details to support its position.[38]
Policy cancellations[edit]
In 2007, the California Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC), a California state regulatory agency, investigated Anthem Blue Cross's policies for revoking (rescinding) health care insurance policies. The DMHC randomly selected 90 instances where Anthem Blue Cross canceled the insurance of policy holders who had been diagnosed with costly or life-threatening illnesses, to find how many of these cancellations were legal. The agency concluded that all these cancellations were illegal. "In all 90 files, there was no evidence [that Blue Cross], before rescinding coverage, investigated or established that the applicant's omission/misrepresentation was willful," the DMHC report said.[39][40]
In July 2008, Anthem Blue Cross agreed to a settlement with the California Department of Managed Health Care. To resolve allegations of improper policy rescissions (cancellations), WellPoint paid $10 million and reinstated 1,770 policy-holders whose plans they had cancelled. They also agreed to provide compensation for any medical debts incurred by these policy-holders in the meantime. However, WellPoint did not officially admit liability.
In April 2010, a report in Reuters alleged that Wellpoint "using a computer algorithm, identified women recently diagnosed with breast cancer and then singled them out for cancellation of their policies."[41][42] The story not only caused considerable public outrage, but led Secretary of Health and Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius, and President Barack Obama, to call on WellPoint to end the practice.[43]
In 2011 Anthem Blue Cross began cancelling policies of members who had been paying premiums with credit cards, sometimes without calling or emailing the member ahead of time.[44]
Opposition to health care reform[edit]
The former Vice President for Public Policy and External Affairs at WellPoint, Elizabeth Fowler, is the Senior Counsel to Max Baucus, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and a leading opponent of the public option in health care reform.[45]
In August 2009, WellPoint’s Anthem Blue Cross unit, the largest for-profit insurer in California, contacted its employees and urged them to get involved to oppose Congress' plan for health care reform. Consumer Watchdog, a nonprofit watchdog organization in Santa Monica, asked California Atty. Gen. Jerry Brown to investigate its claim that WellPoint had illegally pushed workers to write to their elected officials, attend town hall meetings and enlist family and friends to ensure an overhaul that matches the firm’s interests. According to Consumer Watchdog, California's labor code directly prohibits coercive communications, including forbidding employers from controlling, coercing or influencing employees' political activities or affiliations. WellPoint had not been contacted by the California attorney general and had not seen any complaint.[46]
Through 2010 and into 2011, WellPoint senior executives met monthly with executives of other major health insurers to blunt the effect of the health care reform law.[47]
2009 premium increase in Maine[edit]
In 2009, Anthem Health Plans of Maine, a WellPoint subsidiary, sued the state of Maine for the right to increase premiums further.[48] Since Maine licenses insurance companies through its Department of Insurance, Anthem would need the state's permission to raise rates.[49] The Court disagreed with Anthem and found that, unlike other forms of insurance, the Maine Insurance Code does not require the Superintendent to consider profits at all.[50]
2010 premium increase in California[edit]
In February 2010, WellPoint announced that some Anthem Blue Cross individual policies in California would see a rate increase as high as 39%. This announcement resulted in an investigation by the US Federal and California government regulators.[13] Because of this, Anthem Blue Cross gained worldwide media attention and became a poster child for the problem of rising US health costs, when it announced that it was raising rates on some individual policy holders by as much as 39% as of March 2010.[13] The rate increase came one year after Anthem had raised rates 68% on individual policy holders.[51] This announcement resulted in an investigation by the US Federal and California government regulators.[13]
To explain the latest rate increases, some which were four times the rate of medical inflation, Anthem said the company has experienced a death spiral, as unemployment and declining wages led healthy customers to drop their insurance, the remaining risk pool becomes sicker and more expensive to insure, and, in turn, prices are forced up and push more people out of the market.[52]
In response to the outrage from politicians and consumers, Anthem postponed the rate increase until May 1, 2010.[53] Given Anthem’s rate increase plans, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democratic Senator of California, has proposed giving the federal government authority to block insurance premium hikes considered to be "unjustified".[54]
Reclassifying expenses[edit]
On 17 March 2010, WellPoint announced it was reclassifying some of its administrative costs as medical care costs in order to meet new loss ratio requirements under the health care law, which requires insurers to spend at least 80% or 85% of customer premiums on health care services, depending on the type of plan.[55]
2009-10 security breach[edit]
In June 2010, Anthem sent letters to 230,000 customers in California warning them that their personal data might have been accessed online. After a routine upgrade in October 2009, a third-party vendor stated that all security measures had been properly reinstated, when in fact they had not. As a result, personal information of thousands of coverage applicants who were under the age of 65 was exposed in the open. After a Los Angeles-area woman found that her application for coverage was publicly available, she filed a class-action lawsuit against Anthem. While gathering evidence for the proceeding, the woman's lawyers downloaded some confidential customer information from Anthem's website and alerted Anthem about the breach. According to the lawyers, confidential information had remained out in the open for five months.[56][57]
Denying benefits[edit]
In May 2014, Anthem Blue Cross refused to pay for the hospitalization of a Sonoma County, California man for stage four cancers, although he had paid Anthem over $100,000.00 in premiums.[58][59] Anthem ended up paying for coverage following public outcry.[60]
2015 medical data breach[edit]
Main article: Anthem medical data breach
On February 4, 2015, Anthem, Inc. disclosed that criminal hackers had broken into its servers and potentially stolen over 37.5 million records that contain personally identifiable information from its servers. According to Anthem, Inc., the data breach extended into multiple brands Anthem, Inc. uses to market its healthcare plans, including, Anthem Blue Cross, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia, Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Amerigroup, Caremore, and UniCare.[61] Healthlink says it was also a victim.[62] Anthem says the medical information and financial data was not compromised. Anthem has offered free credit monitoring in the wake of the breach.[63] According to Bloomberg News, China may be responsible for this data breach. Michael Daniel, chief adviser on cybersecurity for President Barack Obama, said he would be changing his own password.[64] According to The New York Times about 80 million company records were hacked, and there is fear that the stolen data will be used for identity theft.[65] On February 7, 2015 Elizabeth Weise wrote in USA Today that the compromised information contained names, birthdays, medical IDs, social security numbers, street addresses, e-mail addresses and employment information, including income data.[66]

History[edit]
Anthem Insurance Company[edit]
Anthem Insurance Company grew out of two Indianapolis, Indiana based mutual insurance companies, Mutual Hospital Insurance Inc. and Mutual Medical Insurance Inc. formed in 1944 and 1946.[5] The companies grew significantly, controlling 80% of the medical insurance market in Indiana by the 1970s. In 1972 they came together to create a joint operating agreement,[6] and merged in 1985 as parent company, Associated Insurance Companies, Inc, to form Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Indiana.[6][7][8]
In 1986 Associated Insurance Companies changed its name to The Associated Group (TAG) to reflect its expanded focus,[7] and began heavily expanding outside Indiana, acquiring numerous insurance companies and creating new subsidiaries throughout the late 1980s through the mid-1990s.
Formerly Anthem Inc. was an insurance company which began in the 1980s as a spin-off of the group insurance operations of American General Insurance.
Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield was created as part of the merger of The Associated Group with Community Mutual Insurance Co. of Cincinnati.[9]
From its move to a publicly traded company in 2001 until its final merger in 2004, it merged the Blue Cross Blue Shield organizations of several states to achieve economy of scale, converting them in the process from non-profit to for-profit status. In late 2004, Anthem and WellPoint merged, with the combined company taking the WellPoint name. That Anthem no longer exists as a company, but the Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield brand name is used by WellPoint in 11 states.
In October 2001, Anthem demutualized and conducted an initial public offering of common stock. WellPoint, Inc. (formerly Anthem, Inc.) was formed when WellPoint Health Networks Inc. and Anthem, Inc. merged in 2004 to become the nation's leading health benefits company.
WellPoint Health Network Inc.'s predecessor was Blue Cross of California, which was founded in 1982 with the consolidation of Blue Cross of Northern California (established in 1936) and Blue Cross of Southern California (established in 1937). WellPoint was formed in 1992 to operate Blue Cross of California's managed care business. In 1993, Blue Cross of California spun off its managed care business into a separate publicly traded entity, WellPoint Health Networks Inc. In 1996, Blue Cross of California completed the conversion of all its business to for-profit status, resulting in a restructuring that designated WellPoint Health Networks Inc. as the parent organization. Anthem and WellPoint achieved a portion of this growth through mergers and acquisitions.
Wellpoint, Inc. was formed in November 2004 following a merger of Anthem and WellPoint Health Networks Inc.[5] The merger was structured as Anthem acquiring WellPoint Health Networks and rebranding itself WellPoint, Inc. When the deal was originally announced in October 2003, the merger was set at $16.5 billion.[10] The fair market value of the merger when completed in December 2004 was approximately $20.8 billion.[10] At the time of the merger's completion, WellPoint was the largest American insurer.[10]
In December 2014: WellPoint changed its corporate name to Anthem Inc..

Quality of care[edit]
In the category of "Meeting National Standards of Care" California's state patient advocacy office gave Anthem a rating of 2 out of 4 stars in its 2011 annual report card.[36] In 2014 it received 3 out of 4 stars in the same category.[37]
Controversies[edit]
Giving for uninsured[edit]
In 2007, WellPoint pledged to spend $30 million over three years, through the company's charitable foundation, to help the uninsured. In March 2010, the Los Angeles Times reported that WellPoint's tax records and website showed that the company gave only $6.2 million by 2009. The company disputed that, saying that the foundation did fulfill its $30-million commitment by mid-2009, but declined to provide any financial details to support its position.[38]
Policy cancellations[edit]
In 2007, the California Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC), a California state regulatory agency, investigated Anthem Blue Cross's policies for revoking (rescinding) health care insurance policies. The DMHC randomly selected 90 instances where Anthem Blue Cross canceled the insurance of policy holders who had been diagnosed with costly or life-threatening illnesses, to find how many of these cancellations were legal. The agency concluded that all these cancellations were illegal. "In all 90 files, there was no evidence [that Blue Cross], before rescinding coverage, investigated or established that the applicant's omission/misrepresentation was willful," the DMHC report said.[39][40]
In July 2008, Anthem Blue Cross agreed to a settlement with the California Department of Managed Health Care. To resolve allegations of improper policy rescissions (cancellations), WellPoint paid $10 million and reinstated 1,770 policy-holders whose plans they had cancelled. They also agreed to provide compensation for any medical debts incurred by these policy-holders in the meantime. However, WellPoint did not officially admit liability.
In April 2010, a report in Reuters alleged that Wellpoint "using a computer algorithm, identified women recently diagnosed with breast cancer and then singled them out for cancellation of their policies."[41][42] The story not only caused considerable public outrage, but led Secretary of Health and Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius, and President Barack Obama, to call on WellPoint to end the practice.[43]
In 2011 Anthem Blue Cross began cancelling policies of members who had been paying premiums with credit cards, sometimes without calling or emailing the member ahead of time.[44]
Opposition to health care reform[edit]
The former Vice President for Public Policy and External Affairs at WellPoint, Elizabeth Fowler, is the Senior Counsel to Max Baucus, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and a leading opponent of the public option in health care reform.[45]
In August 2009, WellPoint’s Anthem Blue Cross unit, the largest for-profit insurer in California, contacted its employees and urged them to get involved to oppose Congress' plan for health care reform. Consumer Watchdog, a nonprofit watchdog organization in Santa Monica, asked California Atty. Gen. Jerry Brown to investigate its claim that WellPoint had illegally pushed workers to write to their elected officials, attend town hall meetings and enlist family and friends to ensure an overhaul that matches the firm’s interests. According to Consumer Watchdog, California's labor code directly prohibits coercive communications, including forbidding employers from controlling, coercing or influencing employees' political activities or affiliations. WellPoint had not been contacted by the California attorney general and had not seen any complaint.[46]
Through 2010 and into 2011, WellPoint senior executives met monthly with executives of other major health insurers to blunt the effect of the health care reform law.[47]
2009 premium increase in Maine[edit]
In 2009, Anthem Health Plans of Maine, a WellPoint subsidiary, sued the state of Maine for the right to increase premiums further.[48] Since Maine licenses insurance companies through its Department of Insurance, Anthem would need the state's permission to raise rates.[49] The Court disagreed with Anthem and found that, unlike other forms of insurance, the Maine Insurance Code does not require the Superintendent to consider profits at all.[50]
2010 premium increase in California[edit]
In February 2010, WellPoint announced that some Anthem Blue Cross individual policies in California would see a rate increase as high as 39%. This announcement resulted in an investigation by the US Federal and California government regulators.[13] Because of this, Anthem Blue Cross gained worldwide media attention and became a poster child for the problem of rising US health costs, when it announced that it was raising rates on some individual policy holders by as much as 39% as of March 2010.[13] The rate increase came one year after Anthem had raised rates 68% on individual policy holders.[51] This announcement resulted in an investigation by the US Federal and California government regulators.[13]
To explain the latest rate increases, some which were four times the rate of medical inflation, Anthem said the company has experienced a death spiral, as unemployment and declining wages led healthy customers to drop their insurance, the remaining risk pool becomes sicker and more expensive to insure, and, in turn, prices are forced up and push more people out of the market.[52]
In response to the outrage from politicians and consumers, Anthem postponed the rate increase until May 1, 2010.[53] Given Anthem’s rate increase plans, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democratic Senator of California, has proposed giving the federal government authority to block insurance premium hikes considered to be "unjustified".[54]
Reclassifying expenses[edit]
On 17 March 2010, WellPoint announced it was reclassifying some of its administrative costs as medical care costs in order to meet new loss ratio requirements under the health care law, which requires insurers to spend at least 80% or 85% of customer premiums on health care services, depending on the type of plan.[55]
2009-10 security breach[edit]
In June 2010, Anthem sent letters to 230,000 customers in California warning them that their personal data might have been accessed online. After a routine upgrade in October 2009, a third-party vendor stated that all security measures had been properly reinstated, when in fact they had not. As a result, personal information of thousands of coverage applicants who were under the age of 65 was exposed in the open. After a Los Angeles-area woman found that her application for coverage was publicly available, she filed a class-action lawsuit against Anthem. While gathering evidence for the proceeding, the woman's lawyers downloaded some confidential customer information from Anthem's website and alerted Anthem about the breach. According to the lawyers, confidential information had remained out in the open for five months.[56][57]
Denying benefits[edit]
In May 2014, Anthem Blue Cross refused to pay for the hospitalization of a Sonoma County, California man for stage four cancers, although he had paid Anthem over $100,000.00 in premiums.[58][59] Anthem ended up paying for coverage following public outcry.[60]
2015 medical data breach[edit]
Main article: Anthem medical data breach
On February 4, 2015, Anthem, Inc. disclosed that criminal hackers had broken into its servers and potentially stolen over 37.5 million records that contain personally identifiable information from its servers. According to Anthem, Inc., the data breach extended into multiple brands Anthem, Inc. uses to market its healthcare plans, including, Anthem Blue Cross, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia, Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Amerigroup, Caremore, and UniCare.[61] Healthlink says it was also a victim.[62] Anthem says the medical information and financial data was not compromised. Anthem has offered free credit monitoring in the wake of the breach.[63] According to Bloomberg News, China may be responsible for this data breach. Michael Daniel, chief adviser on cybersecurity for President Barack Obama, said he would be changing his own password.[64] According to The New York Times about 80 million company records were hacked, and there is fear that the stolen data will be used for identity theft.[65] On February 7, 2015 Elizabeth Weise wrote in USA Today that the compromised information contained names, birthdays, medical IDs, social security numbers, street addresses, e-mail addresses and employment information, including income data.[66]

History[edit]
Anthem Insurance Company[edit]
Anthem Insurance Company grew out of two Indianapolis, Indiana based mutual insurance companies, Mutual Hospital Insurance Inc. and Mutual Medical Insurance Inc. formed in 1944 and 1946.[5] The companies grew significantly, controlling 80% of the medical insurance market in Indiana by the 1970s. In 1972 they came together to create a joint operating agreement,[6] and merged in 1985 as parent company, Associated Insurance Companies, Inc, to form Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Indiana.[6][7][8]
In 1986 Associated Insurance Companies changed its name to The Associated Group (TAG) to reflect its expanded focus,[7] and began heavily expanding outside Indiana, acquiring numerous insurance companies and creating new subsidiaries throughout the late 1980s through the mid-1990s.
Formerly Anthem Inc. was an insurance company which began in the 1980s as a spin-off of the group insurance operations of American General Insurance.
Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield was created as part of the merger of The Associated Group with Community Mutual Insurance Co. of Cincinnati.[9]
From its move to a publicly traded company in 2001 until its final merger in 2004, it merged the Blue Cross Blue Shield organizations of several states to achieve economy of scale, converting them in the process from non-profit to for-profit status. In late 2004, Anthem and WellPoint merged, with the combined company taking the WellPoint name. That Anthem no longer exists as a company, but the Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield brand name is used by WellPoint in 11 states.
In October 2001, Anthem demutualized and conducted an initial public offering of common stock. WellPoint, Inc. (formerly Anthem, Inc.) was formed when WellPoint Health Networks Inc. and Anthem, Inc. merged in 2004 to become the nation's leading health benefits company.
WellPoint Health Network Inc.'s predecessor was Blue Cross of California, which was founded in 1982 with the consolidation of Blue Cross of Northern California (established in 1936) and Blue Cross of Southern California (established in 1937). WellPoint was formed in 1992 to operate Blue Cross of California's managed care business. In 1993, Blue Cross of California spun off its managed care business into a separate publicly traded entity, WellPoint Health Networks Inc. In 1996, Blue Cross of California completed the conversion of all its business to for-profit status, resulting in a restructuring that designated WellPoint Health Networks Inc. as the parent organization. Anthem and WellPoint achieved a portion of this growth through mergers and acquisitions.
Wellpoint, Inc. was formed in November 2004 following a merger of Anthem and WellPoint Health Networks Inc.[5] The merger was structured as Anthem acquiring WellPoint Health Networks and rebranding itself WellPoint, Inc. When the deal was originally announced in October 2003, the merger was set at $16.5 billion.[10] The fair market value of the merger when completed in December 2004 was approximately $20.8 billion.[10] At the time of the merger's completion, WellPoint was the largest American insurer.[10]
In December 2014: WellPoint changed its corporate name to Anthem Inc..

Quality of care[edit]
In the category of "Meeting National Standards of Care" California's state patient advocacy office gave Anthem a rating of 2 out of 4 stars in its 2011 annual report card.[36] In 2014 it received 3 out of 4 stars in the same category.[37]
Controversies[edit]
Giving for uninsured[edit]
In 2007, WellPoint pledged to spend $30 million over three years, through the company's charitable foundation, to help the uninsured. In March 2010, the Los Angeles Times reported that WellPoint's tax records and website showed that the company gave only $6.2 million by 2009. The company disputed that, saying that the foundation did fulfill its $30-million commitment by mid-2009, but declined to provide any financial details to support its position.[38]
Policy cancellations[edit]
In 2007, the California Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC), a California state regulatory agency, investigated Anthem Blue Cross's policies for revoking (rescinding) health care insurance policies. The DMHC randomly selected 90 instances where Anthem Blue Cross canceled the insurance of policy holders who had been diagnosed with costly or life-threatening illnesses, to find how many of these cancellations were legal. The agency concluded that all these cancellations were illegal. "In all 90 files, there was no evidence [that Blue Cross], before rescinding coverage, investigated or established that the applicant's omission/misrepresentation was willful," the DMHC report said.[39][40]
In July 2008, Anthem Blue Cross agreed to a settlement with the California Department of Managed Health Care. To resolve allegations of improper policy rescissions (cancellations), WellPoint paid $10 million and reinstated 1,770 policy-holders whose plans they had cancelled. They also agreed to provide compensation for any medical debts incurred by these policy-holders in the meantime. However, WellPoint did not officially admit liability.
In April 2010, a report in Reuters alleged that Wellpoint "using a computer algorithm, identified women recently diagnosed with breast cancer and then singled them out for cancellation of their policies."[41][42] The story not only caused considerable public outrage, but led Secretary of Health and Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius, and President Barack Obama, to call on WellPoint to end the practice.[43]
In 2011 Anthem Blue Cross began cancelling policies of members who had been paying premiums with credit cards, sometimes without calling or emailing the member ahead of time.[44]
Opposition to health care reform[edit]
The former Vice President for Public Policy and External Affairs at WellPoint, Elizabeth Fowler, is the Senior Counsel to Max Baucus, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and a leading opponent of the public option in health care reform.[45]
In August 2009, WellPoint’s Anthem Blue Cross unit, the largest for-profit insurer in California, contacted its employees and urged them to get involved to oppose Congress' plan for health care reform. Consumer Watchdog, a nonprofit watchdog organization in Santa Monica, asked California Atty. Gen. Jerry Brown to investigate its claim that WellPoint had illegally pushed workers to write to their elected officials, attend town hall meetings and enlist family and friends to ensure an overhaul that matches the firm’s interests. According to Consumer Watchdog, California's labor code directly prohibits coercive communications, including forbidding employers from controlling, coercing or influencing employees' political activities or affiliations. WellPoint had not been contacted by the California attorney general and had not seen any complaint.[46]
Through 2010 and into 2011, WellPoint senior executives met monthly with executives of other major health insurers to blunt the effect of the health care reform law.[47]
2009 premium increase in Maine[edit]
In 2009, Anthem Health Plans of Maine, a WellPoint subsidiary, sued the state of Maine for the right to increase premiums further.[48] Since Maine licenses insurance companies through its Department of Insurance, Anthem would need the state's permission to raise rates.[49] The Court disagreed with Anthem and found that, unlike other forms of insurance, the Maine Insurance Code does not require the Superintendent to consider profits at all.[50]
2010 premium increase in California[edit]
In February 2010, WellPoint announced that some Anthem Blue Cross individual policies in California would see a rate increase as high as 39%. This announcement resulted in an investigation by the US Federal and California government regulators.[13] Because of this, Anthem Blue Cross gained worldwide media attention and became a poster child for the problem of rising US health costs, when it announced that it was raising rates on some individual policy holders by as much as 39% as of March 2010.[13] The rate increase came one year after Anthem had raised rates 68% on individual policy holders.[51] This announcement resulted in an investigation by the US Federal and California government regulators.[13]
To explain the latest rate increases, some which were four times the rate of medical inflation, Anthem said the company has experienced a death spiral, as unemployment and declining wages led healthy customers to drop their insurance, the remaining risk pool becomes sicker and more expensive to insure, and, in turn, prices are forced up and push more people out of the market.[52]
In response to the outrage from politicians and consumers, Anthem postponed the rate increase until May 1, 2010.[53] Given Anthem’s rate increase plans, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democratic Senator of California, has proposed giving the federal government authority to block insurance premium hikes considered to be "unjustified".[54]
Reclassifying expenses[edit]
On 17 March 2010, WellPoint announced it was reclassifying some of its administrative costs as medical care costs in order to meet new loss ratio requirements under the health care law, which requires insurers to spend at least 80% or 85% of customer premiums on health care services, depending on the type of plan.[55]
2009-10 security breach[edit]
In June 2010, Anthem sent letters to 230,000 customers in California warning them that their personal data might have been accessed online. After a routine upgrade in October 2009, a third-party vendor stated that all security measures had been properly reinstated, when in fact they had not. As a result, personal information of thousands of coverage applicants who were under the age of 65 was exposed in the open. After a Los Angeles-area woman found that her application for coverage was publicly available, she filed a class-action lawsuit against Anthem. While gathering evidence for the proceeding, the woman's lawyers downloaded some confidential customer information from Anthem's website and alerted Anthem about the breach. According to the lawyers, confidential information had remained out in the open for five months.[56][57]
Denying benefits[edit]
In May 2014, Anthem Blue Cross refused to pay for the hospitalization of a Sonoma County, California man for stage four cancers, although he had paid Anthem over $100,000.00 in premiums.[58][59] Anthem ended up paying for coverage following public outcry.[60]
2015 medical data breach[edit]
Main article: Anthem medical data breach
On February 4, 2015, Anthem, Inc. disclosed that criminal hackers had broken into its servers and potentially stolen over 37.5 million records that contain personally identifiable information from its servers. According to Anthem, Inc., the data breach extended into multiple brands Anthem, Inc. uses to market its healthcare plans, including, Anthem Blue Cross, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia, Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Amerigroup, Caremore, and UniCare.[61] Healthlink says it was also a victim.[62] Anthem says the medical information and financial data was not compromised. Anthem has offered free credit monitoring in the wake of the breach.[63] According to Bloomberg News, China may be responsible for this data breach. Michael Daniel, chief adviser on cybersecurity for President Barack Obama, said he would be changing his own password.[64] According to The New York Times about 80 million company records were hacked, and there is fear that the stolen data will be used for identity theft.[65] On February 7, 2015 Elizabeth Weise wrote in USA Today that the compromised information contained names, birthdays, medical IDs, social security numbers, street addresses, e-mail addresses and employment information, including income data.[66]

Finding the Right Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield Plan
Today, most people get their health insurance through their work. But every year, more and people are choosing to shop in the private market for individual health insurance.
For some individuals and families, there are some key advantages to individual health insurance over employer health coverage — such as affordability, portability and customization.
Whether you’re a single individual, you have a family, you’re self-employed, you’re a student or you’re just looking for the best health insurance plan for your needs, you might want to consider an individual health insurance policy.
Right here, you can compare individual health quotes online instantly and get advice from a licensed health insurance agent in your area. Start with the form above to get your free individual health insurance quotes and life insurance quotes now.
Types of Individual Health Insurance
Many health insurance shoppers don’t realize that there are many different types of health insurance. But it’s a good thing there are so many options because no one has the exact same health and budget needs as another.
There are two main kinds of individual health plans: managed care and traditional indemnity coverage:

Managed care health insurance. This type of health insurance covers medical services from a specific network of doctors, hospitals and other health care providers. Common managed care plans include HMO (Health Maintenance Organization) plans, PPO (Preferred Provider Organization) plans and POS (Point of Service) health plans. With managed care plans, some policyholders can also open Health Savings Accounts (HSA) to save money tax-free for medical bills.
Traditional indemnity coverage. Before managed care plans were created, traditional indemnity health insurance was the most common form of coverage. This type of health insurance covers medical care based on service rather than health care provider.

The main difference between these two forms of health insurance is that traditional indemnity plans provide the same coverage regardless of what doctor or hospital you visit, while managed care only covers care from particular health care professionals.
Comparing Plans from Multiple Health Insurance Companies
One of the biggest advantages individual health insurance has over employer coverage is the immense number of choices. With an employer, you might only have one or two plans to choose from. Not in the individual market — it offers hundreds of different options, each with varying benefits and rates.
With our service here at IndividualHealthQuotes.com, you’ll be able to compare multiple plan options from many health insurance companies. The agents in our network represent dozens of insurers including Aetna, Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield, Assurant, Golden Rule Insurance Company, many Blue Cross and Blue Shield Companies, Time, PacifiCare, World Insurance, Humana, Mega Life and Health, Kaiser Permanente, Unicare, Vista Health Plans and more.
Each insurance company offers unique health insurance solutions, giving you a wealth of options to choose.
Keep in mind that each state has its own set of health insurance regulations and not every insurance company offers plans nationwide.
Get Your Free Individual Health Quotes
When you’re ready to compare plans instantly from multiple carriers, just use our free service to view individual health insurance quotes instantly and speak with local health insurance agents for expert advice.
With our service, you’ll also be able to securely submit an online application for coverage directly to your preferred health insurance company. 
Your individual health insurance quotes are always safe, secure and 100 percent risk-free. You never have any obligation to purchase a health plan and you can cancel your application at any time.
