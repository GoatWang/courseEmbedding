T. Rowe Price mutual funds are subject to ongoing management fees and may be subject to redemption fees. An IRA may be subject to an annual fee, and a fee may be assessed when an IRA is closed. See prospectus for details.

The mutual funds referred to in this website are offered and sold only to persons residing in the United States and are offered by prospectus only. The prospectuses include investment objectives, risks, fees, expenses, and other information that you should read and consider carefully before investing.
Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 5/31/17, 72 of 106 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

*144 of our 330 mutual funds had a 10-year track record as of 3/31/17 (includes all share classes and excludes funds used in insurance products). 122 of these 144 funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 204 of 311 (66%), 175 of 213, 140 of 178 (79%), of T. Rowe Price funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 3/31/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
24 of our 39 Retirement Funds had a 10-year track record as of 3/31/17 (includes all share classes). 23 of these 24 funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 38 of 39, 35 of 36, and 35 of 36 of the Retirement Funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 3/31/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
Source: Lipper Inc. 168 of 213 funds (excluding institutional and bank institutional funds as defined by Lipper) more than 6 months old had expense ratios below their Lipper averages based on fiscal year-end data available as of 3/31/17.
The principal value of the Retirement Funds is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The funds’ allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term postretirement withdrawal horizon. The funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The funds maintain a substantial allocation to equities both prior to and after the target date, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.

*Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 5/31/17, 72 of 106 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.

**This chart displays relative risk of each U.S. mutual fund listed using standard deviation of returns. Those values are provided in the bars at the top of the chart.
Methodology: We evaluate the standard deviation and its resulting placement within a specific risk/return category on an annual basis. A fund is generally placed in a risk/return category based on the 10-year standard deviation of its performance. If a fund is less than 10 years old, the actual fund performance history is supplemented with the primary prospectus benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years. For an Asset Allocation fund with less than 10 years of performance history, sub-strategy returns are used. When a sub-strategy is less than 10 years old, the actual sub-strategy performance history is supplemented with benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years.
Risk return categories overlap; a fund with a standard deviation in the overlap between two categories, denoted by a plus (+), is placed so that its risk categorization is better aligned with anticipated return characteristics an investor may experience going forward at the discretion of T Rowe Price.
When a fund has a cash-like benchmark, denoted by a double plus (++), its standard deviation is estimated using only available fund returns. If the fund is less than 10 years old, benchmark returns are not used to obtain a full 10-year history because they would artificially suppress the volatility estimate.
All investments are subject to market risk, including the possible loss of principal. Standard deviation of returns, a measure of price volatility, is one measure of risk. Please consult the funds’ prospectuses for a more complete discussion of the funds’ risks.

Taxable when withdrawn and generally subject to penalties if withdrawn before age 59½.

Age restrictions
None.  
Must be under age 70½ during the tax year of the contribution.

Eligibility
May contribute only if, depending on filing status, MAGI does not exceed certain amounts. You must have US earned income.

Why T. Rowe Price for a Roth or Traditional IRA?

You need to maximize your return potential, so we work to keep our fees competitive. That's why our solutions include no-load mutual funds with low expense ratios.

All investments involve risk, including possible loss of principal. Diversification cannot assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market.
Retirement savers should consider their financial situation, time horizon, and risk tolerance before making an investment decision. Also, retirement savers may want to consult a tax advisor before selecting a tax-advantaged account.

T. Rowe Price mutual funds are subject to ongoing management fees and may be subject to redemption fees. An IRA may be subject to an annual fee, and a fee may be assessed when an IRA is closed. See prospectus for details.

The mutual funds referred to in this website are offered and sold only to persons residing in the United States and are offered by prospectus only. The prospectuses include investment objectives, risks, fees, expenses, and other information that you should read and consider carefully before investing.
Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 5/31/17, 72 of 106 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

*144 of our 330 mutual funds had a 10-year track record as of 3/31/17 (includes all share classes and excludes funds used in insurance products). 122 of these 144 funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 204 of 311 (66%), 175 of 213, 140 of 178 (79%), of T. Rowe Price funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 3/31/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
24 of our 39 Retirement Funds had a 10-year track record as of 3/31/17 (includes all share classes). 23 of these 24 funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 38 of 39, 35 of 36, and 35 of 36 of the Retirement Funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 3/31/17, respectively.

Source: Lipper Inc. 168 of 213 funds (excluding institutional and bank institutional funds as defined by Lipper) more than 6 months old had expense ratios below their Lipper averages based on fiscal year-end data available as of 3/31/17.
The principal value of the Retirement Funds is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The funds’ allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term postretirement withdrawal horizon. The funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The funds maintain a substantial allocation to equities both prior to and after the target date, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.

*The principal value of the Retirement Funds and Target Funds (collectively, the "target date funds") is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date.

The target date funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The key difference between the Retirement Funds and the Target Funds is the overall allocation to equity; although they each maintain significant allocations to equities both prior to and after the target date, the Retirement Funds maintain a higher equity allocation, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.

Philosophy[edit]
Thomas Rowe Price Jr. started in finance in the 1920s as an entry-level researcher and account manager at Baltimore-area brokerages. He found that he liked the challenges imposed by investing nearly as much as he disliked the common practices of sales-oriented brokerages at the time. So, in 1937, he founded a firm that went against that grain in three major ways: charging fees based on assets under management rather than sales volume, actively managing his clients' accounts strictly as a fiduciary, and investing in growth stocks instead of value stocks. This approach, which emphasized "discipline, process consistency, and fundamental research," garnered success for the firm and its namesake, who became well known as the "father of growth investing" and was nicknamed the "Sage of Baltimore" by Forbes.[3][4] The firm has diversified its products and methodology, but hews closely to the original values upon which it was founded.[1][5]
History[edit]
1937-1986[edit]
Thomas Rowe Price, Jr. founded T. Rowe Price & Associates in Baltimore in 1937. The firm was originally headquartered at 10 Light Street and staffed by a small pool of associates, many of whom left Legg Mason's precursor, MacKubin, Legg and Co. along with Mr. Price.[6] Initially a very small firm focused on wealth management and private investing accounts for Baltimore-area families, the company struggled through the financial turbulence of the Great Depression and World War II before gaining solid footing at the end of the 1940s. By 1950, its clientele grew too large for the staff to manage accounts individually, so the firm incorporated and launched its first mutual fund, the T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund.[3][7]




100 East Pratt Street


Gaining traction in Baltimore and along the U.S. eastern seaboard, the firm continued a steady expansion of clientele, staff, and geographic reach. By 1960, Mr. Price felt the need to open a second fund, named the New Horizons Fund, focused on growth investment opportunities, and especially technological firms like Xerox, IBM, and Boeing.[7] In need of more room, headquarters were moved in 1962 to the new One Charles Center building designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe nearby in downtown Baltimore.[8] At this same juncture, Mr. Price began to prepare for retirement, resigning as president of the firm in 1963, delegating some responsibilities, and selling his shares in the company.[7] Despite this, Mr. Price maintained an active presence in the firm for several years, and urged the opening of the New Era Fund in 1969 as a response to the rapid inflation he predicted would dominate the 1970s.[9] In 1971, the year Mr. Price completely retired, T. Rowe Price opened its Fixed Income Division, and began to modernize and diversify its operations.
In the 1970s and early 1980s, T. Rowe Price kicked off more assertive growth than before, moving to its current location at 100 East Pratt Street and opening its first international office. In 1979, T. Rowe Price launched a joint venture with British asset manager Robert Fleming & Co. named Rowe Price-Fleming International. The venture, which managed $39 billion at its height in 2000, allowed T. Rowe Price to offer a broader range of services and expertise internationally.[10]
1986-present[edit]
T. Rowe Price held its initial public offering, valued at nearly $200 million dollars, in 1986.[11] Shortly thereafter, the firm began establishing larger office complexes in the U.S. and research offices around the world, beginning with a Hong Kong office in 1987. Retirement Plan Services were launched in the 1990s alongside additional new services and funds, including mutual funds acquired from other companies such as USF&G.[12] This momentum, and the firm reaching $100 billion assets under management, pushed T. Rowe Price to create an asset management partnership with Sumitomo Bank and Daiwa Securities in Tokyo in 1999, and to purchase 100% interest of the London-based Rowe Price-Fleming International, which was renamed T. Rowe Price International.[7] Also in 1999, T. Rowe Price was added to the S&P 500 Index.[13][14]
On the strength of its ethic of risk aversion, fundamental research, and active management approach, T. Rowe Price somewhat predicted and largely avoided the dot-com bubble of 2000. Its ethic of caution was so different from the norm at the time that The Wall Street Journal expressed surprise at its non-speculation on profitable technology stocks just a week before the markets began to crash in March 2000.[15] In 2001, the company launched T. Rowe Price Funds SICAV, domiciled in Luxembourg, for non-U.S. institutional investors and financial intermediaries. Two years later it created target-date retirement funds.[16] In 2010, T. Rowe Price bought a significant interest in Unit Trust of India, India's oldest mutual fund company and one of its five largest.[17] Since 2000, T. Rowe Price has opened global offices in locations ranging from Madrid and Dubai to Stockholm and Sydney.[18]

Philosophy[edit]
Thomas Rowe Price Jr. started in finance in the 1920s as an entry-level researcher and account manager at Baltimore-area brokerages. He found that he liked the challenges imposed by investing nearly as much as he disliked the common practices of sales-oriented brokerages at the time. So, in 1937, he founded a firm that went against that grain in three major ways: charging fees based on assets under management rather than sales volume, actively managing his clients' accounts strictly as a fiduciary, and investing in growth stocks instead of value stocks. This approach, which emphasized "discipline, process consistency, and fundamental research," garnered success for the firm and its namesake, who became well known as the "father of growth investing" and was nicknamed the "Sage of Baltimore" by Forbes.[3][4] The firm has diversified its products and methodology, but hews closely to the original values upon which it was founded.[1][5]
History[edit]
1937-1986[edit]
Thomas Rowe Price, Jr. founded T. Rowe Price & Associates in Baltimore in 1937. The firm was originally headquartered at 10 Light Street and staffed by a small pool of associates, many of whom left Legg Mason's precursor, MacKubin, Legg and Co. along with Mr. Price.[6] Initially a very small firm focused on wealth management and private investing accounts for Baltimore-area families, the company struggled through the financial turbulence of the Great Depression and World War II before gaining solid footing at the end of the 1940s. By 1950, its clientele grew too large for the staff to manage accounts individually, so the firm incorporated and launched its first mutual fund, the T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund.[3][7]




100 East Pratt Street


Gaining traction in Baltimore and along the U.S. eastern seaboard, the firm continued a steady expansion of clientele, staff, and geographic reach. By 1960, Mr. Price felt the need to open a second fund, named the New Horizons Fund, focused on growth investment opportunities, and especially technological firms like Xerox, IBM, and Boeing.[7] In need of more room, headquarters were moved in 1962 to the new One Charles Center building designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe nearby in downtown Baltimore.[8] At this same juncture, Mr. Price began to prepare for retirement, resigning as president of the firm in 1963, delegating some responsibilities, and selling his shares in the company.[7] Despite this, Mr. Price maintained an active presence in the firm for several years, and urged the opening of the New Era Fund in 1969 as a response to the rapid inflation he predicted would dominate the 1970s.[9] In 1971, the year Mr. Price completely retired, T. Rowe Price opened its Fixed Income Division, and began to modernize and diversify its operations.
In the 1970s and early 1980s, T. Rowe Price kicked off more assertive growth than before, moving to its current location at 100 East Pratt Street and opening its first international office. In 1979, T. Rowe Price launched a joint venture with British asset manager Robert Fleming & Co. named Rowe Price-Fleming International. The venture, which managed $39 billion at its height in 2000, allowed T. Rowe Price to offer a broader range of services and expertise internationally.[10]
1986-present[edit]
T. Rowe Price held its initial public offering, valued at nearly $200 million dollars, in 1986.[11] Shortly thereafter, the firm began establishing larger office complexes in the U.S. and research offices around the world, beginning with a Hong Kong office in 1987. Retirement Plan Services were launched in the 1990s alongside additional new services and funds, including mutual funds acquired from other companies such as USF&G.[12] This momentum, and the firm reaching $100 billion assets under management, pushed T. Rowe Price to create an asset management partnership with Sumitomo Bank and Daiwa Securities in Tokyo in 1999, and to purchase 100% interest of the London-based Rowe Price-Fleming International, which was renamed T. Rowe Price International.[7] Also in 1999, T. Rowe Price was added to the S&P 500 Index.[13][14]
On the strength of its ethic of risk aversion, fundamental research, and active management approach, T. Rowe Price somewhat predicted and largely avoided the dot-com bubble of 2000. Its ethic of caution was so different from the norm at the time that The Wall Street Journal expressed surprise at its non-speculation on profitable technology stocks just a week before the markets began to crash in March 2000.[15] In 2001, the company launched T. Rowe Price Funds SICAV, domiciled in Luxembourg, for non-U.S. institutional investors and financial intermediaries. Two years later it created target-date retirement funds.[16] In 2010, T. Rowe Price bought a significant interest in Unit Trust of India, India's oldest mutual fund company and one of its five largest.[17] Since 2000, T. Rowe Price has opened global offices in locations ranging from Madrid and Dubai to Stockholm and Sydney.[18]

Rowe Price bought a significant interest in Unit Trust of India, India's oldest mutual fund company and one of its five largest.[17] Since 2000, T. Rowe Price has opened global offices in locations ranging from Madrid and Dubai to Stockholm and Sydney.[18]

Philosophy[edit]
Thomas Rowe Price Jr. started in finance in the 1920s as an entry-level researcher and account manager at Baltimore-area brokerages. He found that he liked the challenges imposed by investing nearly as much as he disliked the common practices of sales-oriented brokerages at the time. So, in 1937, he founded a firm that went against that grain in three major ways: charging fees based on assets under management rather than sales volume, actively managing his clients' accounts strictly as a fiduciary, and investing in growth stocks instead of value stocks. This approach, which emphasized "discipline, process consistency, and fundamental research," garnered success for the firm and its namesake, who became well known as the "father of growth investing" and was nicknamed the "Sage of Baltimore" by Forbes.[3][4] The firm has diversified its products and methodology, but hews closely to the original values upon which it was founded.[1][5]
History[edit]
1937-1986[edit]
Thomas Rowe Price, Jr. founded T. Rowe Price & Associates in Baltimore in 1937. The firm was originally headquartered at 10 Light Street and staffed by a small pool of associates, many of whom left Legg Mason's precursor, MacKubin, Legg and Co. along with Mr. Price.[6] Initially a very small firm focused on wealth management and private investing accounts for Baltimore-area families, the company struggled through the financial turbulence of the Great Depression and World War II before gaining solid footing at the end of the 1940s. By 1950, its clientele grew too large for the staff to manage accounts individually, so the firm incorporated and launched its first mutual fund, the T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund.[3][7]




100 East Pratt Street


Gaining traction in Baltimore and along the U.S. eastern seaboard, the firm continued a steady expansion of clientele, staff, and geographic reach. By 1960, Mr. Price felt the need to open a second fund, named the New Horizons Fund, focused on growth investment opportunities, and especially technological firms like Xerox, IBM, and Boeing.[7] In need of more room, headquarters were moved in 1962 to the new One Charles Center building designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe nearby in downtown Baltimore.[8] At this same juncture, Mr. Price began to prepare for retirement, resigning as president of the firm in 1963, delegating some responsibilities, and selling his shares in the company.[7] Despite this, Mr. Price maintained an active presence in the firm for several years, and urged the opening of the New Era Fund in 1969 as a response to the rapid inflation he predicted would dominate the 1970s.[9] In 1971, the year Mr. Price completely retired, T. Rowe Price opened its Fixed Income Division, and began to modernize and diversify its operations.
In the 1970s and early 1980s, T. Rowe Price kicked off more assertive growth than before, moving to its current location at 100 East Pratt Street and opening its first international office. In 1979, T. Rowe Price launched a joint venture with British asset manager Robert Fleming & Co. named Rowe Price-Fleming International. The venture, which managed $39 billion at its height in 2000, allowed T. Rowe Price to offer a broader range of services and expertise internationally.[10]
1986-present[edit]
T. Rowe Price held its initial public offering, valued at nearly $200 million dollars, in 1986.[11] Shortly thereafter, the firm began establishing larger office complexes in the U.S. and research offices around the world, beginning with a Hong Kong office in 1987. Retirement Plan Services were launched in the 1990s alongside additional new services and funds, including mutual funds acquired from other companies such as USF&G.[12] This momentum, and the firm reaching $100 billion assets under management, pushed T. Rowe Price to create an asset management partnership with Sumitomo Bank and Daiwa Securities in Tokyo in 1999, and to purchase 100% interest of the London-based Rowe Price-Fleming International, which was renamed T. Rowe Price International.[7] Also in 1999, T. Rowe Price was added to the S&P 500 Index.[13][14]
On the strength of its ethic of risk aversion, fundamental research, and active management approach, T. Rowe Price somewhat predicted and largely avoided the dot-com bubble of 2000. Its ethic of caution was so different from the norm at the time that The Wall Street Journal expressed surprise at its non-speculation on profitable technology stocks just a week before the markets began to crash in March 2000.[15] In 2001, the company launched T. Rowe Price Funds SICAV, domiciled in Luxembourg, for non-U.S. institutional investors and financial intermediaries. Two years later it created target-date retirement funds.[16] In 2010, T. Rowe Price bought a significant interest in Unit Trust of India, India's oldest mutual fund company and one of its five largest.[17] Since 2000, T. Rowe Price has opened global offices in locations ranging from Madrid and Dubai to Stockholm and Sydney.[18]

Philosophy[edit]
Thomas Rowe Price Jr. started in finance in the 1920s as an entry-level researcher and account manager at Baltimore-area brokerages. He found that he liked the challenges imposed by investing nearly as much as he disliked the common practices of sales-oriented brokerages at the time. So, in 1937, he founded a firm that went against that grain in three major ways: charging fees based on assets under management rather than sales volume, actively managing his clients' accounts strictly as a fiduciary, and investing in growth stocks instead of value stocks. This approach, which emphasized "discipline, process consistency, and fundamental research," garnered success for the firm and its namesake, who became well known as the "father of growth investing" and was nicknamed the "Sage of Baltimore" by Forbes.[3][4] The firm has diversified its products and methodology, but hews closely to the original values upon which it was founded.[1][5]
History[edit]
1937-1986[edit]
Thomas Rowe Price, Jr. founded T. Rowe Price & Associates in Baltimore in 1937. The firm was originally headquartered at 10 Light Street and staffed by a small pool of associates, many of whom left Legg Mason's precursor, MacKubin, Legg and Co. along with Mr. Price.[6] Initially a very small firm focused on wealth management and private investing accounts for Baltimore-area families, the company struggled through the financial turbulence of the Great Depression and World War II before gaining solid footing at the end of the 1940s. By 1950, its clientele grew too large for the staff to manage accounts individually, so the firm incorporated and launched its first mutual fund, the T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund.[3][7]




100 East Pratt Street


Gaining traction in Baltimore and along the U.S. eastern seaboard, the firm continued a steady expansion of clientele, staff, and geographic reach. By 1960, Mr. Price felt the need to open a second fund, named the New Horizons Fund, focused on growth investment opportunities, and especially technological firms like Xerox, IBM, and Boeing.[7] In need of more room, headquarters were moved in 1962 to the new One Charles Center building designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe nearby in downtown Baltimore.[8] At this same juncture, Mr. Price began to prepare for retirement, resigning as president of the firm in 1963, delegating some responsibilities, and selling his shares in the company.[7] Despite this, Mr. Price maintained an active presence in the firm for several years, and urged the opening of the New Era Fund in 1969 as a response to the rapid inflation he predicted would dominate the 1970s.[9] In 1971, the year Mr. Price completely retired, T. Rowe Price opened its Fixed Income Division, and began to modernize and diversify its operations.
In the 1970s and early 1980s, T. Rowe Price kicked off more assertive growth than before, moving to its current location at 100 East Pratt Street and opening its first international office. In 1979, T. Rowe Price launched a joint venture with British asset manager Robert Fleming & Co. named Rowe Price-Fleming International. The venture, which managed $39 billion at its height in 2000, allowed T. Rowe Price to offer a broader range of services and expertise internationally.[10]
1986-present[edit]
T. Rowe Price held its initial public offering, valued at nearly $200 million dollars, in 1986.[11] Shortly thereafter, the firm began establishing larger office complexes in the U.S. and research offices around the world, beginning with a Hong Kong office in 1987. Retirement Plan Services were launched in the 1990s alongside additional new services and funds, including mutual funds acquired from other companies such as USF&G.[12] This momentum, and the firm reaching $100 billion assets under management, pushed T. Rowe Price to create an asset management partnership with Sumitomo Bank and Daiwa Securities in Tokyo in 1999, and to purchase 100% interest of the London-based Rowe Price-Fleming International, which was renamed T. Rowe Price International.[7] Also in 1999, T. Rowe Price was added to the S&P 500 Index.[13][14]
On the strength of its ethic of risk aversion, fundamental research, and active management approach, T. Rowe Price somewhat predicted and largely avoided the dot-com bubble of 2000. Its ethic of caution was so different from the norm at the time that The Wall Street Journal expressed surprise at its non-speculation on profitable technology stocks just a week before the markets began to crash in March 2000.[15] In 2001, the company launched T. Rowe Price Funds SICAV, domiciled in Luxembourg, for non-U.S. institutional investors and financial intermediaries. Two years later it created target-date retirement funds.[16] In 2010, T. Rowe Price bought a significant interest in Unit Trust of India, India's oldest mutual fund company and one of its five largest.[17] Since 2000, T. Rowe Price has opened global offices in locations ranging from Madrid and Dubai to Stockholm and Sydney.[18]

William Stromberg is ready to take on the naysayers.
Even as investors continue to abandon actively managed mutual funds, the chief executive of T. Rowe Price Group is doubling down on stock picking. Stromberg, armed with a record that shows that the majority of the company's funds outperform indexes even after charging higher fees, is taking steps from bolstering advertising to adding new products to lure clients.





"Over a market cycle, we'll put up our results against passive any day of the week," Stromberg said in an interview.
Stromberg is doing more than boast. He plans to expand the Baltimore-based firm's distribution outside the U.S., create funds that invest in multiple asset classes and add data scientists to supplement the fundamental research the company has relied on for 80 years.
Challenging indexers will be a mighty effort. Investors have pulled $444 billion from funds run by stock pickers in the last 17 months while adding about $575 billion to mutual and exchange-traded funds tracking indexes.
"T. Rowe Price is a fine organization, but the forces of nature are lined up against them," said Michael Rosen, chief investment officer of Angeles Investment Advisors in Los Angeles, which oversees about $25 billion in passive and active strategies. "I'm not sure the argument will resonate."
T. Rowe Price hasn't been immune from the shift to indexing. The company had $2.8 billion in net redemptions in 2016 after two years of modest inflows. Over the past five years the firm attracted a total of $7.7 billion in deposits. To put that in perspective, Vanguard Group, known for its low-cost index products, has gathered about that much money each week this year. T. Rowe Price shares rose 9.6 percent over the past 12 months as of June 27 compared with a gain of 39 percent for the S&P index of asset managers and custody banks.
The company is vulnerable to further outflows and will have to spend more money "just to tread water, much less grow," UBS analyst Brennan Hawken said in a May report in which he cut the rating on the stock to sell.
Stromberg thinks the firm's record versus passive as well as larger rivals is a big advantage. On average, T. Rowe's stock funds beat 75 percent of peers over the past decade, compared with 63 percent for Capital Group and 51 percent for Fidelity Investments, according to data compiled by Morningstar Inc. Fidelity and Capital Group, both known for their equity funds, manage $2.3 trillion and $1.5 trillion, respectively.
T. Rowe has specialized in picking stocks since it was founded in 1937 by Thomas Rowe Price Jr., an investor who favored growth companies. The firm still emphasizes fundamental research and hires money managers who often spend their whole careers there.
Stromberg, 57, once a star football player for Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, fits that profile. He has been at the company for 30 years -- as an analyst, portfolio manager and executive.
In a 2016 study, the company found that a majority of its 18 U.S. equity strategies beat their index benchmarks across multiple time periods over 20 years. Some of the funds topped their benchmarks by a wide margin.
The firm's biggest fund, the $51 billion T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund, beat the S&P 500 Index over five years and 10 years. The $20 billion New Horizons Fund beat the Russell 2000 Growth Index by roughly 4 percentage points a year over 20 years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The $28 billion Mid-Cap Growth Fund exceeded its benchmark by 3 percentage points a year over the same period.
T. Rowe Price's "consistently solid investment performance and reasonable fees" are an important competitive advantage, Greggory Warren, who follows asset managers for Morningstar, said in a March research note.
Most of the firm's biggest stock funds charge between 70 and 80 cents per $100 invested. Many index funds and ETFs charge about 5 cents. Making an analogy between mutual funds and hotels, Robert Sharps, T. Rowe Price's co-head of global equities, said, "If we can deliver a better experience, we should be able to charge a higher price." Performance is calculated net of fees.
New spending initiatives are aimed at making T. Rowe Price more competitive and attracting flows. By beefing up its distribution in Europe, the company is hoping to tap into a bigger pool of investors. Currently only 5 percent of assets come from outside the U.S.
The new products will focus on providing income using a mix of asset classes, said Stromberg. One fund, which opened this week, is a variation on T. Rowe Price's target-date retirement series. Called Retirement Income 2020, it will allow investors to receive regular monthly distributions after they retire.
Like other money managers, including BlackRock Inc. and Tudor Investment Corp., the hedge fund run by Paul Tudor Jones, T. Rowe Price believes it needs to improve its technology skills to keep up with competitors. Its technology center, which opened this year in New York, expects to have 50 to 60 people with expertise in fields such as big data and machine learning.
"This isn't a replacement for fundamental research," said Nigel Faulkner, head of technology, who joined in 2015 from Credit Suisse Group. "We want to use technology to find alpha," or outperformance.
Another area slated for a 10 percent spending hike this year is advertising and promotion.
"We've been a quiet firm," said Stromberg. "Our feeling was that if we deliver terrific results that would carry the day."
With the advocates for passive investing pressing their case so forcefully, said Stromberg, it may be time for T. Rowe Price to raise its voice.
"We may have to be more active in defense of active management," he said.

	T. Rowe Price Investor Day • February 2, 2017 1
 T. ROWE PRICE 
OVERVIEW
 February 2, 2017
 William J. Stromberg
 President and CEO
 T. Rowe Price Investor Day
 Welcome everyone, and thank you for coming today. 
 We are here to provide an update on T. Rowe Price and our strategic priorities. 
̶ From August 2015 through June 2016, we conducted a thorough strategic review of our 
business, and we developed a detailed plan to diversify and grow our business despite the many 
headwinds that we and our industry are currently facing.
 ̶ We are choosing to invest in our business in three general areas to strengthen our competitive 
advantages: (1) products – especially multi-asset, (2) distribution, and (3) technology.
 ̶ We believe that these investments are essential to our long-term success. We recognize that 
they raise our expenses and impact our operating profit margins in the near term – but we think 
these are the right investments to make and that the payoff will be worth it.
  A second purpose of today’s meeting is to introduce you to four leaders who helped develop our plan 
and who lead important businesses within T. Rowe Price. Each is an industry veteran and a strong 
leader, and each is committed to our long-term business success.
  A third reason for hosting this meeting today is to fulfill our commitment to you to provide more 
transparency into our business. We want you to understand what we are investing in and why we 
think we will be successful.

Population

 The marketplace is evolving quickly
  Aging population is shifting demand from equities to income-oriented solutions.
  Intermediaries demanding new vehicles to better meet clients’ needs, and they are paring their 
investment platforms to include only the most capable asset managers.
  Digital technology is reshaping client engagement.
  Regulatory change is accelerating across our business and shining a light on fees and poor 
performers.
  Most importantly, passive and alternative investments are taking significant share from active asset 
managers.
  We get it – and our strategic initiatives reflect our response to these challenges. You’ll hear more 
about these initiatives later in this presentation.

 T. Rowe Price Future Vision
 10
 We Are Executing on a Longer-Term Plan
  Premier active asset manager
  Integrated investment solutions provider 
 Global partner for retirement-oriented investors 
 More globally diversified asset manager 
 Destination of choice for top talent
  More agile company
  Strong financial results and balance sheet
 10
  Maintain our position as a premier active asset manager, creating durable value for clients.
  Become more of an integrated investment solutions provider that leverages our diversified 
investment management and asset allocation capabilities to meet changing client needs. 
 Become a more recognized global partner for retirement-oriented investors (individuals, DC plan 
sponsors, or employers with DB liabilities). 
 Build T. Rowe Price into a more globally diversified asset manager that sources an increasing 
share of AUM from outside the U.S. while still growing our U.S. franchise. 
 Remain a destination of choice for top talent including and beyond our investment teams, with a 
culture of accountability, empowerment, and rigor. 
 Become a more agile company that stays ahead of and capitalizes on disruptions. 
 Deliver attractive financial results and balance sheet strength for our stockholders over the long-
 term.
 In our pursuit of our short- and long-term goals, we believe it is imperative to sustain our client-centric, 
collaborative culture, and reputation for excellence and integrity.

 Active Management Beliefs
 We believe that active and passive will coexist and complement each 
other. Given the need for returns around the world, we believe there 
will always be demand for good active management.
 We also believe that certain characteristics of active firms increase 
their odds of outperforming passive options:
  Firms with high integrity and significant financial strength
  Firms with an intense focus on people, investment process, and culture
  Firms with below-average fees and long-term horizons.

 Active Management Is Hard, We’ve Consistently Done It Well
 T. Rowe Price has performed consistently well versus benchmarks, 
across broad product offerings, over the long term — including our 
important U.S. equity and target date offerings: 
U.S. Equity: 
Over the last 20 years, 75% of active T. Rowe Price diversified funds (18 funds studied) 
outperformed their designated benchmarks in more than 80% of the rolling 10-year periods.1
 Target Date Mutual Funds: 
Since inception of each Retirement Fund in the series, 100% of the funds (9 funds studied) 
have outperformed their designated benchmarks in 100% of the rolling 10-year periods.2
 12
 Past performance is no guarantee of future results. 
1For a more detailed discussion of results and methodology see, “Long-Term Benefits of the T. Rowe Price Approach to Active Management 
(April 2016).” All performance is as of 12/31/2015.
 2For a more detailed discussion of results and methodology see, “Target Date Strategies: The Benefits of the T. Rowe Price Approach 
(January 2017).” All performance is as of 12/31/2015.

  Assume average market conditions
  Baseline net expense growth of ~4% off of 2016 expense level supports existing investments
  Over next three years, new investment split roughly 1/3 each to:
 ̶ Investments/product
 ̶ Distribution
 ̶ Technology and other support
  Operating margin bottoms out in 2018 as new sources of growth ramp up
  What could alter this plan?
 ̶ Markets decline – we will manage pace accordingly
 ̶ Base business declines more than we expect
 ̶ New product or distribution investments do not yield expected results
 Our model’s financial assumptions: 
**For 2016, see the reconciliation between GAAP operating expenses and Adjusted on page 58. 
Operating expense projections for the other years do not consider any non-GAAP adjustments.

  U.S. data – 50% total global market and in many sense U.S. leads global trends
  While active as a category has seen headwinds, we continue to believe in high-quality active 
management:
 — We have the focus on quality and we remain dedicated to this line of business
 — The revenue pools combined with the stock of assets and the replacement rate within the large 
pools continues to present strong potential for commercial returns
 — With the continued material funding gaps in defined benefit plans and with the under-saving in 
much of the world in defined contribution and discretionary savings, the incremental return from 
high-quality active management will be a vital component of successful outcomes for clients
  Clients will continue to need high-quality exposure to all main asset classes, and we are well 
positioned to deliver across the spectrum of equity and fixed income globally
  We already have a material multi-asset solutions business, so we are well placed to benefit from 
this trend in customer needs in all regions of the world

  Key Product Demand Drivers – We have existing products, recent launches, and new product plans 
to continue to meet these:
 — Separation of alpha and beta
 — Absolute return
 — Income
 — Diversification
 — Home market bias versus global opportunity set
  Increased Tailoring – Many clients (particularly larger clients and consultants) are looking for 
increased tailoring. We have the asset allocation and solutions capabilities and breadth of asset 
classes to help clients in this area.
  Pricing – We differentiate ourselves with our core philosophy to treat all customers fairly. We 
recognize the pressures that exist in the marketplace and manage pricing discipline very carefully.
  Regulation and Policy – We remain very involved in all regulatory developments and have 
the scale in our business to respond to issues such as Brexit, MiFID II, money market reform, and 
DOL.

  The developed markets account for 86% of the total existing stock of global AUM
 — T. Rowe Price is already well established in the U.S. along with the Global Investment Services 
U.S. institutional business
 — Demographics, government fiscal trends, and higher levels of wealth/capita are leading Western 
Europe, Japan, and Australia to catch up with U.S. in the levels of managed assets
  While only 13% of existing global AUM, the developing markets account for 40% of global net new 
flows
 — The growth in GDP/capita, the increasing presence of formal retirement markets, and the high 
savings rates make Asia a particular opportunity for a global asset manager such as T. Rowe 
Price with the majority of the developing market opportunity set
  We are looking to position our global business to match these long-term trends

  We see continued growth in DC, particularly in the nearer term in the more developed retirement 
markets. T. Rowe Price has significant DC experience.
  Larger clients are increasingly investigating bringing core asset management in house. T. Rowe 
Price has solutions capabilities to work with clients as they move and a wide range of specialist 
asset classes to complement their in-house core management.
  Increased quality and concentration in the buying process (especially consultants and large 
intermediaries). As the focus on value for money increases, larger clients are looking to leverage 
their buying power across multiple mandates. T. Rowe Price, as one of the larger, more global 
managers that can work with clients and consultants in all regions, is well positioned to benefit.
  Regulatory pressure (e.g., fiduciary standards, research costs, and gifts and entertainment). The 
increasing cost of regulation will require larger levels of investment in business infrastructure, 
operations, and technology. T. Rowe Price, as a larger, more global businesses with diverse 
business across geography, asset class, and distribution, is well positioned to invest through 
these regulatory changes.

 Reconciliation Between GAAP and Adjusted
 2016
 (millions)
 Operating Expenses, GAAP Basis
 Non-GAAP Adjustments
 Expenses of consolidated sponsored investment 
portfolios, net of elimination of the firm’s related 
management fee1
 Nonrecurring charge related to Dell appraisal matter2
 $2,489.5
 (6.5)
 (66.2)
 Adjusted Operating Expenses $2,416.8
 58
 1The firm implemented new consolidation accounting guidance on January 1, 2016, that resulted in a larger number of our sponsored
 investment portfolios, that we provide seed capital to at inception, to be consolidated in our financial statements as we were deemed to have 
a controlling financial interest. We now recognize investment gains and losses on a larger number of the investments in sponsored portfolios 
in our consolidated statement of income compared with our consolidated statement of comprehensive income in 2015. The non-GAAP 
adjustments add back the management fees we earn from the consolidated sponsored investment portfolios and remove the investment
 income and operating expenses of these portfolios that have been included in our U.S. GAAP consolidated statements of income. We
 believe the consolidated sponsored investment portfolios may impact the reader's ability to understand our core operating results. 
2As previously disclosed, we made the decision in 2016 to compensate certain clients in regard to the Dell appraisal rights matter. We also 
recognized an offset to this charge for a related insurance recovery. We believe it is useful to readers of our consolidated statement of 
income to adjust for this nonrecurring charge, net of the insurance recovery, in arriving at adjusted operating expenses as this will aid with 
comparability to prior periods and analyzing our core business results. 
For further information and reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted, see the earnings release for the three months and year ended 
December 31, 2016, filed on Form 8-K on January 26, 2017.

T. Rowe Price mutual funds are subject to ongoing management fees and may be subject to redemption fees. An IRA may be subject to an annual fee, and a fee may be assessed when an IRA is closed. See prospectus for details.

The mutual funds referred to in this website are offered and sold only to persons residing in the United States and are offered by prospectus only. The prospectuses include investment objectives, risks, fees, expenses, and other information that you should read and consider carefully before investing.
Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 5/31/17, 72 of 106 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

*144 of our 330 mutual funds had a 10-year track record as of 3/31/17 (includes all share classes and excludes funds used in insurance products). 122 of these 144 funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 204 of 311 (66%), 175 of 213, 140 of 178 (79%), of T. Rowe Price funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 3/31/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
24 of our 39 Retirement Funds had a 10-year track record as of 3/31/17 (includes all share classes). 23 of these 24 funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 38 of 39, 35 of 36, and 35 of 36 of the Retirement Funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 3/31/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
Source: Lipper Inc. 168 of 213 funds (excluding institutional and bank institutional funds as defined by Lipper) more than 6 months old had expense ratios below their Lipper averages based on fiscal year-end data available as of 3/31/17.
The principal value of the Retirement Funds is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The funds’ allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term postretirement withdrawal horizon. The funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The funds maintain a substantial allocation to equities both prior to and after the target date, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.

No. 1 mutual fund, which made a killing off Amazon and Tesla, is now focused on these stocks

T. Rowe Price's stock drops as concerns over new fiduciary rule prompts downgrade
Shares of T. Rowe Price Group Inc.  slid 3.6% in morning trade Wednesday, after UBS flipped to bearish from bullish amid concerns over new regulatory rules going into effect next month. Analyst Brennan Hawken cut his rating on the provider of financial advisory services to sell from buy, and slashed his stock price target to $61, which is 11% below current levels, from $77. Based on the negative impact of the 2010 rule that increased transparency into 401K fees, the Labor Department's fiduciary rule, which is scheduled to go into effect June 9, should lead to outflows from target date funds, increase expenses and accelerate a shift toward passive investing. The fiduciary rule will require financial advisors to act in the clients' best interest. "TROW has a solid domestic franchise with strong investment performance but we see these positives as more than offset by the overhang from the DOL rule, headwinds from corporate 401K lawsuits and shifts toward passive," Hawken wrote in a note to clients.

Since Thomas Rowe Price, Jr., opened our first office in Baltimore, Maryland, we have grown to serve clients in 45 countries worldwide.












 One Company Serving Clients Around The World.
























1T. Rowe Price ranked third in the Securities and Asset Management Industry category. The survey started with approximately 1,500 companies: the FORTUNE 1,000® (the 1,000 largest U.S. companies ranked by revenue), plus non-U.S. companies in FORTUNE’s Global 500® database with revenue of $10 billion U.S. dollars or more. The companies were then sorted by industry, and the 15 largest for each international industry and the 10 largest for each U.S. industry were selected. A total of 680 companies from 28 countries were surveyed. To create the 51 industry lists, Hay Group (FORTUNE® survey partner) asked executives, directors, and securities analysts to rate companies in their own industry on 9 criteria, from investment value and quality of management and products to social responsibility and ability to attract talent. A company’s score must rank in the top half of its industry survey to be listed.

T. Rowe Price mutual funds are subject to ongoing management fees and may be subject to redemption fees. An IRA may be subject to an annual fee, and a fee may be assessed when an IRA is closed. See prospectus for details.

The mutual funds referred to in this website are offered and sold only to persons residing in the United States and are offered by prospectus only. The prospectuses include investment objectives, risks, fees, expenses, and other information that you should read and consider carefully before investing.
Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 5/31/17, 72 of 106 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

*144 of our 330 mutual funds had a 10-year track record as of 3/31/17 (includes all share classes and excludes funds used in insurance products). 122 of these 144 funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 204 of 311 (66%), 175 of 213, 140 of 178 (79%), of T. Rowe Price funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 3/31/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
24 of our 39 Retirement Funds had a 10-year track record as of 3/31/17 (includes all share classes). 23 of these 24 funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 38 of 39, 35 of 36, and 35 of 36 of the Retirement Funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 3/31/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
Source: Lipper Inc. 168 of 213 funds (excluding institutional and bank institutional funds as defined by Lipper) more than 6 months old had expense ratios below their Lipper averages based on fiscal year-end data available as of 3/31/17.
The principal value of the Retirement Funds is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The funds’ allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term postretirement withdrawal horizon. The funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The funds maintain a substantial allocation to equities both prior to and after the target date, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.

By comparison, as of 5/31/17, 72 of 106 of our rated funds (Investor Class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.​ Past performance cannot guarantee future results.

All mutual funds are subject to market risk, including possible loss of principal.
*Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 5/31/17, 72 of 106 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

**This chart displays relative risk of each U.S. mutual fund listed using standard deviation of returns. Those values are provided in the bars at the top of the chart.
Methodology: We evaluate the standard deviation and its resulting placement within a specific risk/return category on an annual basis. A fund is generally placed in a risk/return category based on the 10-year standard deviation of its performance. If a fund is less than 10 years old, the actual fund performance history is supplemented with the primary prospectus benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years. For an Asset Allocation fund with less than 10 years of performance history, sub-strategy returns are used. When a sub-strategy is less than 10 years old, the actual sub-strategy performance history is supplemented with benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years.
Risk return categories overlap; a fund with a standard deviation in the overlap between two categories, denoted by a plus (+), is placed so that its risk categorization is better aligned with anticipated return characteristics an investor may experience going forward at the discretion of T Rowe Price.
When a fund has a cash-like benchmark, denoted by a double plus (++), its standard deviation is estimated using only available fund returns. If the fund is less than 10 years old, benchmark returns are not used to obtain a full 10-year history because they would artificially suppress the volatility estimate.
All investments are subject to market risk, including the possible loss of principal. Standard deviation of returns, a measure of price volatility, is one measure of risk. Please consult the funds’ prospectuses for a more complete discussion of the funds’ risks.

Philosophy[edit]
Thomas Rowe Price Jr. started in finance in the 1920s as an entry-level researcher and account manager at Baltimore-area brokerages. He found that he liked the challenges imposed by investing nearly as much as he disliked the common practices of sales-oriented brokerages at the time. So, in 1937, he founded a firm that went against that grain in three major ways: charging fees based on assets under management rather than sales volume, actively managing his clients' accounts strictly as a fiduciary, and investing in growth stocks instead of value stocks. This approach, which emphasized "discipline, process consistency, and fundamental research," garnered success for the firm and its namesake, who became well known as the "father of growth investing" and was nicknamed the "Sage of Baltimore" by Forbes.[3][4] The firm has diversified its products and methodology, but hews closely to the original values upon which it was founded.[1][5]
History[edit]
1937-1986[edit]
Thomas Rowe Price, Jr. founded T. Rowe Price & Associates in Baltimore in 1937. The firm was originally headquartered at 10 Light Street and staffed by a small pool of associates, many of whom left Legg Mason's precursor, MacKubin, Legg and Co. along with Mr. Price.[6] Initially a very small firm focused on wealth management and private investing accounts for Baltimore-area families, the company struggled through the financial turbulence of the Great Depression and World War II before gaining solid footing at the end of the 1940s. By 1950, its clientele grew too large for the staff to manage accounts individually, so the firm incorporated and launched its first mutual fund, the T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund.[3][7]




100 East Pratt Street


Gaining traction in Baltimore and along the U.S. eastern seaboard, the firm continued a steady expansion of clientele, staff, and geographic reach. By 1960, Mr. Price felt the need to open a second fund, named the New Horizons Fund, focused on growth investment opportunities, and especially technological firms like Xerox, IBM, and Boeing.[7] In need of more room, headquarters were moved in 1962 to the new One Charles Center building designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe nearby in downtown Baltimore.[8] At this same juncture, Mr. Price began to prepare for retirement, resigning as president of the firm in 1963, delegating some responsibilities, and selling his shares in the company.[7] Despite this, Mr. Price maintained an active presence in the firm for several years, and urged the opening of the New Era Fund in 1969 as a response to the rapid inflation he predicted would dominate the 1970s.[9] In 1971, the year Mr. Price completely retired, T. Rowe Price opened its Fixed Income Division, and began to modernize and diversify its operations.
In the 1970s and early 1980s, T. Rowe Price kicked off more assertive growth than before, moving to its current location at 100 East Pratt Street and opening its first international office. In 1979, T. Rowe Price launched a joint venture with British asset manager Robert Fleming & Co. named Rowe Price-Fleming International. The venture, which managed $39 billion at its height in 2000, allowed T. Rowe Price to offer a broader range of services and expertise internationally.[10]
1986-present[edit]
T. Rowe Price held its initial public offering, valued at nearly $200 million dollars, in 1986.[11] Shortly thereafter, the firm began establishing larger office complexes in the U.S. and research offices around the world, beginning with a Hong Kong office in 1987. Retirement Plan Services were launched in the 1990s alongside additional new services and funds, including mutual funds acquired from other companies such as USF&G.[12] This momentum, and the firm reaching $100 billion assets under management, pushed T. Rowe Price to create an asset management partnership with Sumitomo Bank and Daiwa Securities in Tokyo in 1999, and to purchase 100% interest of the London-based Rowe Price-Fleming International, which was renamed T. Rowe Price International.[7] Also in 1999, T. Rowe Price was added to the S&P 500 Index.[13][14]
On the strength of its ethic of risk aversion, fundamental research, and active management approach, T. Rowe Price somewhat predicted and largely avoided the dot-com bubble of 2000. Its ethic of caution was so different from the norm at the time that The Wall Street Journal expressed surprise at its non-speculation on profitable technology stocks just a week before the markets began to crash in March 2000.[15] In 2001, the company launched T. Rowe Price Funds SICAV, domiciled in Luxembourg, for non-U.S. institutional investors and financial intermediaries. Two years later it created target-date retirement funds.[16] In 2010, T. Rowe Price bought a significant interest in Unit Trust of India, India's oldest mutual fund company and one of its five largest.[17] Since 2000, T. Rowe Price has opened global offices in locations ranging from Madrid and Dubai to Stockholm and Sydney.[18]

Philosophy[edit]
Thomas Rowe Price Jr. started in finance in the 1920s as an entry-level researcher and account manager at Baltimore-area brokerages. He found that he liked the challenges imposed by investing nearly as much as he disliked the common practices of sales-oriented brokerages at the time. So, in 1937, he founded a firm that went against that grain in three major ways: charging fees based on assets under management rather than sales volume, actively managing his clients' accounts strictly as a fiduciary, and investing in growth stocks instead of value stocks. This approach, which emphasized "discipline, process consistency, and fundamental research," garnered success for the firm and its namesake, who became well known as the "father of growth investing" and was nicknamed the "Sage of Baltimore" by Forbes.[3][4] The firm has diversified its products and methodology, but hews closely to the original values upon which it was founded.[1][5]
History[edit]
1937-1986[edit]
Thomas Rowe Price, Jr. founded T. Rowe Price & Associates in Baltimore in 1937. The firm was originally headquartered at 10 Light Street and staffed by a small pool of associates, many of whom left Legg Mason's precursor, MacKubin, Legg and Co. along with Mr. Price.[6] Initially a very small firm focused on wealth management and private investing accounts for Baltimore-area families, the company struggled through the financial turbulence of the Great Depression and World War II before gaining solid footing at the end of the 1940s. By 1950, its clientele grew too large for the staff to manage accounts individually, so the firm incorporated and launched its first mutual fund, the T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund.[3][7]




100 East Pratt Street


Gaining traction in Baltimore and along the U.S. eastern seaboard, the firm continued a steady expansion of clientele, staff, and geographic reach. By 1960, Mr. Price felt the need to open a second fund, named the New Horizons Fund, focused on growth investment opportunities, and especially technological firms like Xerox, IBM, and Boeing.[7] In need of more room, headquarters were moved in 1962 to the new One Charles Center building designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe nearby in downtown Baltimore.[8] At this same juncture, Mr. Price began to prepare for retirement, resigning as president of the firm in 1963, delegating some responsibilities, and selling his shares in the company.[7] Despite this, Mr. Price maintained an active presence in the firm for several years, and urged the opening of the New Era Fund in 1969 as a response to the rapid inflation he predicted would dominate the 1970s.[9] In 1971, the year Mr. Price completely retired, T. Rowe Price opened its Fixed Income Division, and began to modernize and diversify its operations.
In the 1970s and early 1980s, T. Rowe Price kicked off more assertive growth than before, moving to its current location at 100 East Pratt Street and opening its first international office. In 1979, T. Rowe Price launched a joint venture with British asset manager Robert Fleming & Co. named Rowe Price-Fleming International. The venture, which managed $39 billion at its height in 2000, allowed T. Rowe Price to offer a broader range of services and expertise internationally.[10]
1986-present[edit]
T. Rowe Price held its initial public offering, valued at nearly $200 million dollars, in 1986.[11] Shortly thereafter, the firm began establishing larger office complexes in the U.S. and research offices around the world, beginning with a Hong Kong office in 1987. Retirement Plan Services were launched in the 1990s alongside additional new services and funds, including mutual funds acquired from other companies such as USF&G.[12] This momentum, and the firm reaching $100 billion assets under management, pushed T. Rowe Price to create an asset management partnership with Sumitomo Bank and Daiwa Securities in Tokyo in 1999, and to purchase 100% interest of the London-based Rowe Price-Fleming International, which was renamed T. Rowe Price International.[7] Also in 1999, T. Rowe Price was added to the S&P 500 Index.[13][14]
On the strength of its ethic of risk aversion, fundamental research, and active management approach, T. Rowe Price somewhat predicted and largely avoided the dot-com bubble of 2000. Its ethic of caution was so different from the norm at the time that The Wall Street Journal expressed surprise at its non-speculation on profitable technology stocks just a week before the markets began to crash in March 2000.[15] In 2001, the company launched T. Rowe Price Funds SICAV, domiciled in Luxembourg, for non-U.S. institutional investors and financial intermediaries. Two years later it created target-date retirement funds.[16] In 2010, T. Rowe Price bought a significant interest in Unit Trust of India, India's oldest mutual fund company and one of its five largest.[17] Since 2000, T. Rowe Price has opened global offices in locations ranging from Madrid and Dubai to Stockholm and Sydney.[18]

Philosophy[edit]
Thomas Rowe Price Jr. started in finance in the 1920s as an entry-level researcher and account manager at Baltimore-area brokerages. He found that he liked the challenges imposed by investing nearly as much as he disliked the common practices of sales-oriented brokerages at the time. So, in 1937, he founded a firm that went against that grain in three major ways: charging fees based on assets under management rather than sales volume, actively managing his clients' accounts strictly as a fiduciary, and investing in growth stocks instead of value stocks. This approach, which emphasized "discipline, process consistency, and fundamental research," garnered success for the firm and its namesake, who became well known as the "father of growth investing" and was nicknamed the "Sage of Baltimore" by Forbes.[3][4] The firm has diversified its products and methodology, but hews closely to the original values upon which it was founded.[1][5]
History[edit]
1937-1986[edit]
Thomas Rowe Price, Jr. founded T. Rowe Price & Associates in Baltimore in 1937. The firm was originally headquartered at 10 Light Street and staffed by a small pool of associates, many of whom left Legg Mason's precursor, MacKubin, Legg and Co. along with Mr. Price.[6] Initially a very small firm focused on wealth management and private investing accounts for Baltimore-area families, the company struggled through the financial turbulence of the Great Depression and World War II before gaining solid footing at the end of the 1940s. By 1950, its clientele grew too large for the staff to manage accounts individually, so the firm incorporated and launched its first mutual fund, the T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund.[3][7]




100 East Pratt Street


Gaining traction in Baltimore and along the U.S. eastern seaboard, the firm continued a steady expansion of clientele, staff, and geographic reach. By 1960, Mr. Price felt the need to open a second fund, named the New Horizons Fund, focused on growth investment opportunities, and especially technological firms like Xerox, IBM, and Boeing.[7] In need of more room, headquarters were moved in 1962 to the new One Charles Center building designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe nearby in downtown Baltimore.[8] At this same juncture, Mr. Price began to prepare for retirement, resigning as president of the firm in 1963, delegating some responsibilities, and selling his shares in the company.[7] Despite this, Mr. Price maintained an active presence in the firm for several years, and urged the opening of the New Era Fund in 1969 as a response to the rapid inflation he predicted would dominate the 1970s.[9] In 1971, the year Mr. Price completely retired, T. Rowe Price opened its Fixed Income Division, and began to modernize and diversify its operations.
In the 1970s and early 1980s, T. Rowe Price kicked off more assertive growth than before, moving to its current location at 100 East Pratt Street and opening its first international office. In 1979, T. Rowe Price launched a joint venture with British asset manager Robert Fleming & Co. named Rowe Price-Fleming International. The venture, which managed $39 billion at its height in 2000, allowed T. Rowe Price to offer a broader range of services and expertise internationally.[10]
1986-present[edit]
T. Rowe Price held its initial public offering, valued at nearly $200 million dollars, in 1986.[11] Shortly thereafter, the firm began establishing larger office complexes in the U.S. and research offices around the world, beginning with a Hong Kong office in 1987. Retirement Plan Services were launched in the 1990s alongside additional new services and funds, including mutual funds acquired from other companies such as USF&G.[12] This momentum, and the firm reaching $100 billion assets under management, pushed T. Rowe Price to create an asset management partnership with Sumitomo Bank and Daiwa Securities in Tokyo in 1999, and to purchase 100% interest of the London-based Rowe Price-Fleming International, which was renamed T. Rowe Price International.[7] Also in 1999, T. Rowe Price was added to the S&P 500 Index.[13][14]
On the strength of its ethic of risk aversion, fundamental research, and active management approach, T. Rowe Price somewhat predicted and largely avoided the dot-com bubble of 2000. Its ethic of caution was so different from the norm at the time that The Wall Street Journal expressed surprise at its non-speculation on profitable technology stocks just a week before the markets began to crash in March 2000.[15] In 2001, the company launched T. Rowe Price Funds SICAV, domiciled in Luxembourg, for non-U.S. institutional investors and financial intermediaries. Two years later it created target-date retirement funds.[16] In 2010, T. Rowe Price bought a significant interest in Unit Trust of India, India's oldest mutual fund company and one of its five largest.[17] Since 2000, T. Rowe Price has opened global offices in locations ranging from Madrid and Dubai to Stockholm and Sydney.[18]

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

Margin trading involves risks and is not suitable for all investors. Rates are subject to change without notice. Rates are set at the discretion of E*TRADE Securities with reference to commercially recognized interest rates, such as the broker call loan rate.
Trading on margin involves risk, including the possible loss of more money than you have deposited. In addition, E*TRADE Securities can force the sale of any securities in your account without contacting you if your equity falls below required levels, and you are not entitled to an extension of time in the event of a margin call. For more information, please read the risks of trading on margin at www.etrade.com/margin.
The base rate is set at E*TRADE Securities' discretion with reference to commercially recognized interest rates, such as the broker call loan rate. Base rates are subject to change without prior notice.
Transactions in futures carry a high degree of risk. The amount of initial margin is small relative to the value of the futures contract. A relatively small market movement will have a proportionately larger impact on the funds you have deposited or will have to deposit: this may work against you as well as for you. You may sustain a total loss of initial margin funds and any additional funds deposited with the Firm to maintain your position. If the market moves against your positions or margin levels are increased, you may be called upon by the Firm to pay substantial additional funds on short notice to maintain your position. If you fail to comply with a request for additional funds immediately, regardless of the requested due date, your position may be liquidated at a loss by the Firm and you will be liable for any resulting deficit.

The list is comprised of companies headquartered in France and whose market capitalization exceeds EUR 1 billion as of January 1, 2012.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
