(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   First Quarter 2014 Compared to Fourth Quarter 2013 Product Groups (Stated in millions) First Quarter 2014 Fourth Quarter 2013 Income Income Before Before Revenue Taxes Revenue Taxes Oilfield Services Reservoir Characterization $ 2,852 $ 779 $ 3,306 $ 1,031 Drilling 4,331 881 4,440 880 Production 4,116 737 4,219 730 Eliminations & other (60 ) (29 ) (59 ) (37 ) 11,239 2,368 11,906 2,604 Corporate & other (1) - (201 ) - (197 ) Interest income (2) - 7 - 7 Interest expense (3) - (97 ) - (92 ) Charges and credits (4) - - - (152 ) $ 11,239 $ 2,077 $ 11,906 $ 2,170   Geographic Areas (Stated in millions) First Quarter 2014 Fourth Quarter 2013 Income Income Before Before Revenue Taxes Revenue Taxes Oilfield Services North America $ 3,684 $ 683 $ 3,649 $ 716 Latin America 1,758 371 2,003 425 Europe/CIS/Africa 2,881 585 3,225 726 Middle East & Asia 2,845 749 2,923 766 Eliminations & other 71 (20 ) 106 (29 ) 11,239 2,368 11,906 2,604 Corporate & other (1) - (201 ) - (197 ) Interest income (2) - 7 - 7 Interest expense (3) - (97 ) - (92 ) Charges and credits - - - (152 ) $ 11,239 $ 2,077 $ 11,906 $ 2,170  (1) Comprised principally of certain corporate expenses not allocated to the segments, interest on postretirement medical benefits, stock-based compensation costs, amortization expense associated with certain intangible and other nonoperating items.  (2) Interest income excludes amounts which are included in the segments' income ($5 million in 2014; $4 million in 2013).  (3) Interest expense excludes amounts which are included in the segments' income ($6 million in 2014; $6 million in 2013).  OILFIELD SERVICES  First-quarter revenue of $11.24 billion decreased 6% sequentially. The strong year-end product, software and multiclient sales experienced in the fourth quarter of 2013 accounted for almost half of the sequential decline in revenue. The rest of the sequential decline was due to seasonal weather-related activity slowdowns in Russia and China; the completion of marine seismic surveys in Brazil, Norway, Malaysia and in the Caspian Sea; and contract and operational delays in Brazil and Mexico. However, these sequential effects were partly offset by strong pressure pumping activity in US Land and Canada, which was partially muted by severe winter weather.  First-quarter pretax operating income of $2.37 billion decreased 9% sequentially. Pretax operating margin decreased by 80 basis points (bps) to 21.1% due to year-end and seasonality effects primarily due to typical year-end and seasonal winter weather effects. International margin declined slightly by 73 bps to 22.8%, while North America margin decreased 107 bps to 18.5%.  Reservoir Characterization Group  First-quarter revenue of $2.85 billion decreased 14% sequentially. Pretax operating income of $779 million was 24% lower compared to the prior quarter.  Sequentially, the revenue decrease was primarily due to lower WesternGeco multiclient and SIS software sales following their strong year-end highs.  Pretax operating margin of 27.3% decreased 384 bps sequentially as a result of the seasonally lower WesternGeco multiclient and SIS software sales.  Drilling Group  First-quarter revenue of $4.33 billion decreased 2% sequentially. Pretax operating income of $881 million was flat compared to the prior quarter.  Sequentially, the revenue decline reflected a decline in M-I SWACO product sales following a strong 2013 year-end high.  Pretax operating margin of 20.3% increased 51 bps sequentially as a result of better pricing from a higher-technology mix for Drilling & Measurements services, mainly in the Middle East & Asia Area, as well as from improved profitability in Integrated Project Management (IPM) projects.  Production Group  First-quarter revenue of $4.12 billion decreased 2% sequentially. Pretax operating income of $737 million was 1% higher compared to the prior quarter.  The sequential revenue decline was primarily due to lower Completions and Artificial Lift product sales following their strong year-end highs. Well Services pressure pumping technologies were higher due to increased service intensity in US land despite severe winter disruption and contract rollover pricing. Revenue in Well Services was also higher due to peak winter activity in Western Canada.  Pretax operating margin of 17.9% increased 60 bps sequentially on improved profitability for Well Services and Well Intervention Technologies, both in North America land and in the International Areas. This improvement is due to peak winter activity in Western Canada as well as from operational efficiencies in US land, although this was muted by continued pricing weakness in US land.  First Quarter 2014 Compared to First Quarter 2013   Product Groups (Stated in millions) First Quarter 2014 First Quarter 2013 Income Income Before Before Revenue Taxes Revenue Taxes Oilfield Services Reservoir Characterization $ 2,852 $ 779 $ 2,801 $ 729 Drilling 4,331 881 4,062 725 Production 4,116 737 3,759 555 Eliminations & other (60 ) (29 ) (52 ) (44 ) 11,239 2,368 10,570 1,965 Corporate & other (1) - (201 ) - (169 ) Interest income (2) - 7 - 6 Interest expense (3) - (97 ) - (93 ) Charges and credits (4) - - - (92 ) $ 11,239 $ 2,077 $ 10,570 $ 1,617   Geographic Areas (Stated in millions) First Quarter 2014 First Quarter 2013 Income Income Before Before Revenue Taxes Revenue Taxes Oilfield Services North America $ 3,684 $ 683 $ 3,290 $ 627 Latin America 1,758 371 1,904 371 Europe/CIS/Africa 2,881 585 2,863 509 Middle East & Asia 2,845 749 2,394 547 Eliminations & other 71 (20 ) 119 (89 ) 11,239 2,368 10,570 1,965 Corporate & other (1) - (201 ) - (169 ) Interest income (2) - 7 - 6 Interest expense (3) - (97 ) - (93 ) Charges and credits (4) - - - (92 ) $ 11,239 $ 2,077 $ 10,570 $ 1,617  (1) Comprised principally of certain corporate expenses not allocated to the segments, interest on postretirement medical benefits, stock-based compensation costs, amortization expense associated with certain intangible and other nonoperating items.  (2) Interest income excludes amounts which are included in the segments' income ($5 million in 2014; $- million in 2013).  (3) Interest expense excludes amounts which are included in the segments' income ($6 million in 2014; $5 million in 2013).  (4) See Note 2 - Charges and Credits in the Consolidated Financial Statements.  OILFIELD SERVICES  First-quarter revenue of $11.24 billion increased 6% year-on-year. International revenue of $7.48 billion grew $322 million, or 5% year-on-year, while North America Area revenue of $3.68 billion increased $394 million, or 12% year-on-year.  North America Area revenue of $3.68 billion increased 12%. Although land activity was temporarily disrupted by severe winter weather, overall robust results were driven by increased service intensity, market share gains, and new technology uptake in a pressure pumping market where pricing remained competitive. Land revenue also grew from the expanding artificial lift business. North America offshore declined marginally due to operational delays and extended workover activity. International revenue increased 5% led by the Middle East & Asia Area with revenue of $2.84 billion growing 19%, mainly from strong activity in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and by robust drilling activity and technology uptake in Southeast Asia and deepwater Australia. Europe/CIS/Africa Area revenue of $2.88 billion increased 1%, led by the Central West Africa GeoMarket on strong development and exploration activity and by Norway from market share gains in drilling services. Russia and Central Asia region revenue increased slightly as growing activity in the Arctic and the Caspian Sea was offset by activity disruption from the severe winter weather and the impact of the weaker Russian ruble. Latin America Area revenue of $1.76 billion declined 8%, mainly due to significantly lower activity and pricing in Brazil coupled with reduced rig count in Mexico due to budgetary spend. These effects, however, were partially offset by increased work in the Schlumberger Project Management (SPM) Shushufindi project in Ecuador and strong activity in the Vaca Muerta shale in Argentina.  By segment, Reservoir Characterization Group revenue of $2.85 billion increased $51 million, or 2%, led by Wireline and Testing Services driven by offshore exploration and by Schlumberger Information Solutions (SIS) on increased software sales across all International Areas. WesternGeco declined on lower marine vessel fleet utilization and reduced multiclient sales. Drilling Group revenue of $4.33 billion increased $269 million, or 7%, led by robust demand for Drilling & Measurements and M-I SWACO technologies in Saudi Arabia, Australia and in the Southeast Asia region. Production Group revenue of $4.12 billion increased $357 million, or 10%, with double-digit growth posted by Well Services pressure pumping technologies in North America land and increased SPM activity.  Year-on-year, pretax operating margin increased by 248 bps as International pretax operating margin expanded by 286 bps while North America pretax operating margin dipped 53 bps. Middle East & Asia posted a 349 bps year-on-year margin improvement to reach 26.3%, Europe/CIS/Africa increased by 253 bps to 20.3%, and Latin America improved by 160 bps to 21.1%. The slight decline in North America margin was mainly due to pricing weakness on land for Well Services pressure pumping technologies and drilling delays offshore in the US Gulf of Mexico. The robust expansion in International margin was driven by the uptake of new technology, the strong focus on cost and resource management, and the continued margin-accretive contribution of integration-related activities. By segment, Reservoir Characterization Group pretax operating margin expanded 129 bps to 27.3% due to improved profitability in Wireline and Testing Services and increased SIS software sales while the pretax operating margin of the Drilling Group increased 249 bps to 20.3% from increased technology integration, higher margins posted by Drilling & Measurements, and improved profitability in IPM project activity. Production Group pretax operating margin increased 313 bps to 17.9% due mainly to improved cost efficiencies and new technology sales in Well Services and Completions, although the effect of this was partially offset by contract rollover pricing.  Reservoir Characterization Group  First-quarter revenue of $2.85 billion grew 2% year-on-year. Pretax operating income of $779 million increased 7% year-on-year.  The year-on-year revenue growth was led by Wireline and Testing Services driven by offshore exploration, and by SIS on increased software sales across all International Areas. WesternGeco, however, declined on lower marine vessel fleet utilization and reduced multiclient sales.  Pretax operating margin of 27.3% increased by 129 bps due to improved profitability in Wireline and increased SIS software sales.  Drilling Group  First-quarter revenue of $4.33 billion grew 7% year-on-year. Pretax operating income of $881 million increased 22% year-on-year.  The year-on-year revenue growth reflected robust growth in Drilling & Measurements technologies as drilling activity strengthened in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Norway, China, Australia and the Southeast Asia region.  Year-on-year, pretax operating margin increased 249 bps from increased technology integration, better margins at Drilling & Measurements, and improved profitability in IPM project activity.  Production Group  First-quarter revenue of $4.12 billion grew 10% year-on-year. Pretax operating income of $737 million increased 33% year-on-year.  The year-on-year revenue increase was led by double-digit growth in Well Services pressure pumping technologies in North America land. SPM revenue grew by more than 50% as projects in Latin America continued to progress ahead of work plans.  Year-on-year, pretax operating margin increased 313 bps mainly from improved cost efficiencies and new technology sales in Well Services and Completions, although the effect of this was partially offset by contract rollover pricing.  INTEREST & OTHER INCOME Interest & other income consisted of the following: (Stated in millions) First Quarter 2014 2013 Equity in net earnings of affiliated companies $ 64 $ 27 Interest income 12 6 $ 76 $ 33  OTHER Research & engineering and General & administrative expenses, as a percentage of Revenue, for the first quarter ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 were as follows: First Quarter 2014 2013 Research & engineering 2.5 % 2.8 % General & administrative 0.9 % 0.9 %  The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2014 was 22.6% compared to 25.1% for the same period of 2013. This decrease was primarily attributable to the impact of the $92 million charge recorded in the first quarter of 2013 relating to the currency devaluation in Venezuela which had no related tax benefit combined with a change in the geographic mix of earnings.  CHARGES AND CREDITS  Although the functional currency of Schlumberger's operations in Venezuela is the US dollar, a portion of the transactions are denominated in local currency. In February 2013, Venezuela's currency was devalued from the prior exchange rate of 4.3 Bolivar Fuertes per US dollar to 6.3 Bolivar Fuertes per US dollar. Although this devaluation does result in a reduction in the US dollar reported amount of local currency denominated revenue and expenses, the impact is not material to Schlumberger's consolidated financial statements. As a result of this devaluation, Schlumberger recorded a pretax and after-tax foreign currency loss of $92 million during the first quarter of 2013. This amount is classified in Restructuring & other in the Consolidated Statement of Income.  There were no charges or credits recorded during the first quarter of 2014.  NET DEBT  Net Debt represents gross debt less cash, short-term investments and fixed income investments, held to maturity. Management believes that Net Debt provides useful information regarding the level of Schlumberger indebtedness by reflecting cash and investments that could be used to repay debt.  Details of Net Debt follow:  (Stated in millions)   Mar. 31, Mar. 31, 2014 2013 Net Debt, beginning of year $ (4,443 ) $ (5,111 ) Net income 1,608 1,267 Depreciation and amortization (1) 932 896 Other non-cash items 27 108 Excess of equity income over dividends received (61 ) (23 ) Stock-based compensation expense 77 81 Pension and other postretirement benefits expense 86 128 Pension and other postretirement benefits funding (72 ) (177 ) Increase in working capital (870 ) (949 ) Capital expenditures (864 ) (894 ) Multiclient seismic data capitalized (82 ) (117 ) Dividends paid (410 ) (365 ) Proceeds from employee stock plans 280 166 Stock repurchase program (899 ) (193 ) Business acquisitions and investment, net of cash acquired (239 ) (39 ) Currency effect on net debt (20 ) 126 Other (103 ) (177 ) Net Debt, end of period $ (5,053 ) $ (5,273 )  (1) Includes multiclient seismic data costs.  (Stated in millions)   Mar. 31, Mar. 31, Dec. 31, Components of Net Debt 2014 2013 2013 Cash $ 3,752 $ 2,129 $ 3,472 Short-term investments 3,326 3,432 4,898 Fixed income investments, held to maturity 358 266 363 Short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt (1,369 ) (2,962 ) (2,783 ) Long-term debt (11,120 ) (8,138 ) (10,393 ) $ (5,053 ) $ (5,273 ) $ (4,443 )  Key liquidity events during the first three months of 2014 and 2013 included:  · On April 17, 2008, the Schlumberger Board of Directors (the "Board") approved an $8 billion share repurchase program for shares of Schlumberger common stock, to be acquired before December 31, 2011. On July 21, 2011, the Board approved an extension of this repurchase program to December 31, 2013. This program was completed during the third quarter of 2013.  On July 18, 2013, the Board approved a new $10 billion share repurchase program to be completed at the latest by June 30, 2018. Schlumberger had repurchased $2.6 billion of shares under this new share repurchase program as of March 31, 2014. Schlumberger has decided to accelerate this share repurchase program with the aim of completing it in 2.5 years as compared to the original target of 5 years.  The following table summarizes the activity, during the three months ended March 31, under this share repurchase program during 2014 and 2013:  (Stated in millions except per share amounts)   Total cost Total number Average price of shares of shares paid per purchased purchased share Three months ended March 31, 2014 $ 899 10.0 $ 90.31 Three months ended March 31, 2013 $ 193 2.5 $ 77.63  · Cash flow provided by operations was $1.6 billion in the first three months of 2014 compared to $1.1 billion in the first three months of 2013, primarily reflecting higher net income and a lower increase in working capital requirements year-on-year.  · Capital expenditures were $0.9 billion in the first three months of 2014 compared to $0.9 billion during the first three months of 2013. Capital expenditures for full year 2014 are expected to be approximately $3.8 billion as compared to expenditures of $3.9 billion in 2013.  At times in recent years, Schlumberger has experienced delays in payments from its national oil company customer in Venezuela. Schlumberger operates in more than 85 countries. At March 31, 2014, only four of those countries (including Venezuela) individually accounted for greater than 5% of Schlumberger's accounts receivable balance of which only one, the United States, represented greater than 10%.  As of March 31, 2014, Schlumberger had $7.1 billion of cash and short-term investments on hand. Schlumberger had separate committed debt facility agreements aggregating $4.0 billion with commercial banks, of which $2.7 billion was available and unused as of March 31, 2014. This included $3.5 billion of committed facilities which support a commercial paper program in Europe. Schlumberger believes that these amounts are sufficient to meet future business requirements for at least the next 12 months.  Borrowings under the commercial paper program at March 31, 2014 were $1.1 billion.  Other Matters  During the second quarter of 2013, Schlumberger completed the wind down of its service operations in Iran. Prior to this, certain non-U.S. subsidiaries of Schlumberger provided oilfield services to the National Iranian Oil Company and certain of its affiliates ("NIOC"). Schlumberger has classified the results of this business as a discontinued operation. All prior periods were restated accordingly.  Schlumberger's residual transactions or dealings with the government of Iran in the quarter consisted of payments of taxes and other typical governmental charges. Two non-U.S. subsidiaries of Schlumberger have depository accounts at the Dubai branch of Bank Saderat Iran ("Saderat") and at Bank Tejarat ("Tejarat") in Tehran for the deposit by NIOC of amounts owed to non-US subsidiaries of Schlumberger for prior services rendered in Iran. One non-U.S. subsidiary also maintains the account at Tejarat for payment of local expenses such as taxes and utilities. Schlumberger anticipates that it will discontinue its dealings with Saderat and Tejarat following the receipt of all amounts owed to Schlumberger for prior services rendered in Iran.  Although the functional currency of Schlumberger's operations in Venezuela is the US dollar, a portion of the transactions are denominated in Venezuelan bolivares fuertes. For financial reporting purposes, such local currency transactions are remeasured into US dollars at the official exchange rate, which was fixed at 6.3 Venezuelan bolivares fuertes to the US dollar for most of 2013.  During 2014, Venezuela enacted certain changes to its foreign exchange system such that, in addition to the official rate of 6.3 Venezuelan bolivares fuerte per US dollar, there are now two other legal exchange rates (approximately 11 and 51 Venezuelan bolivares fuertes, respectively, to the US dollar as of March . . .

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   First Quarter 2016 Compared to Fourth Quarter 2015 Product Groups (Stated in millions) First Quarter 2016 Fourth Quarter 2015 Income Income before before Revenue Taxes Revenue Taxes Reservoir Characterization $ 1,747 $ 331 $ 2,193 $ 521 Drilling 2,493 371 2,953 494 Production 2,348 208 2,632 302 Eliminations & other (68 ) (9 ) (34 ) (29 ) Pretax operating income 901 1,288 Corporate & other (1) (172 ) (179 ) Interest income (2) 13 8 Interest expense (3) (120 ) (83 ) Charges and credits - (2,136 ) $ 6,520 $ 622 $ 7,744 $ (1,102 )   Geographic Areas (Stated in millions) First Quarter 2016 Fourth Quarter 2015 Income Income before before Revenue Taxes Revenue Taxes North America $ 1,464 $ (10 ) $ 1,955 $ 139 Latin America 1,280 296 1,407 324 Europe/CIS/Africa 1,698 320 2,059 428 Middle East & Asia 2,002 446 2,248 507 Eliminations & other 76 (151 ) 75 (110 ) Pretax operating income 901 1,288 Corporate & other (1) (172 ) (179 ) Interest income (2) 13 8 Interest expense (3) (120 ) (83 ) Charges and credits - (2,136 ) $ 6,520 $ 622 $ 7,744 $ (1,102 )  (1) Comprised principally of certain corporate expenses not allocated to the segments, stock-based compensation costs, amortization expense associated with certain intangible assets, certain centrally managed initiatives and other nonoperating items.  (2) Interest income excludes amounts which are included in the segments' income ($6 million in the first quarter 2016; $6 million in the fourth quarter in 2015).  (3) Interest expense excludes amounts which are included in the segments' income ($13 million in the first quarter 2016; $8 million in the fourth quarter 2015).  During the first quarter of 2016, the decline in global activity and the rate of activity disruption reached unprecedented levels as the industry displayed clear signs of operating in a full-scale cash crisis. Budgeted E&P spend fell again and substantially affected Schlumberger's operating results. This environment is expected to continue deteriorating during the second quarter of 2016 given the magnitude and erratic nature of the disruptions in activity.  First-quarter 2016 revenue of $6.5 billion decreased 16% sequentially and was driven by a continuing drop in activity and persistent pricing pressure throughout Schlumberger's global operations, as well as from project delays, job cancellations and activity disruptions.  North America first-quarter 2016 revenue of $1.5 billion was 25% lower sequentially as the US land rig count declined 31% following customer budget cuts. By the end of the first quarter, the US land rig count had fallen to approximately 400, representing a drop of 80% from the peak of October 2014.  Revenue for the International Areas of $5.0 billion decreased 13% sequentially due to a combination of customer budget cuts, activity disruptions, seasonal winter slow-downs and persistent pricing pressure.  First-quarter 2016 pretax operating margins decreased 281 basis point (bps) to 13.8%. North America pretax operating margin declined 777 bps sequentially to -1% as the downturn deepened causing further customer spending cuts and as widespread operational disruptions prevented prompt cost adjustments. International Area pretax operating margin of 21% decreased 70 bps sequentially due to project cancellations, job delays and activity disruptions, particularly in the Europe/CIS/Africa Area.  Reservoir Characterization Group  Reservoir Characterization Group revenue of $1.7 billion declined 20% sequentially, primarily due to seasonal winter slowdowns and project cancellations that impacted Wireline activities. Lower multiclient and SIS software sales and Testing Services revenue also contributed to the decline.  Pretax operating margin of 19% declined 480 bps sequentially primarily due to reduced high-margin Wireline services and SIS software sales.  Drilling Group  Drilling Group revenue of $2.5 billion decreased 16% sequentially as a result of a sharp drop in drilling activity combined with persistent pricing pressure and seasonal winter slowdowns.  Pretax operating margin of 15% declined 183 bps sequentially as a result of the lower activity and pricing pressure.  Production Group  Production Group revenue of $2.3 billion decreased 11% sequentially with 74% of the decrease attributable to a further decline in North America land activity, as additional customer spending cuts led to a further decline in rig count and increased pricing pressure.  Pretax operating margin of 9% decreased 258 bps sequentially primarily from further pricing weakness in pressure pumping services.   First Quarter 2016 Compared to First Quarter 2015 Product Groups (Stated in millions) First Quarter 2016 First Quarter 2015 Income Income before before Revenue Taxes Revenue Taxes Reservoir Characterization $ 1,747 $ 331 $ 2,655 $ 672 Drilling 2,493 371 3,922 778 Production 2,348 208 3,705 544 Eliminations & other (68 ) (9 ) (34 ) (1 ) Pretax operating income 901 1,993 Corporate & other (1) (172 ) (192 ) Interest income (2) 13 8 Interest expense (3) (120 ) (76 ) Charges and credits - (439 ) $ 6,520 $ 622 $ 10,248 $ 1,294   Geographic Areas (Stated in millions) First Quarter 2016 First Quarter 2015 Income Income before before Revenue Taxes Revenue Taxes North America $ 1,464 $ (10 ) $ 3,222 $ 416 Latin America 1,280 296 1,648 354 Europe/CIS/Africa 1,698 320 2,538 532 Middle East & Asia 2,002 446 2,703 774 Eliminations & other 76 (151 ) 137 (83 ) Pretax operating income 901 1,993 Corporate & other (1) (172 ) (192 ) Interest income (2) 13 8 Interest expense (3) (120 ) (76 ) Charges and credits - (439 ) $ 6,520 $ 622 $ 10,248 $ 1,294  (1) Comprised principally of certain corporate expenses not allocated to the segments, stock-based compensation costs, amortization expense associated with certain intangible assets, certain centrally managed initiatives and other nonoperating items.  (2) Interest income excludes amounts which are included in the segments' income ($6 million in 2016; $5 million in 2015).  (3) Interest expense excludes amounts which are included in the segments' income ($13 million in 2016; $6 million in 2015).  First-quarter 2016 revenue of $6.5 billion was 36% lower year-on-year, while pretax operating income of $901 million was lower by 55%. Pretax operating margin decreased 563 bps to 13.8%  North America first-quarter 2016 revenue of $1.5 billion decreased 55% year-on-year as the US land rig count declined 62% and customer budgets were significantly reduced. Land revenue declined 62%, in line with the rig count decline. Offshore revenue decreased 30% as a result of lower activity, project delays and lower multiclient sales.  Revenue for the International Areas of $5.0 billion decreased 28% year-on-year due to a combination of customer budget cuts, activity disruptions and continued pricing pressure.  North America pretax operating margin declined 1,357 bps year-on-year to -1% while International Area pretax operating margin of 21% decreased 277 bps year-on-year. These decreases were primarily attributable to the severe activity decline and pricing pressure.  Reservoir Characterization Group  First-quarter 2016 revenue of $1.7 billion was 34% lower than the same period of 2015 primarily due to lower customer spending on discretionary and exploration activities, which impacted Wireline and Testing Technologies as well as software and multiclient sales.  Year-on-year, pretax operating margin decreased 635 bps to 19% primarily as a result of the unfavorable revenue mix due to the decrease in high-margin exploration activities.  Drilling Group  First-quarter 2016 revenue of $2.5 billion was 36% lower than the same period of 2015, while pretax operating margin decreased 496 bps to 15%. These declines were primarily due to the sharp drop in drilling activity combined with persistent pricing pressure that mainly affected Drilling & Measurements and M-I SWACO Technologies.  Production Group  First-quarter 2016 revenue of $2.3 billion decreased 37% year-on-year primarily attributable to Well Services pressure pumping technologies driven by the severe activity decline and pricing pressure as the land rig count declined dramatically in North America.  Year-on-year pretax operating margin decreased 580 bps to 9% as lower activity and pricing pressure continued in North America land.  Interest and Other Income Interest & other income consisted of the following: (Stated in millions) First Quarter 2016 2015 Equity in net earnings of affiliated companies $ 25 $ 35 Interest income 20 14 $ 45 $ 49  Other Research & engineering and General & administrative expenses, as a percentage of Revenue, for the first quarter ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: First Quarter 2016 2015 Research & engineering 3.7 % 2.6 % General & administrative 1.7 % 1.2 %  Although Research & engineering and General & administrative costs have increased as a percentage of Revenue, they have decreased in absolute dollar terms as a result of cost control measures that Schlumberger has implemented.  Interest expense of $133 million for the first quarter of 2016 increased by $51 million compared to the same period of the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the issuance of $6.0 billion of Senior Notes during the fourth quarter of 2015.  The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2016 was 15.9% compared to 23.6% for the same period of the prior year. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2015 was significantly impacted by the charges and credits described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Excluding the impact of the charges and credits, the effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2015 was 20.9%. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the geographic mix of earnings, as Schlumberger generated a smaller portion of its pretax earnings in North America during the first quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period last year.  Charges and Credits  Schlumberger recorded charges during the first quarter of 2015, all of which were classified as Restructuring & other in the Consolidated Statement of Income. These charges, which are summarized below, are more fully described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  (Stated in millions)   Pretax Tax Net Workforce reduction $ 390 $ 56 $ 334 Currency devaluation loss in Venezuela 49 - 49 $ 439 $ 56 $ 383  Schlumberger did not record any charges or credits during the first quarter of 2016.  Going forward, Schlumberger will continue to tailor its cost and resource levels to activity in order to protect its financial strength. This will likely result in charges in future periods.  Net Debt  Net Debt represents gross debt less cash, short-term investments and fixed income investments, held to maturity. Management believes that Net Debt provides useful information regarding the level of Schlumberger indebtedness by reflecting cash and investments that could be used to repay debt.  Details of changes in Net Debt follow:  (Stated in millions)   Three Months ended Mar. 31, 2016 2015 Net income $ 523 $ 988 Restructuring and other charges - 439 Depreciation and amortization (1) 967 1,042 Earnings of equity method investments, less dividends received (25 ) (35 ) Pension and other postretirement benefits expense 60 114 Stock-based compensation expense 61 80 Pension and other postretirement benefits funding (45 ) (120 ) Increase in working capital (463 ) (770 ) Other 132 32 Cash flow from operations 1,210 1,770 Capital expenditures (549 ) (606 ) SPM investments (597 ) (109 ) Multiclient seismic data capitalized (167 ) (101 ) Free cash flow (2) (103 ) 954 Dividends paid (629 ) (512 ) Proceeds from employee stock plans 163 182 Stock repurchase program (475 ) (719 ) (1,044 ) (95 ) Business acquisitions and investments, net of cash acquired plus debt assumed (81 ) (79 ) Other 18 74 Increase in Net Debt (1,107 ) (100 ) Net Debt, Beginning of period (5,547 ) (5,387 ) Net Debt, End of period $ (6,654 ) $ (5,487 )  (1) Includes depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortization of intangible assets, multiclient seismic data costs and SPM investments.

Schlumberger had repurchased $9.1 billion of shares under this new share repurchase program as of March 31, 2016.  The following table summarizes the activity under this share repurchase program:  (Stated in millions, except per share amounts)   Total cost Total number Average price of shares of shares paid per purchased purchased share Three months ended March 31, 2016 $ 475 7.1 $ 67.34 Three months ended March 31, 2015 $ 719 8.7 $ 82.98  On January 21, 2016, the Board of directors approved a new $10 billion share repurchase program for Schlumberger common stock. The new program will take effect once the remaining $0.9 billion authorized to be repurchased under the July 18, 2013 program is exhausted.  � Capital expenditures were $0.5 billion during the first three months of 2016 compared to $0.6 billion during the first three months of 2015. Capital expenditures for full-year 2016 are expected to be approximately $2.0 billion (including approximately $160 million from the effect of the recently completed Cameron acquisition), as compared to expenditures of $2.4 billion in 2015.  Schlumberger has experienced delays in payment from its customers in Venezuela. In April 2016, Schlumberger announced that it will reduce its activity in Venezuela to align operations with cash collections as a result of insufficient payments received in recent quarters and a lack of progress in establishing new mechanisms that address past and future accounts receivable. Schlumberger remains fully committed to supporting the Venezuelan exploration and production industry. The reduction in activity levels will be made in close coordination with all customers in Venezuela to continue servicing those customers with available cash flow, while allowing for a safe and orderly wind down of operations for others. Venezuela represented less than 5% of Schlumberger's consolidated revenue during the first quarter of 2016 and for the full-year 2015.  Schlumberger operates in more than 85 countries. At March 31, 2016, only five of those countries individually accounted for greater than 5% of Schlumberger's accounts receivable balances, of which only Venezuela accounted for greater than 10%. Schlumberger's net receivable balance in Venezuela as of March 31, 2016 was approximately $1.2 billion.  On April 1, 2016, Schlumberger acquired all of the outstanding shares of Cameron International Corporation (Cameron), a leading provider of flow equipment products, systems and services to the oil and gas industry worldwide. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Cameron became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Schlumberger. Each share of Cameron common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger was converted into the right to receive 0.716 share of Schlumberger stock and $14.44 in cash. As a result, Schlumberger issued approximately 138 million shares of its common stock and paid cash of  approximately $2.8 billion in connection with this transaction. Based on the closing price of Schlumberger's common stock on April 1, 2016, the total fair value of the consideration transferred to effect the acquisition of Cameron was approximately $12.9 billion. Cameron's revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the three months ended March 31, 2016 was $8.8 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively.  As of March 31, 2016, Schlumberger had $14.4 billion of cash and short-term investments on hand. Schlumberger had separate committed debt facility agreements aggregating $6.8 billion with commercial banks, of which $2.1 billion was available and unused as of March 31, 2016. The $6.8 billion of committed debt facility agreements included $6.5 billion of committed facilities that support commercial paper programs. Schlumberger believes that these amounts are sufficient to meet future business requirements for at least the next 12 months.  Borrowings under the commercial paper programs at March 31, 2016 were $4.8 billion.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  This Form 10-Q and other statements we make contain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which include any statements that are not historical facts, such as our forecasts or expectations regarding business outlook; growth for Schlumberger as a whole and for each of its segments (and for specified products or geographic areas within each segment); oil and natural gas demand and production growth; oil and natural gas prices; improvements in operating procedures and technology; capital expenditures by Schlumberger and the oil and gas industry; the business strategies of Schlumberger's customers; the integration of Cameron into our business; the anticipated benefits of the Cameron transaction; the success of Schlumberger's joint ventures and alliances; future global economic conditions; and future results of operations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, global economic conditions; changes in exploration and production spending by Schlumberger's customers and changes in the level of oil and natural gas exploration and development; general economic, political and business conditions in key regions of the world; foreign currency risk; pricing erosion; weather and seasonal factors; operational modifications, delays or cancellations; production declines; changes in government regulations and regulatory requirements, including those related to offshore oil and gas exploration, radioactive sources, explosives, chemicals, hydraulic fracturing services and climate-related initiatives; the inability of technology to meet new challenges in exploration; the inability to successfully integrate Cameron and to realize expected synergies; the inability to retain key employees; and other risks and uncertainties detailed in this first-quarter 2016 Form 10-Q and our most recent Form 10-K and other filings that we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission. If one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize (or the consequences of any such development changes), or should our underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual outcomes may vary materially from those reflected in our forward-looking statements. Schlumberger disclaims any intention or obligation to update publicly or revise such statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Warning on Recruitment Fraud


Beware – recruitment scams on the increase!
Fraudsters pretending to represent Schlumberger are sending e-mails, letters and texts offering employment to prospective employees. These offers often look legitimate and include job description, salary, and benefit details.
These fraudsters then ask for payment to obtain visas or to process immigration documents.
We never ask for payment to process documents, we never refer you to a third party to process applications or visas, and we never ask you to pay costs.
Never send money or pass on personal details to anyone suggesting they can provide employment with Schlumberger, and never reply to an email address that does not end in @slb.com.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

History[edit]




This Houston building, as of 2015, houses the Schlumberger U.S. executive offices






Schlumberger complex in Sugar Land, Texas


Schlumberger was founded in 1926 by brothers Conrad and Marcel Schlumberger from the Alsace region in France as the Société de prospection électrique (French: Electric Prospecting Company). The company recorded the first-ever electrical resistivity well log in Merkwiller-Pechelbronn, France in 1927. Today Schlumberger supplies the petroleum industry with services such as seismic acquisition and processing, formation evaluation, well testing and directional drilling, well cementing and stimulation, artificial lift, well completions, flow assurance and consulting, and software and information management. The company is also involved in the groundwater extraction[11] and carbon capture and storage industries.[12]
The brothers had experience conducting geophysical surveys in countries such as Romania, Canada, Serbia, South Africa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the United States. The new company sold electrical-measurement mapping services, and recorded the first-ever electrical resistivity well log in Merkwiller-Pechelbronn, France in 1927. The company quickly expanded, logging its first well in the U.S. in 1929, in Kern County, California. In 1935, the Schlumberger Well Surveying Corporation was founded in Houston, later evolving into Schlumberger Well Services, and finally Schlumberger Wireline & Testing. Schlumberger invested heavily in research, inaugurating the Schlumberger-Doll Research Center in Ridgefield, Connecticut in 1948, contributing to the development of a number of new logging tools. In 1956, Schlumberger Limited was incorporated as a holding company for all Schlumberger businesses, which by now included American testing and production company Johnston Testers.[citation needed]
Over the years, Schlumberger continued to expand its operations and acquisitions. In 1960, Dowell Schlumberger (50% Schlumberger, 50% Dow Chemical), which specialized in pumping services for the oil industry, was formed. In 1962, Schlumberger Limited became listed on the New York Stock Exchange.[13] That same year, Schlumberger purchased Daystrom, an electronic instruments manufacturer in South Boston, Virginia which was making furniture by the time the division was sold to Sperry & Hutchinson in 1971.[14] Schlumberger purchased 50% of Forex in 1964 and merged it with 50% of Languedocienne to create the Neptune Drilling Company. The first computerized reservoir analysis, SARABAND, was introduced in 1970. The remaining 50% of Forex was acquired the following year; Neptune was renamed Forex Neptune Drilling Company. In 1979, Fairchild Camera and Instrument (including Fairchild Semiconductor) became a subsidiary of Schlumberger Limited.
Schlumberger established the first international data links with e-mail in 1981. In 1983, Schlumberger opened their Cambridge Research Center in Cambridge, England and in 2012 it was renamed the Schlumberger Gould Research Center after the company's former CEO Andrew Gould.[15]
The SEDCO drilling rig company and half of Dowell of North America were acquired in 1984, resulting in the creation of the Anadrill drilling segment, a combination of Dowell and The Analysts' drilling segments. Forex Neptune was merged with SEDCO to create the Sedco Forex Drilling Company the following year, when Schlumberger purchased Merlin and 50% of GECO.[citation needed]
In 1987, Schlumberger completed their purchases of Neptune (North America), Bosco and Cori (Italy), and Allmess (Germany). That same year, National Semiconductor acquired Fairchild Semiconductor from Schlumberger for $122 million.[16] In 1991, Schlumberger acquired PRAKLA-SEISMOS, and pioneered the use of geosteering to plan the drill path in horizontal wells.[citation needed]
Schlumberger acquired software company GeoQuest Systems in 1992. With the purchase came the conversion of SINet to TCP/IP and www capability. In the 1990s Schlumberger bought out the petroleum division, AEG meter, and ECLIPSE reservoir study team Intera Technologies Corp. A joint venture between Schlumberger and Cable & Wireless resulted with the creation of Omnes, which then handled all of Schlumberger's internal IT business. Oilphase and Camco International were also purchased.[citation needed]
In 1999, Schlumberger and Smith International created a joint venture, M-I L.L.C., the world's largest drilling fluids (or mud) company. The company consists of 60% Smith International, and 40% Schlumberger. Since the joint venture was prohibited by a 1994 antitrust consent decree barring Smith from selling or combining their fluids business with certain other companies, including Schlumberger, the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. found Smith International Inc. and Schlumberger Ltd. guilty of criminal contempt and fined each company $750,000 and placed each company on five years probation. Both companies also agreed to pay a total of $13.1 million, representing a full disgorgement of all of the joint venture's profits during the time the companies were in contempt.[17]
In 2000, the Geco-Prakla division was merged with Western Geophysical to create the seismic contracting company WesternGeco, of which Schlumberger held a 70% stake, the remaining 30% belonging to competitor Baker Hughes. Sedco Forex was spun off, and merged with Transocean Drilling company in 2000.[citation needed]
In 2001, Schlumberger acquired the IT consultancy company Sema plc for $5.2 billion. The company was an Athens 2004 Summer Olympics partner, but Schlumberger's venture into IT consultancy did not pay off, and divestiture of Sema to Atos Origin was completed that year for $1.5 billion. The cards division was divested through an IPO to form Axalto, which later merged with Gemplus to form Gemalto, and the Messaging Solutions unit was spun off and merged with Taral Networks to form Airwide Solutions. In 2003, the Automated Test Equipment group, part of the 1979 Fairchild Semiconductor acquisition, was spun off to NPTest Holding, which later sold it to Credence.[citation needed]
In 2004, Schlumberger Business Consulting was launched. Based in Paris, it is the company's management consultancy arm. [18]
In 2005, Schlumberger purchased Waterloo Hydrogeologic,[19][unreliable source?] which was followed by several other groundwater industry related companies, such as Westbay Instruments, and Van Essen Instruments. Also that year, Schlumberger relocated its U.S. corporate offices from New York to Houston.[20]
In 2006, Schlumberger purchased the remaining 30% of WesternGeco from Baker Hughes for US$2.4 billion.[21] Also that year, the Schlumberger-Doll Research Center was relocated to a newly built research facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts to replace the Ridgefield, Connecticut research center. The facility joins the other research centers operated by the company in Cambridge, England; Moscow, Russia; Stavanger, Norway; and Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.[22]
In 2010, the acquisition of Smith International in an all-stock deal valued at $11.3 billion was announced. The sale price is 45.84-a-share price was 37.5 percent higher than Smith closing price on 18 February 2010. The deal is the biggest acquisition in Schlumberger history.[23] The merger was completed on August 27, 2010.[24] Also announced in 2010 were Schlumberger plans to acquire Geoservices, a French-based company specializing in energy services, in a deal valued at $1.1 billion, including debt.[25]
In 2014, Schlumberger announced the purchase of the remaining shares of SES Holdings Limited (“Saxon”), a Calgary-based provider of international land drilling services, from First Reserve and certain members of Saxon management. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals. Schulmberger had a minority share in Saxon previously.[26]
In 2015, Schlumberger was indicted by the US Department of Justice for sanction violations of conducting business in Iran and Sudan; the company was fined $233 million, amounting to the largest fine for sanctions to date.[27]
Due to a downturn in the global oil & gas industry in 2015, Schlumberger announced 21,000 layoffs accounting for 15% of their total workforce.[28]
In August 2015, Schlumberger agreed to acquire oilfield equipment manufacturer Cameron International for $14.8 billion.[29]
Schlumberger is the global leader in Hydraulic Fracturing patents, as of 2017.[30]

Schlumberger maintains a 33-acre (13 ha) campus at the northeast corner of U.S. Highway 90A and Gillingham Lane in Sugar Land, Texas; as of 2015 Schlumberger is the second largest employer in the city. In 2015 Schlumberger announced that it was moving its U.S. corporate headquarters to the Sugar Land facility from its Houston office building. The company plans to build new buildings with a scheduled completion time of late 2017. They include a total of 250,000 square feet (23,000 m2) of Class A office space and an "amenities" building with 100,000 square feet (9,300 m2) of space.[33]
In the 1930s the North American headquarters were established in Houston. In the 1970s, the company's top executives in North America were relocated to New York City. By 2006 the head office had 50 executives and support staff. By that year the company was moving that office to a building near the Houston Galleria.[34]
Schlumberger moved its Houston-area offices from 5000 Gulf Freeway in Houston to the Sugar Land campus in 1995.[35][36][37]
Environmental record[edit]
In 2009, Newsweek released their "Green Rankings" [38] a ranking of the 500 largest corporations on track records on a number of environmental issues. Schlumberger was ranked 118th out of 500 overall, and 3rd out of 31 in their industry. Newsweek remarked that to mitigate global warming Schlumberger has invested in carbon sequestration which involves long-term storage of CO2 and that the company's seismic survey ships are 20% to 25% more fuel-efficient than those of other seismic contractors from using fuels that emit less pollution and towing equipment that creates less drag on the vessels.[39]
Radioactive Sources[edit]
In 2006, a radioactive canister imported by Schlumberger was recovered in the Western Australian outback desert.[40] The canister had been lost in by the company's transport partner, when the improperly secured container fell off the trailer on which it was being transported.[41]
In 2010, the Aberdeen Sheriff court fined Schlumberger Oilfield UK £300,000 for losing a radioactive source on the rig floor on the Ensco 101 mobile drilling rig in the North Sea for 4 hours.[42]
Spills[edit]
In 2009, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection fined Chesapeake Appalachia LLC and Schlumberger Technology Corp. more than $15,500 each for a hydrochloric acid spill in February 2009 at Chesapeake's Chancellor natural gas well site in Asylum Township, Bradford County, Pennsylvania. Officials said the leak did not contaminate groundwater.[43]
Brownfields[edit]
In 2006, as the current owner of a facility in Pickens, South Carolina, Schlumberger agreed to pay $11.8 million to federal and state agencies for a problem caused by the previous owner, Sangamo-Weston, a capacitor manufacturing plant. The cause of the problem was from polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) released into the environment by Sangamo-Weston from 1955 to 1987. According to the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division, an additional agreement by Schlumberger to purchase and remove dams will directly improve the Twelvemile Creek, South Carolina ecosystem and provide significant environmental benefits for the affected communities.[44]
Deepwater Horizon[edit]
Schlumberger was contracted to perform wireline logging on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. However, the wireline log was cancelled and the Schlumberger standby crew was released by BP and left the rig earlier on the same day of the Deepwater Horizon explosion.[45]

History[edit]




This Houston building, as of 2015, houses the Schlumberger U.S. executive offices






Schlumberger complex in Sugar Land, Texas


Schlumberger was founded in 1926 by brothers Conrad and Marcel Schlumberger from the Alsace region in France as the Société de prospection électrique (French: Electric Prospecting Company). The company recorded the first-ever electrical resistivity well log in Merkwiller-Pechelbronn, France in 1927. Today Schlumberger supplies the petroleum industry with services such as seismic acquisition and processing, formation evaluation, well testing and directional drilling, well cementing and stimulation, artificial lift, well completions, flow assurance and consulting, and software and information management. The company is also involved in the groundwater extraction[11] and carbon capture and storage industries.[12]
The brothers had experience conducting geophysical surveys in countries such as Romania, Canada, Serbia, South Africa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the United States. The new company sold electrical-measurement mapping services, and recorded the first-ever electrical resistivity well log in Merkwiller-Pechelbronn, France in 1927. The company quickly expanded, logging its first well in the U.S. in 1929, in Kern County, California. In 1935, the Schlumberger Well Surveying Corporation was founded in Houston, later evolving into Schlumberger Well Services, and finally Schlumberger Wireline & Testing. Schlumberger invested heavily in research, inaugurating the Schlumberger-Doll Research Center in Ridgefield, Connecticut in 1948, contributing to the development of a number of new logging tools. In 1956, Schlumberger Limited was incorporated as a holding company for all Schlumberger businesses, which by now included American testing and production company Johnston Testers.[citation needed]
Over the years, Schlumberger continued to expand its operations and acquisitions. In 1960, Dowell Schlumberger (50% Schlumberger, 50% Dow Chemical), which specialized in pumping services for the oil industry, was formed. In 1962, Schlumberger Limited became listed on the New York Stock Exchange.[13] That same year, Schlumberger purchased Daystrom, an electronic instruments manufacturer in South Boston, Virginia which was making furniture by the time the division was sold to Sperry & Hutchinson in 1971.[14] Schlumberger purchased 50% of Forex in 1964 and merged it with 50% of Languedocienne to create the Neptune Drilling Company. The first computerized reservoir analysis, SARABAND, was introduced in 1970. The remaining 50% of Forex was acquired the following year; Neptune was renamed Forex Neptune Drilling Company. In 1979, Fairchild Camera and Instrument (including Fairchild Semiconductor) became a subsidiary of Schlumberger Limited.
Schlumberger established the first international data links with e-mail in 1981. In 1983, Schlumberger opened their Cambridge Research Center in Cambridge, England and in 2012 it was renamed the Schlumberger Gould Research Center after the company's former CEO Andrew Gould.[15]
The SEDCO drilling rig company and half of Dowell of North America were acquired in 1984, resulting in the creation of the Anadrill drilling segment, a combination of Dowell and The Analysts' drilling segments. Forex Neptune was merged with SEDCO to create the Sedco Forex Drilling Company the following year, when Schlumberger purchased Merlin and 50% of GECO.[citation needed]
In 1987, Schlumberger completed their purchases of Neptune (North America), Bosco and Cori (Italy), and Allmess (Germany). That same year, National Semiconductor acquired Fairchild Semiconductor from Schlumberger for $122 million.[16] In 1991, Schlumberger acquired PRAKLA-SEISMOS, and pioneered the use of geosteering to plan the drill path in horizontal wells.[citation needed]
Schlumberger acquired software company GeoQuest Systems in 1992. With the purchase came the conversion of SINet to TCP/IP and www capability. In the 1990s Schlumberger bought out the petroleum division, AEG meter, and ECLIPSE reservoir study team Intera Technologies Corp. A joint venture between Schlumberger and Cable & Wireless resulted with the creation of Omnes, which then handled all of Schlumberger's internal IT business. Oilphase and Camco International were also purchased.[citation needed]
In 1999, Schlumberger and Smith International created a joint venture, M-I L.L.C., the world's largest drilling fluids (or mud) company. The company consists of 60% Smith International, and 40% Schlumberger. Since the joint venture was prohibited by a 1994 antitrust consent decree barring Smith from selling or combining their fluids business with certain other companies, including Schlumberger, the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. found Smith International Inc. and Schlumberger Ltd. guilty of criminal contempt and fined each company $750,000 and placed each company on five years probation. Both companies also agreed to pay a total of $13.1 million, representing a full disgorgement of all of the joint venture's profits during the time the companies were in contempt.[17]
In 2000, the Geco-Prakla division was merged with Western Geophysical to create the seismic contracting company WesternGeco, of which Schlumberger held a 70% stake, the remaining 30% belonging to competitor Baker Hughes. Sedco Forex was spun off, and merged with Transocean Drilling company in 2000.[citation needed]
In 2001, Schlumberger acquired the IT consultancy company Sema plc for $5.2 billion. The company was an Athens 2004 Summer Olympics partner, but Schlumberger's venture into IT consultancy did not pay off, and divestiture of Sema to Atos Origin was completed that year for $1.5 billion. The cards division was divested through an IPO to form Axalto, which later merged with Gemplus to form Gemalto, and the Messaging Solutions unit was spun off and merged with Taral Networks to form Airwide Solutions. In 2003, the Automated Test Equipment group, part of the 1979 Fairchild Semiconductor acquisition, was spun off to NPTest Holding, which later sold it to Credence.[citation needed]
In 2004, Schlumberger Business Consulting was launched. Based in Paris, it is the company's management consultancy arm. [18]
In 2005, Schlumberger purchased Waterloo Hydrogeologic,[19][unreliable source?] which was followed by several other groundwater industry related companies, such as Westbay Instruments, and Van Essen Instruments. Also that year, Schlumberger relocated its U.S. corporate offices from New York to Houston.[20]
In 2006, Schlumberger purchased the remaining 30% of WesternGeco from Baker Hughes for US$2.4 billion.[21] Also that year, the Schlumberger-Doll Research Center was relocated to a newly built research facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts to replace the Ridgefield, Connecticut research center. The facility joins the other research centers operated by the company in Cambridge, England; Moscow, Russia; Stavanger, Norway; and Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.[22]
In 2010, the acquisition of Smith International in an all-stock deal valued at $11.3 billion was announced. The sale price is 45.84-a-share price was 37.5 percent higher than Smith closing price on 18 February 2010. The deal is the biggest acquisition in Schlumberger history.[23] The merger was completed on August 27, 2010.[24] Also announced in 2010 were Schlumberger plans to acquire Geoservices, a French-based company specializing in energy services, in a deal valued at $1.1 billion, including debt.[25]
In 2014, Schlumberger announced the purchase of the remaining shares of SES Holdings Limited (“Saxon”), a Calgary-based provider of international land drilling services, from First Reserve and certain members of Saxon management. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals. Schulmberger had a minority share in Saxon previously.[26]
In 2015, Schlumberger was indicted by the US Department of Justice for sanction violations of conducting business in Iran and Sudan; the company was fined $233 million, amounting to the largest fine for sanctions to date.[27]
Due to a downturn in the global oil & gas industry in 2015, Schlumberger announced 21,000 layoffs accounting for 15% of their total workforce.[28]
In August 2015, Schlumberger agreed to acquire oilfield equipment manufacturer Cameron International for $14.8 billion.[29]
Schlumberger is the global leader in Hydraulic Fracturing patents, as of 2017.[30]
Corporate affairs[edit]
France[edit]
Its Paris offices are in Le Palatin 1 in the La Défense business district and in Puteaux, France, near Paris.[31][32]
United States[edit]
Schlumberger maintains a 33-acre (13 ha) campus at the northeast corner of U.S. Highway 90A and Gillingham Lane in Sugar Land, Texas; as of 2015 Schlumberger is the second largest employer in the city. In 2015 Schlumberger announced that it was moving its U.S. corporate headquarters to the Sugar Land facility from its Houston office building. The company plans to build new buildings with a scheduled completion time of late 2017. They include a total of 250,000 square feet (23,000 m2) of Class A office space and an "amenities" building with 100,000 square feet (9,300 m2) of space.[33]
In the 1930s the North American headquarters were established in Houston. In the 1970s, the company's top executives in North America were relocated to New York City. By 2006 the head office had 50 executives and support staff. By that year the company was moving that office to a building near the Houston Galleria.[34]
Schlumberger moved its Houston-area offices from 5000 Gulf Freeway in Houston to the Sugar Land campus in 1995.[35][36][37]
Environmental record[edit]
In 2009, Newsweek released their "Green Rankings" [38] a ranking of the 500 largest corporations on track records on a number of environmental issues. Schlumberger was ranked 118th out of 500 overall, and 3rd out of 31 in their industry. Newsweek remarked that to mitigate global warming Schlumberger has invested in carbon sequestration which involves long-term storage of CO2 and that the company's seismic survey ships are 20% to 25% more fuel-efficient than those of other seismic contractors from using fuels that emit less pollution and towing equipment that creates less drag on the vessels.[39]
Radioactive Sources[edit]
In 2006, a radioactive canister imported by Schlumberger was recovered in the Western Australian outback desert.[40] The canister had been lost in by the company's transport partner, when the improperly secured container fell off the trailer on which it was being transported.[41]
In 2010, the Aberdeen Sheriff court fined Schlumberger Oilfield UK £300,000 for losing a radioactive source on the rig floor on the Ensco 101 mobile drilling rig in the North Sea for 4 hours.[42]
Spills[edit]
In 2009, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection fined Chesapeake Appalachia LLC and Schlumberger Technology Corp. more than $15,500 each for a hydrochloric acid spill in February 2009 at Chesapeake's Chancellor natural gas well site in Asylum Township, Bradford County, Pennsylvania. Officials said the leak did not contaminate groundwater.[43]
Brownfields[edit]
In 2006, as the current owner of a facility in Pickens, South Carolina, Schlumberger agreed to pay $11.8 million to federal and state agencies for a problem caused by the previous owner, Sangamo-Weston, a capacitor manufacturing plant. The cause of the problem was from polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) released into the environment by Sangamo-Weston from 1955 to 1987. According to the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division, an additional agreement by Schlumberger to purchase and remove dams will directly improve the Twelvemile Creek, South Carolina ecosystem and provide significant environmental benefits for the affected communities.[44]
Deepwater Horizon[edit]
Schlumberger was contracted to perform wireline logging on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. However, the wireline log was cancelled and the Schlumberger standby crew was released by BP and left the rig earlier on the same day of the Deepwater Horizon explosion.[45]

History[edit]




This Houston building, as of 2015, houses the Schlumberger U.S. executive offices






Schlumberger complex in Sugar Land, Texas


Schlumberger was founded in 1926 by brothers Conrad and Marcel Schlumberger from the Alsace region in France as the Société de prospection électrique (French: Electric Prospecting Company). The company recorded the first-ever electrical resistivity well log in Merkwiller-Pechelbronn, France in 1927. Today Schlumberger supplies the petroleum industry with services such as seismic acquisition and processing, formation evaluation, well testing and directional drilling, well cementing and stimulation, artificial lift, well completions, flow assurance and consulting, and software and information management. The company is also involved in the groundwater extraction[11] and carbon capture and storage industries.[12]
The brothers had experience conducting geophysical surveys in countries such as Romania, Canada, Serbia, South Africa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the United States. The new company sold electrical-measurement mapping services, and recorded the first-ever electrical resistivity well log in Merkwiller-Pechelbronn, France in 1927. The company quickly expanded, logging its first well in the U.S. in 1929, in Kern County, California. In 1935, the Schlumberger Well Surveying Corporation was founded in Houston, later evolving into Schlumberger Well Services, and finally Schlumberger Wireline & Testing. Schlumberger invested heavily in research, inaugurating the Schlumberger-Doll Research Center in Ridgefield, Connecticut in 1948, contributing to the development of a number of new logging tools. In 1956, Schlumberger Limited was incorporated as a holding company for all Schlumberger businesses, which by now included American testing and production company Johnston Testers.[citation needed]
Over the years, Schlumberger continued to expand its operations and acquisitions. In 1960, Dowell Schlumberger (50% Schlumberger, 50% Dow Chemical), which specialized in pumping services for the oil industry, was formed. In 1962, Schlumberger Limited became listed on the New York Stock Exchange.[13] That same year, Schlumberger purchased Daystrom, an electronic instruments manufacturer in South Boston, Virginia which was making furniture by the time the division was sold to Sperry & Hutchinson in 1971.[14] Schlumberger purchased 50% of Forex in 1964 and merged it with 50% of Languedocienne to create the Neptune Drilling Company. The first computerized reservoir analysis, SARABAND, was introduced in 1970. The remaining 50% of Forex was acquired the following year; Neptune was renamed Forex Neptune Drilling Company. In 1979, Fairchild Camera and Instrument (including Fairchild Semiconductor) became a subsidiary of Schlumberger Limited.
Schlumberger established the first international data links with e-mail in 1981. In 1983, Schlumberger opened their Cambridge Research Center in Cambridge, England and in 2012 it was renamed the Schlumberger Gould Research Center after the company's former CEO Andrew Gould.[15]
The SEDCO drilling rig company and half of Dowell of North America were acquired in 1984, resulting in the creation of the Anadrill drilling segment, a combination of Dowell and The Analysts' drilling segments. Forex Neptune was merged with SEDCO to create the Sedco Forex Drilling Company the following year, when Schlumberger purchased Merlin and 50% of GECO.[citation needed]
In 1987, Schlumberger completed their purchases of Neptune (North America), Bosco and Cori (Italy), and Allmess (Germany). That same year, National Semiconductor acquired Fairchild Semiconductor from Schlumberger for $122 million.[16] In 1991, Schlumberger acquired PRAKLA-SEISMOS, and pioneered the use of geosteering to plan the drill path in horizontal wells.[citation needed]
Schlumberger acquired software company GeoQuest Systems in 1992. With the purchase came the conversion of SINet to TCP/IP and www capability. In the 1990s Schlumberger bought out the petroleum division, AEG meter, and ECLIPSE reservoir study team Intera Technologies Corp. A joint venture between Schlumberger and Cable & Wireless resulted with the creation of Omnes, which then handled all of Schlumberger's internal IT business. Oilphase and Camco International were also purchased.[citation needed]
In 1999, Schlumberger and Smith International created a joint venture, M-I L.L.C., the world's largest drilling fluids (or mud) company. The company consists of 60% Smith International, and 40% Schlumberger. Since the joint venture was prohibited by a 1994 antitrust consent decree barring Smith from selling or combining their fluids business with certain other companies, including Schlumberger, the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. found Smith International Inc. and Schlumberger Ltd. guilty of criminal contempt and fined each company $750,000 and placed each company on five years probation. Both companies also agreed to pay a total of $13.1 million, representing a full disgorgement of all of the joint venture's profits during the time the companies were in contempt.[17]
In 2000, the Geco-Prakla division was merged with Western Geophysical to create the seismic contracting company WesternGeco, of which Schlumberger held a 70% stake, the remaining 30% belonging to competitor Baker Hughes. Sedco Forex was spun off, and merged with Transocean Drilling company in 2000.[citation needed]
In 2001, Schlumberger acquired the IT consultancy company Sema plc for $5.2 billion. The company was an Athens 2004 Summer Olympics partner, but Schlumberger's venture into IT consultancy did not pay off, and divestiture of Sema to Atos Origin was completed that year for $1.5 billion. The cards division was divested through an IPO to form Axalto, which later merged with Gemplus to form Gemalto, and the Messaging Solutions unit was spun off and merged with Taral Networks to form Airwide Solutions. In 2003, the Automated Test Equipment group, part of the 1979 Fairchild Semiconductor acquisition, was spun off to NPTest Holding, which later sold it to Credence.[citation needed]
In 2004, Schlumberger Business Consulting was launched. Based in Paris, it is the company's management consultancy arm. [18]
In 2005, Schlumberger purchased Waterloo Hydrogeologic,[19][unreliable source?] which was followed by several other groundwater industry related companies, such as Westbay Instruments, and Van Essen Instruments. Also that year, Schlumberger relocated its U.S. corporate offices from New York to Houston.[20]
In 2006, Schlumberger purchased the remaining 30% of WesternGeco from Baker Hughes for US$2.4 billion.[21] Also that year, the Schlumberger-Doll Research Center was relocated to a newly built research facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts to replace the Ridgefield, Connecticut research center. The facility joins the other research centers operated by the company in Cambridge, England; Moscow, Russia; Stavanger, Norway; and Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.[22]
In 2010, the acquisition of Smith International in an all-stock deal valued at $11.3 billion was announced. The sale price is 45.84-a-share price was 37.5 percent higher than Smith closing price on 18 February 2010. The deal is the biggest acquisition in Schlumberger history.[23] The merger was completed on August 27, 2010.[24] Also announced in 2010 were Schlumberger plans to acquire Geoservices, a French-based company specializing in energy services, in a deal valued at $1.1 billion, including debt.[25]
In 2014, Schlumberger announced the purchase of the remaining shares of SES Holdings Limited (“Saxon”), a Calgary-based provider of international land drilling services, from First Reserve and certain members of Saxon management. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals. Schulmberger had a minority share in Saxon previously.[26]
In 2015, Schlumberger was indicted by the US Department of Justice for sanction violations of conducting business in Iran and Sudan; the company was fined $233 million, amounting to the largest fine for sanctions to date.[27]
Due to a downturn in the global oil & gas industry in 2015, Schlumberger announced 21,000 layoffs accounting for 15% of their total workforce.[28]
In August 2015, Schlumberger agreed to acquire oilfield equipment manufacturer Cameron International for $14.8 billion.[29]
Schlumberger is the global leader in Hydraulic Fracturing patents, as of 2017.[30]
Corporate affairs[edit]
France[edit]
Its Paris offices are in Le Palatin 1 in the La Défense business district and in Puteaux, France, near Paris.[31][32]
United States[edit]
Schlumberger maintains a 33-acre (13 ha) campus at the northeast corner of U.S. Highway 90A and Gillingham Lane in Sugar Land, Texas; as of 2015 Schlumberger is the second largest employer in the city. In 2015 Schlumberger announced that it was moving its U.S. corporate headquarters to the Sugar Land facility from its Houston office building. The company plans to build new buildings with a scheduled completion time of late 2017. They include a total of 250,000 square feet (23,000 m2) of Class A office space and an "amenities" building with 100,000 square feet (9,300 m2) of space.[33]
In the 1930s the North American headquarters were established in Houston. In the 1970s, the company's top executives in North America were relocated to New York City. By 2006 the head office had 50 executives and support staff. By that year the company was moving that office to a building near the Houston Galleria.[34]
Schlumberger moved its Houston-area offices from 5000 Gulf Freeway in Houston to the Sugar Land campus in 1995.[35][36][37]
Environmental record[edit]
In 2009, Newsweek released their "Green Rankings" [38] a ranking of the 500 largest corporations on track records on a number of environmental issues. Schlumberger was ranked 118th out of 500 overall, and 3rd out of 31 in their industry. Newsweek remarked that to mitigate global warming Schlumberger has invested in carbon sequestration which involves long-term storage of CO2 and that the company's seismic survey ships are 20% to 25% more fuel-efficient than those of other seismic contractors from using fuels that emit less pollution and towing equipment that creates less drag on the vessels.[39]
Radioactive Sources[edit]
In 2006, a radioactive canister imported by Schlumberger was recovered in the Western Australian outback desert.[40] The canister had been lost in by the company's transport partner, when the improperly secured container fell off the trailer on which it was being transported.[41]
In 2010, the Aberdeen Sheriff court fined Schlumberger Oilfield UK £300,000 for losing a radioactive source on the rig floor on the Ensco 101 mobile drilling rig in the North Sea for 4 hours.[42]
Spills[edit]
In 2009, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection fined Chesapeake Appalachia LLC and Schlumberger Technology Corp. more than $15,500 each for a hydrochloric acid spill in February 2009 at Chesapeake's Chancellor natural gas well site in Asylum Township, Bradford County, Pennsylvania. Officials said the leak did not contaminate groundwater.[43]
Brownfields[edit]
In 2006, as the current owner of a facility in Pickens, South Carolina, Schlumberger agreed to pay $11.8 million to federal and state agencies for a problem caused by the previous owner, Sangamo-Weston, a capacitor manufacturing plant. The cause of the problem was from polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) released into the environment by Sangamo-Weston from 1955 to 1987. According to the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division, an additional agreement by Schlumberger to purchase and remove dams will directly improve the Twelvemile Creek, South Carolina ecosystem and provide significant environmental benefits for the affected communities.[44]
Deepwater Horizon[edit]
Schlumberger was contracted to perform wireline logging on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. However, the wireline log was cancelled and the Schlumberger standby crew was released by BP and left the rig earlier on the same day of the Deepwater Horizon explosion.[45]

History[edit]




This Houston building, as of 2015, houses the Schlumberger U.S. executive offices






Schlumberger complex in Sugar Land, Texas


Schlumberger was founded in 1926 by brothers Conrad and Marcel Schlumberger from the Alsace region in France as the Société de prospection électrique (French: Electric Prospecting Company). The company recorded the first-ever electrical resistivity well log in Merkwiller-Pechelbronn, France in 1927. Today Schlumberger supplies the petroleum industry with services such as seismic acquisition and processing, formation evaluation, well testing and directional drilling, well cementing and stimulation, artificial lift, well completions, flow assurance and consulting, and software and information management. The company is also involved in the groundwater extraction[11] and carbon capture and storage industries.[12]
The brothers had experience conducting geophysical surveys in countries such as Romania, Canada, Serbia, South Africa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the United States. The new company sold electrical-measurement mapping services, and recorded the first-ever electrical resistivity well log in Merkwiller-Pechelbronn, France in 1927. The company quickly expanded, logging its first well in the U.S. in 1929, in Kern County, California. In 1935, the Schlumberger Well Surveying Corporation was founded in Houston, later evolving into Schlumberger Well Services, and finally Schlumberger Wireline & Testing. Schlumberger invested heavily in research, inaugurating the Schlumberger-Doll Research Center in Ridgefield, Connecticut in 1948, contributing to the development of a number of new logging tools. In 1956, Schlumberger Limited was incorporated as a holding company for all Schlumberger businesses, which by now included American testing and production company Johnston Testers.[citation needed]
Over the years, Schlumberger continued to expand its operations and acquisitions. In 1960, Dowell Schlumberger (50% Schlumberger, 50% Dow Chemical), which specialized in pumping services for the oil industry, was formed. In 1962, Schlumberger Limited became listed on the New York Stock Exchange.[13] That same year, Schlumberger purchased Daystrom, an electronic instruments manufacturer in South Boston, Virginia which was making furniture by the time the division was sold to Sperry & Hutchinson in 1971.[14] Schlumberger purchased 50% of Forex in 1964 and merged it with 50% of Languedocienne to create the Neptune Drilling Company. The first computerized reservoir analysis, SARABAND, was introduced in 1970. The remaining 50% of Forex was acquired the following year; Neptune was renamed Forex Neptune Drilling Company. In 1979, Fairchild Camera and Instrument (including Fairchild Semiconductor) became a subsidiary of Schlumberger Limited.
Schlumberger established the first international data links with e-mail in 1981. In 1983, Schlumberger opened their Cambridge Research Center in Cambridge, England and in 2012 it was renamed the Schlumberger Gould Research Center after the company's former CEO Andrew Gould.[15]
The SEDCO drilling rig company and half of Dowell of North America were acquired in 1984, resulting in the creation of the Anadrill drilling segment, a combination of Dowell and The Analysts' drilling segments. Forex Neptune was merged with SEDCO to create the Sedco Forex Drilling Company the following year, when Schlumberger purchased Merlin and 50% of GECO.[citation needed]
In 1987, Schlumberger completed their purchases of Neptune (North America), Bosco and Cori (Italy), and Allmess (Germany). That same year, National Semiconductor acquired Fairchild Semiconductor from Schlumberger for $122 million.[16] In 1991, Schlumberger acquired PRAKLA-SEISMOS, and pioneered the use of geosteering to plan the drill path in horizontal wells.[citation needed]
Schlumberger acquired software company GeoQuest Systems in 1992. With the purchase came the conversion of SINet to TCP/IP and www capability. In the 1990s Schlumberger bought out the petroleum division, AEG meter, and ECLIPSE reservoir study team Intera Technologies Corp. A joint venture between Schlumberger and Cable & Wireless resulted with the creation of Omnes, which then handled all of Schlumberger's internal IT business. Oilphase and Camco International were also purchased.[citation needed]
In 1999, Schlumberger and Smith International created a joint venture, M-I L.L.C., the world's largest drilling fluids (or mud) company. The company consists of 60% Smith International, and 40% Schlumberger. Since the joint venture was prohibited by a 1994 antitrust consent decree barring Smith from selling or combining their fluids business with certain other companies, including Schlumberger, the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. found Smith International Inc. and Schlumberger Ltd. guilty of criminal contempt and fined each company $750,000 and placed each company on five years probation. Both companies also agreed to pay a total of $13.1 million, representing a full disgorgement of all of the joint venture's profits during the time the companies were in contempt.[17]
In 2000, the Geco-Prakla division was merged with Western Geophysical to create the seismic contracting company WesternGeco, of which Schlumberger held a 70% stake, the remaining 30% belonging to competitor Baker Hughes. Sedco Forex was spun off, and merged with Transocean Drilling company in 2000.[citation needed]
In 2001, Schlumberger acquired the IT consultancy company Sema plc for $5.2 billion. The company was an Athens 2004 Summer Olympics partner, but Schlumberger's venture into IT consultancy did not pay off, and divestiture of Sema to Atos Origin was completed that year for $1.5 billion. The cards division was divested through an IPO to form Axalto, which later merged with Gemplus to form Gemalto, and the Messaging Solutions unit was spun off and merged with Taral Networks to form Airwide Solutions. In 2003, the Automated Test Equipment group, part of the 1979 Fairchild Semiconductor acquisition, was spun off to NPTest Holding, which later sold it to Credence.[citation needed]
In 2004, Schlumberger Business Consulting was launched. Based in Paris, it is the company's management consultancy arm. [18]
In 2005, Schlumberger purchased Waterloo Hydrogeologic,[19][unreliable source?] which was followed by several other groundwater industry related companies, such as Westbay Instruments, and Van Essen Instruments. Also that year, Schlumberger relocated its U.S. corporate offices from New York to Houston.[20]
In 2006, Schlumberger purchased the remaining 30% of WesternGeco from Baker Hughes for US$2.4 billion.[21] Also that year, the Schlumberger-Doll Research Center was relocated to a newly built research facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts to replace the Ridgefield, Connecticut research center. The facility joins the other research centers operated by the company in Cambridge, England; Moscow, Russia; Stavanger, Norway; and Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.[22]
In 2010, the acquisition of Smith International in an all-stock deal valued at $11.3 billion was announced. The sale price is 45.84-a-share price was 37.5 percent higher than Smith closing price on 18 February 2010. The deal is the biggest acquisition in Schlumberger history.[23] The merger was completed on August 27, 2010.[24] Also announced in 2010 were Schlumberger plans to acquire Geoservices, a French-based company specializing in energy services, in a deal valued at $1.1 billion, including debt.[25]
In 2014, Schlumberger announced the purchase of the remaining shares of SES Holdings Limited (“Saxon”), a Calgary-based provider of international land drilling services, from First Reserve and certain members of Saxon management. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals. Schulmberger had a minority share in Saxon previously.[26]
In 2015, Schlumberger was indicted by the US Department of Justice for sanction violations of conducting business in Iran and Sudan; the company was fined $233 million, amounting to the largest fine for sanctions to date.[27]
Due to a downturn in the global oil & gas industry in 2015, Schlumberger announced 21,000 layoffs accounting for 15% of their total workforce.[28]
In August 2015, Schlumberger agreed to acquire oilfield equipment manufacturer Cameron International for $14.8 billion.[29]
Schlumberger is the global leader in Hydraulic Fracturing patents, as of 2017.[30]
Corporate affairs[edit]
France[edit]
Its Paris offices are in Le Palatin 1 in the La Défense business district and in Puteaux, France, near Paris.[31][32]
United States[edit]
Schlumberger maintains a 33-acre (13 ha) campus at the northeast corner of U.S. Highway 90A and Gillingham Lane in Sugar Land, Texas; as of 2015 Schlumberger is the second largest employer in the city. In 2015 Schlumberger announced that it was moving its U.S. corporate headquarters to the Sugar Land facility from its Houston office building. The company plans to build new buildings with a scheduled completion time of late 2017. They include a total of 250,000 square feet (23,000 m2) of Class A office space and an "amenities" building with 100,000 square feet (9,300 m2) of space.[33]
In the 1930s the North American headquarters were established in Houston. In the 1970s, the company's top executives in North America were relocated to New York City. By 2006 the head office had 50 executives and support staff. By that year the company was moving that office to a building near the Houston Galleria.[34]
Schlumberger moved its Houston-area offices from 5000 Gulf Freeway in Houston to the Sugar Land campus in 1995.[35][36][37]
Environmental record[edit]
In 2009, Newsweek released their "Green Rankings" [38] a ranking of the 500 largest corporations on track records on a number of environmental issues. Schlumberger was ranked 118th out of 500 overall, and 3rd out of 31 in their industry. Newsweek remarked that to mitigate global warming Schlumberger has invested in carbon sequestration which involves long-term storage of CO2 and that the company's seismic survey ships are 20% to 25% more fuel-efficient than those of other seismic contractors from using fuels that emit less pollution and towing equipment that creates less drag on the vessels.[39]
Radioactive Sources[edit]
In 2006, a radioactive canister imported by Schlumberger was recovered in the Western Australian outback desert.[40] The canister had been lost in by the company's transport partner, when the improperly secured container fell off the trailer on which it was being transported.[41]
In 2010, the Aberdeen Sheriff court fined Schlumberger Oilfield UK £300,000 for losing a radioactive source on the rig floor on the Ensco 101 mobile drilling rig in the North Sea for 4 hours.[42]
Spills[edit]
In 2009, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection fined Chesapeake Appalachia LLC and Schlumberger Technology Corp. more than $15,500 each for a hydrochloric acid spill in February 2009 at Chesapeake's Chancellor natural gas well site in Asylum Township, Bradford County, Pennsylvania. Officials said the leak did not contaminate groundwater.[43]
Brownfields[edit]
In 2006, as the current owner of a facility in Pickens, South Carolina, Schlumberger agreed to pay $11.8 million to federal and state agencies for a problem caused by the previous owner, Sangamo-Weston, a capacitor manufacturing plant. The cause of the problem was from polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) released into the environment by Sangamo-Weston from 1955 to 1987. According to the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division, an additional agreement by Schlumberger to purchase and remove dams will directly improve the Twelvemile Creek, South Carolina ecosystem and provide significant environmental benefits for the affected communities.[44]
Deepwater Horizon[edit]
Schlumberger was contracted to perform wireline logging on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. However, the wireline log was cancelled and the Schlumberger standby crew was released by BP and left the rig earlier on the same day of the Deepwater Horizon explosion.[45]

History[edit]




This Houston building, as of 2015, houses the Schlumberger U.S. executive offices






Schlumberger complex in Sugar Land, Texas


Schlumberger was founded in 1926 by brothers Conrad and Marcel Schlumberger from the Alsace region in France as the Société de prospection électrique (French: Electric Prospecting Company). The company recorded the first-ever electrical resistivity well log in Merkwiller-Pechelbronn, France in 1927. Today Schlumberger supplies the petroleum industry with services such as seismic acquisition and processing, formation evaluation, well testing and directional drilling, well cementing and stimulation, artificial lift, well completions, flow assurance and consulting, and software and information management. The company is also involved in the groundwater extraction[11] and carbon capture and storage industries.[12]
The brothers had experience conducting geophysical surveys in countries such as Romania, Canada, Serbia, South Africa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the United States. The new company sold electrical-measurement mapping services, and recorded the first-ever electrical resistivity well log in Merkwiller-Pechelbronn, France in 1927. The company quickly expanded, logging its first well in the U.S. in 1929, in Kern County, California. In 1935, the Schlumberger Well Surveying Corporation was founded in Houston, later evolving into Schlumberger Well Services, and finally Schlumberger Wireline & Testing. Schlumberger invested heavily in research, inaugurating the Schlumberger-Doll Research Center in Ridgefield, Connecticut in 1948, contributing to the development of a number of new logging tools. In 1956, Schlumberger Limited was incorporated as a holding company for all Schlumberger businesses, which by now included American testing and production company Johnston Testers.[citation needed]
Over the years, Schlumberger continued to expand its operations and acquisitions. In 1960, Dowell Schlumberger (50% Schlumberger, 50% Dow Chemical), which specialized in pumping services for the oil industry, was formed. In 1962, Schlumberger Limited became listed on the New York Stock Exchange.[13] That same year, Schlumberger purchased Daystrom, an electronic instruments manufacturer in South Boston, Virginia which was making furniture by the time the division was sold to Sperry & Hutchinson in 1971.[14] Schlumberger purchased 50% of Forex in 1964 and merged it with 50% of Languedocienne to create the Neptune Drilling Company. The first computerized reservoir analysis, SARABAND, was introduced in 1970. The remaining 50% of Forex was acquired the following year; Neptune was renamed Forex Neptune Drilling Company. In 1979, Fairchild Camera and Instrument (including Fairchild Semiconductor) became a subsidiary of Schlumberger Limited.
Schlumberger established the first international data links with e-mail in 1981. In 1983, Schlumberger opened their Cambridge Research Center in Cambridge, England and in 2012 it was renamed the Schlumberger Gould Research Center after the company's former CEO Andrew Gould.[15]
The SEDCO drilling rig company and half of Dowell of North America were acquired in 1984, resulting in the creation of the Anadrill drilling segment, a combination of Dowell and The Analysts' drilling segments. Forex Neptune was merged with SEDCO to create the Sedco Forex Drilling Company the following year, when Schlumberger purchased Merlin and 50% of GECO.[citation needed]
In 1987, Schlumberger completed their purchases of Neptune (North America), Bosco and Cori (Italy), and Allmess (Germany). That same year, National Semiconductor acquired Fairchild Semiconductor from Schlumberger for $122 million.[16] In 1991, Schlumberger acquired PRAKLA-SEISMOS, and pioneered the use of geosteering to plan the drill path in horizontal wells.[citation needed]
Schlumberger acquired software company GeoQuest Systems in 1992. With the purchase came the conversion of SINet to TCP/IP and www capability. In the 1990s Schlumberger bought out the petroleum division, AEG meter, and ECLIPSE reservoir study team Intera Technologies Corp. A joint venture between Schlumberger and Cable & Wireless resulted with the creation of Omnes, which then handled all of Schlumberger's internal IT business. Oilphase and Camco International were also purchased.[citation needed]
In 1999, Schlumberger and Smith International created a joint venture, M-I L.L.C., the world's largest drilling fluids (or mud) company. The company consists of 60% Smith International, and 40% Schlumberger. Since the joint venture was prohibited by a 1994 antitrust consent decree barring Smith from selling or combining their fluids business with certain other companies, including Schlumberger, the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. found Smith International Inc. and Schlumberger Ltd. guilty of criminal contempt and fined each company $750,000 and placed each company on five years probation. Both companies also agreed to pay a total of $13.1 million, representing a full disgorgement of all of the joint venture's profits during the time the companies were in contempt.[17]
In 2000, the Geco-Prakla division was merged with Western Geophysical to create the seismic contracting company WesternGeco, of which Schlumberger held a 70% stake, the remaining 30% belonging to competitor Baker Hughes. Sedco Forex was spun off, and merged with Transocean Drilling company in 2000.[citation needed]
In 2001, Schlumberger acquired the IT consultancy company Sema plc for $5.2 billion. The company was an Athens 2004 Summer Olympics partner, but Schlumberger's venture into IT consultancy did not pay off, and divestiture of Sema to Atos Origin was completed that year for $1.5 billion. The cards division was divested through an IPO to form Axalto, which later merged with Gemplus to form Gemalto, and the Messaging Solutions unit was spun off and merged with Taral Networks to form Airwide Solutions. In 2003, the Automated Test Equipment group, part of the 1979 Fairchild Semiconductor acquisition, was spun off to NPTest Holding, which later sold it to Credence.[citation needed]
In 2004, Schlumberger Business Consulting was launched. Based in Paris, it is the company's management consultancy arm. [18]
In 2005, Schlumberger purchased Waterloo Hydrogeologic,[19][unreliable source?] which was followed by several other groundwater industry related companies, such as Westbay Instruments, and Van Essen Instruments. Also that year, Schlumberger relocated its U.S. corporate offices from New York to Houston.[20]
In 2006, Schlumberger purchased the remaining 30% of WesternGeco from Baker Hughes for US$2.4 billion.[21] Also that year, the Schlumberger-Doll Research Center was relocated to a newly built research facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts to replace the Ridgefield, Connecticut research center. The facility joins the other research centers operated by the company in Cambridge, England; Moscow, Russia; Stavanger, Norway; and Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.[22]
In 2010, the acquisition of Smith International in an all-stock deal valued at $11.3 billion was announced. The sale price is 45.84-a-share price was 37.5 percent higher than Smith closing price on 18 February 2010. The deal is the biggest acquisition in Schlumberger history.[23] The merger was completed on August 27, 2010.[24] Also announced in 2010 were Schlumberger plans to acquire Geoservices, a French-based company specializing in energy services, in a deal valued at $1.1 billion, including debt.[25]
In 2014, Schlumberger announced the purchase of the remaining shares of SES Holdings Limited (“Saxon”), a Calgary-based provider of international land drilling services, from First Reserve and certain members of Saxon management. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals. Schulmberger had a minority share in Saxon previously.[26]
In 2015, Schlumberger was indicted by the US Department of Justice for sanction violations of conducting business in Iran and Sudan; the company was fined $233 million, amounting to the largest fine for sanctions to date.[27]
Due to a downturn in the global oil & gas industry in 2015, Schlumberger announced 21,000 layoffs accounting for 15% of their total workforce.[28]
In August 2015, Schlumberger agreed to acquire oilfield equipment manufacturer Cameron International for $14.8 billion.[29]
Schlumberger is the global leader in Hydraulic Fracturing patents, as of 2017.[30]
Corporate affairs[edit]
France[edit]
Its Paris offices are in Le Palatin 1 in the La Défense business district and in Puteaux, France, near Paris.[31][32]
United States[edit]
Schlumberger maintains a 33-acre (13 ha) campus at the northeast corner of U.S. Highway 90A and Gillingham Lane in Sugar Land, Texas; as of 2015 Schlumberger is the second largest employer in the city. In 2015 Schlumberger announced that it was moving its U.S. corporate headquarters to the Sugar Land facility from its Houston office building. The company plans to build new buildings with a scheduled completion time of late 2017. They include a total of 250,000 square feet (23,000 m2) of Class A office space and an "amenities" building with 100,000 square feet (9,300 m2) of space.[33]
In the 1930s the North American headquarters were established in Houston. In the 1970s, the company's top executives in North America were relocated to New York City. By 2006 the head office had 50 executives and support staff. By that year the company was moving that office to a building near the Houston Galleria.[34]
Schlumberger moved its Houston-area offices from 5000 Gulf Freeway in Houston to the Sugar Land campus in 1995.[35][36][37]
Environmental record[edit]
In 2009, Newsweek released their "Green Rankings" [38] a ranking of the 500 largest corporations on track records on a number of environmental issues. Schlumberger was ranked 118th out of 500 overall, and 3rd out of 31 in their industry. Newsweek remarked that to mitigate global warming Schlumberger has invested in carbon sequestration which involves long-term storage of CO2 and that the company's seismic survey ships are 20% to 25% more fuel-efficient than those of other seismic contractors from using fuels that emit less pollution and towing equipment that creates less drag on the vessels.[39]
Radioactive Sources[edit]
In 2006, a radioactive canister imported by Schlumberger was recovered in the Western Australian outback desert.[40] The canister had been lost in by the company's transport partner, when the improperly secured container fell off the trailer on which it was being transported.[41]
In 2010, the Aberdeen Sheriff court fined Schlumberger Oilfield UK £300,000 for losing a radioactive source on the rig floor on the Ensco 101 mobile drilling rig in the North Sea for 4 hours.[42]
Spills[edit]
In 2009, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection fined Chesapeake Appalachia LLC and Schlumberger Technology Corp. more than $15,500 each for a hydrochloric acid spill in February 2009 at Chesapeake's Chancellor natural gas well site in Asylum Township, Bradford County, Pennsylvania. Officials said the leak did not contaminate groundwater.[43]
Brownfields[edit]
In 2006, as the current owner of a facility in Pickens, South Carolina, Schlumberger agreed to pay $11.8 million to federal and state agencies for a problem caused by the previous owner, Sangamo-Weston, a capacitor manufacturing plant. The cause of the problem was from polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) released into the environment by Sangamo-Weston from 1955 to 1987. According to the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division, an additional agreement by Schlumberger to purchase and remove dams will directly improve the Twelvemile Creek, South Carolina ecosystem and provide significant environmental benefits for the affected communities.[44]
Deepwater Horizon[edit]
Schlumberger was contracted to perform wireline logging on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. However, the wireline log was cancelled and the Schlumberger standby crew was released by BP and left the rig earlier on the same day of the Deepwater Horizon explosion.[45]

History[edit]




This Houston building, as of 2015, houses the Schlumberger U.S. executive offices






Schlumberger complex in Sugar Land, Texas


Schlumberger was founded in 1926 by brothers Conrad and Marcel Schlumberger from the Alsace region in France as the Société de prospection électrique (French: Electric Prospecting Company). The company recorded the first-ever electrical resistivity well log in Merkwiller-Pechelbronn, France in 1927. Today Schlumberger supplies the petroleum industry with services such as seismic acquisition and processing, formation evaluation, well testing and directional drilling, well cementing and stimulation, artificial lift, well completions, flow assurance and consulting, and software and information management. The company is also involved in the groundwater extraction[11] and carbon capture and storage industries.[12]
The brothers had experience conducting geophysical surveys in countries such as Romania, Canada, Serbia, South Africa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the United States. The new company sold electrical-measurement mapping services, and recorded the first-ever electrical resistivity well log in Merkwiller-Pechelbronn, France in 1927. The company quickly expanded, logging its first well in the U.S. in 1929, in Kern County, California. In 1935, the Schlumberger Well Surveying Corporation was founded in Houston, later evolving into Schlumberger Well Services, and finally Schlumberger Wireline & Testing. Schlumberger invested heavily in research, inaugurating the Schlumberger-Doll Research Center in Ridgefield, Connecticut in 1948, contributing to the development of a number of new logging tools. In 1956, Schlumberger Limited was incorporated as a holding company for all Schlumberger businesses, which by now included American testing and production company Johnston Testers.[citation needed]
Over the years, Schlumberger continued to expand its operations and acquisitions. In 1960, Dowell Schlumberger (50% Schlumberger, 50% Dow Chemical), which specialized in pumping services for the oil industry, was formed. In 1962, Schlumberger Limited became listed on the New York Stock Exchange.[13] That same year, Schlumberger purchased Daystrom, an electronic instruments manufacturer in South Boston, Virginia which was making furniture by the time the division was sold to Sperry & Hutchinson in 1971.[14] Schlumberger purchased 50% of Forex in 1964 and merged it with 50% of Languedocienne to create the Neptune Drilling Company. The first computerized reservoir analysis, SARABAND, was introduced in 1970. The remaining 50% of Forex was acquired the following year; Neptune was renamed Forex Neptune Drilling Company. In 1979, Fairchild Camera and Instrument (including Fairchild Semiconductor) became a subsidiary of Schlumberger Limited.
Schlumberger established the first international data links with e-mail in 1981. In 1983, Schlumberger opened their Cambridge Research Center in Cambridge, England and in 2012 it was renamed the Schlumberger Gould Research Center after the company's former CEO Andrew Gould.[15]
The SEDCO drilling rig company and half of Dowell of North America were acquired in 1984, resulting in the creation of the Anadrill drilling segment, a combination of Dowell and The Analysts' drilling segments. Forex Neptune was merged with SEDCO to create the Sedco Forex Drilling Company the following year, when Schlumberger purchased Merlin and 50% of GECO.[citation needed]
In 1987, Schlumberger completed their purchases of Neptune (North America), Bosco and Cori (Italy), and Allmess (Germany). That same year, National Semiconductor acquired Fairchild Semiconductor from Schlumberger for $122 million.[16] In 1991, Schlumberger acquired PRAKLA-SEISMOS, and pioneered the use of geosteering to plan the drill path in horizontal wells.[citation needed]
Schlumberger acquired software company GeoQuest Systems in 1992. With the purchase came the conversion of SINet to TCP/IP and www capability. In the 1990s Schlumberger bought out the petroleum division, AEG meter, and ECLIPSE reservoir study team Intera Technologies Corp. A joint venture between Schlumberger and Cable & Wireless resulted with the creation of Omnes, which then handled all of Schlumberger's internal IT business. Oilphase and Camco International were also purchased.[citation needed]
In 1999, Schlumberger and Smith International created a joint venture, M-I L.L.C., the world's largest drilling fluids (or mud) company. The company consists of 60% Smith International, and 40% Schlumberger. Since the joint venture was prohibited by a 1994 antitrust consent decree barring Smith from selling or combining their fluids business with certain other companies, including Schlumberger, the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. found Smith International Inc. and Schlumberger Ltd. guilty of criminal contempt and fined each company $750,000 and placed each company on five years probation. Both companies also agreed to pay a total of $13.1 million, representing a full disgorgement of all of the joint venture's profits during the time the companies were in contempt.[17]
In 2000, the Geco-Prakla division was merged with Western Geophysical to create the seismic contracting company WesternGeco, of which Schlumberger held a 70% stake, the remaining 30% belonging to competitor Baker Hughes. Sedco Forex was spun off, and merged with Transocean Drilling company in 2000.[citation needed]
In 2001, Schlumberger acquired the IT consultancy company Sema plc for $5.2 billion. The company was an Athens 2004 Summer Olympics partner, but Schlumberger's venture into IT consultancy did not pay off, and divestiture of Sema to Atos Origin was completed that year for $1.5 billion. The cards division was divested through an IPO to form Axalto, which later merged with Gemplus to form Gemalto, and the Messaging Solutions unit was spun off and merged with Taral Networks to form Airwide Solutions. In 2003, the Automated Test Equipment group, part of the 1979 Fairchild Semiconductor acquisition, was spun off to NPTest Holding, which later sold it to Credence.[citation needed]
In 2004, Schlumberger Business Consulting was launched. Based in Paris, it is the company's management consultancy arm. [18]
In 2005, Schlumberger purchased Waterloo Hydrogeologic,[19][unreliable source?] which was followed by several other groundwater industry related companies, such as Westbay Instruments, and Van Essen Instruments. Also that year, Schlumberger relocated its U.S. corporate offices from New York to Houston.[20]
In 2006, Schlumberger purchased the remaining 30% of WesternGeco from Baker Hughes for US$2.4 billion.[21] Also that year, the Schlumberger-Doll Research Center was relocated to a newly built research facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts to replace the Ridgefield, Connecticut research center. The facility joins the other research centers operated by the company in Cambridge, England; Moscow, Russia; Stavanger, Norway; and Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.[22]
In 2010, the acquisition of Smith International in an all-stock deal valued at $11.3 billion was announced. The sale price is 45.84-a-share price was 37.5 percent higher than Smith closing price on 18 February 2010. The deal is the biggest acquisition in Schlumberger history.[23] The merger was completed on August 27, 2010.[24] Also announced in 2010 were Schlumberger plans to acquire Geoservices, a French-based company specializing in energy services, in a deal valued at $1.1 billion, including debt.[25]
In 2014, Schlumberger announced the purchase of the remaining shares of SES Holdings Limited (“Saxon”), a Calgary-based provider of international land drilling services, from First Reserve and certain members of Saxon management. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals. Schulmberger had a minority share in Saxon previously.[26]
In 2015, Schlumberger was indicted by the US Department of Justice for sanction violations of conducting business in Iran and Sudan; the company was fined $233 million, amounting to the largest fine for sanctions to date.[27]
Due to a downturn in the global oil & gas industry in 2015, Schlumberger announced 21,000 layoffs accounting for 15% of their total workforce.[28]
In August 2015, Schlumberger agreed to acquire oilfield equipment manufacturer Cameron International for $14.8 billion.[29]
Schlumberger is the global leader in Hydraulic Fracturing patents, as of 2017.[30]
Corporate affairs[edit]
France[edit]
Its Paris offices are in Le Palatin 1 in the La Défense business district and in Puteaux, France, near Paris.[31][32]
United States[edit]
Schlumberger maintains a 33-acre (13 ha) campus at the northeast corner of U.S. Highway 90A and Gillingham Lane in Sugar Land, Texas; as of 2015 Schlumberger is the second largest employer in the city. In 2015 Schlumberger announced that it was moving its U.S. corporate headquarters to the Sugar Land facility from its Houston office building. The company plans to build new buildings with a scheduled completion time of late 2017. They include a total of 250,000 square feet (23,000 m2) of Class A office space and an "amenities" building with 100,000 square feet (9,300 m2) of space.[33]
In the 1930s the North American headquarters were established in Houston. In the 1970s, the company's top executives in North America were relocated to New York City. By 2006 the head office had 50 executives and support staff. By that year the company was moving that office to a building near the Houston Galleria.[34]
Schlumberger moved its Houston-area offices from 5000 Gulf Freeway in Houston to the Sugar Land campus in 1995.[35][36][37]
Environmental record[edit]
In 2009, Newsweek released their "Green Rankings" [38] a ranking of the 500 largest corporations on track records on a number of environmental issues. Schlumberger was ranked 118th out of 500 overall, and 3rd out of 31 in their industry. Newsweek remarked that to mitigate global warming Schlumberger has invested in carbon sequestration which involves long-term storage of CO2 and that the company's seismic survey ships are 20% to 25% more fuel-efficient than those of other seismic contractors from using fuels that emit less pollution and towing equipment that creates less drag on the vessels.[39]
Radioactive Sources[edit]
In 2006, a radioactive canister imported by Schlumberger was recovered in the Western Australian outback desert.[40] The canister had been lost in by the company's transport partner, when the improperly secured container fell off the trailer on which it was being transported.[41]
In 2010, the Aberdeen Sheriff court fined Schlumberger Oilfield UK £300,000 for losing a radioactive source on the rig floor on the Ensco 101 mobile drilling rig in the North Sea for 4 hours.[42]
Spills[edit]
In 2009, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection fined Chesapeake Appalachia LLC and Schlumberger Technology Corp. more than $15,500 each for a hydrochloric acid spill in February 2009 at Chesapeake's Chancellor natural gas well site in Asylum Township, Bradford County, Pennsylvania. Officials said the leak did not contaminate groundwater.[43]
Brownfields[edit]
In 2006, as the current owner of a facility in Pickens, South Carolina, Schlumberger agreed to pay $11.8 million to federal and state agencies for a problem caused by the previous owner, Sangamo-Weston, a capacitor manufacturing plant. The cause of the problem was from polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) released into the environment by Sangamo-Weston from 1955 to 1987. According to the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division, an additional agreement by Schlumberger to purchase and remove dams will directly improve the Twelvemile Creek, South Carolina ecosystem and provide significant environmental benefits for the affected communities.[44]
Deepwater Horizon[edit]
Schlumberger was contracted to perform wireline logging on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. However, the wireline log was cancelled and the Schlumberger standby crew was released by BP and left the rig earlier on the same day of the Deepwater Horizon explosion.[45]
