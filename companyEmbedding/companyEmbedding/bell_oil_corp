Scam Alert


We are aware of unscrupulous activity that has taken place recently to solicit advance fees and documentation in relation to non-existing jobs. The advertisements in the form of emails or posted job websites will often say that upon payment of a fee you will be assured of employment within our company. Please note that we will never ask you for a fee at any point during our recruitment process.
 
Never respond to or become involved in any such request, no matter how attractive the employment offer may seem. Do not give out your personal information or bank account details. You can report details of any suspected scams to enquiries@belloil.com.
 
Please be advised that www.belloil.com is the only official website of the company. Any other website with a similar name does not belong to Bell Oil & Gas and may be an attempt to mislead the general public.
We dissociate ourselves entirely from any of these fraudulent or illegal activities, or any information and material contained in these emails and websites.
