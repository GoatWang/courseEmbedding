 About Us

Calvert is a recognized leader in Responsible Investing. Our mission is to deliver superior long-term performance to our clients and to enable them to achieve positive impact.
Calvert Research and Management traces its roots to Calvert Investments, which was founded in 1976 and was the first to launch a socially responsible mutual fund that avoided investment in companies that did business in apartheid-era South Africa. Today, the Calvert Funds are one of the largest and most diversified families of responsibly invested mutual funds, encompassing actively and passively managed strategies, U.S. and international equity strategies, fixed-income strategies, and asset allocation funds — all managed in accordance with the Calvert Principles for Responsible Investment.
Through the years, the Calvert Funds have stayed at the forefront of Responsible Investing, applying innovative investment strategies, groundbreaking research, shareholder advocacy programs and public policy initiatives. Today, we’re helping a new generation of investors see financial potential through the lens of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors.

Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.







Past performance is no guarantee of future results.



Diversification and asset allocation do not ensure a profit or guarantee against loss.


          * Fidelity's goal is to make financial expertise broadly accessible and effective in helping people live the lives they want. With assets under administration of $5.6 trillion, including managed assets of $2.1 trillion as of September 30, 2016, we focus on meeting the unique needs of a diverse set of customers: helping more than 24 million people invest their own life savings, nearly 20,000 businesses manage employee benefit programs, as well as providing nearly 10,000 advisory firms with technology solutions to invest their own clients' money.
	
    

          1. Fidelity Management & Research Company and Fidelity Institutional Asset Management, as of 9/30/16. Data is unaudited. These figures reflect the resources of Fidelity Management & Research Company, a U.S. company, and its subsidiaries. Research professionals include portfolio managers, research analysts and research associates.
	
    

          2. Highly rated funds are defined as those funds that have a 4- or 5-Star Morningstar rating. For each fund, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar RatingTM metric each month by subtracting the return on a 90-day U.S. Treasury Bill from the fund's load-adjusted return for the same period, and then adjusting this excess return for risk. The top 10% of funds in each broad asset class receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) Although gathered from reliable sources, data completeness and accuracy cannot be guaranteed by Morningstar.
	
    

          3. You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund’s sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time. Fidelity's government and U.S. Treasury money market funds will not impose a fee upon the sale of your shares, nor temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the fund's weekly liquid assets fall below 30% of its total assets because of market conditions or other factors.
	
    

          4. You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. The fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the Fund's liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund's sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.


          5. You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Because the share price of the fund will fluctuate, when you sell your shares they may be worth more or less than what you originally paid for them. The fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the fund's liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund's sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.


Because of their narrow focus, sector investments tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies.


          Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.
	
    

The securities of smaller, less well known companies can be more volatile than those of larger companies.


Because of their narrow focus, sector investments tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies.


In general, the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk, liquidity risk, call risk, and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so holding them until maturity to avoid losses caused by price volatility is not possible.



Indexes are unmanaged. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

Back to resultsUnderstanding Socially Innovative Investing 




Socially Innovative Investing (S2I), a proprietary strategy developed by U.S. Trust, is based on a growing awareness that strong corporate financial performance and social responsibility are not mutually exclusive; rather, they are mutually beneficial qualities. For investors, S2I seeks to answer yes to an age-old question: Is it possible to do good and do well at the same time?
Utilizing the Principle of Shared Value

The idea of investing according to personal values and beliefs is hardly new. At least since the mid-18th century, when Quakers banned followers from participating in the slave trade, individuals and groups have periodically chosen to avoid investments that conflict with moral, religious, environmental or other values. 
This approach to investing, now often referred to as socially responsible investing, or SRI, is viewed largely in terms of what it doesn't do. Investors choose what not to invest in — such as tobacco, weapons manufacturers and alcohol. And, because SRI entails limiting the universe of potentially profitable investments, the implication is that though this might be a noble endeavor, the investor is challenged by a restricted  investment universe .
During the 1980s, Fortune magazine famously described SRI as "feel good investing" and "politically correct investing." But as interest in SRI has continued to grow, a new, more active and demanding approach to social investing has emerged based on the idea that social responsibility and corporate earnings should naturally go hand in hand. Dr. Michael Porter, of the Institute for Strategy and Competitiveness at Harvard Business School, summed up this new idea: "Corporate Social Responsibility can be much more than a cost, a constraint or a charitable deed — it can be a source of opportunity, innovation and competitive advantage."
Inspired by those words, U.S. Trust has created Socially Innovative Investing, which takes traditional socially responsible investing a step further. S2I incorporates an active, proprietary method for reviewing U.S. securities across a wide spectrum of criteria that weight both social responsibility and financial fundamentals .To be considered for inclusion, companies must be attractive fundamentally, as well as fit global macro investment themes established by U.S. Trust's thought leadership team. During the portfolio construction process, sector weights adhere to U.S. Trust's recommendation.
THE PRINCIPLE OF SHARED VALUE
S2I stands on the idea that corporations and society don't (indeed, can't) thrive as wholly separate, unrelated entities.
Corporations need vibrant communities in order to create demand for their products and to provide a supportive environment in which to operate.
Society needs healthy, competitive companies able to create jobs, buy local goods from the community and pay taxes. Where these needs intersect, in a zone of shared values, is the sweet spot of S2I. It is our conviction that companies that demonstrate and remain committed to policies and practices that enhance their own competitiveness while simultaneously advancing economic and social convictions in their communities not only meet the ethical criteria of socially minded investors but stand best poised to prosper in a pure business sense.
THE FRAMEWORK
Our framework for assessing a company's commitment to social innovation rests on three pillars:

Human capital engagement. How does the company treat all of its stakeholders (employees, shareholders, customers, suppliers and the community)?
Considerations include such issues as the pay gap between management and employees, employee ownership, health and wellness, diversity and product quality, among others.

Environmental stewardship. What policies does the company employ for interacting with the environment?
Considerations include greenhouse gas reduction, renewable energy use, emissions, effluents and wastes, recycling and others.

Corporate philanthropy. What are the standards and procedures regarding its role as a corporate citizen?
Considerations include community engagement, community investment, corporate giving, employee volunteerism and community impact policies.

Measuring a company's actual commitment to these pillars involves a two-part review of stated policies and performance accountability.

Policy review. We review, benchmark and score policies, based on our analysis that good policies indicate good management and are indicators of long-term value creation.

Performance accountability review. Because good intentions don't always result in positive results, we assess companies by how effectively a corporation has implemented its policies. And, crucially, we consider whether it has capitalized on external incentives for good corporate behavior, and avoided costly fines and penalties.

However, it is our belief that while quantifying intent and peerto-peer benchmarking is important, the direct tangible results of the policies must be measured in order to determine their absolute or relative success.
MONITORING AND MAINTAINING THE PORTFOLIO
Continual attention, monitoring and adjustment are required to keep the S2I properly balanced to achieve its goals. We review changes in U.S. Trust's recommended sector allocations and periodically rebalance the portfolio. We monitor position sizes, fundamentals, egregious  social violations and trends in social scoring.


Four myths about social investing debunked
MYTH #1:
Corporate social responsibility comes at the expense of profit.

S2I was designed to identify companies that address social issues as part of their strategies to be more competitive in the marketplace — in keeping with the theory of Shared Value.

Shared Value proposes that companies can improve their longrun position by looking for sustainable competitive advantages, including methods of engaging stakeholders on social issues.


MYTH #2:
Reliable and consistent data are not available.

The Socially Innovative Investing Model addresses transparency and data manipulation by relying predominantly on third-party verified data. The quality of the data and the proprietary weighting of the model form the central value proposition of the strategy.


MYTH #3:
Interpretation of social metrics is extremely subjective.

In our model, hundreds of  independent data points divided into over 30   criteria are collected and scored, and compared with their peers, sector by sector.

Whenever possible, we set metrics and ranges as quantifiable targets.

Our model to determine each company's composite social innovation score is applied uniformly. Companies must meet a minimum rated score, regardless of their sector.


MYTH #4:
Social investing underperforms the broad market.

The S2I methodology was designed both to identify long-term value creators and to mitigate risk.

When SRI strategies underperform, usually they do so because of poor portfolio construction, not social screening. To address this shortcoming, we:


Utilize U.S. Trust® thought leadership for sector overweights and underweights.

Require positive ratings from non-SRI analysts on each eligible security.

Maintain a rigorous buy, sell and rebalance discipline.

We believe we are at the beginning of a secular growth phase for the U.S. economy driven largely by the rebalancing of global growth from the developed to the developing world. We focus on the long-term drivers, the macro forces and investment themes at play across industries that are taking us into the next growth cycle.

Amana Mutual Funds Trust
 





Amana Founders Video

 


Watch Amana Mutual Funds Trust founders, Nick Kaiser and Yaqub Mirza, discuss the creation and history of the Trust.

At Saturna Capital and the Amana Mutual Funds Trust, we endeavor to align our investments with our principles.
Our Funds favor companies with low price-to-earnings multiples, strong balance sheets, and proven businesses. They follow a value-oriented approach consistent with Islamic finance principles. Generally, these principles require that investors avoid interest and investments in businesses such as liquor, pornography, gambling, and banks. The Funds avoid bonds and other conventional fixed-income securities.
Saturna Capital selects investments in companies that to its knowledge do not violate the requirements of the Islamic faith at the time of investment. To ensure that investments continue to meet the requirements of the Islamic faith, Saturna Capital engages Amanie Advisors Sdn Bhd, a leading consultant specializing in Islamic finance.
The Amana Funds limit the securities they purchase to those consistent with Islamic principles. This limits opportunities and may affect performance.
 
 





Saturna White Papers: Educational Series 

  
  
 Dancing with Correlation 
 We explore the correlation between Islamic investment certificates, including sukuk, and other investment asset classes as a means of better understanding the risk and return characteristics of this unique and distinct asset class.
 
   

  
 What Makes Sukuk Halal? 
 We explain what differentiates Islamic investment certificates, often called sukuk, from conventional bonds, and identifies the distinctive features that form the core of what makes sukuk Islamic-compliant, or halal.

 About Us

Calvert is a recognized leader in Responsible Investing. Our mission is to deliver superior long-term performance to our clients and to enable them to achieve positive impact.
Calvert Research and Management traces its roots to Calvert Investments, which was founded in 1976 and was the first to launch a socially responsible mutual fund that avoided investment in companies that did business in apartheid-era South Africa. Today, the Calvert Funds are one of the largest and most diversified families of responsibly invested mutual funds, encompassing actively and passively managed strategies, U.S. and international equity strategies, fixed-income strategies, and asset allocation funds — all managed in accordance with the Calvert Principles for Responsible Investment.
Through the years, the Calvert Funds have stayed at the forefront of Responsible Investing, applying innovative investment strategies, groundbreaking research, shareholder advocacy programs and public policy initiatives. Today, we’re helping a new generation of investors see financial potential through the lens of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only; due to market vola tility, the Fund’s current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage change in net asset value (NAV) with all distributions reinvested. Returns for other classes of share s offered by the Fund are different. Performance less than or equal to one year is cumulative. The share class has no sales charge.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considere d a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding  consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.The Overall Morningstar Rat ing for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns,  60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most  weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Star ratings do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales load.©2017 Morningstar. All  Rights Reserved.

About Risk:

Calvert Investments, Inc., established in 1976, is an investment management company that is headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland and led by John Streur, the firm’s President and Chief Executive Officer. Calvert is one of the largest responsible investment companies in the United States.[1]
To guide its mission of stewarding capital responsibly, Calvert seeks to deliver on what it calls the four pillars of responsible investing. These pillars are financial performance, superior research, shareholder engagement and inclusive prosperity and impact. Financial performance refers to Calvert’s paramount fiduciary responsibility to the investor to achieve the right risk and return profile for the asset class and style of investment. Superior research means gaining a comprehensive understanding of the impact an investment could have on society both positive and negative in order to generate investment returns and avoid risks. Shareholder engagement speaks to Calvert’s commitment to actively engage with companies on behalf of their investors with a focus on environmental, social and governance issues. Finally, inclusive prosperity and impact means recognizing that the original and primary purpose of capitalism was to address problems in society. With this in mind, Calvert works to execute specific investments intended to directly address key problems such as widespread poverty and sub-standard living conditions worldwide.

Timeline[edit]
In addition to Calvert’s investment products and services, several notable milestones have kept Calvert at the forefront of the responsible investing field:

1976: Calvert launched the first variable rate fund in the US before later introducing the Calvert Social Investment Fund (CSIF) in 1982.[2]
1982: the Calvert Social Investment Fund (CSIF) was the first mutual fund to oppose Apartheid, and then one of the first groups to reinvest in free South Africa in 1994.[3]
1986: Calvert became one of the first mutual fund groups to sponsor a shareholder resolution. Calvert filed with the Angelica Corporation, identifying potential financial impact of labor management issue.[4]
1988: Calvert Investments founded the Calvert Foundation, a separate 501(c)3 nonprofit. The goal of the foundation is to invest directly in underserved communities.
1992: Calvert launched World Values Fund (today called the Calvert International Equity Fund) the first International SRI mutual fund.
1992: Calvert started a Special Equities Program for high impact social ventures. At the time, this program was one of the first of its kind in the responsible investing field.
1998: Calvert pursued an advisory opinion from the U.S. Department of Labor in support of the inclusion of sustainable and responsible investment options in defined contribution plans. In a letter to Calvert,[5] the Department of Labor stated that it believes sustainable and responsible investment options are not inconsistent with fiduciary standards.
2000: Calvert introduced The Calvert Social Index (renamed Calvert US Large Cap Core Responsible Index in June 2015) which is an unmanaged index that measures the performance of large, U.S.-based sustainable and responsible companies.
2004: Calvert, in collaboration with the United Nations Development Fund for Women, developed the first global voluntary code of conduct guiding business on how to empower, advance, and invest in women worldwide. The Calvert Women’s Principles were designed to provide companies with specific, measurable goals for achieving gender equity in areas such as hiring, pay and career development as well as representation of women in their management ranks on their boards. Later, in 2010, the UN chose to adapt Calvert Women’s Principles® to create their own Women’s Empowerment Principles.[6]
2007: Calvert began expanding the number of investment strategies offered that addressed global sustainability challenges through favorable investment opportunities . In 2007, Calvert created the Global Alternative Energy Fund, an actively managed SRI fund, renamed Calvert Global Energy Solutions Fund in 2015. The Global Water Fund followed in 2008, and in 2011, Calvert launched the Emerging Markets Equity Fund.[7]
2013: Calvert expanded its fixed-income mutual funds with the launch of Calvert Green Bond Fund.[8]
2014: John Streur was selected as Calvert’s next CEO.[9]
2015: Calvert introduced the Responsible Index Series, a group of low-cost, efficient strategies designed to benefit from the impact that ESG factors can have on a company’s long-term financial stability and revenue.[10]
2015: Calvert launched the Principles for Responsible Investment, which the firm uses to guide investment decisions, balancing a commitment to the needs of financial and nonfinancial stakeholders.[11] Calvert’s passive indices include companies on the basis of these principles and the results of a comprehensive research system, while Calvert’s active investment strategies give priority to the principles as they seek superior risk adjusted financial returns relative to market benchmarks. In conjunction with the Principles for Responsible Investment, Calvert’s research system developed an innovative, new method by coupling increasingly available ESG data and classic financial analysis. The Calvert Research System allows the firm to quantitatively rate and rank companies both inside their respective industry and across the entire investment universe in absolute terms.[12]
2017: Calvert Investment Management (CIM) was purchased by Eaton Vance Corporation and replaced with Calvert Research and Management (CRM).[13]

Special Equities Program: The innovative program gives unique exposure to early-stage venture companies. The program was started in 1992 as a way to identify social entrepreneurs and provide financing needed to create larger social impact and financial return.

The Calvert Foundation[edit]
The Calvert Foundation was founded in 1988 and is a community Development Financial Institution (CDFI). Though the Calvert Foundation has a close relationship with Calvert Investments, the Foundation is a legally separate organization with its own operations and mission. Today, the Calvert Foundation works in approximately 80 countries in varied sectors such as affordable housing development, microfinance, women’s empowerment, fair trade and sustainable agriculture.[14]
The Calvert Foundation’s successes have included the introduction of the Community Investment Notes in 1995, which allows everyday investors to partake in the field of impact investing.

Calvert Investments, Inc., established in 1976, is an investment management company that is headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland and led by John Streur, the firm’s President and Chief Executive Officer. Calvert is one of the largest responsible investment companies in the United States.[1]
To guide its mission of stewarding capital responsibly, Calvert seeks to deliver on what it calls the four pillars of responsible investing. These pillars are financial performance, superior research, shareholder engagement and inclusive prosperity and impact. Financial performance refers to Calvert’s paramount fiduciary responsibility to the investor to achieve the right risk and return profile for the asset class and style of investment. Superior research means gaining a comprehensive understanding of the impact an investment could have on society both positive and negative in order to generate investment returns and avoid risks. Shareholder engagement speaks to Calvert’s commitment to actively engage with companies on behalf of their investors with a focus on environmental, social and governance issues. Finally, inclusive prosperity and impact means recognizing that the original and primary purpose of capitalism was to address problems in society. With this in mind, Calvert works to execute specific investments intended to directly address key problems such as widespread poverty and sub-standard living conditions worldwide.

2007: Calvert began expanding the number of investment strategies offered that addressed global sustainability challenges through favorable investment opportunities . In 2007, Calvert created the Global Alternative Energy Fund, an actively managed SRI fund, renamed Calvert Global Energy Solutions Fund in 2015. The Global Water Fund followed in 2008, and in 2011, Calvert launched the Emerging Markets Equity Fund.[7]
2013: Calvert expanded its fixed-income mutual funds with the launch of Calvert Green Bond Fund.[8]
2014: John Streur was selected as Calvert’s next CEO.[9]
2015: Calvert introduced the Responsible Index Series, a group of low-cost, efficient strategies designed to benefit from the impact that ESG factors can have on a company’s long-term financial stability and revenue.[10]
2015: Calvert launched the Principles for Responsible Investment, which the firm uses to guide investment decisions, balancing a commitment to the needs of financial and nonfinancial stakeholders.[11] Calvert’s passive indices include companies on the basis of these principles and the results of a comprehensive research system, while Calvert’s active investment strategies give priority to the principles as they seek superior risk adjusted financial returns relative to market benchmarks. In conjunction with the Principles for Responsible Investment, Calvert’s research system developed an innovative, new method by coupling increasingly available ESG data and classic financial analysis. The Calvert Research System allows the firm to quantitatively rate and rank companies both inside their respective industry and across the entire investment universe in absolute terms.[12]
2017: Calvert Investment Management (CIM) was purchased by Eaton Vance Corporation and replaced with Calvert Research and Management (CRM).[13]

Calvert Investments in the Community[edit]
Through the investment strategies Calvert offers, investors are able to combine financial impact with environmental and social impact. Today, Calvert Investments targets one-to-three percent of their participating portfolios’ assets to high impact investments directly in communities.

Special Equities Program: The innovative program gives unique exposure to early-stage venture companies. The program was started in 1992 as a way to identify social entrepreneurs and provide financing needed to create larger social impact and financial return.

The Calvert Foundation[edit]
The Calvert Foundation was founded in 1988 and is a community Development Financial Institution (CDFI). Though the Calvert Foundation has a close relationship with Calvert Investments, the Foundation is a legally separate organization with its own operations and mission. Today, the Calvert Foundation works in approximately 80 countries in varied sectors such as affordable housing development, microfinance, women’s empowerment, fair trade and sustainable agriculture.[14]
The Calvert Foundation’s successes have included the introduction of the Community Investment Notes in 1995, which allows everyday investors to partake in the field of impact investing.

 About Us

Calvert is a recognized leader in Responsible Investing. Our mission is to deliver superior long-term performance to our clients and to enable them to achieve positive impact.
Calvert Research and Management traces its roots to Calvert Investments, which was founded in 1976 and was the first to launch a socially responsible mutual fund that avoided investment in companies that did business in apartheid-era South Africa. Today, the Calvert Funds are one of the largest and most diversified families of responsibly invested mutual funds, encompassing actively and passively managed strategies, U.S. and international equity strategies, fixed-income strategies, and asset allocation funds — all managed in accordance with the Calvert Principles for Responsible Investment.
Through the years, the Calvert Funds have stayed at the forefront of Responsible Investing, applying innovative investment strategies, groundbreaking research, shareholder advocacy programs and public policy initiatives. Today, we’re helping a new generation of investors see financial potential through the lens of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors.

Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.







Past performance is no guarantee of future results.



Diversification and asset allocation do not ensure a profit or guarantee against loss.


          * Fidelity's goal is to make financial expertise broadly accessible and effective in helping people live the lives they want. With assets under administration of $5.6 trillion, including managed assets of $2.1 trillion as of September 30, 2016, we focus on meeting the unique needs of a diverse set of customers: helping more than 24 million people invest their own life savings, nearly 20,000 businesses manage employee benefit programs, as well as providing nearly 10,000 advisory firms with technology solutions to invest their own clients' money.
	
    

          1. Fidelity Management & Research Company and Fidelity Institutional Asset Management, as of 9/30/16. Data is unaudited. These figures reflect the resources of Fidelity Management & Research Company, a U.S. company, and its subsidiaries. Research professionals include portfolio managers, research analysts and research associates.
	
    

          2. Highly rated funds are defined as those funds that have a 4- or 5-Star Morningstar rating. For each fund, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar RatingTM metric each month by subtracting the return on a 90-day U.S. Treasury Bill from the fund's load-adjusted return for the same period, and then adjusting this excess return for risk. The top 10% of funds in each broad asset class receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) Although gathered from reliable sources, data completeness and accuracy cannot be guaranteed by Morningstar.
	
    

          3. You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund’s sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time. Fidelity's government and U.S. Treasury money market funds will not impose a fee upon the sale of your shares, nor temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the fund's weekly liquid assets fall below 30% of its total assets because of market conditions or other factors.
	
    

          4. You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. The fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the Fund's liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund's sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.


          5. You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Because the share price of the fund will fluctuate, when you sell your shares they may be worth more or less than what you originally paid for them. The fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the fund's liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund's sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.


Because of their narrow focus, sector investments tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies.


          Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.
	
    

The securities of smaller, less well known companies can be more volatile than those of larger companies.


Because of their narrow focus, sector investments tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies.


In general, the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk, liquidity risk, call risk, and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so holding them until maturity to avoid losses caused by price volatility is not possible.



Indexes are unmanaged. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

Back to resultsUnderstanding Socially Innovative Investing 




Socially Innovative Investing (S2I), a proprietary strategy developed by U.S. Trust, is based on a growing awareness that strong corporate financial performance and social responsibility are not mutually exclusive; rather, they are mutually beneficial qualities. For investors, S2I seeks to answer yes to an age-old question: Is it possible to do good and do well at the same time?
Utilizing the Principle of Shared Value

The idea of investing according to personal values and beliefs is hardly new. At least since the mid-18th century, when Quakers banned followers from participating in the slave trade, individuals and groups have periodically chosen to avoid investments that conflict with moral, religious, environmental or other values. 
This approach to investing, now often referred to as socially responsible investing, or SRI, is viewed largely in terms of what it doesn't do. Investors choose what not to invest in — such as tobacco, weapons manufacturers and alcohol. And, because SRI entails limiting the universe of potentially profitable investments, the implication is that though this might be a noble endeavor, the investor is challenged by a restricted  investment universe .
During the 1980s, Fortune magazine famously described SRI as "feel good investing" and "politically correct investing." But as interest in SRI has continued to grow, a new, more active and demanding approach to social investing has emerged based on the idea that social responsibility and corporate earnings should naturally go hand in hand. Dr. Michael Porter, of the Institute for Strategy and Competitiveness at Harvard Business School, summed up this new idea: "Corporate Social Responsibility can be much more than a cost, a constraint or a charitable deed — it can be a source of opportunity, innovation and competitive advantage."
Inspired by those words, U.S. Trust has created Socially Innovative Investing, which takes traditional socially responsible investing a step further. S2I incorporates an active, proprietary method for reviewing U.S. securities across a wide spectrum of criteria that weight both social responsibility and financial fundamentals .To be considered for inclusion, companies must be attractive fundamentally, as well as fit global macro investment themes established by U.S. Trust's thought leadership team. During the portfolio construction process, sector weights adhere to U.S. Trust's recommendation.
THE PRINCIPLE OF SHARED VALUE
S2I stands on the idea that corporations and society don't (indeed, can't) thrive as wholly separate, unrelated entities.
Corporations need vibrant communities in order to create demand for their products and to provide a supportive environment in which to operate.
Society needs healthy, competitive companies able to create jobs, buy local goods from the community and pay taxes. Where these needs intersect, in a zone of shared values, is the sweet spot of S2I. It is our conviction that companies that demonstrate and remain committed to policies and practices that enhance their own competitiveness while simultaneously advancing economic and social convictions in their communities not only meet the ethical criteria of socially minded investors but stand best poised to prosper in a pure business sense.
THE FRAMEWORK
Our framework for assessing a company's commitment to social innovation rests on three pillars:

Human capital engagement. How does the company treat all of its stakeholders (employees, shareholders, customers, suppliers and the community)?
Considerations include such issues as the pay gap between management and employees, employee ownership, health and wellness, diversity and product quality, among others.

Environmental stewardship. What policies does the company employ for interacting with the environment?
Considerations include greenhouse gas reduction, renewable energy use, emissions, effluents and wastes, recycling and others.

Corporate philanthropy. What are the standards and procedures regarding its role as a corporate citizen?
Considerations include community engagement, community investment, corporate giving, employee volunteerism and community impact policies.

Measuring a company's actual commitment to these pillars involves a two-part review of stated policies and performance accountability.

Policy review. We review, benchmark and score policies, based on our analysis that good policies indicate good management and are indicators of long-term value creation.

Performance accountability review. Because good intentions don't always result in positive results, we assess companies by how effectively a corporation has implemented its policies. And, crucially, we consider whether it has capitalized on external incentives for good corporate behavior, and avoided costly fines and penalties.

However, it is our belief that while quantifying intent and peerto-peer benchmarking is important, the direct tangible results of the policies must be measured in order to determine their absolute or relative success.
MONITORING AND MAINTAINING THE PORTFOLIO
Continual attention, monitoring and adjustment are required to keep the S2I properly balanced to achieve its goals. We review changes in U.S. Trust's recommended sector allocations and periodically rebalance the portfolio. We monitor position sizes, fundamentals, egregious  social violations and trends in social scoring.


Four myths about social investing debunked
MYTH #1:
Corporate social responsibility comes at the expense of profit.

S2I was designed to identify companies that address social issues as part of their strategies to be more competitive in the marketplace — in keeping with the theory of Shared Value.

Shared Value proposes that companies can improve their longrun position by looking for sustainable competitive advantages, including methods of engaging stakeholders on social issues.


MYTH #2:
Reliable and consistent data are not available.

The Socially Innovative Investing Model addresses transparency and data manipulation by relying predominantly on third-party verified data. The quality of the data and the proprietary weighting of the model form the central value proposition of the strategy.


MYTH #3:
Interpretation of social metrics is extremely subjective.

In our model, hundreds of  independent data points divided into over 30   criteria are collected and scored, and compared with their peers, sector by sector.

Whenever possible, we set metrics and ranges as quantifiable targets.

Our model to determine each company's composite social innovation score is applied uniformly. Companies must meet a minimum rated score, regardless of their sector.


MYTH #4:
Social investing underperforms the broad market.

The S2I methodology was designed both to identify long-term value creators and to mitigate risk.

When SRI strategies underperform, usually they do so because of poor portfolio construction, not social screening. To address this shortcoming, we:


Utilize U.S. Trust® thought leadership for sector overweights and underweights.

Require positive ratings from non-SRI analysts on each eligible security.

Maintain a rigorous buy, sell and rebalance discipline.

			ESG investing, once a sideline practice, has gone decisively mainstream — and this is creating real opportunities for investors.
			These opportunities meet the interests of a wide spectrum of clients, from fiduciaries aligning their portfolios with the realities of a rapidly changing world to clients who are increasingly looking to have their investments express their values.
		



			Better data, refined tools and improved methods have expanded the possibilities across all of those interests.
			As a result, ESG investing is no longer a carve-out within a portfolio — it IS the portfolio for some investors. What was once the province of a small number of family offices and foundations has drawn sharply increased participation among pension funds, insurance companies, nonprofits and faith-based investors.
		

			At Goldman Sachs, the growth of ESG investing has been significant, and it has accelerated since the acquisition of Imprint Capital, a leading ESG advisor, in 2015. We have seen a virtuous cycle in which demand has driven product and service innovation, creating new models for success and driving further demand. As a result, our assets under supervision in dedicated ESG strategies have grown significantly, to $6.5 billion by the end of 2016.
		

			Fundamental to this growth is an increased understanding that a disciplined approach to ESG investing can drive competitive risk-adjusted returns — just as with any other investment. Risk/return profiles of ESG portfolios now mirror the markets and span asset classes, fueling the evolution of impact investment strategies that meet conventional risk/return hurdles, but also include social and environmental impacts that are both intentional and measurable.
		









					GROWTH OF ESG AUS
				

					Assets Under Supervision in ESG strategies grew 74% YoY in 2016.
				






			World Resources Institute
		

			How does a research-driven, global institute focused on sustainability manage its portfolio for the long term? One way is by leveraging its own research on trends to more effectively steward their endowment while also using this work to create a model for other institutional investors. Here, the World Resources Institute’s President Andrew Steer and Head of Sustainable Investing Elizabeth Lewis discuss WRI’s objectives and investing approach with Goldman Sachs’ John Goldstein.
		
















					MUNICIPAL BONDS:AN OVERLOOKEDIMPACT INVESTMENT?
				

					As interest grows in achieving positive impacts while generating market-rate returns, investors may forget about the opportunity in their own backyards — municipal bonds. Often focused on financing redevelopment, infrastructure and key community needs for education, health, housing and sustainability, municipal bonds can drive ESG impact in addition to providing clear tax advantages. Senior portfolio manager Ben Barber and research analyst Michael Kashani explain.

One way is by leveraging its own research on trends to more effectively steward their endowment while also using this work to create a model for other institutional investors. Here, the World Resources Institute’s President Andrew Steer and Head of Sustainable Investing Elizabeth Lewis discuss WRI’s objectives and investing approach with Goldman Sachs’ John Goldstein.
		
















					MUNICIPAL BONDS:AN OVERLOOKEDIMPACT INVESTMENT?
				

					As interest grows in achieving positive impacts while generating market-rate returns, investors may forget about the opportunity in their own backyards — municipal bonds. Often focused on financing redevelopment, infrastructure and key community needs for education, health, housing and sustainability, municipal bonds can drive ESG impact in addition to providing clear tax advantages. Senior portfolio manager Ben Barber and research analyst Michael Kashani explain.

Give your money a chance to grow



Investing in mutual funds offers benefits you won't get from trading individual stocks and bonds on your own.




Less risk through more diversification
One mutual fund can invest in hundreds—sometimes thousands—of individual securities at once. So if any one security does poorly, the others are there to help offset that risk.
 




Lower costs
With a no-load mutual fund, you pay one (hopefully low) expense ratio—instead of racking up the commissions you'd pay when buying and selling individual securities yourself.
See how low-cost, no-load mutual funds are just the start 

Get details on fees & minimums for Vanguard mutual funds 

 




Professional management
You don't have to keep track of every security your mutual fund owns. The fund is managed by experts who take care of that for you.
 




Convenience
You can buy and sell mutual fund shares online or by phone and set up automatic investments and withdrawals.
 

Consider your mutual fund options








Choosing which Vanguard mutual funds to invest in can be as simple as picking one fund to do the work of an entire portfolio or as customized as building your portfolio from a variety of fund options.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
