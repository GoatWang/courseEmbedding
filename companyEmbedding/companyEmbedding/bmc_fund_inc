1.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                                           

   BMC Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") is a closed-end, non-diversified investment
    company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
  Prior to becoming a regulated investment company on April 1, 1981, BMC
    Fund, Inc. operated as a regular corporation. The following is a summary
      of significant accounting policies followed by the Fund in the preparation
      of its financial statements. The policies are in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles for investment companies.            

  A.    Investment Valuations - The municipal bond investments and other
         investment securities are stated at market. The cost of the bonds
      has been adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of
           discount over the term of the security. Interest income is adjusted
           to reflect such amortization and accretion. The market value of the
   investment in its wholly owned subsidiaries is based on the
         appraised value of the underlying assets. The investments in real
           estate are accounted for at appraised values updated by management.

  B.    Income Taxes - No federal tax provision is required as it is the
            Company's policy to comply with the provision of Subchapter M of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, including the
           distribution to its shareholders of substantially all of its income
          and any capital gains not offset by capital losses. Also, no state
          income tax provision has been provided because the states in which
           the Fund has income recognizes the tax exempt status of a regulated
investment company.                                     

     C.    Investment Transactions - Investment transactions are accounted for
            on the date the order to buy or sell is executed. Realized gains and
     losses on investments are determined on the basis of specific
identification of issues sold or matured.               

   D.    Dividend Policy - It is the Fund's policy to pay dividends during
           the year in sufficient amounts to meet the requirements to maintain
its status as a regulated investment company.           

E.    Temporary Cash and Short-term Investments - For purposes of   
     financial reporting, the Company considers all investments at
          financial institutions with original maturities of three months or
          less (repurchase agreements at September 30, 1998) to be temporary
           cash investments. Short-term investments are considered to be money
market investments managed by third party investors.    

2.    ADVISORY BOARD AND REMUNERATION OF DIRECTORS                              

    The Fund does not have an advisory board. During the current six months,
the Chairman was paid $8,000 and the President was paid $25,000. The
  independent directors are paid an annual fee of $1,000 plus $1,000 for
each meeting attended.

3.    SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION                                                  

    Paul H. Broyhill, Chairman of the Board, and E. D. Beach, President, are
primarily responsible for the day to day management of the Fund's   
 portfolio and have had such responsibility since the inception of the
  Fund. In addition, portions of the Fund's portfolio are managed by IBJ
    Schroder Bank & Trust Company ("IBJ Schroder"), which is responsible for
   approximately $16.2 million of the Fund's portfolio, and W. H. Reaves &
   Co., Inc. ("Reaves & Co."), which is responsible for approximately $7.5
     million of the Fund's portfolio. Christian E. Kaefer, a Senior Investment
 Officer of IBJ Schroder, is the portfolio manager responsible for the
   portion of the Fund's portfolio managed by IBJ Schroder; and William H.
Reaves, who is the Chief Investment Officer of Reaves & Co., is the 
 portfolio manager responsible for the portion of the Fund's portfolio
     managed by Reaves & Co. Mr. Kaefer and Mr. Reaves have held their current
     positions with IBJ Schroder and Reaves & Co., respectively, for more than
five years.                                                         

   At a board of directors meeting held in July 1998, the board approved a
   plan to change the Fund's investment strategy so that no funds would be
     invested in tax-exempt securities after April 1, 1999 and that tax-exempt
     funds held on that date be disposed of in a prompt and reasonable manner.
     In preparation for this, the maturity dates of those securities now being
held has been reduced to slightly more than one year.
