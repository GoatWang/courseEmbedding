Corporate headquarters at 12200 N. Ambassador Drive on the site of the former Red Crown Tourist Court 2009


WireCo WorldGroup (formerly Wire Rope Corporation of America) is a privately owned company that claims to be the world's largest manufacturer of wire rope.[1]
History[edit]
J.P. Barclay, Sr. founded the company in 1931 as a spin-off of the New Haven, Connecticut-based Wire Machinery Corporation of America. In 1950 it moved its headquarters to St. Joseph, Missouri where its main operations had been since 1948.[2]
It acquired the wire rope division of A.H. Leschen & Sons of St. Louis, Missouri in 1962; the Armco Steel wire rope division in 1988; the Rochester Corporation wire rope division in 1998; the Broderick Bascom Rope Company and MacWhyte Wire Rope Company of Wisconsin in 1999; the Aceros Camesa in Mexico in 2005; entered into a joint agreement with Wuhan Iron and Steel[disambiguation needed] in China in 2006; Wireline Works of Canada in 2007; CASAR in 2007 and Phillystran in 2009.[3]
In 2002 the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. KPS Special Situations acquired the company for $53 million in assumed debt and $1.5 million in cash.
Fox Paine & Company bought the company in 2007[2] Later that year the company moved its headquarters to the former Farmland Industries headquarters on the site of the Red Crown Tourist Court by Kansas City International Airport.[4] The company was renamed Wireco Worldgroup in October 2007 and ownership was transferred to Paine & Partners. In the summer of 2015, the company moved its headquarters to Prairie Village, Kansas.[5]

Corporate headquarters at 12200 N. Ambassador Drive on the site of the former Red Crown Tourist Court 2009


WireCo WorldGroup (formerly Wire Rope Corporation of America) is a privately owned company that claims to be the world's largest manufacturer of wire rope.[1]
History[edit]
J.P. Barclay, Sr. founded the company in 1931 as a spin-off of the New Haven, Connecticut-based Wire Machinery Corporation of America. In 1950 it moved its headquarters to St. Joseph, Missouri where its main operations had been since 1948.[2]
It acquired the wire rope division of A.H. Leschen & Sons of St. Louis, Missouri in 1962; the Armco Steel wire rope division in 1988; the Rochester Corporation wire rope division in 1998; the Broderick Bascom Rope Company and MacWhyte Wire Rope Company of Wisconsin in 1999; the Aceros Camesa in Mexico in 2005; entered into a joint agreement with Wuhan Iron and Steel[disambiguation needed] in China in 2006; Wireline Works of Canada in 2007; CASAR in 2007 and Phillystran in 2009.[3]
In 2002 the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. KPS Special Situations acquired the company for $53 million in assumed debt and $1.5 million in cash.
Fox Paine & Company bought the company in 2007[2] Later that year the company moved its headquarters to the former Farmland Industries headquarters on the site of the Red Crown Tourist Court by Kansas City International Airport.[4] The company was renamed Wireco Worldgroup in October 2007 and ownership was transferred to Paine & Partners. In the summer of 2015, the company moved its headquarters to Prairie Village, Kansas.[5]

	Steel Rope


	 consists of a group of high-carbon steel wire strands helically and symmetrically twisted and “closed” together around a central core. Steel rope can range from small specialty rope of 1/16th of an inch to large mining ropes of up to five inches in diameter. We produce both highly engineered specialty products and steel rope suitable for a variety of uses, such as drill lines, mining ropes, cranes, mooring lines, bridges and logging. Major applications of these highly engineered products involve mineral mining, oil and gas exploration, fishing, maritime, construction and heavy industry (e.g., cranes).




	EM Cable


	is a highly engineered, customized electrical power and electrical signal transmission cable that is armored with high-carbon steel wire or special metal alloys, providing protection for the electrical conductors inside and various mechanical performance properties. Our EM Cable product is used in the oil and gas exploration industry and provides a link to the surface from underground instrumentation. The cable not only transmits data, but also acts as a strength member for the insertion and removal of the geophysical tools used for data-logging and perforating oil and gas wells. Over the past several years, advancements in drilling technology have opened up large shale gas reserves, creating a significant shale drilling market for our EM Cable product.




	Synthetic Ropes




	include high tenacity fiber ropes, strands, braids and strength members made from fibers such as Kevlar®, Dyneema®, Twaron®, Technora® (all registered trademarks are owned by their respective owners) and our own proprietary formulations. These products are unique in that they have the strength characteristics of steel rope but weigh significantly less. Synthetic ropes are primarily used in maritime, offshore oil and gas, fishing and other industries that require specific operating strength, buoyancy (when in high-modulus polyethylene), corrosion resistance or weight tolerance characteristics beyond wire rope. These include mooring lines, fishing ropes, fishing nets, life and winch lines, structural and support lines, boat rigging, power cables and broadcast tower guy cables. For certain applications, fiber ropes offer attractive physical characteristics compared to steel. Although fiber has comparative strength features, it is known to have greater flexibility and lighter weight, which allows submersion to approximately 10,000 meters, allowing far greater depth reach with virtually no increase in weight. Synthetic products have become crucial in the offshore oil and gas markets as greater drilling depths have made steel ropes impractical and obsolete due to the weight of the steel rope. We have pioneered the development of new products, which combine the use of steel wire ropes with high-strength synthetic components that improve the strength to weight ratio in the finished product.




	Synthetic Yarns


	products, such as tapes, yarns and monofilaments, are used in a variety of end market applications including flexible intermediate bulk containers, horticulture, agriculture, cables, concrete reinforcement, synthetic grass, geotextiles, electrical fencing, antiballistics, luggage, sports products, industrial/infrastructure usage and synthetic ropes. The Company also manufactures synthetic yarns for use in the production of its own synthetic ropes.

	End Markets




	Our Rope products provide solutions in a variety of end markets with attractive growth opportunities, focusing on premium high-margin business. A breakdown of our net sales for the year ended


	December 31, 2013


	 by end market, as well as our Go-to-Market brands were as follows:







	The following provides a detailed description regarding uses of our products by some of our end markets:




	Industrial/Infrastructure -


	This end market encompasses industrial and infrastructure applications that use steel rope in various industries, including construction, transportation, defense, automotive, agriculture and logging. Crane ropes sold within this end market consist of both Original Equipment Manufacturers ("OEMs") tied to new crane build annually and a much larger global market of end users of cranes in the aftermarket.  Crane ropes are a consumable working component of cranes that require replacement every one to four years depending on cycle counts, working conditions and operator experience. 




	Oil and Gas -


	Steel and synthetic ropes are used throughout the oil and gas industry, providing solutions, from exploration all the way to production. We have a full suite of product offerings for onshore oil and gas (well servicing, tubing and sandlines, drill lines, and raising lines), offshore above platform (drill lines, buoy pendants, tensioner ropes, riser ropes, cranes and cable lays), and offshore mooring system for below platform solutions (deep water mooring, anchor lines, mooring systems, modulines and synthetic tethers). Onshore and offshore above platform ropes typically need to be replaced every 6 to 12 months depending on the application and operating environment.




	Fishing -


	The fishing industry encompasses applications that use steel and synthetic wire ropes and netting for fishing and other related equipment. We are a leading global supplier of these products to the fishing industry, with distribution worldwide, and with strong presence in Europe. Our products are consumable working ropes and nets for fishing vessels and fish farms, which need to be replaced every 12 to 24 months based on level of activity in order to protect valuable fish catches or fish farm production.




	Mining -


	Our steel rope products are primarily consumable working ropes for mining operations. We participate both in the underground market for the extraction of coal and other bedded materials, and surface market for coal, copper, iron ore and other minerals and ores. Due to the severe wear-and-tear that steel ropes endure in surface mining operations, they typically need to be replaced every two to four months depending on the application and operating environment.




	Maritime -


	Steel and synthetic ropes are used for various maritime operating applications including mooring, tugging, lifting and anchoring.  Maritime end market applications include cargo, container and tanker vessels for shipping product globally, as well as working boats, tug boats, dredging boats, drilling ships, building ships, cruise ships and naval ships.  These types of ropes typically need to be replaced every 12 months depending on the application and operating environment.




	Structures -


	Our steel and synthetic rope products are used in bridges, stadiums, towers and other cable supported structures. Our specialty wire products are commonly used as concrete reinforcement for infrastructure projects, as well. Recently, our products were used on several high profile projects, including the Freedom Tower and Manhattan Bridge in New York and the San Francisco Bay Bridge in California.

	SPECIALTY WIRE




	Product Portfolio




	Our specialty wire provides a competitive edge, fulfilling 80-90% of our internal supply chain needs. The majority of our volume in wire is high-carbon steel wire for use in the production of our own steel ropes and EM Cable products. For our external customers, we offer a variety of selective products such as PC strand, PC wire, tire bead, spring and duct, guy strand and staple band, which are manufactured for a wide variety of uses in a broad range of industries. A breakdown of our volume by product for the year ended December 31, 2013 and the Go-to-Market brands were as follows:







	End Markets




	Besides serving our internal needs, we serve niche markets in the infrastructure and industrial industries. Our primary infrastructure product is PC strand, used in highways, dams, silos, long extension bridges and industrial structures. PC strand is a reinforcing component for concrete. For the industrial market, we serve a variety of applications including air conditioning, automotive, furniture and fencing applications. Guy strand is used in the telecommunications industry and staple band is used to manufacture staples for various industries.









	ENGINEERED PRODUCTS









	Product Portfolio




	Engineered products are highly engineered, plastic injected molded products and sheets. Our products have a very low maintenance cost, long useful life, high impact resistance, and perform in extreme temperature conditions. In many cases, these products are used as a substitute for steel, concrete or wood alternatives due to their unique engineered design, performance characteristics and price. Most products are custom designed by our dedicated team of research and development engineers to meet specific customer requirements. Since these applications are complementary with some of our wire and synthetic rope products, we can offer our customers a "complete solution." An example is our oil-platform mooring systems where we offer high strength synthetic ropes and buoyancy modules produced by our engineered products facilities. Sales and distribution are done locally in Europe, but with our global network of dedicated distributors and agents, we are able to serve customers around the world.









	End Markets




	Engineered products are used in the following end markets: offshore, poultry, infrastructure and storage systems. Within offshore, we produce applications ranging from protection to buoyancy. Our poultry end market includes poultry manufacturing conveyor belts for eggs and manure. The infrastructure end market produces manholes, poles, planks, decking, furniture, bridges, and most recently, railroad cross ties. Engineered products are used in coil storage solutions, such as steel plants, service centers, automotive plants and transportation and pipe storage systems for worksite mobility.

	RAW MATERIALS




	The main raw materials that we use to manufacture our rope products are high-carbon steel wire, polymers, such as polypropylene and polyethylene, and synthetic fibers, such as polyester and polyamide (nylon) and high tenacity synthetic fibers, such as Dyneema®. The main raw material that we use to manufacture wire is high-carbon steel rod. Our rope and wire products are made from steel rod that is primarily made from recycled steel scrap, while engineered products are made from both new and recycled plastic materials. The recycled plastics are sourced from agricultural foils, bottle caps and industrial waste. Due to the wide geographic dispersion of our production facilities, we use numerous producers for the raw materials needed in our operations. These raw materials are purchased at regular intervals, usually on a monthly or quarterly basis, depending on pricing and market conditions. We are not significantly dependent on any one or a limited number of suppliers. Also, we are vertically integrated and manufacture the majority of the wire, fibers and cores we use in our ropes.









	MANUFACTURING FOOTPRINT




	We have a comprehensive global footprint, with both highly engineered value added manufacturing and low cost production serving diverse end markets. Our rope products are produced on a diverse set of manufacturing assets and our engineered products have unique production capabilities, such as low and high pressure injection molding, flat-die extrusion and high production flexibility. Refer to Item 2,


	Properties


	, of this annual report for more information on our manufacturing footprint.









	CUSTOMERS

	2012


	 and


	2011


	, respectively, and our largest customer accounted for less than


	3%


	,


	5%


	 and


	6%


	 of net sales in


	2013


	,


	2012


	 and


	2011


	, respectively.









	COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS




	We are subject to competitive conditions in most end markets. Our competitors include other global well-capitalized wire rope manufacturers, as well as other local and specialized wire manufacturers and niche markets with a wide variety of specialized producers of plastic solutions, as well as large producers of steel, concrete and wood alternatives. In spite of this moderately competitive environment, we have established market leading positions in our various end markets under our distinguished brands and design capabilities. We generally compete on the basis of product performance, sales and technical service support, and price.









	INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY




	The Company believes that its patents, brands, trademarks and other intellectual property provide it with a significant competitive advantage. We own numerous patents and patent applications worldwide.  We regularly file patent applications and obtain issued patents resulting from our research and development activities. Although we use patented inventions throughout our product portfolio, our business is not substantially dependent on any single patent or group of patents. We have

	Table of Contents







	a significant number of trademarks covering our company names and material brands. These trademarks include WireCo WorldGroup®, WireCo®, Union™, CASAR®, Lankhorst Ropes®, Camesa®, Euronete™, Oliveira™, WireCo® Structures, Phillystran®, Drumet™, Lankhorst Engineered Products™ and Lankhorst Mouldings™. In addition, we have trademarks registered in the U.S. and some foreign countries to protect our specific “marker strand” designs, which, consistent with market practice, designate our steel rope products as well as various brands. We have also trademarked our orange-colored plastic coating used to enhance the performance of our steel rope product lines.









	RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT




	We believe our focused agenda of research and development initiatives ha


	s


	 enhanced our reputation as one of the leading product innovators in the industries that we serve. Demand for our products developed in previous years continues to increase as our customers recognize the added value to their respective business. In 2013, we introduced fourteen new products to the diverse global industries that we serve. These new products have been included in our already extensive and highly engineered product portfolio. Our strategy is to continue to build on our history of innovation and technological expertise while bringing new, highly engineered products to market. Our investment in research and development was


	$4.0 million


	,


	$3.1 million


	 and


	$2.2 million


	 for the years ended


	December 31, 2013


	, 2012 and 2011, respectively.









	REGULATION -


	Environmental Matters




	Our business operations and facilities are subject to a number of laws and regulations, which govern the discharge of pollutants and hazardous substances into the air and water; the handling, storage, use and disposal of such materials; and remediation of contaminated sites. Operations at our facilities include transforming steel rods and wire into steel rope or cable, which can produce wastewater, spent acid and petroleum waste; and transforming polymers and synthetic fibers into fiber strand and fiber rope, which may be recycled or may produce polymer or synthetic fiber waste. We also store certain petroleum products and hazardous substances that we use in our operations. Due to the nature of these activities, our facilities are subject to routine inspection by regulators. Our regulators have not identified any material findings or situations that could have a material impact on our operations. Although we continually incur expenses and make capital expenditures related to environmental protection, we do not anticipate that future expenditures should materially impact our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.









	EMPLOYEES AND LABOR RELATIONS




	At


	December 31, 2013


	, we employed


	3,748


	 employees worldwide, not including our joint ventures, of which


	813


	 are employed by the Registrant in the U.S. Approximately


	41%


	 of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements, of which none are subject to agreements that expire within one year of


	December 31, 2013


	. The Company believes it will successfully negotiate all contracts as they come due.









	FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS




	The Company conducts a significant amount of its business and has a number of operating facilities in countries outside the United States. Refer to Note 16—“Segment and Geographic Area Information” to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8,


	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data


	, of this annual report for financial information about WireCo’s domestic and foreign operations.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
