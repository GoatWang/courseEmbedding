        maintenance and reliability


Made in America. The phrase is starting to take on the same quaint, 
anachronistic feel as, say, "Mr. Smith received a gold watch from the company 
after 40 years of loyal service." It's simply another stark reality of our 
globalizing world. But to assume that American manufacturers have to padlock the 
factory doors and move overseas is to deny the innovative spirit – and bulldog 
determination – that birthed and nourished our nation's economy.
Just ask Century Furniture. This Hickory, N.C.-based maker of fine, high-end 
home furnishings is doing what many view as "the impossible." It is keeping its 
factories open.
Century, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, has seven 
manufacturing facilities and some 1,200 business partners. (The company doesn't 
call them employees because each one actually owns a stake in the business.) It 
is one of the last, lonely holdouts in the area that proudly calls itself "The 
Furniture Capital of America." About two-thirds of its wood manufacturing 
competitors have closed up shop and moved their manufacturing to China.
According to Hardwood Review Weekly, which keeps track of these 
statistics, between 2000 and 2006, 279 U.S. furniture factories closed in 29 
states, totaling more than 64,000 lost jobs. Between 2000 and 2005, North 
Carolina lost 68 percent of its 32,000 furniture jobs.
"It's not hard to understand why so many manufacturers have made the choice 
to move overseas," says Robert J. Maricich, president and CEO of Century 
Furniture. "The average skilled American worker earns 28 times what his 
counterpart in China earns. Factor in our escalating healthcare costs and our 
far more stringent governmental restraints and you can see the depth of the 
challenge."
Fortunately, Maricich is a man who thrives on challenge.
When he arrived at Century in 2000, the company was enjoying a banner year. 
Business was growing, profits robust. A record number of employees showed up 
every day to craft the expensive, luxurious wood and upholstered furniture for 
which Century is known. But he barely had time to get his office set up when 
what he calls "the perfect storm" abruptly ended the sunny day in which his new 
company was basking. September 11 triggered a massive decline in consumer 
confidence, the stock market, and, consequently, consumer spending on big ticket 
purchases. Prices plunged. And simultaneously, Chinese imports shot through the 
roof.


In the wake of these dark days, Maricich and his leadership team made the 
decision to keep Century's manufacturing – the bulk of it, at least – on 
American soil.
"We had to honestly assess our strengths and weaknesses," says Maricich. "We 
had to identify those niches in which we could effectively compete and focus our 
energies on adding value to our products and services. And yes, we did have to 
cut our workforce – 20 percent across the board. But here we are, still 
standing. We haven't closed a single factory."
So, how is Century pulling off such a feat? Maricich answered that question 
when he spoke – alongside the CEOs of Starbucks, Best Buy and other 
multi-billion dollar firms – at the 2006 Leadership Excellence Summit at the 
U.S. Naval Academy this summer. In a presentation titled "Leadership in the 
Global Economy: Tactical Principles for Success in a New World," he shared the 
following insights:
Principle 1: When You Find Yourself in a Hole, Stop Digging. 

Take a long, hard, objective look at everything you're doing. If it doesn't 
add value or maximize efficiency, stop doing it. If the customer doesn't care 
about it, stop doing it. Rethink every process. When you hear the words, "But 
we've always done it this way," ignore them. "Change is hard and it does upset 
numerous apple carts," reflects Maricich.
Principle 2: Take Action. You Cannot Afford to Wait for All the 
Facts. 
Knowing that uncertainty will always exist, be a confident decision maker. 
Don't fall prey to "analysis paralysis." Opportunities pass quickly and if you 
don't grab them quickly, someone else will. Once you've made a decision, don't 
fret over it. No one has ever figured out how to turn back time and undo 
anything. Even if 20/20 hindsight proves your decision was a mistake, well, 
mistakes are learning vehicles for all of us.
Principle 3: Get Comfortable with Ambiguity. 
"The ambiguity I refer to here applies only to business decisions," says 
Maricich. "There is no ambiguity about integrity, honesty and the core values 
that provide a moral rudder. Those qualities must remain constant. However, when 
operating in a globalizing economy, there are few cut-and-dry rules; there is no 
clear right and wrong. Even if you don't make the wrong choice, you might not 
make the most "right" choice, either. Accept that fact."
Principle 4: Find Your Brilliance and Leverage It Relentlessly. 

Every company must decide what it does best – indeed, what it does better 
than anyone else – and infuse that brilliance into its entire operation. Century 
is differentiating itself via a three-pronged approach: 
1) It provides a luxury experience to consumers by offering top-of-the-line 
quality and mass customization; 
2) It innovates relentlessly, in products, in design partnerships, in sales 
strategies; 
3) In an industry known for moving at a snail's pace, Century gets furniture 
to its customers on an average of three short weeks after the order is 
placed.
"That's our brilliance and everything we do is based on being the best at 
bringing it to the customer," says Maricich. "We had T-shirts made that say, ‘We 
have one standard: The Best.’ It's a simple concept that everyone at every level 
understands. Its simplicity gives it its power. If a worker sees a tiny flaw in 
the finish on a headboard, she will make sure the problem is corrected in order 
to live up to that standard."
Principle 5: Being All Things to All People Is the Golden Rule for 
Failure. 
When Maricich took over Century, the company had strayed outside its 
traditional "fine home furnishings niche" and was making furniture for hotels 
and yachts.
"We had extraordinary competencies to make just about any kind of sofa, 
chair, bed, dresser or table," he says. "We let ourselves be lured into those 
arenas. But ultimately, we realized we couldn't really be competitive in these 
areas, so we cut them out. Trying to be all things to all people doesn't allow 
you to differentiate, it doesn't reward you for creativity, and it doesn't 
reward you for fashion leadership. In the end, we walked away from 15 percent of 
our business."
Principle 6: Cut the Fat. Leave the Muscle. Get LEAN! 
In addition to the aforementioned 20 percent reduction in workforce – which 
hit management and workers alike – Century embraced lean 
manufacturing as a strategy. The company focused on getting rid of all 
waste, eliminating anything the customer wasn't willing to pay for. It 
streamlined and reconfigured its upholstery plants, reducing the distance an 
average piece of upholstery traveled from 908 feet to 522 feet.
"That's a 42 percent reduction that results in the elimination of 1,300 miles 
each year," says Maricich. "By the way, these items are pushed by hand. Not only 
does this save time, it reduces dirty upholstery skirts, fabric tears and broken 
furniture legs, not to mention employee fatigue."
Principle 7: Embrace Globalization. 
Take advantage of what's best in the world, as long as it reinforces your 
strategy, says Maricich.
"You can and probably should use outsourcing on a selective basis," he says. 
"At Century, we stopped making chair frames, for instance, deciding it made 
sense to have those made overseas. We leveraged our brilliance in finishing, 
customizing and providing innovative design to the purchased frames . . . and 
our customers appreciate the value we create with that strategy."
Principle 8: Create a Culture of Trust. 
A culture of trust centers on authenticity, says Maricich.
"Don't pretend you know all the answers and don't make promises you can't 
keep," he says. "I have had to look into my employees' eyes and say, 'Yes, the 
plant might have to close. Yes, you could lose your job. But the future is in 
our hands and that is a good thing. We are all going to pull together to do our 
best to keep this company going.' That was a difficult thing to do but it was 
also the right thing to do."
Principle 9: Foster a Sense of Ownership. 
How do you instill an entrepreneurial mindset in your employees? First, says 
Maricich, ensure that your employees literally own a stake in their company. 
(Century does so via its ESOP.) But just as importantly, share your vision with 
your employees every chance you get.
"The only way to create organizational clarity is to communicate the same 
message at all levels of your company," he says. "Whether I am talking to 
upholsterers or board members, I make sure my message is the same: This is the 
vision. These are the initiatives. These are the action steps."
Principle 10: Hire and Retain the Very Best People. 
You know the basic rules: Hire smart people, passionate people, people who 
fit your culture. They all still apply. But when you're hiring people who must 
do the near-impossible, i.e., keep your American factories running in a tough 
global economy, you've got your work cut out for you. You look like a big 
risk.
"Make it a priority to convince the best and brightest that you have an 
environment in which they can do their best work," advises Maricich. "Learn how 
to play up your strengths. For instance, we use the finest materials in our 
furniture – exotic woods, imported stone, hand-hammered wrought iron, exquisite 
fabrics – and that's a big draw for highly creative people. They appreciate 
having access to such beautiful materials with which they can practice their 
art."
On the other end of the employment spectrum, don't be afraid to cut people 
loose when the passion isn't there.
"This is not just for your benefit, but for theirs as well," he adds.
Principle 11: Reward People for a Job Well Done. 
Yes, financial rewards are always welcome. But don't forget the power of 
recognition and praise. Maricich, an avid outdoorsman, gives outstanding 
employees his special Crystal Bear Award.
"I don't give them out indiscriminately so these awards mean a lot to people 
who receive them," he says. "We also look for fun ways to celebrate our 
successes at Century. There can be no success without celebration."
Principle 12: Innovate, Innovate, Innovate! Look Outside the Paradigm 
for New Ideas. 
When you have an innovative culture, a culture filled with divergent thinkers 
who feel free to express their wildest ideas, you have something no competitor 
can steal. Century's innovative culture manifests in unusual products like the 
radial table from its Oscar de la Renta Home collection. The table, based on an 
1835 design, has a patented mechanism that allows its round top to expand, 
making room for eight leaves that slide in between its pie-shaped swirl mahogany 
wedges. Retailing for $25,000, it is Century's top-selling table in both units 
and dollars and the highest margin item in its line.
Likewise, when Century entered the Leisure category four years ago, it 
debuted a finishing process used on the outside of boat hulls to make furniture 
nearly impervious to weather. This innovation allowed the company to be the 
first to use woods other than the teak family and to finish them to the same 
standards as indoor furniture.
Maricich is a big believer in the philosophy, "If you can't hire it, rent 
it." That's why Century collaborates with such diverse names as fashion giant 
Oscar de la Renta, British interior designer Kelly Hoppen and international 
designer Richard Frinier.
Principle 13: Choose Your Customers (or Those Who Influence Your 
Customers). 
Century has fired a few retail partners who cannot meet the needs of affluent 
consumers. Simultaneously, it is aggressively increasing the segment of its 
business that sells directly to professional interior designers.
"I have never heard anyone say, 'You know, I finally used a designer to redo 
my living room and I really regret it,'" laughs Maricich. "People are always 
thrilled with the results when they hire a professional designer — and the kinds 
of people who do so are the same kinds of people we want as customers. It's a 
natural fit."
Principle 14: Give Customers What They Really Want. 
Are you giving your customers what they really want, or are you giving them 
what you want them to want? Just because you are in love with your own products 
and services doesn't mean the customer will be. Do continuous market research. 
Ask the customer what he or she wants. Keep an eye on trends that are revealing 
themselves and be mindful of how your company might leverage opportunities that 
arise from them. This is no guarantee of success, of course, but it does make 
success more likely.
"The luxury niche is hot right now," says Maricich. "In 2005, Louis Vuitton, 
Lexus, Rolex, Manolo, Tiffany, Coach and Starbucks all had record years. That 
tells me that Century's target customer – the woman from the top 5 percent of 
all households earning more than $150,000 a year – is in a spending mood. We 
just have to convince that woman to spend her money on us. How do we do that? By 
providing not just a luxury product but a luxury experience."
Principle 15: Practice Perpetual Optimism. 
"Some psychologists believe there is a strong connection between a person's 
mood and his conception of the future," Maricich points out. "Just the simple 
act of saying, 'We have a plan' calms people and creates a positive mood in the 
organization – which, in turn, makes it more likely that the plan will be 
successful. To lead in an environment of ambiguity, you must defeat anxiety in 
yourself so that you don't risk infecting the people around you. Strive to 
manage your moods. Employees will follow your lead."
Principle 16: Never, Ever Be a Victim. 
"I refuse to be a victim, and I refuse to have victims working for me," says 
Maricich. "I've read that Jack Welch fired the bottom 10 percent of his 
workforce every year. The people who comprised that 10 percent were 'victim 
types' who could no longer effect change and drive the business forward. Jack 
was right – victims and other low performers bring everyone else down with 
them."
The message is clear: Even as the world transforms itself, old-fashioned 
strong leadership, superb quality and uncompromising service still count.
"I do not believe outsourcing is an inevitability," concludes Maricich. "But 
more important than the final outcome is this lesson: don't give up without a 
fight. In the '80s, everyone thought Japan would take over the world. Well, 
clearly, it hasn't. China is the emerging powerhouse right now in manufacturing, 
but the key phrase is 'right now.' There will always be another China. We as an 
industry and as a nation will always face challenges, so we always need to be in 
fighting shape."
