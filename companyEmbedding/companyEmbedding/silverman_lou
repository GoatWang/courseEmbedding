This is a court document that instructs a sheriff to seize and sell a defendant's property in order to satisfy a monetary judgment against the defendant.

(more...)A meeting of the minds. An agreement is made when two people reach an understanding about a particular issue, including their obligations, duties and rights. While agreement is sometimes used to mean contract -- a legally binding oral or written agreement -- it is actually a broader term, including understandings that might not rise to the level of a legally binding contract.

(more...)A law adopted by some cities or towns with desirable vistas -- such as those in the mountains or overlooking the ocean -- that protects a property owner from having his or her view obstructed by growing trees. View ordinances don't cover buildings or other structures that may block views.

YELLOW-DOG CONTRACTAn employment contract in which the employer forbids the employee to join a labor union. Yellow-dog contracts are not legally enforceable.

SHORT SALE (OF HOUSE)A sale of a house in which the proceeds fall short of what the owner still owes on the mortgage. Many lenders will agree to accept the proceeds of a short sale ... (more...)A sale of a house in which the proceeds fall short of what the owner still owes on the mortgage. Many lenders will agree to accept the proceeds of a short sale and forgive the rest of what is owed on the mortgage when the owner cannot make the mortgage payments. By accepting a short sale, the lender can avoid a lengthy and costly foreclosure, and the owner is able to pay off the loan for less than what he owes. See also deed in lieu (or foreclosure).

MORTGAGEA loan in which the borrower puts up the title to real estate as security (collateral) for a loan. If the borrower doesn't pay back the debt on time, the lender... (more...)A loan in which the borrower puts up the title to real estate as security (collateral) for a loan. If the borrower doesn't pay back the debt on time, the lender can foreclose on the real estate and have it sold to pay off the loan.

(more...)The legally prescribed time limit in which a lawsuit must be filed. Statutes of limitation differ depending on the type of legal claim, and often the state. For example, many states require that a personal injury lawsuit be filed within one year from the date of injury -- or in some instances, from the date when it should reasonably have been discovered -- but some allow two years. Similarly, claims based on a written contract must be filed in court within four years from the date the contract was broken in some states and five years in others. Statute of limitations rules apply to cases filed in all courts, including federal court.

(more...)An old-fashioned term for a female executor--the person named in a will to handle the distribution of the deceased person's property. Now, whether male or female, this person is called either the executor or the personal representative.

(more...)An extraordinary and unexpected natural event, such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake or even the sudden death of a person. An act of God may be a defense against liability for injuries or damages. Under the law of contracts, an act of God often serves as a valid excuse if one of the parties to the contract is unable to fulfill his or her duties -- for instance, completing a construction project on time.

 Lou Silverman, CEO of Advanced ICU Care, was featured in a “Cost Containment Corner” article in Healthcare Business News. In the article, Silverman details how disruption and evolution in health care reveal opportunities for innovation and strategic partnerships. With an increasing focus on value-based care – and pressure to elevate quality while improving financial efficiency – telemedicine services are having a positive impact in the ICU where acuity and cost of care are highest. Silverman explains that because ICUs typically account for approximately 30% of hospital costs, despite representing only about10% of the beds, and with the growing expectation of 24/7 intensivist oversight, the complicated ICU environment is primed to benefit from tele-ICU services. He further details how the intense connectivity of the tele-intensivist-led care team, via constant data streams and communication interfaces, enables proactive care and a particular focus on clinical best practices. Citing aggregated data and current tele-ICU service users, Silverman identifies how around-the-clock availability of and collaboration with the remote teams can positively impact the quality of care provided while benefitting the ICUs bottom line. CLICK HERE to read the full article on how strategic telemedicine partnerships improve care and yield financial benefits in ICUs nationwide.
