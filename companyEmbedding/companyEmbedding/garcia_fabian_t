NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Revlon, Inc. (NYSE:REV) announced today that its Board of Directors 
      elected Fabian T. Garcia as Revlon’s President and Chief Executive 
      Officer, effective April 15, 2016. Fabian was also appointed to serve as 
      a member of Revlon’s Board of Directors, as well as the Board of 
      Revlon’s wholly owned operating subsidiary, Revlon Consumer Products 
      Corporation (“RCPC”).
    


      Over the last 13 years, Fabian has served in a number of leading roles 
      at the Colgate-Palmolive Company, including leading the company’s 
      businesses in Asia-Pacific, Eurasia, Latin America, and most recently, 
      Europe and the Hills Pet Nutrition business. As COO of Global Innovation 
      and Growth, Fabian had responsibility for Colgate-Palmolive’s growth 
      strategy, consumer and customer innovation, and operational productivity 
      strategies and plans. Fabian also led the company's innovation strategy, 
      focusing on new business models, core categories, and emerging business 
      opportunities.
    

      Prior to Colgate-Palmolive, Fabian worked at the Timberland Company 
      managing Timberland’s International operations.
    

      Prior to Timberland, Fabian was President of Chanel in the Asia-Pacific 
      region, responsible for the Chanel Fashion, Fine Jewelry and Watches and 
      Fragrance and Beauty lines in the region, where he drove growth and 
      expansion in to new markets.
    

      Fabian started his career in the Procter & Gamble Company, progressing 
      through assignments of increased responsibility in Marketing and General 
      Management, in Venezuela, the United States, Colombia, Taiwan and Japan. 
      His last assignment in P&G was as President of the Max Factor business 
      in Japan and Asia Pacific.
    

      “I am honored to join Revlon during such an exciting period of renewed 
      growth and innovation,” said Fabian, 56. “Revlon is a true global market 
      leader setting the highest standard for beauty and quality. I look 
      forward to joining this extraordinary team to help continue to drive 
      growth and innovation and to continue to deliver strong results for our 
      customers around the world.”
    

      Commenting on today’s announcement, Ronald O. Perelman, Chairman of 
      Revlon said, "I want to welcome Fabian as Revlon’s President and CEO. 
      Fabian has demonstrated a long track-record of success at Colgate in 
      terms of driving growth and profitability, and in successfully leading 
      and expanding global organizations. He has the global strategic, 
      marketing, sales, financial and operational leadership experience to 
      successfully lead Revlon into the future.”

      Company's ongoing obligations under the U.S. federal securities laws, 
      the Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any

      viewed on the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov or on our website at 
      http://www.revloninc.com), as well as reasons including: unanticipated 
      circumstances or results affecting the Company's future financial 
      performance, including decreased consumer spending in response to weak 
      economic conditions or weakness in the consumption of beauty care 
      products in the Consumer, Professional and/or Other segments; adverse 
      changes in foreign currency exchange rates, foreign currency controls 
      and/or government-mandated pricing controls; decreased sales of the 
      Company's products as a result of increased competitive activities by 
      the Company's competitors and/or decreased performance by third party 
      suppliers; changes in consumer preferences, such as reduced consumer 
      demand for the Company's color cosmetics and other current products, 
      including new product launches; changes in consumer purchasing habits, 
      including with respect to retailer preferences and/or among professional 
      salons; higher than expected restructuring costs and/or 
      acquisition-related integration costs; higher than expected advertising, 
      promotional and/or marketing expenses or lower than expected results 
      from the Company’s advertising, promotional, pricing and/or marketing 
      plans; higher than expected sales returns related to any reduction of 
      space by the Company's customers, product discontinuances or otherwise 
      or decreased sales of the Company’s existing or new products; actions by 
      the Company’s customers, such as inventory management and greater than 
      anticipated space reconfigurations or reductions in display space and/or 
      product discontinuances or a greater than expected impact from pricing, 
      marketing, advertising and/or promotional strategies by the Company's 
      customers; changes in the competitive environment and actions by the 
      Company's competitors, including, among other things, business 
      combinations, technological breakthroughs, implementation of new pricing 
      strategies, new product offerings, increased advertising, promotional 
      and marketing spending and advertising, promotional and/or marketing 
      successes by competitors; and/or difficulties, delays in or less than 
      expected results from the Company’s efforts to grow profitability 
      through intensive innovation and geographical expansion, such as less 
      than effective product development and/or the Company's inability to 
      consummate transactions to expand its geographical presence. Factors 
      other than those listed above could also cause the Company’s results to 
      differ materially from expected results. Additionally, the business and 
      financial materials and any other statement or disclosure on or made 
      available through the Company’s websites or other websites referenced
