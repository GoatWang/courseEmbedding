What We Sell













Liquidmetal® Technologies has developed highly specialized alloys and a manufacturing process that allow cosmetic (down to 2 Ra, μin), high-strength (231 ksi), precision parts to be injection molded in a single manufacturing step. Liquidmetal alloys provide an economic advantage for parts with cosmetic surfaces, complex shapes with close tolerances, or forged titanium-grade strength.
Millions of Liquidmetal parts have been made for consumer electronics, providing nearly indestructible cases, close fitting chassis, and hinges and clamps that perform reliably even after thousands of cycles. The simplicity of our one-step molding process lends itself to high rate production with remarkable consistency from part to part.
Our business focus is on small precision parts, typically weighing up to 80g. While parts must be designed to eject from a mold, advanced tooling methods such as slides are available to accommodate critical features. A well-designed part can replace an assembly of machined parts and can be made substantially thinner than other conventional metal parts.
Liquidmetal alloys are truly exceptional for a variety of specialized applications. Utilizing this revolutionary process, product development managers and engineers have been able to overcome many manufacturing obstacles. The molding process and a highly unique combination of properties allow “outside the box” thinking relative to traditional metal forming processes when designing parts. 
With the simple objective to overcome rigid manufacturing roadblocks, and improve economic advantage in our customers’ parts, contact us now, to see that now you can.

Quality Assurance













Liquidmetal Technologies is committed to providing the highest quality parts to customers, which means careful attention and regulation of the end-to-end materials and fabrication processes.
As a recent breakthrough in engineered materials technology, bulk metallic glass alloys require extremely high quality standards to ensure reliability and repeatability in part performance. Many of the analysis tools that are used in traditional metallurgy can be used to assess the quality of Liquidmetal processes, but often in ways as unique as the alloy itself.
Liquidmetal Technologies uses a wide variety of tools to track the quality of its products, from initial alloy production to final part performance.




Examples of amorphous and crystalline materials under a high power microscope.
Chemistry: Since the material properties of Liquidmetal alloys are inseparably linked to its glassy structure, the alloy composition, which dictates its glass forming ability, is of crucial importance. Liquidmetal alloys have incredibly precise compositions and extremely low levels of contaminants such as oxygen.
Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC): A technique for studying the heat release associated with material phase transitions, which can be used to extract information about volumetric amorphous content of as-cast parts.
Optical Microscopy: High quality bulk metallic glass parts can be identified by their uniquely featureless surfaces when an ultra-high polished is applied to a specimen.
Mechanical Strength: As-cast mechanical properties can also be used to determine the consistency and reliability of the alloy and processing method.

Finishing













There are multiple finishing options that are available to Liquidmetal® parts.
De-gating
Upon ejection from the mold, Liquidmetal parts are attached to a tree that must be removed. The tree includes the sprue, runner, and gate as excess features. The simplest means of removing this material is to use a water-jet system where the tree is clamped into a fixture and quickly cut, leaving only the parts with a non-cosmetic quality surface where the gate was removed. In some cases, this surface quality may be sufficient for the application; however, if not, the surface will need to be processed further.
CNC Machining
At the Manufacturing Center of Excellence in Rancho Santa Margarita, Liquidmetal Technologies operates a CNC machining center. Liquidmetal alloys are a very hard and strong material; draft angles are required on all surfaces to ensure that the mold can eject the part without causing damage to either the part or the mold. Holes with tolerances in the ±0.008mm (±0.0003”) range can be machined along with grinding operations performed on surfaces and outer diameters that can hold the same tolerance. In some cases, parts will be molded as close to tolerance as possible and cleaned up with minimal stock removal from the part in a secondary operation.
Surface Treatment 




Near optical surface finish featured on two as-molded Liquidmetal parts.
Most customers chose to utilize the as-molded finish of Liquidmetal parts. This allows us to do a minimal amount of post processing on the surface, and leaves the customer with a finish that matches the surface roughness of the mold. If a polished mold is specified, it is typical to see Liquidmetal parts come out of the tool with a surface roughness of 0.025-0.050µm (1-2µin). The best corrosion resistance also occurs with an as-molded product. In some cases, customers may determine that a blasted finish is optimal for aesthetic reasons. A variety of blasting media can be used for this, including Zirconia, Alumina, Silica, etc. This can be discussed further with Liquidmetal engineers.
Other options for part finishes include painting and even PVD (physical vapor deposition).

It's just a single device! Would buy next new Samsung Device! I hate Samsung anyway! I am an iPhone Guy now! I am going for Google Pixel Phone!View Results Loading ... Share Tweet Reddit WhatsApp EmailA lot of rumors had been doing their rounds regarding Apple’s upcoming iPhone. Some of these claimed that Apple will be using a rather new material, called liquid metal, in its next iPhone. The liquid was to be furnished by Liquidmetal Technology, the company headed by Tom Steipp as its CEO. Now, Steipp has confirmed that Apple has future plans with liquid metal. Liquid metal is a material with a metallic glass-like composition, a material that can look really, really cool on a tech gadget. Moreover, it shows promising durability and strength and it is precisely for this reason that many analysts had speculated that Apple may use it in iPhone 5.However, now Steipp has come forth and announced that Apple has indeed license liquid metal for use in its future products. He didn’t clearly confirm or rebuff the rumor that Apple will use it in its next iPhone too.  According to Steipp, “Apple along with us are commercializing Liquidmetal in the consumer electronic space.” He also revealed that Apple has licensed the material from his company as far back as 2010. Naturally, Apple hasn’t revealed the tiniest bit of this deal or its plans regarding a liquid metal future.The greatest advantage Apple will have in using liquid metal is that of looks as well as strength and space saving. Apple can construct casing for iPhone and iPad that are twice as strong as titanium, the metal that is often hailed for its strength. Moreover, liquid metal casing can allow Apple to trim down on the thickness of its devices further.Finally, with Apple having the exclusive license to liquid metal use, its products may stand out in the market with the other vendors forced to not copy it, which in itself is going to be a very difficult task according to Steipp. Steipp’s talk is posted below.Source: RedmondpieBuy Cheapest Related Product From Amazon.com      « Previous  QuickOffice Acquired By Google Next » By 2017, More Than 80% Of The Users Will Have 3G/4GYou can also press the left/right arrow key on your keyboard to go to previous/next post  Tags: Apple, Apple Product, iPad casing, iPhone 5, iPhone casing, liquid metal, Liquidmetal Technology  On June 6, 2012(5 years, 1 month ago.)

Quote:Liquidmetal Technologies Review of Product Line Financial Results and Guidance  April 20, 2017    Liquidmetal Technologies Inc (OTCQB: LQMT), is a leading developer of bulk amorphous alloys. Amorphous alloys are unique materials that are distinguished by their ability to be injection molded and die cast into high performance applications for a broad range of markets.   The company recently announced that it has received two hot crucible amorphous metal molding machines from the Company’s licensing partner Eontec Ltd.  LQMT’s hot-crucible machines provide the benefits of amorphous alloy technology to price-sensitive applications that were previously beyond its reach. Management is bullish about the synergistic benefits accruing due to merger of Eontec’s technology and expertise within Liquidmetal.   As per management, the company’s business risk profile is on a rapid growth trajectory and it’s making excellent progress on its plans to significantly expand market reach and the scale of operations.   Previously, the company announced that it has passed additional pre-screening biocompatibility tests for use in medical implants and is now pursuing collaborations with medical implant companies.   The results of these tests strategically position the Company to engage medical device customers in a broad range of implantable device applications including, cardiac rhythm, cochlear, spinal, and orthopedic implants among others. Liquidmetal will now focus on collaborating with medical implant manufacturers to identify specific applications to further explore the use of Liquidmetal.   In 2016, the company generated $480 thousand ($125 thousand in 2015) in revenue as it continued to focus on development and manufacturing of prototype and commercial parts for its customers, and collaborating with licensees on the development of the Company’s technology and production processes. Notwithstanding its revenue growth, Liquidmetal continues to struggle with subdued profitability, and high debt amongst other challenges.   The new addition of these systems along with the above-mentioned strategic developments could potentially benefit the company’s earnings and revenues, and consequently, this could drive LQMT shares.  The company’s stock has witnessed significant strength in the recent past. Liquidmetal reported an increase in share price backed by its above-expected performance and robust guidance laying foundation for revenue visibility and business growth.   Description & about the Company:   California-based Liquidmetal Technologies, Inc. is the leading developer of bulk alloys and composites that utilize the performance advantages offered by amorphous alloy technology. Amorphous alloys are unique materials that are distinguished by their ability to retain a random structure when they solidify, in contrast to the crystalline atomic structure that forms in ordinary metals and alloys. Liquidmetal Technologies is the first company to produce amorphous alloys in commercially viable bulk form, enabling significant improvements in products across a wide array of industries.   About Eontec:   EONTEC (“EON”) provides one-stop solutions in aluminum & magnesium die-casting. It is also an innovator in amorphous metals with substantive IP in alloys, molds, machines and manufacturing processes.   Advanced Amorphous Metal Molding Systems:   Liquidmetal received two hot crucible amorphous metal molding machines from the Company’s licensing partner Eontec Ltd.   These Machines allow the production of amorphous alloy parts that are up to three times larger and one-third the cost of established technologies. This technology complements Liquidmetal’s well established cold-crucible systems, which are capable of producing parts that meet requirements for the most demanding medical and automotive applications. The Machines are in the Company’s new 41,000 square-foot manufacturing facility in Lake Forest, CA., where operations are planned to commence in the second half of this year.   Liquidmetal’s hot-crucible machines provide the benefits of amorphous alloy technology to price-sensitive applications that were previously beyond company’s reach.   Implant Study:   Liquidmetal has passed additional pre-screening biocompatibility tests for use in medical implants and is now pursuing collaborations with medical implant companies.    In February 2017, LQMT received long-term implantation results from parts 3, 10, 6 and 11 of the ISO 10993 (Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices) suite of tests, which include evaluation of genotoxicity, sub-chronic systemic toxicity, and pyrogenicity. LQMT alloy LM105 passed all of these tests well within the allowable limits. These results, combined with previously completed tests from ISO 10993 parts 10, 11, 4, and 5 which cover sensitization, irritation, acute systemic toxicity, hemocompatibility and cytotoxicity, indicate that the Liquidmetal process is compatible with a wide range of medical device requirements including long term implants.   The results of these tests are very exciting and it positions LQMT well to engage medical device customers in a broad range of implantable device applications including, cardiac rhythm, cochlear, spinal, and orthopedic implants among others.   With the above-mentioned developments, along with purchase of a new, larger manufacturing facility, as well as sourcing alternatives, manufacturing platforms and materials from China-based Eontec, Liquidmetal is actively moving towards increasing manufacturing capabilities, expanding the range of products it will be able to manufacture, and providing lower cost solutions to customers. Management believes that these investments, when combined with an improved capital structure and future strategies, will allow LQMT to accomplish goal of expanding the Liquidmetal brand and future profitability.   Key Stock Influences & Risk Factors:  Limited Track record & Competitive landscape: Liquidmetal competes against companies that have relatively more established products, longer operating histories and greater resources, which may prevent it from achieving rapid market penetration or increased operating results. Also, LQMT has a limited history of developing and selling products. Therefore, if the company cannot ramp up its business, as envisioned, it may not achieve the anticipated market penetration, revenue targets or profitability.   Liquidity & Financial Flexibility:   Liquidmetal’s business is not currently profitable, and it may not be able to achieve profitability even if it continues to record significant growth in revenue. The operating loss for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 were $9.9 million, $9.3 million, and $8.9 million, respectively. It had an accumulated deficit of approximately $236.7 million at December 31, 2016.   Therefore, its ability to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility to fund its incremental capital requirements will remain key financial sensitivity factor for the company.   Earnings Review:   Total revenue increased by $355 thousand to $480 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $125 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2015.  The increase for the period was attributable to a higher mix of small-scale pre-production orders during 2016 as a result of continued growth of on-site manufacturing capabilities.   Profitability:   Gross profit (loss) increased by $151 thousand from $(224) thousand as of December 31, 2015 to $(73) thousand as of December 31, 2016.   Operating loss increased by $606 thousand from $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Fluctuations in operating loss are primarily attributable to variations in operating expenses.   Also, annual net losses of $18.8 million as of December 31, 2016 and $7.3 million as of December 31, 2015 are reflective of operating expenses associated with on-going business as well as non-operational expenses.   Cash Flow & Balance Sheet:    Cash and restricted cash totaled $58.9 million at December 31, 2016, as compared to $4.8 million at December 31, 2015.   The company anticipates that its current capital resources, when considering expected losses from operations, will be sufficient to fund the Company’s operations for the foreseeable future.   Stock Performance  On Wednesday, April 19th, 2017, LQMT shares surged by 3.36% to $0.268 on an average volume of 1.65 million shares exchanging hands. Market capitalization is $237.03M. The current 14 days RSI is 68.54   In the past 52 weeks, shares of LQMT have traded as low as $0.12 and as high as $0.29   At $0.268, shares of LQMT are trading above their 50-day moving average (MA) at $0.216 and above their 200-day MA at $0.187   The present support and resistance levels for the stock are at $0.2539 & $0.2669 respectively.

Liquidmetal and Vitreloy are commercial names of a series of amorphous metal alloys developed by a California Institute of Technology (Caltech) research team and marketed by Liquidmetal Technologies. Liquidmetal alloys combine a number of desirable material features, including high tensile strength, excellent corrosion resistance, very high coefficient of restitution and excellent anti-wearing characteristics, while also being able to be heat-formed in processes similar to thermoplastics. Despite the name, they are not liquid at room temperature.[1]
Liquidmetal was introduced for commercial applications in 2003.[2] It is used for, among other things, golf clubs, watches and covers of cell phones.
The alloy was the end result of a research program into amorphous metals carried out at Caltech. It was the first of a series of experimental alloys that could achieve an amorphous structure at relatively slow cooling rates.[citation needed] Amorphous metals had been made before, but only in small batches because cooling rates needed to be in the millions of degrees per second. For example, amorphous wires could be fabricated by splat quenching a stream of molten metal on a spinning disk. Because Vitreloy allowed such slow cooling rates, production of larger batch sizes was possible. More recently, a number of additional alloys have been added to the Liquidmetal portfolio. These alloys also retain their amorphous structure after repeated re-heating, allowing them to be used in a wide variety of traditional machining processes.

Characteristics[edit]
Liquidmetal, created by Dr. Atakan Peker, contain atoms of significantly different sizes. They form a dense mix with low free volume. Unlike crystalline metals, there is no obvious melting point at which viscosity drops suddenly. Vitreloy behaves more like other glasses, in that its viscosity drops gradually with increased temperature. At high temperature, it behaves in a plastic manner, allowing the mechanical properties to be controlled relatively easily during casting. The viscosity prevents the atoms moving enough to form an ordered lattice, so the material retains its amorphous properties even after being heat-formed.
The alloys have relatively low softening temperatures, allowing casting of complicated shapes without need for finishing. The material properties immediately after casting are much better than those of conventional metals; usually, cast metals have worse properties than forged or wrought ones. The alloys are also malleable at low temperatures (400 °C or 752 °F for the earliest formulation), and can be molded. The low free volume also results in low shrinkage during cooling. For all of these reasons, Liquidmetal can be formed into complex shapes using processes similar to thermoplastics,[3] which makes Liquidmetal a potential replacement for many applications where plastics would normally be used.
Due to their non-crystalline (amorphous) structures, Liquidmetals are harder than alloys of titanium or aluminum of similar composition. The zirconium and titanium based Liquidmetal alloys achieved yield strength of over 1723 MPa, nearly twice the strength of conventional crystalline titanium alloys (Ti6Al4V is ~830 MPa), and about the strength of high-strength steels and some highly engineered bulk composite materials (see tensile strength for a list of common materials). However, the early casting methods introduced microscopic flaws that were excellent sites for crack propagation which led to Vitreloy being fragile like glass. Although strong, these early batches shattered easily when struck. Newer casting methods, adjustments of the alloy mixtures and other changes have improved this.[citation needed]
The lack of grain boundaries contributes to the high yield strength (and thereby resilience) exhibited. In a demonstration, a metal sphere dropped on amorphous steel bounced significantly longer than the same metal sphere dropped on crystalline steel.[4]
The lack of grain boundaries in a metallic glass eliminates grain-boundary corrosion—a common problem in high-strength alloys produced by precipitation hardening and sensitized stainless steels. Liquidmetal alloys are therefore generally more corrosion resistant, both due to the mechanical structure as well as the elements used in its alloy. The combination of mechanical hardness, high elasticity and corrosion resistance makes Liquidmetal wear resistant.
Although at high temperatures, plastic deformation occurs easily, almost none occurs at room temperature before the onset of catastrophic failure. This limits the material's applicability in reliability-critical applications, as the impending failure is not evident. The material is also susceptible to metal fatigue with crack growth. A two-phase composite structure with amorphous matrix and a ductile dendritic crystalline-phase reinforcement, or a metal matrix composite reinforced with fibers of other material can reduce or eliminate this disadvantage.[5]
Uses[edit]
Liquidmetal combines a number of features that are normally not found in any one material. This makes them useful in a wide variety of applications.
One of the first commercial uses of Liquidmetal was in golf clubs made by the company, where the highly elastic metal was used in portions of the club face.[6] These were highly rated by users, but the product was later dropped, in part because the prototypes shattered after fewer than 40 hits.[7] Since then, Liquidmetal has appeared in other sports equipment, including the cores of golf balls, skis, baseball and softball bats, and tennis racquets.[8]
The ability to be cast and molded, combined with high wear resistance, has also led to Liquidmetal being used as a replacement for plastics in some applications.[9] It has been used on the casing of late-model SanDisk "Cruzer Titanium" USB flash drives as well as their Sansa line of flash-based MP3 player, and casings of some mobile phones, like the luxury Vertu products, and other toughened consumer electronics.[citation needed] Liquidmetal was used in the Biolase dental laser Ilase and the Socketmobile ring bar code scanner. Liquidmetal has also notably been used for making the SIM ejector tool of some iPhone 3Gs made by Apple Inc., shipped in the US. This was done by Apple as an exercise to test the viability of usage of the metal.[10] They retain a scratch-free surface longer than competing materials, while still being made in complex shapes. The same qualities lend it to use as protective coatings for industrial machinery, including petroleum drill pipes and power plant boiler tubes.[citation needed]
It also replaces titanium in applications ranging from medical instruments and cars to the military and aerospace industry. In military applications, rods of amorphous metals replace depleted uranium in kinetic energy penetrators.[11] Plates of Liquidmetal were used in the solar wind ion collector array in the Genesis space probe.[citation needed]

Liquidmetal and Vitreloy are commercial names of a series of amorphous metal alloys developed by a California Institute of Technology (Caltech) research team and marketed by Liquidmetal Technologies. Liquidmetal alloys combine a number of desirable material features, including high tensile strength, excellent corrosion resistance, very high coefficient of restitution and excellent anti-wearing characteristics, while also being able to be heat-formed in processes similar to thermoplastics. Despite the name, they are not liquid at room temperature.[1]
Liquidmetal was introduced for commercial applications in 2003.[2] It is used for, among other things, golf clubs, watches and covers of cell phones.
The alloy was the end result of a research program into amorphous metals carried out at Caltech. It was the first of a series of experimental alloys that could achieve an amorphous structure at relatively slow cooling rates.[citation needed] Amorphous metals had been made before, but only in small batches because cooling rates needed to be in the millions of degrees per second. For example, amorphous wires could be fabricated by splat quenching a stream of molten metal on a spinning disk. Because Vitreloy allowed such slow cooling rates, production of larger batch sizes was possible. More recently, a number of additional alloys have been added to the Liquidmetal portfolio. These alloys also retain their amorphous structure after repeated re-heating, allowing them to be used in a wide variety of traditional machining processes.

Liquidmetal, created by Dr. Atakan Peker, contain atoms of significantly different sizes. They form a dense mix with low free volume. Unlike crystalline metals, there is no obvious melting point at which viscosity drops suddenly. Vitreloy behaves more like other glasses, in that its viscosity drops gradually with increased temperature. At high temperature, it behaves in a plastic manner, allowing the mechanical properties to be controlled relatively easily during casting. The viscosity prevents the atoms moving enough to form an ordered lattice, so the material retains its amorphous properties even after being heat-formed.

Liquidmetal alloys are therefore generally more corrosion resistant, both due to the mechanical structure as well as the elements used in its alloy. The combination of mechanical hardness, high elasticity and corrosion resistance makes Liquidmetal wear resistant.
Although at high temperatures, plastic deformation occurs easily, almost none occurs at room temperature before the onset of catastrophic failure. This limits the material's applicability in reliability-critical applications, as the impending failure is not evident. The material is also susceptible to metal fatigue with crack growth. A two-phase composite structure with amorphous matrix and a ductile dendritic crystalline-phase reinforcement, or a metal matrix composite reinforced with fibers of other material can reduce or eliminate this disadvantage.[5]
Uses[edit]
Liquidmetal combines a number of features that are normally not found in any one material. This makes them useful in a wide variety of applications.
One of the first commercial uses of Liquidmetal was in golf clubs made by the company, where the highly elastic metal was used in portions of the club face.[6] These were highly rated by users, but the product was later dropped, in part because the prototypes shattered after fewer than 40 hits.[7] Since then, Liquidmetal has appeared in other sports equipment, including the cores of golf balls, skis, baseball and softball bats, and tennis racquets.[8]
The ability to be cast and molded, combined with high wear resistance, has also led to Liquidmetal being used as a replacement for plastics in some applications.[9] It has been used on the casing of late-model SanDisk "Cruzer Titanium" USB flash drives as well as their Sansa line of flash-based MP3 player, and casings of some mobile phones, like the luxury Vertu products, and other toughened consumer electronics.[citation needed] Liquidmetal was used in the Biolase dental laser Ilase and the Socketmobile ring bar code scanner. Liquidmetal has also notably been used for making the SIM ejector tool of some iPhone 3Gs made by Apple Inc., shipped in the US. This was done by Apple as an exercise to test the viability of usage of the metal.[10] They retain a scratch-free surface longer than competing materials, while still being made in complex shapes. The same qualities lend it to use as protective coatings for industrial machinery, including petroleum drill pipes and power plant boiler tubes.[citation needed]
It also replaces titanium in applications ranging from medical instruments and cars to the military and aerospace industry. In military applications, rods of amorphous metals replace depleted uranium in kinetic energy penetrators.[11] Plates of Liquidmetal were used in the solar wind ion collector array in the Genesis space probe.[citation needed]

Liquidmetal and Vitreloy are commercial names of a series of amorphous metal alloys developed by a California Institute of Technology (Caltech) research team and marketed by Liquidmetal Technologies. Liquidmetal alloys combine a number of desirable material features, including high tensile strength, excellent corrosion resistance, very high coefficient of restitution and excellent anti-wearing characteristics, while also being able to be heat-formed in processes similar to thermoplastics. Despite the name, they are not liquid at room temperature.[1]
Liquidmetal was introduced for commercial applications in 2003.[2] It is used for, among other things, golf clubs, watches and covers of cell phones.
The alloy was the end result of a research program into amorphous metals carried out at Caltech. It was the first of a series of experimental alloys that could achieve an amorphous structure at relatively slow cooling rates.[citation needed] Amorphous metals had been made before, but only in small batches because cooling rates needed to be in the millions of degrees per second. For example, amorphous wires could be fabricated by splat quenching a stream of molten metal on a spinning disk. Because Vitreloy allowed such slow cooling rates, production of larger batch sizes was possible. More recently, a number of additional alloys have been added to the Liquidmetal portfolio. These alloys also retain their amorphous structure after repeated re-heating, allowing them to be used in a wide variety of traditional machining processes.

Characteristics[edit]
Liquidmetal, created by Dr. Atakan Peker, contain atoms of significantly different sizes. They form a dense mix with low free volume. Unlike crystalline metals, there is no obvious melting point at which viscosity drops suddenly. Vitreloy behaves more like other glasses, in that its viscosity drops gradually with increased temperature. At high temperature, it behaves in a plastic manner, allowing the mechanical properties to be controlled relatively easily during casting. The viscosity prevents the atoms moving enough to form an ordered lattice, so the material retains its amorphous properties even after being heat-formed.
The alloys have relatively low softening temperatures, allowing casting of complicated shapes without need for finishing. The material properties immediately after casting are much better than those of conventional metals; usually, cast metals have worse properties than forged or wrought ones. The alloys are also malleable at low temperatures (400 °C or 752 °F for the earliest formulation), and can be molded. The low free volume also results in low shrinkage during cooling. For all of these reasons, Liquidmetal can be formed into complex shapes using processes similar to thermoplastics,[3] which makes Liquidmetal a potential replacement for many applications where plastics would normally be used.
Due to their non-crystalline (amorphous) structures, Liquidmetals are harder than alloys of titanium or aluminum of similar composition. The zirconium and titanium based Liquidmetal alloys achieved yield strength of over 1723 MPa, nearly twice the strength of conventional crystalline titanium alloys (Ti6Al4V is ~830 MPa), and about the strength of high-strength steels and some highly engineered bulk composite materials (see tensile strength for a list of common materials). However, the early casting methods introduced microscopic flaws that were excellent sites for crack propagation which led to Vitreloy being fragile like glass. Although strong, these early batches shattered easily when struck. Newer casting methods, adjustments of the alloy mixtures and other changes have improved this.[citation needed]
The lack of grain boundaries contributes to the high yield strength (and thereby resilience) exhibited. In a demonstration, a metal sphere dropped on amorphous steel bounced significantly longer than the same metal sphere dropped on crystalline steel.[4]
The lack of grain boundaries in a metallic glass eliminates grain-boundary corrosion—a common problem in high-strength alloys produced by precipitation hardening and sensitized stainless steels. Liquidmetal alloys are therefore generally more corrosion resistant, both due to the mechanical structure as well as the elements used in its alloy. The combination of mechanical hardness, high elasticity and corrosion resistance makes Liquidmetal wear resistant.
Although at high temperatures, plastic deformation occurs easily, almost none occurs at room temperature before the onset of catastrophic failure. This limits the material's applicability in reliability-critical applications, as the impending failure is not evident. The material is also susceptible to metal fatigue with crack growth. A two-phase composite structure with amorphous matrix and a ductile dendritic crystalline-phase reinforcement, or a metal matrix composite reinforced with fibers of other material can reduce or eliminate this disadvantage.[5]
