 Scott B. Salmirs
2016 Recipient, Distinguished Community Service Award
The United Hospital Fund’s Distinguished Community Service Award recognizes volunteer leadership of a specific project or initiative that significantly improves health care in New York City. This year, we salute Scott B. Salmirs, a founder of Donate Eight, a nonprofit organization that has galvanized members of New York’s real estate, building management, and building services community on behalf of organ donation awareness and registration.
In New York City, lots of important ideas are born over lunch. It’s rare, though, that an idea takes root that has the potential to save thousands of New Yorkers’ lives. Yet that’s just what happened in 2012 when Scott Salmirs, president and chief executive officer of ABM Industries, an international facility management provider, and Jodi Goldman, a colleague in the real estate industry, got talking about New York’s desperate need for more organ donors.
Already a registered organ donor, Scott was passionate about the issue and dismayed by the dire statistics: 10,000 New Yorkers are awaiting an organ transplant; every 18 hours, a New Yorker dies waiting for a heart, lung, kidney, or pancreas; New York State is ranked last in the nation in the percentage of people registered to be organ donors. He was also drawn to the cause because making progress didn’t require finding a cure. “The ‘cure’ is right in front of us,” says Scott. “Lives can be saved by simply educating people and getting them registered as donors.” Scott left that lunch with a growing belief that he could make a difference.
Within weeks, Scott was offering his help to a very grateful and somewhat incredulous Helen Irving, the CEO and president of LiveOnNY, the nonprofit, federally designated organ procurement organization that serves 13 million people in the greater New York metropolitan area. LiveOnNY works closely with 10 transplant centers and more than 90 hospitals to facilitate organ, eye, and tissue donation and transplantation, and is dedicated to educating the public about donation and encouraging enrollment in the New York State Donate Life Registry.
Scott then tapped eight prominent and like-minded executives from New York’s real estate, building management, and building services community, who enthusiastically joined his cause. They named themselves Donate Eight, a reference to the eight life-saving organs that one person can donate.
“Getting that initial call from Scott was the kind of gift every leader of a nonprofit dreams of,” says Helen Irving.
An early and central priority of Donate Eight was to raise significant funds to support LiveOnNY’s vital work and strong partnership with the hospital community—and to raise awareness among members of the New York real estate community about the power of organ donation. In just four years, Donate Eight’s annual reception has become both a signature event and an eye-opening, “must-attend” evening for hundreds of real estate executives—raising hundreds of thousands of dollars each year, and showcasing the miracle of organ donation.
“Every donation story is so moving,” says Scott. “When you hear a father talk about meeting a child who received the heart of his own deceased three-year-old son, it just takes your breath away.”
Spurred by the funds Donate Eight raised—now $3.2 million—and the promise of continuing support, in early 2016 LiveOnNY established the LiveOnNY Foundation to extend its critical work of encouraging New Yorkers to register as organ donors, raising awareness about donation as a gift of life, and supporting donor families in their decision-making and in their grief. New initiatives will also support scientific research on transplantation and opportunities to advance living donation.
Dispelling myths about organ donation is a particular passion for Scott. “Some people inaccurately believe that if they are registered as organ donors, medical professionals won’t work as hard to save their life,” he says. “Others are concerned that organ donation may be against their religion, when in reality it is consistent with most major religions’ beliefs. And some believe that an open-casket funeral isn’t an option for people who have donated organs or tissues—also not true. Education about these and other issues is truly a matter of life and death.”
What drives Scott Salmirs? He’s always been guided, he says, by the principle that helping others enriches your own life—and his wife of 30 years, Marcy, has been a key role model for his charitable work. For more than 20 years, she’s spearheaded a program that delivers food to needy families in the south Bronx; she’s also been instrumental in Donate Eight’s success, running all aspects of its annual fundraising event. Scott is quick to acknowledge, too, that the organization’s success comes from the collective strength, commitment, and enthusiasm of its founding board.
For his bold and decisive action to address the urgent need for increased organ donation awareness and registration in the greater New York area—and for tapping his vast professional and personal network to assist in this truly life-saving initiative—United Hospital Fund is proud to present Scott Salmirs with the 2016 Distinguished Community Service Award.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
