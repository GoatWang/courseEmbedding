Berkshire Style - Anne Sutherland Fuchs 







Berkshire Style - In and Around The Berkshires, An Online Resource




Anne Sutherland Fuchs by Kathryn BoughtonAnne Sutherland Fuchs no longer leads publications such as Vogue, Harpers Bazaar, Redbook, Womans Day and Town & Country. She has stepped aside from her executive positions at The New York Times Company, Hachette Publications, Condé Nast, CBS and JC Penny and has transplanted her home from New York City to western Connecticut.

But her drive to serve societys greater good, which paralleled her extraordinary business career, has not diminished. In her view, the two functions require many of the same skills. I look at philanthropies like a business," she said. You have to look at [an organizations] fiscal responsibility, process and results."

The newest board member for the Torrington-based Community Foundation of Northwest Connecticut, which provides philanthropic support to 20 towns in Litchfield County, has high praise for the foundation.

It started [in 1969] with $15,000," she related. Now our product is $87 millionhow do we disseminate it and partner with community organizations? There is a process that has to be followed and the process of running this fund couldnt get better."

A national survey ranked the Foundation number 2 in the country for philanthropic oversight. Annually, it distributes $3.5 million to programs in its 20 communities. 

Fuchs has a wealth of experience to inform her assessment of the Community Foundation. She was founder, president, then chair of the Madison Boys and Girls Club, Women's Board trustee of the Whitney Museum, and chair of the USIA's Magazine and Print Committee, formed in 1989 to distribute publications in former Soviet Bloc countries to help them understand democracy and the American way of life.

A past board member of the Berkshire School in Sheffield, she is currently on the board of Greenwoods Counseling Referrals, which makes mental health services available to area residents.
She credits her success in the publishing world to her lifelong interest in reading and a talent for business." Her pleasure in being around energized, creative people and of getting a number and tripling it" made her a natural for the magazine world and opened doors for her in a male-dominated environment.

She said that consistently delivering" eased her way through the publishing hierarchy. Nobody can argue with a number," she observed. One time could be a fluke, but not 20 times. If there was a wall in front of me and I couldnt go through it, I just went around."

Promoting a magazine requires being on top of the sociological wave, she said. And you have to stay on top and ride it. It wasnt just selling one issueit was a collective, living, breathing product."
During her career, she oversaw the business-side launches of "O", the Oprah Magazine, Marie Claire and Elle Magazine and managed Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, Redbook and Town & Country. She also served as Global CEO of Phillips, de Pury and Luxembourg, then owned by LVMH Moêt Hennessy-Louis Vuitton.

As Group President of the Growth Brands Division of the JCPenney Company, she launched two start-up digital retail websites. She currently sits on the boards of Pitney Bowes Inc. and Gartner Inc.

A long-time Washington, Conn. homeowner, she moved there full time almost two years ago, enjoying the region with her two college-age sons, Slater and Nicky. I love this community," she said. My two sons consider it home."

Becoming one of the most accomplished and recognized businesswomen and publishers in the country was never Anne Sutherland Fuchs’s intent. In fact she might have thought it impossible. But that’s exactly what happened.



Fuchs was born in Brazil to, as she described them, an English mother and a very American father. When she was still a child the family moved to the Midwest and she grew up in Chicago. She graduated from New York University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in French literature. When she went to study at the Sorbonne Fuchs decided that she wanted to live out the rest of her days in France. But that didn’t happen.



“I had a life-threatening accident,” Fuchs said. “That’s when I became a serious person and began confronting a lot of issues. Before that I never took anything seriously. I had no business skills and my background in French literature didn’t present many career opportunities.”



Fuchs arrived in New York flat broke and in need of a job—quickly. She went to a personnel agency that advertised in The New Yorks Times, hoping to find a job at an art gallery or similar institution.

“The interviewer looked at my résumé and noted that my degree was in French literature not art,” Fuchs recalled. “’But, she said, you’d be perfect for Hertz,’ as in rent-a-car.’ I don’t know how she determined this would be suitable for me, but I said yes. This is called survival; I only had five dollars to my name at the time.



“At Hertz I interviewed with this wonderful Irishman who hired me as his assistant. When he asked if I could type I said no, but I quickly learned how to be a customer relations manager by listening to him deal with clients.”



A fast learner, Fuchs was offered a job in sales, She begged off at first since she knew her boss always fired people in sales who didn’t make their numbers. But then she took the job anyway and became the number one salesperson in the country and the only woman in the industry to reach that mark.



“To me everyone was a potential client,” Fuchs explained. “So I went after insurance companies, like New York Life, which was huge. I understood the margins and would rewrite contracts to make them more attractive—but still profitable. And I just kept bringing in new accounts.”



Word was out that Fuchs was a phenomenon in the business and job offers came pouring in. “I didn’t even have a briefcase!” she said. “I didn’t know I was going to be successful in business, I was just trying to survive. When I used to give speeches to women’s groups they always asked who my mentors were. My mentor was survival. It teaches you a great deal fast.”



After three years in the car rental business, Fuchs went on to work with The New York Times as manager of the National Food Business to sell media to regional sales managers, an untapped resource that proved very profitable for everyone.



“My jobs always seemed to be for three-years or so,” Fuchs said. “The first year was spent figuring out the job, the second year would be working and selling; by the third year I was successful and then something else would come my way.”



Her next opportunity came from the publishing industry. She was offered a job with Charter Publishing which owned the Ladies Home Journal, Redbook, and Sport Magazine. She began producing inserts for the magazine with special promotions and eventually started a division called Charter Contest where they put all their special interest publications.



As she approached each new challenge—and became known for her business expertise and her willingness to try something new—Fuchs carved out an incredible career path. She became publisher of Cuisine, which led to her work with two magazine publishing titans, Hearst and Conde Nast, where Fuchs became the first female publisher of Vogue. At Hearst she served as Senior Vice-President/Group Publishing Director of Hearst Magazines, which included management of the publications known as the “Women’s Group:” O, The Oprah Magazine, Town & Country, Harper’s Bazaar, Marie Claire, Redbook, and Victoria. She also launched the American edition of Elle. She was responsible for an incredible assortment of some of the most prestigious magazines in the country.



“It was a very exciting time for me,” Fuchs said. “In the magazine business you creating a product you want someone to like all the time. Each issue has to be a different flavor, but you need some consistency so the consumer isn’t confused.” A challenging task at best. In order to raise sales, the product always had to be right.



“I love being around creative people, but my strength is the business side. I’m not capable of producing extraordinary photo essays and understanding the nuance of things. Editorial is the driver,” Fuchs explained. “I have to applaud the extraordinary editors I was privileged to work with. I don’t create the product; it’s the editors who do that and if they can come up with a product that consumers want, I can do the rest.



“Women’s Day is a perfect example. When I was there newsstand sales were at five-and-a half million copies. Women purchased the magazine because they saw something on the cover they wanted to read. And buying at the newsstand is so much faster than taking out a subscription. You want to grab the consumer immediately.”



As Fuchs talks about her publishing experiences one can see that she clearly loved being involved in the industry and is proud of what she achieved. But how does one keep up the momentum?



“I love the challenge of taking something to a new level,” Fuchs said, “changing the format, trying something no one else has done before. It’s risky, but terribly exciting. It’s wonderful to feel the muscle twitch across the country for the product you’re involved with.”



Fuchs became known as an innovator with extensive branding experience within the media industry and has been recognized for her achievements with numerous awards, including, the Matrix Award for Magazines by Women of Communication, Advertising Women of the Year, and the Woman of the Year Award by the NY Police Athletic League. She was also named one of the “21 Leaders for the 21st Century” by Women eNews.



Under Mayor Bloomberg, she was made chairwoman of the NYC Commission on Women’s Issues, serving as a liaison between the Mayor and the female community. In that capacity she worked to brand New York City as a desirable place for women to thrive, raising opportunities for education, and a place to build both a career and a family.



Balancing a career and family was of great concern to Fuchs when she decided to have children. It is a dilemma many career women face.



“Children are not for every women,” said Fuchs. “But all along I always wanted children. It was a challenge. I was used to working 24/7. When my boys were younger I still worked all the time, but running home to attend school meetings, sports events, helping with homework—in between appointments. When I became a single mom I just stopped. I put my briefcase and my ambition on a shelf—where I could easily pick them up again. You have to decide with kind of parent you’re going to be. My only way was to be there, to be a wall of constant strength.”



Her sons, Nicky, 21 and Slater, 20, are both at Southern Methodist University in Texas. “It was their idea to attend the same school. It’s perfect—they are wonderful friends and support each other. I feel very blessed,” Fuchs said.



In 2013, Fuchs made Washington, Conn., her permanent residence.



“My life in New York had changed,” she explained. “I had worked with JC Penney and started online retail stores for them. I was going back and forth to Dallas and Chicago, but I didn’t need to be in New York City. I decided I wanted to wake up to beautiful. So, here I am in this wonderful place—it was a big decision but it seems as natural as daylight for me to be here all the time.”



But living in the country has not affected Fuchs’s energy and need to be involved in new projects. “At the moment I sit on two corporate boards, Gartner Inc. and Pitney Bowes, Inc.” Locally she was named to the board of directors of The Community Foundation of Northwest Connecticut. She is also on the board of Greenwoods Counseling Referral, Inc.



In this idyllic setting, with her many commitments, Fuchs does manage to do some recreational things she loves most.



“I love to entertain,” she said. “’Entertain’ being the operative word, because I am not a great cook. And taking long walks with our black Lab, watching her splash in stream, so much energy!”



However, Fuchs is always looking for the next challenge. “If you are open to people as well as opportunities, you never stop learning. And that’s what I love.”
