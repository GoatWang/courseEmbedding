GLENDALE Ariz. — Andrew Barroway burst onto the scene three months ago when the New York Post reported he was pursuing a majority stake in the Coyotes. But he remained out of the spotlight until the deal was completed Wednesday.
The Coyotes on Friday formally introduced their new majority owner, chairman and governor at a press conference at Gila River Arena. While Barroway’s arrival won’t have an immediate impact on the on-ice product, he believes the deal gives the team more financial stability and flexibility. 
"We want to build this right way; the smart way," he said. "That’s a long-term process."
Coyotes fans that are hoping the team spends lavishly at the trade deadline or in free agency this summer may be disappointed. With the team already 13 points out of the playoffs before Friday’s games, there will be no quick fixes. The free-agent pool this summer is also considered weak, so fans may have to accept a slower process if the Coyotes do not identify players that fit their future plans this summer.
FOX Sports Arizona sat down with Barroway after Friday’s press conference to examine the future of the franchise — and to get the answers to all those questions fans have been dying to ask the past three months.
What took you so long?
Barroway: (laughs) "This is actually the timeline you expect. It’s a long and complicated process because it’s a complicated transaction. I’m just happy we got it done and I’m happy we got it done before the end of the year which was good, but I don’t consider this to be anything out of the ordinary in terms of timing." 
How did you become interested in the Coyotes and why?
Barroway: "I think it was late September or early October. I was introduced to (Coyotes president and CEO) Anthony (LeBlanc) through our bankers. We got along great and I thought it was a great opportunity. I think hockey is and can continue to be successful here in the Valley. Anthony and (alternate governor) George (Gosbee) were just a great bunch of guys. It was just a nice, natural fit."


 BLUE JACKETS at COYOTES
When: 6 p.m. SaturdayWhere: Gila River Arena, GlendaleTV: FOX Sports ArizonaInjuries: Blue Jackets: F Nathan Horton (back), D Ryan Murray (knee), F Mark Letestu (groin), F Artem Anisimov (torn triceps), F Brian Gibbons (knee), F Boone Jenner (back) and F Cam Atkinson (shoulder) are all on injured reserve. Coyotes: F Joe Vitale (lower body) and D Chris Summers (upper body) are day to day but both are likely to play.Quick facts: The Coyotes waived defenseman David Schlemko on Friday. … A win over Minnesota on Wednesday gave Columbus its 10th victory in 12 games in December and brought the Blue Jackets back to .500 (16-16-3) for the first time since Oct. 26. … Columbus left wing Nick Foligno signed a six-year, $33 million extension on Wednesday. Foligno leads the team with 17 goals and is tied with center Ryan Johansen for the team lead in points with 32.


Why would you want to buy a team that hasn’t made money since it arrived in the Valley in 1996?
Barroway: "I didn’t do the deal to make money. Let me say that first. I’ve always been a huge sports fan and hockey fan. This was a dream since childhood. But having said that, you want the deal to be on strong financial footing. This team is heading in that direction. Corporate sales are up. Ticket sales are up. Everything is trending in the right direction and in the National Hockey League overall, everything is trending up, too so I think we’re going to get there. We also have a strong partnership with the City of Glendale. I just saw it as a good investment for me to get in and work with people I like." 
How active an owner do you plan to be?
Barroway: "I’m going to be an active owner. I will be involved in all the major decisions of the team. I would let the hockey guys control the hockey operations. They know a lot more about hockey than me. 
So no coaching aspirations?
Barroway: "I will not be coaching the team." 
There are reports you wanted to flip the team quickly, possibly to another owner to relocate it to Las Vegas. Can you comment on that speculation?
Barroway: "Completely untrue. I am buying this team because I am a lifelong sports and hockey fan. It has always been my dream to become an owner. I want to bring a winner to the Valley. That (report) couldn’t be any more false. I am thrilled to be here and am thrilled to be an owner and would not have gone through this difficult process in buying a team just to go flip it. I don’t think people buy teams to make money. That’s not the goal. You try not to lose too much, but no, I certainly did not buy it for a quick flip. I can’t state that any more emphatically.
For those reading the tea leaves, it has been pretty apparent the NHL wanted to expand, not relocate to Las Vegas for some time. Were you aware of the league’s expansion plans to Las Vegas and other markets as you began pursuing this deal?
Barroway: "There had been talk of expansion to Vegas and yes I was aware of that ahead of time, but again, there was never any thought to relocating the team. We want to build a winner here. We never had any thought about Las Vegas or any other market."
There were multiple reports that this deal started falling apart in recent weeks. Were those reports valid? 
Barroway: "No. It’s weird to read articles about yourself that you know are just not right. It is what it is. There are always going to be rumors but we were always completely committed to the deal. People are interested in sports and people come up with cockamamie theories like Las Vegas or like this deal falling apart. That had nothing to do with this deal."
The lender-driven out clause that allows the Coyotes to leave the Valley after five years if their losses reach or exceed $50 million will remain in place despite this deal. Can you explain why?
Barroway: "It was part of the prior deal. Nothing has changed. I just assumed this position as 51 percent owner. It’s just a continuation."
I know you took in the Coyotes’ game against the Flyers earlier this week. What are your general impressions of the team?
Barroway: "I think the team has had a tough start to the year. I think there is a good nucleus of young players. I think we’re going to continue to build this thing long-term. We have some good prospects coming up. We want to build it the right way and we want to be smart about it. I’m going to defer to the hockey experts on that but I am bullish and very positive on the Coyotes’ future."

How much have you talked with the current ownership group?
Barroway: "We have talked quite a bit on a variety of topics, but right now I’m listening and learning before I do anything more."
Do you expect changes in the structure of the ownership group or the hockey operations department?
Barroway: "I don’t think there are going to be any dramatic changes, certainly for the remainder of this year. I think we’re always going to want to make things better, but I don’t see any dramatic changes coming."
Do you expect general manager Don Maloney and coach Dave Tippett to remain in place at least until the end of the season?
Barroway: "Yes. Without a doubt. I think they’ve both done an outstanding job. They both are tremendously respected hockey guys. The results have not been what we wanted so far this year, but we’re going to fix that. I think we have the right hockey guys in place to do it."
George Gosbee said that $30 million would be injected back into the team from this sale, with as much as $9 million going to payroll. What can you tell us about the financial structure of this deal? Does it reduce debt? 
Barroway: Yes, it will reduce the debt. That’s all I want to say on that.
What message do you want fans to take from this deal and your arrival?
Barroway: "Be excited. The Coyotes are here to stay. We want to build a great team for you guys so please come out and support us. It’s an exciting day for me and it’s an exciting day for them. I’m thrilled to be a part of this — more than you can possibly imagine."

The Have-Mores!: The Next Tycoons
There’s a new generation of moguls-in-the-making—and these 15 local players are leading the charge

By admin  |  June 9, 2008 
















comment on this post



 



Mike Luby, 38Founder, TargetRxMogul status: After a decade-long career in marketing and sales at Merck, Luby decided that pharmaceutical companies could market their products to doctors more effectively. He left in 1999 to start TargetRx, a Horsham-based analytical firm that acts as a middleman, collecting data from doctors that drug companies use to streamline marketing and development plans. Tycoon potential: Besides pulling in $20 million to $25 million in revenue last year, TargetRx can now call most of the top 30 U.S. pharmaceutical companies clients. Organic growth, taking TargetRx public, and adding more divisions are in Luby’s near future.Trivia: Luby holds a U.S. patent for his unique data-collecting ­approach.
Andrew L. Barroway, 41Managing partner, Schiffrin & BarrowayMogul status: Schiffrin & Barroway is among the most successful law firms in the country in its specialty: bringing class-action shareholder lawsuits against publicly held companies.Tycoon potential: Barroway’s firm usually gets a good chunk—about a quarter—of the settlements it reaches with the companies it sues, which have included Tenet Healthcare Corporation (for $216.5 million), CVS ($110 million) and AOL ($100 million). Last year, Barroway and a group of other investors nearly bid on the 76ers. Trivia: Once hosted a party at his Miami penthouse that was attended by Bono and the Edge.
John Westrum, 42CEO, Westrum Development CompanyMogul status: Loves building stuff that revitalizes has-been neighborhoods. Recent projects include Brewerytown Square, a $200 million, well-known North Philly rehab; the Arbours, adult living communities in the Northeast and West Goshen; and the Reserve, luxury townhomes in South Philly’s Packer Park. Tycoon potential: His golden-boy rep in City Hall—earned through his low- and mixed-income projects and dedication to civic ­improvement—can only help future projects. His sprawl is now going national with a 275-acre project in Chicago. Money doesn’t hurt, either; in 2006, Westrum Development generated more than $100 million in revenue.Trivia: His first real estate deal, in Upper Dublin Township, sprang from a class project while he was still in college. It sold out before construction even started.
Michael G. Rubin, 34CEO and chairman, GSI Commerce Mogul status: Rubin founded GSI, which creates and operates e-­commerce websites for major retailers such as Adidas, Kmart and Burberry, in 1999. The company has since become one of the leading e-commerce companies in the nation, with more than $500 million in revenue and 2,000 full-time employees. Tycoon potential: GSI has been growing steadily, and Rubin owns about 14 percent of the company’s shares—a stake worth almost $140 million. Says: “During Christmas, I would see a Zales commercial, then a Radio Shack commercial, then a Dick’s Sporting Goods commercial [all GSI customers], and you recognize how much impact this company has on the e-commerce industry. That’s probably the most rewarding thing for me.”
Raza Bokhari, 40CEO and president, Lakewood Pathology AssociatesMogul status: Villanova resident Bokhari was hired to financially stabilize a small pathology lab in Lakewood, New Jersey, so it could be sold off. He did—and bought it himself, turning it into a national entity.Tycoon potential: ­Chicago-based Water Street Capital Partners recently bought a major stake of the business for $50 million. Bokhari remains a minority owner and CEO and hopes to see the company grow.Trivia: Has a soft spot for Temple’s Fox School of Business, from which he earned his MBA in 2001; he recently donated a million bucks.

Barroway bought out the Coyotes' minority owners, according to a person with direct knowledge of the transaction who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Monday because the deal has not been announced. Amid continued questions about the Coyotes' arena situation, the person said Barroway is committed to keeping the Coyotes in the area.That's certainly the league's belief as Barroway takes over."The reorganization is an effort to consolidate and strengthen the ownership and to resolve various disputes among the existing owners," NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly said. "We believe this will better position the club to achieve a long-term solution in the Valley."The Coyotes have been in a dispute with the city of Glendale over Gila River Arena and are looking for a permanent home in the Phoenix metropolitan area. There has been some thought they could share a new arena with the NBA's Phoenix Suns, who currently play at the 25-year-old Talking Stick Resort Arena in downtown Phoenix.Barroway bought a controlling interest in the team from the IceArizona group of Canadian businessmen in 2014. That group, led by CEO Anthony LeBlanc, president of hockey operations Gary Drummond and George Gosbee, bought the Coyotes in 2013.Barroway, a Philadelphia hedge fund manager, previously attempted to buy the New York Islanders from Charles Wang and filed a lawsuit saying Wang backed out of the deal. He dropped the lawsuit and joined the Coyotes' ownership group.The NHL's board of governors must approve any ownership changes and could do so at its meeting later this month.Canadian TV network Sportsnet was the first to report the transaction.___Follow Hockey Writer Stephen Whyno on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/SWhyno .___More AP NHL: https://apnews.com/tag/NHLhockey

Andrew Barroway is an American hedge fund manager. He is the owner of the Arizona Coyotes hockey team in the National Hockey League.
In October 2014, he agreed to purchase the 51% majority share of the Coyotes for $152.5 million, a franchise that was reportedly valued by Coyotes' president Anthony LeBlanc at $305 million.[1] On December 31, 2014, the NHL Board of Governors approved the sale.[2] The team had been previously purchased out of bankruptcy by LeBlanc's group for $170 million in 2013 with substantial concessions by the City of Glendale, Arizona. The City of Glendale paid subsidies to the NHL when revenue and value failed to meet the required minimums during bankruptcy proceedings. The NHL Board of Governors prevented the city from acquiring an ownership share in the franchise.
In 2015, it was reported that Barroway had missed payments and would be removed from the majority shareholder position.[3] However, in 2016, Barroway reportedly obtained a greater share of the franchise with up to 54% of the shares.[4] In 2017, Barroway then bought out the rest of his IceArizona partners to become the sole shareholder.[5]
