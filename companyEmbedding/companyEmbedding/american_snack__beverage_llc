no need to sign for the box



good to know
how do I order a box?
Ordering is simple. You choose a box type and enter your delivery and payment details. Then all you have to do is sit back and wait to enjoy the food when it arrives, simple as that.
will you deliver to me?
Currently, graze boxes can only be shipped to US addresses, including P.O. Boxes, within the 50 states.
For the time being, graze does not ship to APOs, FPOs, or US Territory addresses.
what food can I get?
We have a range of over ninety tasty snacks (each with a specific benefit to you), including nuts, seeds, juicy dried fruits, tasty crackers, dips and dippers, and natural treats. 
Graze is not suitable for people with allergies. All of our food is packed in the same place, so cross-contamination between any of our ingredients is likely to occur. Our snacks may contain traces of gluten, wheat, eggs, nuts, peanuts, soy, milk and fish. 
how do I choose what goes into my box?
The food in your box is selected based on your own preferences. For each of our foods, you tell us whether you like, love, or would like to try them. We put together your box based on these ratings ensuring you always receive the food you like.
when are my boxes delivered?
When you sign up to graze, you’ll be automatically signed up to receive a box either every week or every two weeks depending on where you are based in the US. Boxes are delivered Monday to Saturday, every day of the year the USPS delivers mail.
how are my boxes delivered?
Graze boxes are delivered by the USPS. Your boxes will arrive with your normal mail and will fit into standard US mailboxes so there’s no need to be home to sign for your box.
will my graze box fit in my mailbox?
We’ve designed our graze boxes to fit inside most standard-sized mailboxes, but we know this can vary. The dimensions of each box are: 6.5" x 9" x 2".
what if I go on vacation?
This can be done on your home page under ‘your regular boxes’. You can postpone your regular boxes one week at a time by clicking on ‘when next?’ and selecting the week you’d like to receive your next box.
If we’ve already started preparing your next box, it won’t be possible for you to push the delivery date back. Amendments to orders can only be made before your cut-off time.
how much does each box cost?
Each 8 snack variety box costs just $13.99 including delivery.  
when do I pay?
You pay per box and we take payment up to a week in advance of you receiving your box as we need time to prepare it and send it to you.
how easy it is to cancel?
There's no commitment ever - you can cancel your deliveries anytime online. However, because we start preparing your boxes in advance, we just need a bit of notice.

                  About ABC                











Daily's orange juice was originally made from
			oranges squeezed by the company's owners themselves.


Founded as Daily Orange Juice Company, Inc. in 1960, American Beverage Corporation (ABC) began as a small company that manufactured and delivered orange juice products door-to-door in the Pittsburgh suburb of Verona, PA. As other juice flavors were added, the company name was changed to Daily Juice Products.
ABC is still headquartered in Verona, PA, but over the past 50 years, we have grown to become a multi-million dollar manufacturer and marketer of ready to drink cocktails, non-alcoholic cocktail mixers and fruit drinks. Our brands include Daily's Cocktails, Little Hug Fruit Barrels, Big Hug, and Guzzler and are nationally distributed in grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs and liquor stores. We also sell Daily's Cocktails products through food service distributors to bars and restaurants.
All ABC employees are committed to total customer satisfaction and are dedicated to the continuous innovation and improvement of our products and operating systems. With manufacturing facilities in Verona, PA and Phoenix, AZ, ABC maintains state-of-the-art manufacturing including bottle blow molding expertise.









Sustainability
American Beverage Corporation is dedicated to protecting and preserving the environment and we have implemented a number of sustainability policies and initiatives. We rigorously comply with all local, state and federal governmental regulations while employing state-of-the-art technology to help manage and sustain our resources and reduce waste.

		ABC recycles all paper, plastic, corrugate and metal scrap, along with incoming packaging containers to reduce trash in our landfills.

		All ABC bottles are 100% recyclable.

		ABC participates in an electric program that not only aids the environment, but also helps protect our community from brown outs and black outs and helps stabilize electric rates.

		All ABC packaging suppliers participate in the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI), where members agree to use environmentally responsible practices that promote the protection of wildlife, plants, soil, water, biodiversity, and air quality; while perpetuating the growing and harvesting of trees.

		ABC has a rigorous charitable donation program to reduce the waste of products that while fit for consumption, have shorter than standard expiry or do not meet our high standard for packaging. Rather than throw out products with cosmetic packaging flaws, we donate them to various charities.

 I opened my Daily’s frozen pouch and did not drink all of it – can I refreeze the pouch? 
 Yes, you may refreeze our Daily’s pouches after opening them.
  

 How do I know if my Daily’s pouch is still fresh? Is there an expiration code? 
 You can determine the freshness of Daily’s frozen pouches by reading the product code that is printed on the back of the pouch. The product code is printed in a format similar to the following:

	0930 V 14A
Please refer to the information below to determine the freshness of your product.

	13 = year product manufactured (first 2 digits)
	032 = day in a 365-day year (digits 3-5)

 Are your frozen pouches sold in the freezer sections of liquor stores? 
 Typically our pouches are sold on shelf or on a rack or display in stores and need to be frozen after purchase. But some stores do sell them in the freezer case. To find a retailer near you, please check out our new store locator.

good to know
how do I order a box?
Ordering is simple. You choose a box type and enter your delivery and payment details. Then all you have to do is sit back and wait to enjoy the food when it arrives, simple as that.
will you deliver to me?
Currently, graze boxes can only be shipped to US addresses, including P.O. Boxes, within the 50 states.
For the time being, graze does not ship to APOs, FPOs, or US Territory addresses.
what food can I get?
We have a range of over ninety tasty snacks (each with a specific benefit to you), including nuts, seeds, juicy dried fruits, tasty crackers, dips and dippers, and natural treats. 
Graze is not suitable for people with allergies. All of our food is packed in the same place, so cross-contamination between any of our ingredients is likely to occur. Our snacks may contain traces of gluten, wheat, eggs, nuts, peanuts, soy, milk and fish. 
how do I choose what goes into my box?
The food in your box is selected based on your own preferences. For each of our foods, you tell us whether you like, love, or would like to try them. We put together your box based on these ratings ensuring you always receive the food you like.
when are my boxes delivered?
When you sign up to graze, you’ll be automatically signed up to receive a box either every week or every two weeks depending on where you are based in the US. Boxes are delivered Monday to Saturday, every day of the year the USPS delivers mail.
how are my boxes delivered?
Graze boxes are delivered by the USPS. Your boxes will arrive with your normal mail and will fit into standard US mailboxes so there’s no need to be home to sign for your box.
will my graze box fit in my mailbox?
We’ve designed our graze boxes to fit inside most standard-sized mailboxes, but we know this can vary. The dimensions of each box are: 6.5" x 9" x 2".
what if I go on vacation?
This can be done on your home page under ‘your regular boxes’. You can postpone your regular boxes one week at a time by clicking on ‘when next?’ and selecting the week you’d like to receive your next box.
If we’ve already started preparing your next box, it won’t be possible for you to push the delivery date back. Amendments to orders can only be made before your cut-off time.
how much does each box cost?
Each 8 snack variety box costs just $13.99 including delivery.  
when do I pay?
You pay per box and we take payment up to a week in advance of you receiving your box as we need time to prepare it and send it to you.
how easy it is to cancel?
There's no commitment ever - you can cancel your deliveries anytime online. However, because we start preparing your boxes in advance, we just need a bit of notice.
