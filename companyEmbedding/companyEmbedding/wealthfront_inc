              Wealthfront
            

              Live the life you
              want. We've got 
              your back.
            










Imagine being confident about the financial decisions you make.


                Sounds crazy,
              
              we know.
            


            Financial planning and investing
            with Wealthfront couldn't be easier.
We do it for you.















              Our investment strategies may be sophisticated, but our philosophy is simple.
            

              Technology can do some things better than people.
              We use software to better execute time-tested investment strategies:
            













              reduce 
              risk
            

              We'll build a diversified portfolio for
              
              you to maximize returns while minimizing your risk. And our software automatically
              maintains the right level of diversification for you.
              




              reduce 
              taxes
            

              We built tax intelligence into our software to help lower the taxes you pay, so you'll have more money to invest.
            



              reduce 
              fees
            

              We don't let higher fees eat away at your long-term returns. Our fees are simple
              and so low that the additional returns our strategy generates more than covers the cost.
            







              Our Philosophy 















When it comes to your finances,
            what’s on your mind?
          



                Maybe it’s retiring comfortably –
                
                  and confidently. Or maybe it's giving your
                
                kids the best educational opportunities.
                
                  Perhaps you just want a solid financial foundation for the future.
                
                Or maybe it's something else.
              










You have goals.
                We have ways to help you reach them.
              

                Explore Your Next Steps

          We have the same low fee for everyone.
        







              0.25%
            

A simple annual advisory fee
No trading commissions. No hidden fees.
                No financial advisor salaries.
No, really.

          the closer you’ll be to reaching your goals.

    Welcome to Wealthfront! We will ask you a set of questions to get you started
  


      What is your primary reason for investing?
    






            General savings
          






            Retirement
          






            College Savings

    Let's get to know you.
  


      What are you looking for in a financial advisor?
    






            I'd like to create a diversified investment portfolio
          


          Great! At Wealthfront, we'll create a diversified portfolio of 7 or 8 asset classes based on your answers to this questionnaire.
        





            I'd like to save money on my taxes
          


          So do we! That's why Wealthfront offers our Continuous Tax-Loss Harvesting service in an attempt to reduce your investment and overall taxes.
        





            I'd like someone to completely manage my investments, so that I don't have to
          


          Fantastic! We've designed Wealthfront as a hassle-free service. Once you open your account, we'll handle the details of investing, rebalancing, and more for you.
        





            I'd like to match or beat the performance of the markets
          


          At Wealthfront, we believe the best way to match market performance is to make sure you pay low fees for your investments and minimize your taxes. Our fees are some of the lowest in the industry (at 0.25% of invested assets above $10,000 - that's under $20 per month for a $100,000 portfolio) and with our Tax-Optimized Asset Allocation and Tax-Loss Harvesting, we work hard to minimize your taxes.

      What is your current age?
    











    Let's get to know you.
  


      What is your annual pre-tax income?

      Which of the following best describes your household?
    






            Single income, no dependents
          






            Single income, at least one dependent
          






            Dual income, no dependents
          






            Dual income, at least one dependent
          






            Retired or financially independent
          










    Let's get to know you.
  


      What is the total value of your cash and liquid investments?
    


e.g. savings, CDs, mutual funds, IRAs, 401(k)s, public stocks











    Let's get to know you.
  


      When deciding how to invest your money, which do you care about more?
    






            Maximizing gains
          






            Minimizing losses
          






            Both equally
          










    Let's get to know you.
  


      The global stock market is often volatile. If your entire investment portfolio lost 10% of its value in a month during a market decline, what would you do?
    


Your behavior during a market downturn is important to understanding your risk tolerance.






            Sell all of your investments
          






            Sell some

    Great! Here's an overview of the Wealthfront 529 College Savings Plan
  

    A 529 account is designed to help families tax-efficiently save for future college costs.
  











              Wealthfront manages the account for you automatically
              




              We manage your account using a personalized investment plan designed
              specifically for college savings. It uses an investment glide path to optimize
              risk and return over time based on your individual criteria.
            












              Save on taxes
              




              Earnings in a 529 account grow tax-free and withdrawals are also tax-free
              when used to pay for qualified higher education expenses at an eligible educational
              institution. Before investing in any 529 plan, you should consider whether your or
              the beneficiary’s home state offers a 529 plan that provides its taxpayer with
              favorable state tax benefits.
            












              High contribution limits
              




              Contribute up to a maximum of $370,000 per beneficiary across all Nevada 529
              plans, no matter what your income level.
            












              Jumpstart your savings with superfunding
              




              You can contribute up to $70,000 ($140,000 for married couple filing
              jointly) to a 529 account using 5 years' worth of federal gift tax
              exclusions. We refer to this election as superfunding.
            








      To learn more about the Wealthfront 529 College Savings Plan (the "Plan"), please read the
      Plan Description
      and Participation Agreement. Investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses, and other important
      information are included in the Plan Description and Participation Agreement; read and consider it carefully
      before investing. Wealthfront Brokerage Corporation serves as the distributor and the underwriter of the Plan.
    

      The Plan is administered by the Board of Trustees of the College Savings Plan of Nevada (the "Board"), chaired by
      the Nevada State Treasurer. Ascensus Broker Dealer Services, Inc. ("ABD") serves as the Program Manager.
    
Please refer to the Plan Description for the privacy statements of the Board and ABD.

      Your investment is not insured or guaranteed by the State of Nevada, the Board, Plan or any state official, the
      FDIC or any other federal agency, the Program Manager, or Wealthfront. Investment returns will vary depending
      upon the performance of the Designated Portfolios in your account. You could lose all or a portion of your
      investment.

                WealthFront Inc.            


    By Mark P. Cussen, CFP®, CMFC, AFC | January 18, 2017 — 7:10 AM EST    






Share


















































Name: WealthFront Inc.
Estimated valuation:  $700 million
Product: Automated Investment Service
IPO Timeline: TBD
Date founded: December 2011
WealthFront was founded in December 2011 by Dan Carroll and Andy Rachleff and has quickly grown to become the largest automated investment provider in the business. The company, headquartered near Silicon Valley in Palo Alto, Calif., began as mutual fund analysis company kaChing in 2008 before turning to wealth management. At the beginning of 2013, the company had $97 million in assets, a number that grew by an incredible 450% during the year. The company also introduced its “Direct Indexing” program that year, which harvests tax losses in accounts with a value of $100,000 or more. Adam Nash became the CEO of WealthFront in 2014. Its assets under management (AUM) now exceed $4.3 billion. It has received total equity funding of $129.5 million in five separate rounds. The most recent funding was a $64 million Series D on October 27, 2014.
A Wealth of Offerings
The company researches and builds personalized, globally diversified investment portfolios that seek to provide the highest possible returns on capital on a net-of-fee, after-tax risk adjusted basis. It provides actionable suggestions for investors looking for ideas and also provides them with round-the-clock access to their money via their website at www.wealthfront.com. The company charges an annual advisory fee of 0.25% for its portfolio management services, which are driven by a complex set of computer algorithms designed to follow various investment strategies. It offers individual, joint and trust accounts as well as IRAs, SEP-IRAs and 401(k) rollover accounts. It offered its first college savings account in the state of Nevada in 2016.
WealthFront has not been shy in its belief that it simply offers the best automated money management service in the business. It criticized Schwab’s Intelligent Portfolios for its failure to effectively harvest tax losses compared to WealthFront’s portfolios. It has also panned the bid-ask spreads and advisory fees that Schwab charges and attacked the fee structure of competitor Betterment.
WealthFront’s investment portfolios include U.S. stocks, foreign stocks, emerging markets, natural resources, dividend stocks and municipal bonds. Its stock portfolios tend to be skewed heavily towards large-cap stocks. It only uses one equity exchange-traded fund, VIX, which covers the vast majority of the U.S. stock market. However, Morningstar reports that just over 70% of the portfolio’s performance is determined by large and giant-cap stocks. They also emphasize international investments, with just over a fifth of their retail assets and almost a third of their IRA money invested in foreign holdings. Emerging markets account for 9% of retail assets with twice that percentage in IRAs, and these funds are likewise heavily weighted with large and giant-cap stocks. All stock funds are also geared entirely towards growth; they do not offer any exposure to value-based equities. The company also offers a stock-sale program that enables investors to liquidate concentrated holdings on a tax-efficient basis and gradually move money into more diversified vehicles. All client portfolios are monitored and rebalanced on an ongoing basis in accordance with the investor’s risk tolerance and investment objectives.
WealthFront’s investment team includes top market experts such as Burton Malkiel, the author of the best-selling book A Random Walk Down Wall Street. Other members of the team include Silicon Valley heavyweights and seven investment analysts with Ph.Ds from the likes of Harvard, Princeton and Yale; the team has collectively published more than 16 books on investing that have received widespread acclaim. The firm's investment philosophy is based on Modern portfolio theory and finding the efficient frontier using mean-variance organization.

              Wealthfront
            

              Live the life you
              want. We've got 
              your back.
            










Imagine being confident about the financial decisions you make.


                Sounds crazy,
              
              we know.
            


            Financial planning and investing
            with Wealthfront couldn't be easier.
We do it for you.















              Our investment strategies may be sophisticated, but our philosophy is simple.
            

              Technology can do some things better than people.
              We use software to better execute time-tested investment strategies:
            













              reduce 
              risk
            

              We'll build a diversified portfolio for
              
              you to maximize returns while minimizing your risk. And our software automatically
              maintains the right level of diversification for you.
              




              reduce 
              taxes
            

              We built tax intelligence into our software to help lower the taxes you pay, so you'll have more money to invest.
            



              reduce 
              fees
            

              We don't let higher fees eat away at your long-term returns. Our fees are simple
              and so low that the additional returns our strategy generates more than covers the cost.
            







              Our Philosophy 















When it comes to your finances,
            what’s on your mind?
          



                Maybe it’s retiring comfortably –
                
                  and confidently. Or maybe it's giving your
                
                kids the best educational opportunities.
                
                  Perhaps you just want a solid financial foundation for the future.
                
                Or maybe it's something else.
              










You have goals.
                We have ways to help you reach them.
              

                Explore Your Next Steps 















          Putting your mind at ease doesn’t have to be expensive.
        

          We have the same low fee for everyone.
        







              0.25%
            

A simple annual advisory fee
No trading commissions. No hidden fees.
                No financial advisor salaries.
No, really.
















          The sooner you start,
          the closer you’ll be to reaching your goals.

Investing insights Wealthfront news


Giving Credit Where Credit’s Due

By Andy Rachleff / 04.19.17






The dream house. The dream wedding. The dream kitchen. The dream vacation.
All too often pursuing these dreams is a total nightmare.
Why? Because the typical options available for getting the money you need to make these dreams a reality aren’t that great. If you own a home you can pursue a home equity line of credit (HELOC), but that process often takes weeks and comes with a ton of paperwork – and there’s no guarantee you’ll actually get the loan. Alternatively, you can take money out of your investment account, but you may have to pay taxes on the withdrawal (not to mention shrinking your nest egg!).
But at Wealthfront we think differently. We want you to have your cake and eat it too.
That’s why today we are excited to launch a new service that is our first foray into personal banking. Introducing Portfolio Line of Credit. We live in a world of “instant delivery,” from taxis to groceries to handymen. So why not add lines of credit to the mix? At Wealthfront we want our clients to be able to borrow what they need, when they need it, directly from their smartphones.
Portfolio Line of Credit establishes a line of credit of up to 30% of your account value for Wealthfront clients with at least $100,000 invested in an individual or joint investment account. The best part? We do this instantly and without the hassle of paperwork — you’re already approved when you open your account! It takes 30 seconds to sign up, and in many cases you get your money in 24 hours.

But there’s more good stuff: we offer this line of credit at interest rates well below traditional alternatives, like HELOCs. How? Because your line of credit is secured by your own investments. In fact, you get an even better interest rate the more you have invested in your Wealthfront account. Oh, and you repay on your own timeline. Interest accrues and is added to your monthly balance, but you pay back the loan when it works for you. How’s that for flexibility?

Our goal at Wealthfront is to keep innovating so that you can live your best life. With Portfolio Line of Credit, you’ll get immediate access to credit that’s less expensive and more convenient, all the while continuing to grow your investment account. How’s that for a win-win?
So dream big. We’ve got your back.

Portfolio Line of Credit is a margin lending product offered exclusively to Wealthfront clients by Wealthfront Brokerage Corporation, Wealthfront’s brokerage subsidiary. As with any financial service, there are numerous factors to consider before using a margin lending product including interest rate risk, margin call risk and liquidation risk.
DisclosureAll investing involves risk, including the loss of your principal investment(s), and past performance does not guarantee future results. Margin lending can add to these risks, and investors should carefully review those risks as part of their overall financial strategy. Diversification strategies do not guarantee a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
Financial advisory services are offered by Wealthfront, Inc., an SEC-registered investment adviser. Brokerage products and services are offered by Wealthfront Brokerage Corporation, member FINRA / SIPC, and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Wealthfront, Inc. Wealthfront, Inc. and Wealthfront Brokerage Corporation may use data from third parties believed to be reliable, but cannot ensure the accuracy or completeness of that data.  Wealthfront, Inc. and Wealthfront Brokerage Corporation do not provide legal or tax advice. Investors should consult with their personal legal and tax advisors with respect to their individual tax situation. Please see our Full Disclosure for more important information.

Career advice


The 2017 Wealthfront Career-Launching Companies List

By Andy Rachleff / 10.19.16






Today we are pleased to present our fifth annual list of US mid-sized information technology companies with momentum.
We publish this list because it is our responsibility as a financial advisor to provide the advice that maximizes your net worth. As proud as we are of our investment service, we think we can add even more value by helping you start your career on the right foot. That’s because choosing the right job can add far more to your ultimate net worth than making good planning or investment decisions. We believe the companies we list each year are the ideal places for young people to start their careers because they are all highly likely to turn into large businesses, and nothing early in your career is more important than achieving success — and nothing signals success more than working for a successful company. For a complete explanation of this logic, it’s important that you read the post that accompanied our original list: 48 Hot Tech Companies To Build A Career.
To qualify for our list, a company must be privately held, have a current revenue run rate between $20 million and $300 million and be on a trajectory to grow at a rate in excess of 50% over at least the next three or four years. This year we’re adding a further qualification: the companies must have compelling unit economics. Selling a product at very low margins can lead to rapid revenue growth, but it doesn’t necessarily imply a great long-term business. We built our list by surveying the partners of the following 14 venture capital firms: Accel Partners, Andreessen Horowitz, Benchmark, DAG Ventures, Greylock Partners, Index Ventures, Lightspeed, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Matrix Partners, Redpoint Ventures, Ribbit Capital, Sequoia Capital, the Social Capital and Spark Capital.

Changes Since Last Year
This year’s list includes 132 companies, down 4 from last year’s 136. We added 28 new companies, which is about our five year average and about half the number as last year. We dropped 32 which includes 2 companies that have filed to go or went public, 3 that were acquired, 3 that grew beyond the $300 million revenue cap, and 24 that experienced growth that was too slow to continue to qualify (the largest number of drops in any one year):

I am struck by a few things this year. First only 8 of the 28 new additions were consumer companies. A higher percentage than ever (79%) of the new additions are from the Bay Area. Half of the new Bay Area companies are based south of San Francisco (the traditional Silicon Valley), which is probably a function of the high percentage of enterprise companies. This counters the trend of San Francisco gaining share. Los Angeles had a strong showing with 4 new additions, which is a much higher percentage (14%) than we would traditionally expect.
The number of IPOs declined to an all time low of 2 this year although I understand a number of our listed companies are in the process of filing their registration statements with the SEC. There were also very few company sales. We had a very large number of drops due to slowing revenue growth relative to previous years, but the vast majority of the dropped companies are still growing at a rapid rate even though they don’t qualify for the lofty hurdle of 50% expected compounded growth for the next few years.
Other Fun Facts
As usual the majority of the companies are based in the San Francisco Bay Area (61%). The majority of the Bay Area companies (58%) are still located in San Francisco rather than Silicon Valley, although this is the second year in a row in which San Francisco has lost share and is down from a peak of 70% in 2015.

All geographies other than the Bay Area lost share this past year. While other geographies may be experiencing an increased level of startup activity, it still appears that the more successful companies are likely to be based near Silicon Valley. This means you should seriously consider moving to the Bay Area to launch your career and consider moving home to start your own company once you’ve gained the halo and experience.
Enterprise gained share to 64% of the companies, up significantly from 60% in the previous year. This year only 3 of the Bay Area consumer-focused companies are not headquartered in San Francisco and that’s down from only 5 the previous year. People who want to work for a consumer facing company on the Peninsula may need to look for slightly earlier stage companies. There are still only three hardware companies left on the list and 2 are based in the Bay Area (one moved from North Carolina to get access to better talent). This is amazing when you consider that semiconductor and hardware companies created Silicon Valley.
Your Career Matters to Your Financial Future
We hope you find the 2017 list helpful. Please remember it is very important to evaluate these companies in the context of the advice provided in our Silicon Valley Career Guide. While it is always possible that we may have missed a few companies, we believe this list is an excellent start for professionals looking for differentiated success in their careers. We hope that you will also consider opening a Wealthfront account if you find our advice valuable.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards. This may include, but is not limited to business name, address and contact information; names and background of principles; business and banking references; licensing and/or professional accreditation; and a complete description of the nature of the business.
                

                    2. Clearly disclose to customers:

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,
3. includes appropriate evidence and documents supporting the business' position, and

                                    4. explains why any relief sought by the complainant cannot or should not be granted.
                                





                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.
                







Safeguard Privacy









            Protect any data collected against mishandling and fraud, collect personal information only as needed, and respect the preferences of customers regarding the use of their information.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Respect Privacy Businesses conducting e-commerce agree to disclose on their Web site the following: 
1. what information they collect,
2. with whom it is shared,
3. how it can be corrected,
4. how it is secured,

                            5. how policy changes will be communicated, and;
                        
6. how to address concerns over misuse of personal data.



                    2. Secure Sensitive Data Businesses that collect sensitive data online (credit card, bank account numbers, Social Security number, salary or other personal financial information, medical history or records, etc.) will ensure that it is transmitted via secure means.Businesses will make best efforts to comply with industry standards for the protection and proper disposal of all sensitive data, both online and offline.
                    
                

                    3. Honor Customer Preferences

                     Businesses agree to respect customer preferences regarding contact by telephone, fax and e-mail, and agree to remedy the underlying cause of any failure to do so.
                







Embody Integrity









            Approach all business dealings, marketplace transactions and commitments with integrity.
            
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to:
            
1. Avoid involvement, by the business or its principles, in activities that reflect unfavorably on, or otherwise adversely affect the public image of BBB or its accredited businesses.












BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Talent exodus hits Wealthfront including heads of product, marketing and compliance | RIABiz


























News, Vision & Voice for the Advisory CommunityElliot Shmukler is credited with much of the product development that vaulted the robo from $150 million to $3.5 billionJuly 26, 2016 — 10:08 PM UTC by Brooke Southall 0 CommentsBrooke’s Note: The straight-A atmosphere and whiteboard ether that seems to permeate most of the robo-advisors makes it easy to forget that these are basically small businesses with a bunch of folks toiling away on laptops. People and the companies they work for, stock options aside, have different destines that show up over time. Wealthfront has been around since 2008 and so there has been time for life to intervene in some cases. In fact, it’s really been around since 2011 when it re-launched with its current business model. See: Investing site KaChing gets classier as Wealthfronth If there is an inconvenient quality to these departures for Wealthfront, it may be more in regard to appearances. The company is on the watch list of analysts wondering whether the AUM ground it has lost to Betterment is a sign of lost momentum in the larger sense of start-up success — and the idea that you can go direct to investors with financial advice using automation and the Internet.Wealthfront Inc. is experiencing its first big talent exodus — a flurry of departures that includes some C-suite titles and a Unicorn shepherd.The latter mythic creature is product chief, Elliot Shmukler who left the Redwood City, Calif.-based automated advisor in June to join Instacart — one of Silicon Valley’s hot startups. Other recent Palo Alto, Calif.-based Wealthfront executive departures include Brian Dennen, chief operating officer, Maya Grinberg, marketing director and Brad Mauney, director of product management. There are an additional three designers and four engineers who have departed recently.  See: Andy Rachleff is out as CEO of Wealthfront as former LinkedIn star takes his place. Observers give Shmukler credit for spearheading the series of paid robo-services that vaulted Wealthfront’s growth from $150 million to $3 billion. He also oversaw the introduction of direct indexing, single-stock diversification service and its first mobile app. Wealthfront currently manages $3.5 billion of assets and has 130 employees, according to its ADV.



Andy Johns is stepping into the big shoes of Elliot Shmukler. 
                    

Shmukler has a similarly stellar list of accolades connected to his time at LinkedIn where he gets much of the credit for monetizing the online-resume social media site. Over his career, Shmukler’s become renowned for his copious and successful application A/B testing (comparing two versions of a web page to see which one performs better) for his products and team. The who behind 'who’s viewed my profile’At LinkedIn, Shmukler led a team responsible for generating nearly half of LinkedIn’s page views with features such as Profile, Search, Contacts, New User Registration, People You May Know, Who’s Viewed My Profile, and more. As LinkedIn’s overseer of membership growth, he grew the site from 20 million members to 200-million members during his tenure, according to his LinkedIn page.Still, a top LinkedIn exec reached for comment says Shmukler, though successful, was not without peccadilloes. “He was well respected but he struck me as someone hard to work with and I would have disagreed with some of the product decisions [he made] with regards to the registration flow,” the person says. “But being difficult is what most great leaders have in common and LinkedIn enjoyed enormous growth during his time — and I think he was with LinkedIn at the right time so some level of luck for sure as well.”The Wealthfront departures come at a time when the company has lost bragging rights as the biggest, fastest-growing, best-financed robo-advisor. That honor now goes to Betterment, which hit $5 billion of managed assets recently and hints at $20 billion soon enough.  See: Betterment makes CFO hire with $20 billion AUM 'line of sight’ and IPO mindfulness.New York-based Betterment Holdings Inc. also has 190 employees to Wealthfront’s 130 and Betterment’s recent VC round puts it at $205 million raised. Wealthfront has raised $129.5 million.Getting while getting’s good?Will Trout, senior analyst with Celent LLC, says it’s important to note that a startup can only ride so far with dependence on its product talent — if it is falling behind to Betterment in the race for AUM.“The problem for Wealthfront is that product innovation is not a game-changer in itself,” he writes in an email. “Investors lose track, get bored, etc. of hearing about the latest whiz-bang feature. AUM growth  — and the big news stories that it fuels —  is both more powerful and self-reinforcing, and I’d say Wealthfront has lost a bit of its luster vis-à-vis Betterment and other next-gen players. Yes, the artificial intelligence angle around Wealthfront 3.0 is cool, but it’s still pretty vague and undefined. In my view it’s unlikely to fuel the kind of growth that will be needed for Wealthfront to remain independent long term. So Shmukler is getting out while on top….with all that implies!”Still, Wealthfront has long been considered Silicon Valley’s most significant, best-funded financial advice startup. But it is no longer the best funded with Redwood City, Calif.-based Personal Capital Corp. having surpassed it with $175 million.  See: Personal Capital gets $75 million investment and an ex-Schwab retail chief in Jeff Carney. 'Embarrassment of riches’Wealthfront still has plenty of cards to play — starting with its stack of talent.Andy Johns, who reported to Shmukler, will now step up to fulfill his role at Wealthfront. Andy Rachleff, co-founder and chairman of Wealthfront, adds that Johns is a gifted talent. He says the departures come at a time when Wealthfront has an “embarrassment of riches” when it comes to people that understand the development of web-delivered products. For example, it was Ali Rosenthal, Wealthfront’s director of strategic partnerships who helped get the Wealthfront 529 plan out the door. It is now the designated plan for the state of Nevada. Rosenthal joined Wealthfront from Facebook about two years ago as vice president of strategic partnerships. She helped launch Facebook’s “share” button, helped make Facebook available on mobile platforms. During her time Facebook Mobile, its active user base grew from fewer than 100,000 users to over 250 million.  See: Wealthfront takes on another Facebook vet  — a clue that going dark in Palo Alto doesn’t mean going away. Johns is also a Facebook alumni.



Maya Grinberg never quite caught the same fire at Wealthfront as she did at Google. 
                    

Four-year vestingWealthfront currently employs about 150 people and its recent departures represent less than a 10% turnover rate — a rate not considered high in the fluid Silicon Valley labor market. That rate is also affected by the customary vesting programs, which go in four years cycles — short by Fortune 500 standards. Wealthfront has four-year vesting, according to a source. Turnover is also fueled by aggressive headhunting. Mauney left to be a product manager for New York-based COMPASS. Grinberg joined up with Segment in San Francisco. Grinberg was formerly the chief evangelist at social advertising startup, Wildfire. After Wildfire’s acquisition by Google in 2012, Grinberg joined the Google product marketing organization as Wildfire caught fire and which now serves over 21,000 businesses worldwide powering over 300,000 campaigns. Thirty of the top 50 brands worldwide use Wildfire.Of the four engineers who recently left, two went to Google, one to Uber and another to Apple, sources say. Wall Street minds?Trout agrees that new blood could be good for a firm playing some catch-up in assets, but thinks Rachleff’s laser focus on blue-chip Silicon Valley talent may be overdone. “I think Wealthfront would be best off pivoting from its Silicon Valley/software roots and pick up some sharp minds with connections to NYC or Wall Street,” he writes. “This could be a product guy but doesn’t need to be … good ideas can come from a range of people and sources.”Rachleff has historically been loath to hire outside a circle of people he knows share his vision for marketing and serving millennials, aged 18 to 34, with the idea that they are remarkably different not only from baby boomers, (55 to 69) — but even different from members of Gen X (ages 34-54). The key is that millennials don’t want to talk on the phone and will even pay to avoid the inconvenience of doing so.
