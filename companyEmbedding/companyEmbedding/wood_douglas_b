Exploration Services


Mining, quarrying and offshore exploration for oil and gas remain critical industries for the provision of energy supplies, precious metals and other raw materials.  Exploration services take place in some of the most challenging and hostile environments where safety, security and reliability are essential prerequisites to successful projects.
Reliable radio communications can be extremely difficult in these circumstances, particularly underground, at sea or over vast radio propagation distances.  Wood & Douglas specialises in delivering wireless communications in such challenging RF environments.  Projects have included a high bit rate COFDM digital data links from ship to shore, video capture and delivery for the oil and gas industries,  radio telemetry transceivers for seismic survey and wireless perimeter fencing for large area open cast mine security.
Delivering critical wireless applications in such demanding environments requires intelligent RF design and rock solid radio implementation.  Wood & Douglas has proved its capability to combine creative wireless solutions with flawless RF execution.

Wireless water reservoir monitoring
Life in the balance

The challenge:
In arid Namibia, farms depend on water pumped from underground aquifers into surface reservoir holding tanks, from which it can be distributed for the wellbeing of livestock and humans. Given the large, rural nature of many farms in the region, landowners often have to rely on unskilled staff to monitor and control this key aspect of running an estate. This was the challenge facing Aloegrove, a safari lodge and cattle farm located...

 Gasometer water seal (cup) monitoring
Gasometer monitoring - delivering public safety for the National Grid

Issue:
Gasometers, or gas holders, operated by the National Grid still remain a common site in British towns and cities. Built to address the problems of poor gas pressure in the local grid, these aging structures cannot be upgraded in the same way as gas pipes. As many are located in proximity to residential areas, the monitoring of these structures has become paramount.
If movement of the gasometer lift occurs as a result of pressure increase...

DOUGLAS FIR WOOD PRODUCTS PAGE : BEAMS : FLOORING : SIDING : BEAR CREEK LUMBER













 Home   Species   Douglas Fir
Douglas Fir
Scientific Name: Pseudotsuga menziesii
When architects and engineers look for the best in structural lumber, their first choice repeatedly is Douglas Fir. It is dimensionally stable and universally recognized for its superior strength-to-weight ratio. Its high specific gravity provides excellent nail and plate-holding ability. The species also enjoys a documented superior performance against strong forces resulting from natural phenomena such as winds, storms and earthquakes. It is truly the ideal structural and general purpose wood for framing lumber in residential, light commercial, multi story and industrial construction. The Douglas Fir/Western Larch species combination has the highest modulus of elasticity (E or MOE) of the North American softwood species. This is the ratio of the amount a piece of lumber will deflect in proportion to an applied load; it is a reflection of the species’ high degree of stiffness, an important consideration in the design of floors and other systems. In strength properties, Douglas Fir/Western Larch has the highest ratings of any western softwood for extreme fiber stress in bending (Fb); for tension parallel-to-grain (Ft); for horizontal sheer (Fv); for compression perpendicular-to-grain (Fc); and for compression parallel-to-grain (Fc//). These physical working properties, as well as to the moderate durability of its heartwood and its excellent dimensional stability, provide the reasons many builders use Douglas Fir as the standard against which all other framing lumber is judged. It is also tight knotted and close-grained, adding the bonus of beauty to its structural capabilities.Photo: above left: Weathered Fir Beam and Channel Siding.

More information about Douglas Fir
The straight grained and exceptionally strong Douglas Fir tree is one of the most dominant species in the Northwest forests. After a forest fire, the tree springs to life, growing thickly in the sunshine of a newly open area. Over the past 100 years, it has been the favorite species of silviculturists because of its fast growth and multitude of uses. Its stiffness and durability make it ideal for structural applications. It also makes a good flooring and paneling product as well as a fine trim for doors and windows.
	      Douglas Fir is known for its distinctive grain patterns, produced by the varying degrees of spring and summer wood in the grain. The color differences between the two range from yellowish to reddish brown. Douglas Fir flooring ages to a warm orange-brown color.
Douglas Fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) is not a true fir at all, it is a distinct species named after Archibald Menzies, a Scottish physician and naturalist who first discovered the tree on Vancouver Island in 1791, and David Douglas, the Scottish botanist who later identified the tree in the Pacific Northwest in 1826. Douglas Fir is North Americas most plentiful softwood species, accounting for one fifth of the continents total softwood reserves
	  The wood of Douglas-fir varies widely in weight and strength. When lumber of high strength is needed for structural uses, selection can be improved by applying the density rule. This rule uses percentage of latewood and rate of growth as they affect density. For equivalent knot sizes, the higher density generally indicates stronger wood. Sapwood of Douglas-fir is narrow in old-growth trees but may be as much as 3 inches (7.62 cm) wide in second-growth trees of commercial size. Fairly young trees of moderate to rapid growth have reddish heartwood and are called red-fir. Very narrow-ringed wood of old trees may be yellowish brown and is known on the market as yellow-fir. 
	  The range of Douglas-fir extends from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific coast and from Mexico to central British Columbia. The Douglas-fir production comes from the Coast States of Oregon, Washington, and California and from the Rocky Mountain States. Douglas-fir reaches heights of 250 feet (76.20 m), with a diameter of 6 feet (1.83 m), in coastal stands that are between 200 and 800 years old. The largest intact specimen was recorded at 330 feet (100.58 m) near Littlerock Washington. 
	Methow Valley Douglas Fir Peeled Posts and Poles
Bear Creek Lumber has access to an actively managed timber stand. The project is a sustained growth patch of mixed age Douglas Fir and Ponderosa Pine. The stand has been logged twice since 1910 and is presently being thinned. A mixture of middle-aged and old-growth products are being selectively harvested to improve the stand's health. These round wood products can be cut to order for log rafters, poles, posts, vigas and stringers. 6 to 12 inch and large diameters are available. They can be cut to any length. Customers interested in seeing the ecosystem management of a Northwestern forest are welcome to take a tour of the property.

We always endeavour to never specify what we cannot measure.
 




Utilities
Businesses in the utilities market operate in an increasingly complex environment.
They need to ensure the security of remote assets, manage geographically diverse operations and plan and deliver reliable services over increasingly complex wired and wireless networks.
Radio transmitter and receiver products and services enable utilities to more effectively measure, monitor and control operations. Whether it is the remote monitoring of reservoirs and sub stations assets, or new technology energy monitoring and control, wireless communications enables utility companies to develop more effective and reliable infrastructure network services.
Wood & Douglas has worked with leading utility companies such as Thames Water, United Utilities and Western Power to develop and implement robust wireless services helping utility companies deliver a more effective and efficient business solution.


Homeland Security
The events of and since September 11th 2001 have and continue to reshape the security of the modern World. 
Governments across the globe have had to develop new and more effective means by which to protect their citizens.  Wireless communication has enabled new forms and techniques for intelligence gathering that were previously unimaginable.
Wood & Douglas work with a number of Homeland Security agencies around the world, helping them to develop new means of remotely monitoring, gathering and managing information using radio communication technology.
Wood & Douglas radio equipment is often deployed in extreme environmental conditions and will be expected to delivery HD quality video images, digital encryption, low quiescent standby power consumption with a low payload mass. 
These are complex and contradicting operational radio requirements, often life critical, and from demanding clients.


Emergency Services
Wireless technology has always been a critical resource for the emergency services.  Radio communications gives the absolute flexibility required by these life critical public services.
Wood & Douglas has enhanced their usage of the radio spectrum by providing specialist wireless transceiver hardware into key narrow niche areas.  Remote telemetry monitoring of fire crew breathing apparatus and major incident on scene real time video are typical examples of where our radio engineering skills have been successfully applied to give emergency services personnel the tools to do a more effective and safer job.
An increasing number of emergency services are consulting with Wood & Douglas’ radio engineers to develop new ways of communicating through wireless technology.  Our experienced team's primary objective is to create wireless connected services that deliver the reliability and flexibility that emergency services can trust.


Health Care
More than half of the population born today will live to the age of 100 or more. As the population ages, the need to manage serious but non-life threatening illnesses for longer will continue to grow. The healthcare market will rely on new thinking to develop smart solutions to the challenges of tomorrow.
Central to this new thinking will be the smart application of wireless technology to allow healthcare professionals to discretely monitor their patients whether in sheltered care or at home. Developments in wireless technology will ensure that people who need the support of medical staff receive it quickly and effectively.
Wood & Douglas has supported a number of RF enabled suppliers to this market with cost effect OEM radio communication connectivity for integration into wireless patient monitoring systems.  The Company’s high quality reliable radio equipment is ideally suited to creating new ways to care for the needs of the population in the 21st century.
Health Care Infrastructure
Estate Managers of Health Care campuses such as hospitals, Trusts and care homes face increasing challenges in relation to providing a safe environment for the patients in their care. Aging infrastructure, increased regulations and a focus on cost-savings are common place problems and many are having to look beyond current building management systems to find effective and efficient solutions. 
One such challenge is the monitoring of water systems to mitigate the chances of legionella developing. Changes in legislation have forced Estate Managers to look beyond manual monitoring of water flow and temperature, a costly, labour intensive exercise fraught with inaccuracies and risk.
The Ultra Real-Time Monitoring Solution (U-RTMS) offers estate managers for NHS Trusts and campuses the ability to remotely monitor, report upon and analyse data relating to safety systems such as mitigation of legionella. U-RTMS addresses key criteria such as:

Complying with National Safety Standards
Improving patient and building safety
Reducing costs associated with manual monitoring of systems
Providing robust records for audit purposes 

The modular and scalable U-RTMS offers a multitude of applications in addition to legionella monitoring such as: 

Active gas-flow monitoring
Critical temperature monitoring
Access security monitoring



Transport
By the end of 2010, more than 55% of the world’s population were living in cities. The increasing urbanisation of society creates new challenges for transportation within and between metropolises. Environmental concerns are also driving new transportation systems - to deliver a better experience more sustainably.
Wireless technology is heavily embedded in transportation.  Radio keyless entry lets you enter your car. Integrated public transportation systems provide wireless timetable displays. Traffic light priority signalling helps public transport flow smoother. The list for the application of radio is endless and growing.
Wood & Douglas’ RF engineers have designed and developed radio leading edge services for major players in the transportation industry. Radio transceivers deliver data messaging datagrams. COFDM digital video links provide real time high quality images for logistics and security.  Behind many key radio system suppliers, the communication engine is a Wood & Douglas wireless communication product.


Exploration Services
Mining, quarrying and offshore exploration for oil and gas remain critical industries for the provision of energy supplies, precious metals and other raw materials.  Exploration services take place in some of the most challenging and hostile environments where safety, security and reliability are essential prerequisites to successful projects.
Reliable radio communications can be extremely difficult in these circumstances, particularly underground, at sea or over vast radio propagation distances.  Wood & Douglas specialises in delivering wireless communications in such challenging RF environments.  Projects have included a high bit rate COFDM digital data links from ship to shore, video capture and delivery for the oil and gas industries,  radio telemetry transceivers for seismic survey and wireless perimeter fencing for large area open cast mine security.
Delivering critical wireless applications in such demanding environments requires intelligent RF design and rock solid radio implementation.  Wood & Douglas has proved its capability to combine creative wireless solutions with flawless RF execution.


M2M
Machine to Machine (M2M) communications is one of the fastest growing technology markets in the world. A diverse range of industries are adopting this network-based technology. According to research by Markets to Markets, the global M2M market is expected to grow 26.1% from 2012 to 2017 and be worth $85.96 billion.
M2M technology allows the transmission of data from one machine to another over a network. M2M is used primarily for remote monitoring, automation and notification. It is particularly helpful to monitor facilities that are geographically remote or difficult to access.
Since the deployment of the mobile phone networks, and the growth of other wireless technologies, there has been considerable interest in M2M technology. However the technology is not new. Connected sensors and devices have existed for many years and been an integral part of monitoring and measurement in a number of diverse industries. Nor is it true to say that M2M is only possible since the development of cellular networks. Any network can be used for M2M. However wireless networks are usually more suitable to the needs of the M2M market.
Wood & Douglas has deployed its wireless radio technology in a wide range of application to deliver a robust, reliable and fast network for M2M services to operate seamlessly. We have successfully installed our radio units across diverse industries from utilities and emergency services to homeland security and exploration services, working with some of the leading names in these respective sectors.
Q&A
What is Machine to Machine (M2M)?
In simple terms, M2M is the real-time transmission of data between machines over a wired or wireless network without interaction from a human. Generally, the captured data is then remotely collected, assessed and analysed.
What communications technology is used to create the network?
Any wired or wireless technology can be used as a channel for M2M communications. Typically wireless technologies are often used because M2M tends to be implemented to monitor remote or difficult to reach areas. Cellular, satellite and radio frequency technologies are all suitable for M2M communications.
What industries is M2M used in?
M2M technology is implemented in a diverse range of industries ranging from utilities, homeland security, emergency services, health care, transport, exploration services, plant and construction, oil and gas, digital media, exploration and mining to broadcast and retail.
What applications is M2M technology used for?
Wood & Douglas has deployed wireless technology into a wide range of M2M applications for industry. For example, we have strong relationships with the major utility companies in the UK helping them monitor waste water processes, detect leaks in underground water pipes, monitor reservoir levels, employ smart metering and manage faults on the national grid. We also work with major plants across the country in health and safety and delivering tidal information to determine the safe passage of cargo boats into estuary areas.
What data can be carried on an M2M network?
Typically M2M communications tend to be used for monitoring or measurement. A good example would be monitoring the volume of water in a reservoir. A water authority might measure the volume of water in a number of reservoirs over a wide area. This information would then be sent to a central control unit that could ensure that customer receive an uninterrupted water supply and ensure that, if one reservoir is below a certain level, another supplies the water.
This is just one application of M2M. It could monitor and measure anything from the speed of water flow to the volume of gas in an underground storage facility and from traffic congestion in a city to environmental measurements in the atmosphere.
Which technology is most suited to my M2M project?
This will depend entirely on the project. M2M communications can be achieved on cellular networks, local RF, satellite or even using short distance technologies such as Bluetooth. Each communications technology has its own challenges and opportunities (and costs). In order to understand which communications technology is right for your M2M project it is important to understand exactly what needs to be achieved.
Why adopt M2M technology?
M2M technology makes it easier to monitor, manage and action critical data.
M2M technology has three key benefits:
Speed: information can be transmitted and actioned quickly
Convenience: because M2M is automated, there is no need for human intervention, meaning that remote areas can be monitored without having to send people to physically measure.
Cost: M2M is highly cost effective
