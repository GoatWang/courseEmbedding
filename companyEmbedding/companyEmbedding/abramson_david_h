About Me

I am a board-certified ophthalmologist with specialty training in opthalmic oncology. I am Chief of the Ophthalmic Oncology Service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, the only service of its kind dedicated to ophthalmic oncology in a cancer hospital in the US. Because of our close association with specialists in pediatrics, radiation oncology, and medicine, we are able to offer coordinated, state-of-the-art care with access to novel therapies and clinical trials not available anywhere else in the country.

Ophthalmic oncologists are ophthalmologists who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer on the surface of the eye, in the eye, and in the tissues around the eye (the lids and orbit). I have a joint appointment in Surgery, Pediatrics, and Radiation Oncology.
I have had extensive experience in the diagnosis and treatment of cancers in and around the eye. These cancers are all rare and are usually diagnosed without biopsy, so experience is very important in arriving at the correct diagnosis every time. To help make a diagnosis we use the latest in diagnostic digital imaging and ultrasound, including standardized A and B scan, in addition to high frequency anterior segment ultrasound (“ultrasonic biomicroscopy,” or UBM), OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography), digital imaging and needle biopsy when indicated.
The most common cancer we see is melanoma in the eye, also known as ocular melanoma. We offer the most sophisticated diagnostic and therapeutic option for these cancers, including brachytherapy (radioactive material sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters is placed directly into or near a tumor) with radioactive iodine and ruthenium. Our medical physicists and brachytherapy team are internationally respected for their expertise in delivering individually designed treatment for each patient. In collaboration with Memorial Sloan Kettering’s melanoma team, we are now offering a Phase II trial for the first targeted molecule in the treatment of melanoma of the eye (uveal melanoma) that has spread, or metastasized, to another part of the body.
Our retinoblastoma center, with records that go back to 1914, is the longest continually operating center of its kind in the world, with the longest follow-up of the largest number of patients. We have a newly-constructed examination suite dedicated to caring for children with retinoblastoma, which has all the modern equipment used to diagnose and treat retinoblastoma.
I have introduced many new treatments for retinoblastoma that have been adopted by other cancer hospitals worldwide. These treatments include the novel use of chemotherapy delivered around the eye to prevent systemic toxicity of intravenous medication; and in 2006, the use of high concentration — but low dose — chemotherapy delivered directly into the eye via a catheter placed in the groin, administered on an outpatient basis. Our studies on the long-term complications in this disease have been published extensively in the Journal of the American Medical Association as well as ophthalmic and oncology journals.
I have published more than 400 books, chapters, original articles, scientific reviews, audiotapes, and videotapes, and I was the editor of the American Academy’s instruction book on ophthalmic oncology. I have delivered more than 400 lectures worldwide, including in France, Italy, Switzerland, Israel, China, Hong Kong, Canada, Mexico, Venezuela, Peru, Brazil, and Argentina.
Among the many honors I have received are awards from the Swiss Ophthalmological Society, The Association for Research in Vision, the Helen Keller Society, and the New York State Ophthalmological Society. I have received many teaching awards, and I have received the Honor Award, the Senior Honor Award, and the Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Academy of Ophthalmology.

Ophthalmic oncologists are ophthalmologists who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer on the surface of the eye, in the eye, and in the tissues around the eye (lids, orbit). My appointment is a joint one in Surgery, Pediatrics, and Radiation Oncology. I perform all the surgery on ophthalmic oncology patients at MSK but in every case work closely with my colleagues in Pediatrics, Radiation Oncology, and Medicine. We are the only service dedicated to ophthalmic oncology in a cancer hospital in the US; and, because of our close association with these other services, we are able to offer coordinated, state-of-the-art care with access to novel therapies and clinical trials not available anywhere else in the country. After completing a residency in ophthalmology and a full year of research involving ultrasound and cancer of the eye, I did a fellowship in ophthalmic oncology and also spent additional time training at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology in Washington, DC. I have had extensive experience in the diagnosis and treatment of cancers in and around the eye. Cancers in and around the eye are usually diagnosed without biopsy; and since all cancers in my area are rare, experience is very important in arriving at the correct diagnosis every time. To assist me, we have the latest in diagnostic digital imaging and ultrasound, including standardized A and B scan in addition to high frequency anterior segment ultrasound ('ultrasonic biomicroscopy,' or UBM). I have published more than 400 books, chapters, original articles, scientific reviews, audiotapes, and videotapes, and I was the editor of the American Academy's instruction book on Ophthalmic Oncology. I have delivered more than 400 lectures worldwide, including in France, Italy, Switzerland, Israel, China, Hong Kong, Canada, Mexico, Venezuela, Peru, Brazil, and Argentina. The most common cancer we see is melanoma in the eye. We offer every modern diagnostic and therapeutic option for these cancers, including brachytherapy ('plaques') with radioactive iodine and ruthenium. I work closely with our radiation oncologists, and our physicists and brachytherapy team are internationally respected for their expertise. Every plaque therapy is individually designed for each patient. I was a principal investigator (and author) of the 20-year NIH-sponsored trial called the COMS (Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study), in which we demonstrated the most effective management of patients with ocular melanomas. I have been described as 'the Dean of Retinoblastoma,' and our retinoblastoma center is the longest continually operating retinoblastoma center in the world, with the longest follow-up of the largest number of patients ever. We have a newly constructed examination suite dedicated to the examinations of children with retinoblastoma, and in it is every modern piece of equipment that exists to diagnose and treat retinoblastoma. I have introduced many new treatments for retinoblastoma that have been adopted by other centers worldwide. These include the novel use of chemotherapy delivered around the eye to prevent systemic toxicity of intravenous medication. Our studies on the long-term complications of cancer diathesis in this disease have been published extensively in JAMA as well as ophthalmic and oncology journals. I have received awards from the Swiss Ophthalmological Society (for my work in childhood eye cancer and genetics), The Association for Research in Vision (for my contributions to clinical ophthalmological research), the Helen Keller Society (for my work with blind and limited-sighted children), and the New York State Ophthalmological Society (for my humanitarian approach to patients). I have received many teaching awards, and I have received the Honor Award and the Senior Honor Award from the American Academy of Ophthalmology.Dr. Abramson's Experience0ExperienceMatchExperience MatchSee how Dr. Abramson's experience matches your preferences.1SpecialtiesFor the best healthcare for your needs, choose a doctor who specializes in your medical condition.1Board CertificationsBoard certification indicates that a doctor is highly qualified in the medical field in which they practice.60Conditions TreatedCheck to see that this provider treats your medical condition.11Procedures PerformedCheck to see that this provider performs the procedure that you need.Background CheckCheck to see if your provider has any malpractices, board actions, or sanctions.EducationLearn more about where this provider went to medical school, residency, and more.Awards & RecognitionView information about special awards and recognition for this provider.Languages SpokenCheck to see what languages this provider and/or staff speak.Memberships & Professional AffiliationsView memberships and affiliations associated with this provider.Overall Patient Satisfaction8responsesLikelihood of recommending Dr. Abramson to family and friends is 5 out of 5Have you seen Dr. Abramson?Leave a ReviewVisiting Dr. AbramsonDr. Abramson accepts 9 insurance carriersView all insurance carriers Dr. Abramson is now accepting new patients Ophthalmology1275 York AveNew York, NY 10065(212) 744-1700Get DirectionsFeatured Ophthalmology Specialists in New York, NY 10065Dr. George Cioffi, MDOphthalmology Specialist(5)Dr. Lama Al-Aswad, MDOphthalmology Specialist(15)These providers are brought to you by and on medical staff atNewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical CenterHospital Referral Line: (212) 235-1531Dr. Jason Horowitz, MDOphthalmology Specialist(4)Dr. Jeffrey Liebmann, MDOphthalmology Specialist(14)View MoreAffiliated HospitalsHospital QualityCheck out the quality of care at the 1 hospitals where Dr. Abramson has admitting privileges.Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center1275 York AveNew York, NY 10065Hospital Awards0Overall Patient ExperienceView Hospital ProfileSee our Ophthalmology Specialists at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical CenterView Hospital ProfileDr. Abramson's ReviewsLikelihood of recommending Dr. Abramson to family and friends5.0 based on 8 total reviewsLeave a reviewDr. Abramson's PerformanceTrustworthinessEXCELLENTExplains condition(s) wellEXCELLENTAnswers QuestionsEXCELLENTTime well spentEXCELLENTOffice & Staff PerformanceSchedulingEXCELLENTOffice environmentEXCELLENTStaff friendlinessEXCELLENTAverage wait time 10 to 15 minutesHave you seen Dr. David Abramson, MD?Leave a Review.Are you Dr. Abramson?Make it easy for patients to share their feedback.

For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia.

Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered.
