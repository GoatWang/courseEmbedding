Richard Weller - Wikipedia





















 






Richard Weller

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Richard Weller is an Australian landscape architect and academic. He is Professor and Chair of Landscape Architecture at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, having succeeded James Corner in 2013.[1] Weller also holds the Martin and Margy Meyerson Chair of Urbanism at the University of Pennsylvania,[2] is on the Board of Directors of the Landscape Architecture Foundation, Washington D.C.,[3] and is Creative Director of LA+ Interdisciplinary Journal of Landscape Architecture.[4] He has been Winthrop Professor of Landscape Architecture at the University of Western Australia,[5][6] and director of the Australian Urban Design Research Centre (AUDRC).[7][8] He has received a number of awards for teaching excellence including a 2012 national citation "for sustained commitment to inspiring and enabling students to engage creatively and critically with complex design problems".[9]
Works[edit]
Weller is a landscape architect and former co-director (with Vladimir Sitta) of Australian landscape architecture firm Room 4.1.3. whose built projects include the "Garden of Australian Dreams"[10] at the National Museum of Australia in Canberra, ACT. The built garden attracted controversy for its radical design.[11][12] He is also identified as a major proponent for the Elizabeth Quay project in Perth, Western Australia, and this can be found in the contents of Boomtown where he uses quotes from various supporters and detractors of the project.[13][14]
Weller's design work has been exhibited in the Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney (1998) as a finalist in the Seppelt Australian Art Awards[15] and in the Venice Biennale (2004). In 2002 his design was selected as a finalist in the Pentagon Memorial competition in Washington, D.C.[16] and in 2005 he was a finalist in the Tsunami Memorial competition in Thailand.[17] His early work (1990 to 1995) as consultant to Berlin landscape architecture firm Muller, Knippschild Wehberg (now Lützow 7) was heavily awarded in European design competitions.[18]
Research and Publications[edit]
Weller gave the Frederick Law Olmsted Memorial Lecture at the Harvard Graduate School of Design in 2011[19] and has been a regular commentator on planning and design issues.[20][21] He is author of five books and over 90 single-authored papers.[22] His publications include:

Room 4.1.3: Innovations in Landscape Architecture (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2005)[23]
"An Art of Instrumentality: Thinking Through Landscape Urbanism" in Charles Waldheim (ed), The Landscape Urbanism Reader (Princeton Architectural Press, 2006)
Boomtown 2050: Scenarios for a Rapidly Growing City (University of Western Australia Press, 2009)[24]
Made in Australia: The Future of Australian Cities (UWA Publishing, 2013)[25]
The Atlas for the End of the World (2017), a website which audits the status of land use and urbanization in the most critically endangered bioregions on Earth.[26]

 Richard Weller is the Martin and Margy Meyerson Chair of Urbanism and Professor and Chair of Landscape Architecture at PennDesign.Throughout his career he has worked simultaneously as an academic and a consultant specializing in the formative stages of projects ranging from gardens to plazas, memorials, museums, suburbs and waterfronts. He is former director of the design firm Room 4.1.3 and the Australian Urban Design Research Center. His research projects have involved scenario planning for cities, megaregions and nations. His current research concerns urbanization in the world’s biodiversity hotspots. In over 30 years practice he has received a consistent stream of international design competition awards at all scales of landscape architecture and urban design. He has published 4 books and over 90 single-authored papers. Weller sits on the board of the Landscape Architecture Foundation ( (LAF) in Washington and is the founder and Creative Director of the interdisciplinary journal of landscape architecture LA+. A devoted teacher, he was honored with an Australian National Teaching Award in 2012 for “sustained commitment to inspiring and enabling students to engage creatively and critically with complex design problems.” He teaches in three subject areas: advanced design studios at all scales, urban design history and theory, and historical and contemporary ideas of Nature. Weller’s designs, research and writing can be found here.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
