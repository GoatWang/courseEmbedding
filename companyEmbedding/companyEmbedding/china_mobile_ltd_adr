Black swans? Here’s why the recent global breakout in stocks should NOT be trusted
              
              If the trend is, indeed, your friend, then more gains are on the way, because everything is breaking out around the world. Last week, nine key indexes busted through to record highs on the same day, including the Value Line Geometric Composite, maybe the broadest global gauge of them all.

If you can’t resist the lure of bottom-fishing this market, at least follow these five rules

Dow struggles to take flight as Wall Street focuses on earnings; Fed ahead
              
              The U.S. stock market opened slightly lower on Monday to start a week packed with corporate earnings releases and a midweek meeting of the Federal Reserve. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  was trading less than 0.1% lower at 21,557, the S&P 500 index  was off about 0.1% at 2,470. The Nasdaq Composite Index , meanwhile, was trading flat at 6,390. Wall Street investors were paying attention to weakness in the dollar , and conversely strength in the euro . A weaker dollar tends to give a boost to multinational companies selling goods and services abroad, while a strengthening euro can provide a headwind to European companies selling outside of the eurozone. Market participants also watched a meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries for signs of any further moves to limit a glut of crude oil, which has weighed on futures prices . In corporate news, the market was watching the tumble in Hibbett Sports Inc. , which was sinking after it said it expected second-quarter sales to slump. Also, Shares of WebMD Health Corp.  soared on news that KKR & Co.  was looking to take the health-care information company private. Looking ahead, Google-parent Alphabet Inc.  is set to report after the close of trade on Monday. Further out, the Fed kicks off its two-day policy meeting on Tuesday, with the central bank not expected to lift interest rates further, but clues about its policy plans and the state of the U.S. economy will be closely tracked in its updated statement. In economic news,  the IHS Markit flash purchasing managers index, a key business survey, came in at 55.8--lower than the 56.2 analysts had expected, and a six-month low for the index. A reading above 50 indicates economic growth.

4 Reasons I'm Buying China Mobile Ltd. (ADR) Stock
China’s top wireless carrier looks like a great investment in a tumultuous market.











                Leo Sun
            

                (TMFSunLion)



            
            Jan 26, 2017 at 7:52PM
            
            





U.S. telecom stocks performed well over the past year thanks to low interest rates driving investors toward high-yielding dividend stocks. However, investors shouldn't forget about overseas telcos, which combine many of the same benefits as American telcos with higher growth potential. One such company is Chinese telco China Mobile (NYSE:CHL), which I recently added to my portfolio for four simple reasons.

1. It has great long-term growth potential
As the biggest wireless carrier in China (and the world) with 849 million customers, China Mobile's moat is nearly impossible for any rival to cross. Between last January and December, China Mobile's total customer base grew 2.5%. That growth sounds tepid, but its 4G customer base -- which generates higher subscription revenues -- grew 59% to over 535 million during that period. 
Meanwhile, its 3G customer base shrank by 37% to just over 103 million. The remainder of China Mobile's customers remain on 2G networks -- which means that there are still plenty of feature phone users who could eventually convert to data-hungry smartphones. China Mobile also has a small but growing wireline business with 78 million customers. This could enable the company to offer more digital bundles in the near future.
2. It's backed by the state
China Mobile is the largest of China's three state-backed telcos, which also include China Unicom (NYSE:CHU) and China Telecom (NYSE:CHA). The Chinese government sometimes rotates the management of the three companies to ensure that one of the companies doesn't overpower the other two.

While this setup prevents China Mobile from ever becoming a monopoly, its state backing presents a wide safety net for the company. The state-backed status of all three companies also makes it easier to sign collaborative agreements. In late 2015, all three telcos agreed to sell their towers to China Tower for cash and stock, and lease them back to reduce operating costs. Analysts estimate the move generated about 2.4 billion yuan (about $350 million) in savings for China Mobile during the first year alone.





3. It generates strong and steady growth
As a mature telco, China Mobile offers investors steady top and bottom line growth. Analysts expect its revenue to rise 2% this year and 5% next year, as more 2G and 3G users upgrade to 4G plans and it expands its wireless and wireline ecosystems. China Mobile's positive sales growth offers a stark contrast to China Unicom and China Telecom, which are expected to post respective revenue declines of 6% and 1% this year.
On the bottom line, China Mobile's earnings are expected to grow 17% this year and 7% next year. That slowdown should be caused by expenses related to its 4G base station expansion plans and its investments in digital bundles for its customers. But once again, that forecast crushes China Unicom's projected earnings drop of 87% this year and China Telecom's estimated 13% decline.
4. It's fundamentally cheap and pays a decent dividend
China Mobile is clearly the "best in breed" player among Chinese telcos, but its stock trades at just 14 times earnings -- which is slightly higher than China Telecom's P/E of 13 but lower than China Unicom's P/E of 47 and the industry average of 18 for foreign telecom companies. 
China Mobile has a trailing dividend yield of 2.9%, which admittedly isn't as attractive as the 4%+ yields of its U.S. counterparts. Its dividend payments are also semi-annual instead of quarterly, fluctuate from year to year, and don't follow a pattern of annual hikes. The payments are then converted from Hong Kong dollars to U.S. dollars for ADR shareholders, which could be hurt by currency headwinds. That might not sound appealing to income investors, but it's still a decent bonus for owning the stock.





The key takeaway
China Mobile isn't an ideal stock for income investors, but it provides a good blend of growth and income while giving your portfolio exposure to the second biggest economy in the world. A slowdown in the Chinese economy could definitely hurt China Mobile, but I believe that the company is built to last for a very long time.

China Mobile Ltd. (ADR), China Unicom (Hong Kong) Limited (ADR): How To Profit From China’s Economic Slowdown | ETF Daily News



































 



























































How To Profit From China’s Economic Slowdown [China Mobile Ltd. (ADR), China Unicom (Hong Kong) Limited (ADR)]


 March 13, 2014 2:11pm  ETF BASIC NEWS  



 




Moe Zulfiqar: There’s a significant amount of pessimism towards the Chinese economy these days, and the reasons behind this are very understandable. The economic data suggests the country is headed toward an economic slowdown.




In 2013, China’s gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 7.7%—barely better than the previous year and the estimates that were calling for the lowest growth rate since 1999. (Source: Yao, K. and Wang, A., “China’s 2013 economic growth dodges 14-year low but further slowing seen,” Reuters, January 20, 2014.) Keep in mind that despite beating the estimates, this GDP growth rate is much lower than the country’s historical average.
This isn’t all. A credit crunch is also in the making. We are now hearing how companies in China will have troubles paying their interest on the bonds they have issued. So far, we have seen one default on payment by Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology Co. This solar company, based in China, defaulted on a $14.7-million interest payment on bonds it issued two years ago. (Source: Wei, L., McMahon, D. and Ma, W., “Chinese Firm’s Bond Default May Not Be the Last,” The Wall Street Journal, March 9, 2014.)
Before this default, there was a slight hope that the government would come in and bail out the troubled companies—something that happened in the U.S. economy during the financial crisis in 2008. Now, with this default, there are speculations that we will see more of the same.
Furthermore, there are concerns that property values in the Chinese economy are going to see a correction. Over the past few years, there has been the mass development of ghost towns—these are cities that have been built with massive infrastructure, yet very few people are living there. It shows there’s a massive amount of supply in the property market—which, of course, results in lower prices.
In addition to all this, production in the country is declining. In February, the indicators of manufacturing activity in China like the HSBC China Manufacturing Purchasing Mangers’ Index declined to an eight-month low, showing there’s an outright contraction in the sector. (Source: “HSBC China Manufacturing PMI; PMI signals modest deterioration of business conditions in February,” Markit, March 3, 2014.)
In spite of the negativity towards China in the mainstream, I remain bullish on the country and believe investors may do very well there.
Let me explain…
Certainly, there are troubles that will come in the way in the near future, but the long-term perspective looks good. Many investors forget that China has the biggest population in the world and the middle class in the country continues to grow.
The recent troubles, according to my analysis, will create havoc in Chinese stocks in the short term, but they will also create buying opportunities in the well-known names that have massive market share.
Take China Mobile Limited (NYSE:CHL), for example; since the third quarter of 2013, the company’s stock price has declined roughly 20%. Recently, the stock broke below its long-term support level, and it may go down further. China Mobile has more than 700 million subscribers. To put this into perspective, that’s more than twice the size of the American population.
As more economic news comes out of China, investors should make a list of major companies that operate in China and trade on the key stock indices here in the U.S. When there’s a sell-off, certain companies get punished for no apparent reason—and that’s when they are worth buying. Chinese companies will be no different.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

History[edit]
A state-owned enterprise directly controlled by the government of the People's Republic of China[5] and also a public company that is listed on the NYSE and the Hong Kong stock exchanges,[2] China Mobile has dominated Chinese mobile services since its inception. As of 2010, China Mobile controls the vast majority of its domestic mobile services market with a 70% market share.[9] China Unicom and China Telecom have 20% and 10% shares, respectively.[9]
Incorporated in 1997 as China Telecom (Hong Kong) Limited,[1] China Mobile was born from the 1999 break-up of China Telecom.[10] (This company continues to provide mobile services, however.[9])
State control[edit]
The company likely enjoys substantial protectionist benefits from China's government[11] but also experiences frequent government intervention in its business affairs.[12] Government control is maintained through a presumably government-owned holding company, China Mobile Communications Corporation (CMCC), that owns 100 percent ownership of China Mobile (HK) Group Limited,[13] which in turn holds over seventy percent ownership of China Mobile–the remainder being controlled by public investors.[2] Established in 2000,[13] CMCC is China Mobile Ltd's current parent company as of 2011.[14]
Rural subscriber base[edit]

display of China Mobile phones, 2010


China Mobile has historically held a greater share of the rural market than competitors.[16] By 2006, its network had expanded to provide reception to 97% of the Chinese population,[17] and the company has since seen a sustained stream of new, rural mobile customers.[16]
It also offers services targeted at the rural market including an agricultural information service, which facilitates a variety of activities such as the sale and purchase of agricultural products, access to market prices for produce and crops, wire transfers, bank withdrawals, and payments, etc.[18]
Overseas activities[edit]
The company branched out in 2007 with the purchase of Paktel in Pakistan[19] launching the Zong brand there a year later.[20]
In 2013, China Mobile eyed expansion into Myanmar expressing interest in bidding for one of two licences on offer in a partnership with Vodafone although this plan ultimately fell through.[21]
Domestic acquisitions[edit]
In May 2008, the company took over China Tietong, a fixed-line telecom[22] and the then third-largest broadband ISP in China[23] adding Internet services to its core business of mobile services.
Network[edit]
China Mobile operates a GSM network,[24] which encompasses all 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and directly administered municipalities in Mainland China and includes Hong Kong, too.[2] GPRS is utilized for data transmission.[25]

3G

The company controls 70% of the Chinese mobile market but a far smaller percentage of the 3G market.[9] As of May 2012, its nearly 60 million 3G subscribers account for roughly 9% of its total subscriber base,[26] which is an increase from 3% in 2010.[9]
Its 3G network, still under construction in 2010, utilizes the TD-SCDMA standard, which China Mobile helped develop. 3G service is available in all of the 4 direct-controlled municipalities and most of the 283 prefecture-level cities in China as of 2010.[27]

4G

As of 2010, China Mobile has debuted small-scale 4G demonstration networks using a variant of 3GPP's Long Term Evolution, TD-LTE, and has plans for larger, citywide demonstration networks in the future.[27] As of May 2012, such networks are in operation.[26]
While prior iPhone models couldn't use the China Mobile network due to the chipset relying on WCDMA-based networks, talks to carry the then unreleased 4G iPhone (iPhone 5) began in mid-2012.[26] The iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s were sold through China Mobile starting in January 2014.[28]

Everest

In 2003 and again in 2007, China Mobile provided mobile services on Mount Everest.[29]

Spratly Isles coverage

In May 2011, China Mobile announced its network now includes the controversial Spratly Islands.[30]
Nokia deal[edit]
In October 2014, Nokia and China Mobile signed a $970 million framework deal for delivery between 2014 and 2015.[31][32]
Service brands[edit]
China Mobile uses other names to differentiate its offerings.
Mainland China[edit]
Mobile services are available in Mainland China under several brands as of 2007.[33] As of 2013, the below brands are scheduled to be slowly phased out and replaced by an all-encompassing new brand name—And[34]—whose logo combines an exclamation point, the Chinese character for "peace" (Chinese: 和, Hanyu Pinyin: Hé), as well as the English word "and".[35]

History[edit]
A state-owned enterprise directly controlled by the government of the People's Republic of China[5] and also a public company that is listed on the NYSE and the Hong Kong stock exchanges,[2] China Mobile has dominated Chinese mobile services since its inception. As of 2010, China Mobile controls the vast majority of its domestic mobile services market with a 70% market share.[9] China Unicom and China Telecom have 20% and 10% shares, respectively.[9]
Incorporated in 1997 as China Telecom (Hong Kong) Limited,[1] China Mobile was born from the 1999 break-up of China Telecom.[10] (This company continues to provide mobile services, however.[9])
State control[edit]
The company likely enjoys substantial protectionist benefits from China's government[11] but also experiences frequent government intervention in its business affairs.[12] Government control is maintained through a presumably government-owned holding company, China Mobile Communications Corporation (CMCC), that owns 100 percent ownership of China Mobile (HK) Group Limited,[13] which in turn holds over seventy percent ownership of China Mobile–the remainder being controlled by public investors.[2] Established in 2000,[13] CMCC is China Mobile Ltd's current parent company as of 2011.[14]
Rural subscriber base[edit]




Wang Jianzhou, Chairman and CEO during the Market Insight: Frontier Markets plenary session in Tianjin, China, 28 September 2008.[15]






display of China Mobile phones, 2010


China Mobile has historically held a greater share of the rural market than competitors.[16] By 2006, its network had expanded to provide reception to 97% of the Chinese population,[17] and the company has since seen a sustained stream of new, rural mobile customers.[16]
It also offers services targeted at the rural market including an agricultural information service, which facilitates a variety of activities such as the sale and purchase of agricultural products, access to market prices for produce and crops, wire transfers, bank withdrawals, and payments, etc.[18]
Overseas activities[edit]
The company branched out in 2007 with the purchase of Paktel in Pakistan[19] launching the Zong brand there a year later.[20]
In 2013, China Mobile eyed expansion into Myanmar expressing interest in bidding for one of two licences on offer in a partnership with Vodafone although this plan ultimately fell through.[21]
Domestic acquisitions[edit]
In May 2008, the company took over China Tietong, a fixed-line telecom[22] and the then third-largest broadband ISP in China[23] adding Internet services to its core business of mobile services.
Network[edit]
China Mobile operates a GSM network,[24] which encompasses all 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and directly administered municipalities in Mainland China and includes Hong Kong, too.[2] GPRS is utilized for data transmission.[25]

3G

The company controls 70% of the Chinese mobile market but a far smaller percentage of the 3G market.[9] As of May 2012, its nearly 60 million 3G subscribers account for roughly 9% of its total subscriber base,[26] which is an increase from 3% in 2010.[9]
Its 3G network, still under construction in 2010, utilizes the TD-SCDMA standard, which China Mobile helped develop. 3G service is available in all of the 4 direct-controlled municipalities and most of the 283 prefecture-level cities in China as of 2010.[27]

4G

As of 2010, China Mobile has debuted small-scale 4G demonstration networks using a variant of 3GPP's Long Term Evolution, TD-LTE, and has plans for larger, citywide demonstration networks in the future.[27] As of May 2012, such networks are in operation.[26]
While prior iPhone models couldn't use the China Mobile network due to the chipset relying on WCDMA-based networks, talks to carry the then unreleased 4G iPhone (iPhone 5) began in mid-2012.[26] The iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s were sold through China Mobile starting in January 2014.[28]

Everest

In 2003 and again in 2007, China Mobile provided mobile services on Mount Everest.[29]

Spratly Isles coverage

In May 2011, China Mobile announced its network now includes the controversial Spratly Islands.[30]
Nokia deal[edit]
In October 2014, Nokia and China Mobile signed a $970 million framework deal for delivery between 2014 and 2015.[31][32]
Service brands[edit]
China Mobile uses other names to differentiate its offerings.
Mainland China[edit]
Mobile services are available in Mainland China under several brands as of 2007.[33] As of 2013, the below brands are scheduled to be slowly phased out and replaced by an all-encompassing new brand name—And[34]—whose logo combines an exclamation point, the Chinese character for "peace" (Chinese: 和, Hanyu Pinyin: Hé), as well as the English word "and".[35]

History[edit]
A state-owned enterprise directly controlled by the government of the People's Republic of China[5] and also a public company that is listed on the NYSE and the Hong Kong stock exchanges,[2] China Mobile has dominated Chinese mobile services since its inception. As of 2010, China Mobile controls the vast majority of its domestic mobile services market with a 70% market share.[9] China Unicom and China Telecom have 20% and 10% shares, respectively.[9]
Incorporated in 1997 as China Telecom (Hong Kong) Limited,[1] China Mobile was born from the 1999 break-up of China Telecom.[10] (This company continues to provide mobile services, however.[9])
State control[edit]
The company likely enjoys substantial protectionist benefits from China's government[11] but also experiences frequent government intervention in its business affairs.[12] Government control is maintained through a presumably government-owned holding company, China Mobile Communications Corporation (CMCC), that owns 100 percent ownership of China Mobile (HK) Group Limited,[13] which in turn holds over seventy percent ownership of China Mobile–the remainder being controlled by public investors.[2] Established in 2000,[13] CMCC is China Mobile Ltd's current parent company as of 2011.[14]
Rural subscriber base[edit]

display of China Mobile phones, 2010


China Mobile has historically held a greater share of the rural market than competitors.[16] By 2006, its network had expanded to provide reception to 97% of the Chinese population,[17] and the company has since seen a sustained stream of new, rural mobile customers.[16]
It also offers services targeted at the rural market including an agricultural information service, which facilitates a variety of activities such as the sale and purchase of agricultural products, access to market prices for produce and crops, wire transfers, bank withdrawals, and payments, etc.[18]
Overseas activities[edit]
The company branched out in 2007 with the purchase of Paktel in Pakistan[19] launching the Zong brand there a year later.[20]
In 2013, China Mobile eyed expansion into Myanmar expressing interest in bidding for one of two licences on offer in a partnership with Vodafone although this plan ultimately fell through.[21]
Domestic acquisitions[edit]
In May 2008, the company took over China Tietong, a fixed-line telecom[22] and the then third-largest broadband ISP in China[23] adding Internet services to its core business of mobile services.
Network[edit]
China Mobile operates a GSM network,[24] which encompasses all 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and directly administered municipalities in Mainland China and includes Hong Kong, too.[2] GPRS is utilized for data transmission.[25]

3G

The company controls 70% of the Chinese mobile market but a far smaller percentage of the 3G market.[9] As of May 2012, its nearly 60 million 3G subscribers account for roughly 9% of its total subscriber base,[26] which is an increase from 3% in 2010.[9]
Its 3G network, still under construction in 2010, utilizes the TD-SCDMA standard, which China Mobile helped develop. 3G service is available in all of the 4 direct-controlled municipalities and most of the 283 prefecture-level cities in China as of 2010.[27]

4G

As of 2010, China Mobile has debuted small-scale 4G demonstration networks using a variant of 3GPP's Long Term Evolution, TD-LTE, and has plans for larger, citywide demonstration networks in the future.[27] As of May 2012, such networks are in operation.[26]
While prior iPhone models couldn't use the China Mobile network due to the chipset relying on WCDMA-based networks, talks to carry the then unreleased 4G iPhone (iPhone 5) began in mid-2012.[26] The iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s were sold through China Mobile starting in January 2014.[28]

Everest

In 2003 and again in 2007, China Mobile provided mobile services on Mount Everest.[29]

Spratly Isles coverage

In May 2011, China Mobile announced its network now includes the controversial Spratly Islands.[30]
Nokia deal[edit]
In October 2014, Nokia and China Mobile signed a $970 million framework deal for delivery between 2014 and 2015.[31][32]
Service brands[edit]
China Mobile uses other names to differentiate its offerings.
Mainland China[edit]
Mobile services are available in Mainland China under several brands as of 2007.[33] As of 2013, the below brands are scheduled to be slowly phased out and replaced by an all-encompassing new brand name—And[34]—whose logo combines an exclamation point, the Chinese character for "peace" (Chinese: 和, Hanyu Pinyin: Hé), as well as the English word "and".[35]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
