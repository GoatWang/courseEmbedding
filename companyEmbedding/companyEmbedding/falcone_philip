Early life and education[edit]
Philip Falcone grew up in Chisholm, Minnesota with nine siblings in a three-bedroom house.[1][2][4] He attended Harvard University on financial aid and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Economics in 1984.[1][2][3]
Growing up in Chisholm, Falcone was a stand-out hockey player. He went on to play Varsity hockey at Harvard. After graduating, Falcone played professionally for the Malmö Redhawks, a Swedish professional hockey team, until his playing career ended after one professional season when he sustained a leg injury while playing in Sweden.[1][2][4][5]
Career[edit]
In 1985, he started his career at Kidder, Peabody & Co.[2][3][6] He also worked at Wachovia.[1][6] He was also Senior High Yield trader at First Union Capital Markets in Charlotte, North Carolina.[6] From 1990 to 1995, he served as President and CEO of AAB Manufacturing Corporation".[6] He was the head of High Yield trading at Gleacher Natwest from 1997 to 1998, and at Barclays Capital from 1998 to 2000.[3][6]
In 2000, he founded Harbinger Capital with Raymond J. Harbert.[1][7] In 2008, Falcone became a minority owner of the NHL's Minnesota Wild hockey team when he purchased a 40% stake of the hockey team.[1][3][2] Through Harbinger Capital, Falcone and Harbert owned 20% of The New York Times in 2009.[8] That same year, Falcone became its majority owner, though Harbert remained an investor.[7]
He is a founding council member of the Kissinger Institute on China and the United States.[1][9] He has made further donations to the American Museum of Natural History.[4]
In February 2013, Forbes listed Falcone as one of the 40 Highest-Earning hedge fund managers.[10]
On November 25, 2014, it was announced that Falcone would step down as chief executive and chairman of Harbinger Group effective December 1 to focus on his other venture, HC2 Holdings.[11][12][13]
Lightsquared[edit]
A significant focus on Phil Falcone's investment activities has been the telecommunications company Lightsquared, which attempted to build a multibillion-dollar satellite-based network that would have supplied 4G wireless broadband in competition with AT&T and Verizon Wireless.[4] The plan, however, consisted of gaining wireless spectrum reserved for satellite uses and employing it for terrestrial communication. Critics described this use of wireless spectrum as a loophole meant to avoid paying royalties to the government.[14]
Republican legislators like Chuck Grassley, Ralph Hall and Darrell Issa have expressed concerns that he would receive special treatment to develop LightSquared over the United States Military's Global Positioning System.[15] He later denied the claim.[16] On 15 February 2012, the Federal Communications Commission revoked the 2011 conditional approval for further development of the LightSquared network, stating it would interfere with GPS signals.[17]
2012 securities fraud charge[edit]
On June 27, 2012, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed securities fraud charges against Falcone and Harbinger Capital Partners, alleging that Falcone "used fund assets [of $113.2 million] to pay his taxes, conducted an illegal 'short squeeze' to manipulate bond prices, secretly favored certain customers at the expense of others, and that Harbinger unlawfully bought equity securities in a public offering, after having sold short the same security during a restricted period."[18]
In May 2013, he accepted an SEC settlement in which he and Harbinger agreed to pay a total of $18 million. Under the deal, Falcone would have been banned from operating as an investment advisor for two years.[19] However, in a rare move, the commissioners overruled the enforcement staff and threw out the deal, forcing the two sides back to the bargaining table. Reportedly, SEC chairwoman Mary Jo White felt the deal was too lenient. Finally, on August 19, the SEC and Falcone agreed to a deal in which he and Harbinger admitted breaking the law. It was the first SEC settlement in years in which the defendant was required to admit wrongdoing; usually, defendants who accept SEC settlements neither admit nor deny that they broke the securities laws.[20]
Under the terms of the deal, Falcone will have to pay a total of $11.5 million of his own money to settle the charges. He will disgorge a total of $6.5 million in illicit profits and pay $1.01 million in prejudgment interest and $4 million in civil penalties, and also accepted a five-year ban from the securities industry. By comparison, the May deal required him to pay only $4 million out of his own pocket. Harbinger will pay $6.5 million in civil penalties. Falcone admitted to siphoning off $113.2 million of Harbinger assets to pay his personal state and federal taxes and pay customer redemptions to favored clients. He also admitted to manipulating the bond price of MAAX Holdings, a Canadian bathroom products manufacturer, by buying up all of the outstanding bonds and demanding that Goldman Sachs settle all outstanding MAAX transactions and deliver the bonds it owed. Falcone was well aware Goldman couldn't deliver the bonds because all of them were tied up by Harbinger.[20][21][22][23]
On July 4, 2014, the SEC Office of the Whistleblower rejected a claim made by an individual requesting a reward for assisting in the investigation. The SEC rejected the claim, asserting in the "Claimant did not provide information that led to the successful enforcement".[24]
Personal life[edit]
Falcone is married with two children, and lives in New York City.[1] In 1997, Falcone married Lisa Velasquez.[25] Lisa grew up in Spanish Harlem and has an associate's degree from Pace University. In 2008, she started a film production company, Everest Entertainment, and she has produced Mother and Child, 127 Hours, and Win Win.[4] She is active in philanthropic causes, including the American Museum of Natural History and sits on the board of the New York City Ballet.[1] In 2009, the couple reportedly donated $10 million to New York City's High Line project.[26] They have twin daughters, Liliana and Carolina (born February 2005), who attend The Brearley School.[27][28][29]
In 1999, Falcone built a house in Sag Harbor, New York, which he sold in 2005 for $1.57 million.[30][31]
In 2008, Falcone bought a house on the Upper East Side, formerly owned by Jeremiah Milbank and later Bob Guccione, for $49 million.[4][32] Also in 2008, Falcone bought a Saint Barthélemy villa for $39 million.[33][34]

He is a founding council member of the Kissinger Institute on China and the United States.[1][9] He has made further donations to the American Museum of Natural History.[4]
In February 2013, Forbes listed Falcone as one of the 40 Highest-Earning hedge fund managers.[10]
On November 25, 2014, it was announced that Falcone would step down as chief executive and chairman of Harbinger Group effective December 1 to focus on his other venture, HC2 Holdings.[11][12][13]
Lightsquared[edit]
A significant focus on Phil Falcone's investment activities has been the telecommunications company Lightsquared, which attempted to build a multibillion-dollar satellite-based network that would have supplied 4G wireless broadband in competition with AT&T and Verizon Wireless.[4] The plan, however, consisted of gaining wireless spectrum reserved for satellite uses and employing it for terrestrial communication. Critics described this use of wireless spectrum as a loophole meant to avoid paying royalties to the government.[14]
Republican legislators like Chuck Grassley, Ralph Hall and Darrell Issa have expressed concerns that he would receive special treatment to develop LightSquared over the United States Military's Global Positioning System.[15] He later denied the claim.[16] On 15 February 2012, the Federal Communications Commission revoked the 2011 conditional approval for further development of the LightSquared network, stating it would interfere with GPS signals.[17]
2012 securities fraud charge[edit]
On June 27, 2012, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed securities fraud charges against Falcone and Harbinger Capital Partners, alleging that Falcone "used fund assets [of $113.2 million] to pay his taxes, conducted an illegal 'short squeeze' to manipulate bond prices, secretly favored certain customers at the expense of others, and that Harbinger unlawfully bought equity securities in a public offering, after having sold short the same security during a restricted period."[18]
In May 2013, he accepted an SEC settlement in which he and Harbinger agreed to pay a total of $18 million. Under the deal, Falcone would have been banned from operating as an investment advisor for two years.[19] However, in a rare move, the commissioners overruled the enforcement staff and threw out the deal, forcing the two sides back to the bargaining table. Reportedly, SEC chairwoman Mary Jo White felt the deal was too lenient. Finally, on August 19, the SEC and Falcone agreed to a deal in which he and Harbinger admitted breaking the law. It was the first SEC settlement in years in which the defendant was required to admit wrongdoing; usually, defendants who accept SEC settlements neither admit nor deny that they broke the securities laws.[20]
Under the terms of the deal, Falcone will have to pay a total of $11.5 million of his own money to settle the charges. He will disgorge a total of $6.5 million in illicit profits and pay $1.01 million in prejudgment interest and $4 million in civil penalties, and also accepted a five-year ban from the securities industry. By comparison, the May deal required him to pay only $4 million out of his own pocket. Harbinger will pay $6.5 million in civil penalties. Falcone admitted to siphoning off $113.2 million of Harbinger assets to pay his personal state and federal taxes and pay customer redemptions to favored clients. He also admitted to manipulating the bond price of MAAX Holdings, a Canadian bathroom products manufacturer, by buying up all of the outstanding bonds and demanding that Goldman Sachs settle all outstanding MAAX transactions and deliver the bonds it owed. Falcone was well aware Goldman couldn't deliver the bonds because all of them were tied up by Harbinger.[20][21][22][23]
On July 4, 2014, the SEC Office of the Whistleblower rejected a claim made by an individual requesting a reward for assisting in the investigation. The SEC rejected the claim, asserting in the "Claimant did not provide information that led to the successful enforcement".[24]
Personal life[edit]
Falcone is married with two children, and lives in New York City.[1] In 1997, Falcone married Lisa Velasquez.[25] Lisa grew up in Spanish Harlem and has an associate's degree from Pace University. In 2008, she started a film production company, Everest Entertainment, and she has produced Mother and Child, 127 Hours, and Win Win.[4] She is active in philanthropic causes, including the American Museum of Natural History and sits on the board of the New York City Ballet.[1] In 2009, the couple reportedly donated $10 million to New York City's High Line project.[26] They have twin daughters, Liliana and Carolina (born February 2005), who attend The Brearley School.[27][28][29]
In 1999, Falcone built a house in Sag Harbor, New York, which he sold in 2005 for $1.57 million.[30][31]
In 2008, Falcone bought a house on the Upper East Side, formerly owned by Jeremiah Milbank and later Bob Guccione, for $49 million.[4][32] Also in 2008, Falcone bought a Saint Barthélemy villa for $39 million.[33][34]

Early life and education[edit]
Philip Falcone grew up in Chisholm, Minnesota with nine siblings in a three-bedroom house.[1][2][4] He attended Harvard University on financial aid and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Economics in 1984.[1][2][3]
Growing up in Chisholm, Falcone was a stand-out hockey player. He went on to play Varsity hockey at Harvard. After graduating, Falcone played professionally for the Malmö Redhawks, a Swedish professional hockey team, until his playing career ended after one professional season when he sustained a leg injury while playing in Sweden.[1][2][4][5]
Career[edit]
In 1985, he started his career at Kidder, Peabody & Co.[2][3][6] He also worked at Wachovia.[1][6] He was also Senior High Yield trader at First Union Capital Markets in Charlotte, North Carolina.[6] From 1990 to 1995, he served as President and CEO of AAB Manufacturing Corporation".[6] He was the head of High Yield trading at Gleacher Natwest from 1997 to 1998, and at Barclays Capital from 1998 to 2000.[3][6]
In 2000, he founded Harbinger Capital with Raymond J. Harbert.[1][7] In 2008, Falcone became a minority owner of the NHL's Minnesota Wild hockey team when he purchased a 40% stake of the hockey team.[1][3][2] Through Harbinger Capital, Falcone and Harbert owned 20% of The New York Times in 2009.[8] That same year, Falcone became its majority owner, though Harbert remained an investor.[7]

Philip A. Falcone, barred from the securities business until 2018, now oversees HC2 Holdings, a publicly traded company.

Philip A. Falcone, the brash hedge fund titan who once managed $26 billion before stumbling and running afoul of regulators, is pressing ahead on a new comeback effort, his second.His latest investment platform is a publicly traded company with $800 million in assets called HC2 Holdings. It has bought a couple of midsize businesses — an undersea cable installer and a steel fabricator — that are intended to generate cash to help support several smaller growth prospects that include operations in wireless services, natural-gas truck-fueling stations, life sciences, insurance and sports.For Mr. Falcone, the goal is to make smart acquisitions and hit home runs with some of the smaller earlier-stage ventures, much as he once did by buying bonds of companies in financial distress.The new venture also allows him to stay active during a regulatory ban that bars him from the securities and investment advisory businesses until 2018; regulators have allowed him to run a public company that buys whole businesses instead of managing a fund trading stocks and bonds.

In an interview, Mr. Falcone said he was aiming to “go out and acquire companies and build on that,” creating value through growth in diverse industries. Continue reading the main story

“I feel like, not that I have a lot to prove, but I look at this vehicle as ‘success is the best revenge,’ ” he added.Charles Frischer, a private investor in Seattle whose family owns 1.7 million shares, or 6.5 percent, of HC2, said Mr. Falcone would be “completely redeemed” if he could build HC2’s assets to $2 billion or $3 billion.But Mr. Falcone faces hurdles at HC2, which has been hampered by his history and has already encountered a few setbacks. After quadrupling in price based on its debt-financed acquisitions, its stock has fallen by 40 percent this summer amid sales by a large investor. And a $195 million takeover bid that could have doubled HC2’s size was rejected recently.And the results at his first comeback, a larger public-company vehicle he started six years ago, were underwhelming.Still, Mr. Falcone is undeterred.“People kind of look at me as I am unbelievably aggressive, and I probably do make some people nervous,” Mr. Falcone, a former Harvard hockey center, said in a large conference room in his Park Avenue office for which he pays part of the rent because HC2 alone is not big enough to afford it.Explaining his motivation, he said, “I’m a competitor. I think I’m an unbelievable competitor.” He added, “As the youngest of nine kids in a three-bedroom house, I learned how not to give up.”Mr. Falcone, 53, has already known triumph and adversity on a large scale.After a decade as a high-yield bond trader on Wall Street, he began the Harbinger Capital hedge fund in 2001, initially focusing on distressed debt. In 2007, he personally earned $1.7 billion and doubled his investors’ money on a winning bet against subprime mortgages.

He also indulged in a real estate spending spree, paying $49 million for a 27-room Manhattan townhouse once owned by the Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione and $39 million for a mountainside Caribbean villa in St. Barts.But in 2008, he got caught in the market downdraft with too many illiquid positions just as he faced $10 billion in redemption demands from his investors. Those demands forced him to block investor exits, even as he took a $113 million loan in 2009 to pay his own taxes while he was also buying out a co-founding partner for about $100 million.While Harbinger documents gave him the right to obtain the loan, the Securities and Exchange Commission said in 2013 that he did not form a required fairness committee, did not pay the same rate as Harbinger was paying to borrow and did not disclose the loan to investors for five months.The cloud of the S.E.C. inquiry, which began in 2010, coupled with losses in 2010 and 2011, eventually doomed the hedge fund. Still two-fifths owned by Mr. Falcone, it retains a few illiquid holdings, chiefly a 48 percent stake in LightSquared, a wireless spectrum owner potentially worth billions, and a hotel-casino-golf resort in Vietnam.Mr. Falcone’s first comeback attempt was a public company shell he bought through his hedge fund in 2009 and renamed Harbinger Group, now known as HRG Group.With Mr. Falcone as chief executive, HRG grew to a market value of $2.7 billion with debt of $1.4 billion, partly by issuing new shares in exchange for assets from the hedge fund. For example, it acquired a majority stake in Spectrum Brands, which sells Black & Decker appliances and George Foreman grills.

But the S.E.C. charges and Harbinger’s losses put a cloud over HRG stock. An article in Barron’s noted that the shares traded at a discount to its net asset value, “partly reflecting investor uneasiness with Falcone.”With the hedge fund selling HRG stock to meet redemptions, two outside investors, Leucadia National and Fortress Investment Group, built positions totaling 31 percent by mid-2014, gaining three board seats. And that paved the way for Mr. Falcone’s departure.In early 2014, HRG invested about $20 million for a 40 percent stake in HC2 as a new but smaller Falcone acquisition platform with a broader mandate that gave him more autonomy. Mr. Falcone said HRG directors “had lived through the issues with the S.E.C. and I think it created a little bit of tension and uneasiness with the board.” In order to expand HRG in the wider way he envisions for HC2, “I really would have had to push and battle.”

So Mr. Falcone turned his focus to HC2. Last November, he stepped down as HRG’s chief executive, reaping a $40 million exit payout. During his tenure, HRG stock’s price gain of 78 percent trailed broader market averages. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, for example, gained 135 percent over the same period.HC2 is now the stage for Falcone comeback No. 2.Last year, the company paid $260 million for Global Marine Systems, an undersea cable installer, and $85 million for the Schuff International steel fabrication business.Those companies are meant to generate cash to help fund the venture-stage growth bets. One such bet is American Natural Gas, a small chain of 10 truck fueling stations that sell compressed natural gas instead of diesel fuel.“We probably started off a little bit slow,” Mr. Falcone told investors in August, referring to American Natural Gas. “We’re going to make a big push in that area over the next six to 12 months.”But the risks can be seen in the steep 11 percent interest rate that HC2 is paying on its $300 million in junk-bond debt, and in its roller coaster stock action.Earlier this year, with HC2 stock still rising, Mr. Falcone sought to buy MCG Capital — a middle-market commercial finance company whose cash assets could have doubled HC2’s size — in a bid of mostly stock. MCG, however, spurned Mr. Falcone, choosing another suitor and raising the prospect of potential regulatory hurdles because of the S.E.C. case against him.Just then, with the takeover battle in full swing, HRG signaled that it had begun selling HC2 shares, sending the stock price sharply lower and cutting the value of the bid for MCG. As the stock fell, Mr. Falcone said the question arose why he wasn’t buying. On Aug. 14, MCG holders decisively rejected the Falcone bid.Although Mr. Falcone had been blocked from buying HC2 shares just then by a pre-earnings trading blackout, the issue of his HC2 stock ownership remains valid. Most of his holdings are in options, which he can earn under a performance formula tied to bolstering the company’s net-asset value.

While the latest HC2 proxy lists him as owning 2.4 million shares for an 8.9 percent stake, most of that count represents options he has not exercised. As of April 15, he owned only 565,951 shares outright, currently worth just $4.2 million.That means Mr. Falcone gains more if the stock rises than he loses if it drops. Trying to build HC2 quickly to reap such rewards could heighten the risk for other investors. But Mr. Frischer, the Seattle investor, said the upside from HC2’s speculative holdings “could be very high.”Explaining his small stake in HC2, Mr. Falcone said his money “is tied up,” with about one-third in his personal real estate holdings — estimated to be worth a few hundred million dollars — and much of the rest in his remaining stakes in the hedge fund and HRG. As a concession to his shrunken empire, this year he sold his minority stake in the Minnesota Wild professional hockey team.Mr. Falcone insists he is not going to rush things at HC2, calling the recent stock-price decline “a blip.”“From a logic perspective, I have to take my time, I can’t be flippant,” he said. “I’m looking to build value between now and 10 years from now. It doesn’t happen overnight.”

Former hedge fund billionaire Philip Falcone is selling his insane St. Barts estate for a cool $57.4 million.
The sprawling La Grande Maison des Etoiles estate has nine bedrooms and 10 ¹/₂ bathrooms, three swimming pools and sweeping ocean views. In the largest of the three pools is a glass pyramid that serves as the skylight for the state-of-the-art fitness room below.
And thanks to Falcone’s fashionista wife, Lisa Maria, five of the bedrooms are named for famous designers like Hermès and Christian Dior. The “Louis Vuitton” master suite has floor tiles arranged to resemble the designer’s logo stretching from the in-room pool area to the bathroom.
There’s also a caretaker cottage to house the staff.
Falcone bought the estate in Colombier’s exclusive gated area in 2008 for $39 million — a record at the time for the island favored by business titans and Hollywood celebs.
Lisa Maria told Page Six that they no longer spend much time at the estate. “We’re selling it because our twin girls are now 12, and because of school and their activities we only get to come here a few weeks a year. Plus, it needs a lot of upkeep and people keep asking to borrow it.”
The sale was first reported by the Caribbean Journal, which did not identify the owner.
Falcone ran as much as $26 billion at his hedge fund Harbinger Capital. He made his fortune shorting subprime mortgages in 2006 heading into the financial crisis.
In 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Falcone with securities fraud. He pleaded negligence and settled for $18 million, agreeing to a five-year ban from the securities industry, but admitting no wrongdoing.
He now runs HC2 Holdings, a publicly traded holding company.
The Falcones famously bought Penthouse founder Bob Guccione’s East 67th Street townhouse for $49 million in 2008 and completed an epic renovation, which included a pool, spa, gym, movie theater, giant walk-in wardrobe with a bar, and two elevators. They also considered installing heated sidewalks outside to avoid the inconvenience of shoveling snow.
The property is being offered exclusively by St. Barth Properties Sotheby’s International Realty.

Overview[edit]
Harbinger is a highly diversified multi-strategy hedge fund.[3] It has bet against sub-prime mortgages in the United States and the United Kingdom, including HBOS.[1][4] It is also a major investor in LightSquared, a troubled wireless communications company that filed bankruptcy in 2012, formerly known as SkyTerra Communications Inc.[5] Harbinger's $3.05 billion restructuring plan gives 74 percent of LightSquared to Cerberus Capital Management LP, Fortress Investment Group LLC and JPMorgan Chase & Co., leaving Falcone with 12.5 percent of the company's equity.[6] In March 2015, a judge approved Harbinger Capital's restructuring plan of LightSquared, which pays off lender Charlie Ergen, putting LightSquared in the hands of investors.[7]
In November 2014, Falcone announced his resignation as chief executive and chairman from Harbinger Group HRG, whose second biggest shareholder is Harbinger Capital. Falcone was paid a lump-sum of $40.3 million upon his resignation.[8][9]
In March 2015, the lawsuit accusing Falcone and Harbinger Capital Partners of "misleading investors about the firm's stake in LightSquared Inc." was dismissed.[10]
The firm's hedge funds include the Harbinger Capital Partners Master Fund, the Credit Distressed BlueLine Fund, and Harbinger Capital Partners Special Situations Fund.[11]
According to press accounts the assets under management at Harbinger peaked at $26 Billion in 2008 and had declined to approximately $9 Billion as of 2010 due to sizeable investor redemptions with approximately 40% of that total (approximately $3.5 Billion) concentrated in investments related to building a high-speed wireless network in the United States.[12]
History[edit]
Harbinger was founded in 2001[13] by its Senior Managing Director Philip Falcone and Harbert Management Corporation, a Birmingham, Alabama-based investment company that provided much of the original funding. Harbinger had funds under management of $26.5 billion (£13.4 billion) as of the end of June 2008.[14][15] In 2009, Harbinger acquired the ownership of its funds from Harbert, although Harbert handled administrative functions for Harbinger for a short transitional period. Also in 2009, Harbinger acquired controlling stock of the Zapata Corporation from the Glazer family and changed its name to The Harbinger Group Inc. (NYSE: HRG).[16] The hedge fund is based in New York, New York.[13]
Harbinger has owned large stakes in The New York Times Company, Cleveland-Cliffs, and 28% stock ownership of satellite communications company Inmarsat. The company has also owned stakes in rival satellite operators SkyTerra and Terrestar, and British sugar producer Tate & Lyle.[15]
In 2008, Harbinger Capital was ranked 19th on the Wall Street Journal's "The Hedge Fund 100" list, pulling in 23.85 percent in three-year annualized returns.[17] In 2009, Harbinger Capital was ranked 12th on the Wall Street Journal's "Top 100 Hedge Funds" list, pulling in 30.48 percent in three-year annualized returns.[18]
Harbinger Capital, which owned Russell Hobbs, merged it with Spectrum Brands on June 16, 2010 for $661 million and now controls approximately 64% of the appliance maker, Spectrum.
Top equity holdings[edit]
As of 2015, the top equity holdings of the firm were in the shares of the following companies: Spectrum Brands Inc, Harbinger Group Inc, North American Energy Partners Inc, and EXCO Resources Inc.[2]
SEC settlement[edit]
In August 2013, the firm reached a settlement with the SEC agreeing to pay more than $18 million and admit wrongdoing. As part of the settlement, Harbinger Senior Managing Director Philip Falcone was also barred from the securities industry for at least five years but did not prohibit him from working as an officer or director of a public company.[19] Among the SEC's multiple allegations were that Falcone misused fund assets and diverted fund assets for personal use, that the fund engaged in redemption and other practices that favored certain investors over others and that fund attempted to conduct an improper short squeeze on the bonds of Canadian manufacturing firm, partially in retaliation against a competitor investment firm. Harbinger and Falcone largely admitted to these allegations in the settlement.[20]
July 4, 2014, the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission's Office of the Whistleblower issued a "Final Order" in matter number 2012 -81[21] ruling that rejected a claim made by an individual requesting a reward for assisting in the investigation. The SEC rejected the claim, asserting in the "Claimant did not provide information that led to the successful enforcement" and denying the application.[22]

Overview[edit]
Harbinger is a highly diversified multi-strategy hedge fund.[3] It has bet against sub-prime mortgages in the United States and the United Kingdom, including HBOS.[1][4] It is also a major investor in LightSquared, a troubled wireless communications company that filed bankruptcy in 2012, formerly known as SkyTerra Communications Inc.[5] Harbinger's $3.05 billion restructuring plan gives 74 percent of LightSquared to Cerberus Capital Management LP, Fortress Investment Group LLC and JPMorgan Chase & Co., leaving Falcone with 12.5 percent of the company's equity.[6] In March 2015, a judge approved Harbinger Capital's restructuring plan of LightSquared, which pays off lender Charlie Ergen, putting LightSquared in the hands of investors.[7]
In November 2014, Falcone announced his resignation as chief executive and chairman from Harbinger Group HRG, whose second biggest shareholder is Harbinger Capital. Falcone was paid a lump-sum of $40.3 million upon his resignation.[8][9]
In March 2015, the lawsuit accusing Falcone and Harbinger Capital Partners of "misleading investors about the firm's stake in LightSquared Inc." was dismissed.[10]
The firm's hedge funds include the Harbinger Capital Partners Master Fund, the Credit Distressed BlueLine Fund, and Harbinger Capital Partners Special Situations Fund.[11]
According to press accounts the assets under management at Harbinger peaked at $26 Billion in 2008 and had declined to approximately $9 Billion as of 2010 due to sizeable investor redemptions with approximately 40% of that total (approximately $3.5 Billion) concentrated in investments related to building a high-speed wireless network in the United States.[12]
History[edit]
Harbinger was founded in 2001[13] by its Senior Managing Director Philip Falcone and Harbert Management Corporation, a Birmingham, Alabama-based investment company that provided much of the original funding. Harbinger had funds under management of $26.5 billion (£13.4 billion) as of the end of June 2008.[14][15] In 2009, Harbinger acquired the ownership of its funds from Harbert, although Harbert handled administrative functions for Harbinger for a short transitional period. Also in 2009, Harbinger acquired controlling stock of the Zapata Corporation from the Glazer family and changed its name to The Harbinger Group Inc. (NYSE: HRG).[16] The hedge fund is based in New York, New York.[13]
Harbinger has owned large stakes in The New York Times Company, Cleveland-Cliffs, and 28% stock ownership of satellite communications company Inmarsat. The company has also owned stakes in rival satellite operators SkyTerra and Terrestar, and British sugar producer Tate & Lyle.[15]
In 2008, Harbinger Capital was ranked 19th on the Wall Street Journal's "The Hedge Fund 100" list, pulling in 23.85 percent in three-year annualized returns.[17] In 2009, Harbinger Capital was ranked 12th on the Wall Street Journal's "Top 100 Hedge Funds" list, pulling in 30.48 percent in three-year annualized returns.[18]
Harbinger Capital, which owned Russell Hobbs, merged it with Spectrum Brands on June 16, 2010 for $661 million and now controls approximately 64% of the appliance maker, Spectrum.
Top equity holdings[edit]
As of 2015, the top equity holdings of the firm were in the shares of the following companies: Spectrum Brands Inc, Harbinger Group Inc, North American Energy Partners Inc, and EXCO Resources Inc.[2]
SEC settlement[edit]
In August 2013, the firm reached a settlement with the SEC agreeing to pay more than $18 million and admit wrongdoing. As part of the settlement, Harbinger Senior Managing Director Philip Falcone was also barred from the securities industry for at least five years but did not prohibit him from working as an officer or director of a public company.[19] Among the SEC's multiple allegations were that Falcone misused fund assets and diverted fund assets for personal use, that the fund engaged in redemption and other practices that favored certain investors over others and that fund attempted to conduct an improper short squeeze on the bonds of Canadian manufacturing firm, partially in retaliation against a competitor investment firm. Harbinger and Falcone largely admitted to these allegations in the settlement.[20]
July 4, 2014, the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission's Office of the Whistleblower issued a "Final Order" in matter number 2012 -81[21] ruling that rejected a claim made by an individual requesting a reward for assisting in the investigation. The SEC rejected the claim, asserting in the "Claimant did not provide information that led to the successful enforcement" and denying the application.[22]
