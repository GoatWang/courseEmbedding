WHO WE ARE
SUPPLY CHAIN
CLINICAL PERFORMANCE
WORKFORCE


Much more than a traditional GPO
Our legacy committed model is just the beginning.  While other GPOs are trying to align regional scale and market compliance, we are delivering on the pillars of total spend management.  Our esteemed membership and national purchasing power provides unrivaled price advantage on supplies.  And our accountability – including service line leadership, shared services experience, physician engagement and innovative pilots – provides industry leading benchmarks and best practices from the nation’s leading health systems.  This “operator advantage” informs every assessment and recommendation we make. Our inSight Advisory team is the differentiator in guiding and implementing performance improvement in cost, quality and outcomes.


Lowering the Cost of Care Delivery
Our “speed to scale” is a game-changer.  Five HealthTrust members represent approximately $20B in supply spend – a scale that is unmatched by the top 25 accounts of our competitors – IF they were aligned.  The result is market-leading pricing on clinically-approved products in exchange for a committed market share that other GPOs simply cannot match.   That alignment assures a SUSTAINABLE price advantage – meaning year-over year price improvement as we refresh the portfolio.  Gone are the days of forecasting and budgeting supply-cost escalation due to annual category price increases.   Our price advantage extends to all classes of trade via AdvantageTrust (non-acute GPO) and CoreTrust (non-healthcare GPO).  And our “operator advantage” does too, covering pharmacy, food service, facilities, energy, HR, I.T. even the hidden supply cache in the operating room.
Learn More


Redefining the Value Equation
Value-based care requires data and thoughtful clinical evaluation of new technologies and practice variation.  InSight Advisory provides the analytics, champions the initiatives and drives the results through engagement with physicians and operators. Cost savings initiatives sometimes “get lost on the way to the P&L.”   A robust value analysis process, clinical collaboration and operating discipline assure the alignment that is critical to thriving  under reimbursement systems that reward both lower costs and higher quality.
Learn More


Proven Workforce Management Solutions
With labor costs representing the single largest expenditure and not enough qualified healthcare professionals to meet ever-increasing demand, it is no surprise that hospitals cite their workforce as their greatest asset and challenge.
Built upon a rich hospital operator legacy, HealthTrust utilizes proven practices to enhance patient and employee satisfaction, optimize labor productivity and manage labor costs.
We are your strategic partner, offering customized workforce solutions ranging from forecasting and productivity benchmarking to physician recruiting, nurse staffing, and innovative nurse training programs designed to close skill and experience gaps.

Risk Factors
Our potential risks and uncertainties are presented in the section titled âItem 1A. Risk Factorsâ disclosed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following are some of the risks and uncertainties, although not all risks and uncertainties, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those presented in our forward-looking statements:


 Certain of our executive officers and directors are also officers, managers or holders of a direct or indirect controlling interest in Healthcare Trust Advisors, LLC (our "Advisor") and other entities affiliated with AR Global Investments, LLC (the successor business to AR Capital, LLC, "AR Global"), the parent of our sponsor, American Realty Capital VII, LLC (the "Sponsor"). As a result, certain of our executive officers and directors, our Advisor and its affiliates face conflicts of interest, including significant conflicts created by our Advisor's compensation arrangements with us and other investment programs advised by affiliates of AR Global and conflicts in allocating time among these investment programs and us. These conflicts could result in unanticipated actions that adversely affect us.
 Because investment opportunities that are suitable for us may also be suitable for other investment programs advised by affiliates of AR Global, our Advisor and its affiliates face conflicts of interest relating to the purchase of properties and other investments and such conflicts may not be resolved in our favor, meaning that we could invest in less attractive assets, which could reduce the investment return to our stockholders.
 Although we intend to seek a listing of our shares of common stock on a national stock exchange when we believe market conditions are favorable to do so, there is no assurance that our shares of common stock will be listed. No public market currently exists, or may ever exist, for shares of our common stock and our shares are, and may continue to be, illiquid.
 We focus on acquiring and owning a diversified portfolio of healthcare-related assets located in the United States and are subject to risks inherent in concentrating investments in the healthcare industry.
 If our Advisor loses or is unable to obtain qualified personnel, our ability to continue to achieve our investment strategies could be delayed or hindered.
 The healthcare industry is heavily regulated, and new laws or regulations, changes to existing laws or regulations, loss of licensure or failure to obtain licensure could result in the inability of tenants to make lease payments to us. 
 We are depending on our Advisor to select investments and conduct our operations. Adverse changes in the financial condition of our Advisor and its affiliates or our relationship with our Advisor could adversely affect us.
 We may be unable to fund distributions from cash flows from operations, or maintain cash distributions or increase distributions over time.
 We are obligated to pay fees, which may be substantial, to our Advisor and its affiliates.
 We depend on tenants for our revenue and, accordingly, our revenue is dependent upon the success and economic viability of our tenants.
 We may not be able to achieve our rental rate objectives on new and renewal leases and our expenses could be greater, which may impact our results of operations.
 Increases in interest rates could increase the amount of our debt payments and limit our ability to pay distributions.
 Any distributions, especially those not covered by our cash flows from operations, may reduce the amount of capital available for other purposes included investment in properties and other permitted investments and may negatively impact the value of our stockholders' investment.
 We have not and may not in the future generate cash flows sufficient to pay our distributions to stockholders and, as such, we may be required to fund distributions from borrowings, which may be at unfavorable rates and could restrict the amount we can borrow for investments and other purposes, or depend on our Advisor or our property manager, Healthcare Trust Properties, LLC (the "Property Manager") to waive fees or reimbursement of certain expenses and fees to fund our operations. There is no assurance these entities will waive such amounts or that we will be able to borrow funds at all.
 We are subject to risks associated with any dislocations or liquidity disruptions that may exist or occur in the credit markets of the United States from time to time.
 We are subject to risks associated with changes in general economic, business and political conditions including the possibility of intensified international hostilities, acts of terrorism, and changes in conditions of United States or international lending, capital and financing markets.
 We may fail to continue to qualify to be treated as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes ("REIT"), which would result in higher taxes, may adversely affect our operations and would reduce the value of an investment in our common stock and the cash available for distributions.
 We may be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Investment Company Act"), and thus subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act.
 The offering price and repurchase price for our shares, including shares sold pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan ("DRIP") may not, among other things, accurately reflect the value of our assets and may not represent what a stockholder may receive on a sale of the shares, what they may receive upon a liquidation of our assets and distribution of the net proceeds or what a third party may pay to acquire the Company.

About Healthcare Trust of America, Inc.
Healthcare Trust of America, Inc. (NYSE: HTA) is a publicly traded real estate investment trust that acquires, owns and operates medical office buildings. Since 2006, the company has invested over $6.8 billion in medical office buildings and other healthcare assets comprising more than 24 million square feet across 31 states.
HTA invests in key markets with above average growth and healthcare infrastructure that is capable of servicing long-term patient demand. Within each key market, HTA focuses on acquiring medical office buildings on health system campuses, in community-core locations, or near university medical centers. The portfolio consists of medical office buildings that are core-critical, a key part of the integrated delivery of healthcare, and that continue to complement the company's institutional asset management and leasing platform. HTA's business strategy is defined by establishing critical mass within key markets which allows HTA's asset management and in-house leasing platform to drive earnings growth, capitalize on synergies and maximize expense efficiencies, and build lasting tenant relationships which leads to retention, rent growth and long-term value creation across the portfolio.
Founded more than a decade ago in 2006, HTA has a consistent track record of generating stockholder returns that we believe have outperformed, the RMZ, S&P 500, and our direct MOB Peer. HTA listed its shares on the York Stock Exchange in June of 2012.

NEW YORK, April 22, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Healthcare Trust, Inc. ("HTI" or the "Company"), a publicly registered, non-traded real estate investment trust, today announced that the Company's Board of Directors, led by its independent directors, has initiated a strategic review process to identify, examine, and consider a range of strategic alternatives available to the Company with the objective of maximizing shareholder value. 
The Board of Directors has undertaken the following actions:



The independent directors are leading the review of strategic alternatives and a special committee has been formed to address potential conflicts of interest. 
The Board of Directors is in the process of engaging a leading real estate investment banking group as financial advisor. 
The Board of Directors has retained Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP as special legal counsel in connection with such strategic review process. 
"The steps we are taking represent our commitment to maximize value to our shareholders over the long term," said Randolph Read, Chairman of the Board. 
The Board of Directors has not made a decision to enter into any transaction at this time, and there are no assurances that the consideration of strategic alternatives will result in any transaction.  HTI does not intend to comment on or disclose developments regarding the process unless it deems further disclosure is appropriate or required.

What Our Customers Are Saying



“OraMD is 100% natural and the real benefit to patients is that it not only kills bacteria, but can replace toothpaste, mouthwash, and even breath fresheners. As a leading authority on dental wellness, I highly recommend OraMD. I can assure you, that if you use this natural product and follow the oral hygiene program in my book, you’ll see significant improvements in your oral health. OraMD is the only oral care product I endorse.”
-Dr. Tom McGuire, DDS
Best Selling Author and
World’s Leading Authority on Preventive Dentistry



 “As a woman in my late thirties, I have been using facial skin care products for 25+ years. As Mrs. U.S. of A Globe 2005 and Mrs. Kentucky 2009 I was frustrated with other skin products. I wanted my skin to best the it could possibly be, but often battled dryness, breakouts, hyperpigmentation, etc. Since using Amazingly Beautiful, everything has changed for the better! When I wear make-up it now glides and blends over my skin instead of sitting on top of my skin like a mask. In fact, my skin looks so much better with Amazingly Beautiful that I don’t need to wear as much makeup and often go without makeup entirely. I use only 2 skincare products – the Amazingly Beautiful AM Moisturizer and the Amazingly Beautiful PM Revitalizer.”
