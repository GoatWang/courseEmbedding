MV Agusta Recapitalizes With Help From Russian Investment Fund




Giovanni Castiglioni will continue to control MV Agusta through a holding company partly owned by ComSar Invest.  ComSar Invest is wholly owned by Black Ocean Group, which is controlled by Timur Sardarov.  Sardarov is described in the following press release as a “Russian Dynasty Key Player in the production of oil and gas in East Europe.”
Here is a press release from MV Agusta describing its recapitalization:
Varese, July 24th 2017 – MV Agusta Holding consolidates its equity investment through ComSar Invest; an investment fund part of Black Ocean Group, owned by Timur Sardarov, a Russian dynasty key player in the production of oil and gas in East Europe.
Along with the transaction, MV Agusta Holding announces the purchase of the 25% shares held by Mercedes AMG in the historic Italian motorcycle manufacturer MV Agusta Motor S.p.A.. The closing of the deal, whose financial terms are not disclosed, is set simultaneously to the capital increase of MV Agusta Holding in MV Agusta Motor S.p.A. expected at homologation of the company restructuring plan, which has been approved by the quorum of the creditors.
The new shareholding structure of MV  Agusta  Holding,  which  will  control  100%  of MV Agusta Motor S.p.A., will see ComSar Invest as a strong minority shareholder and GC Holding, the investment company of Giovanni Castiglioni, owning the controlling stake.
The finalization of the transaction adds another important element to MV Agusta deep turnaround plan started in 2016, based on the repositioning of the MV Agusta as a prime producer of super premium motorcycles, that brought the company back to positive Ebitda.
Giovanni Castiglioni, President of MV Agusta, commented: “The transaction with ComSar Invest in our holding company through a capital increase and the acquisition of the shares previously held by Mercedes AMG in MV Agusta Motor S.p.A., represents an important milestone for our plan which has as a main objective the reinforcement of MV Agusta core business: the production of high-performance, high end motorcycles. In the last 12 months the implemented measures, has brought MV Agusta back in positive cash flow generation, allowing to complete the restructuring plan and to consistently support product development and consolidation of our key markets.”
Timur Sardarov, controlling shareholder of ComSar Invest: “MV Agusta is for us the most iconic brand in the industry; a company that in the last 5 years has invested heavily in new product development creating a extensive, enviable range of motorcycles which results today is a unique asset for a successful future. Our presence in the capital, with a clear long-term vision, as well as in the key management of the company, has the objective, through our core competences and skills to support and strengthen MV Agusta in the coming years consolidating its position of super premium motorcycle producer. We will focus our funding to reinforce MV Agusta sales network and service and our knowledge in the technology fields, web and marketing to reach and enhance new markets, strengthen our digital and social presence enlarging MV Agusta’s  consumer base.”

MV makes some jaw droppingly gorgeous bikes for sure. I definitely wish them well, but MV and Ducati have a tough road ahead of them now that all the Japanese OEMs and BMW are into the race-replica, super-premium sportbike thing too.

Read moreAMG Funds – Why Work For Us?Why Work For Us?About UsProductsClients About Us Products ClientsEstablished in 2005, AMG Funds provides access to many of AMG’s Affiliates through our family of mutual funds, separately managed accounts and asset allocation products. In addition, AMG Funds oversees and distributes a number of complementary, open-architecture mutual funds managed by non-AMG Affiliates. This broad combination of investment products allows us to serve the needs of the financial advisor community and their clients.AMG seeks to achieve earnings growth by investing in high quality boutique asset management firms that have demonstrated a consistent ability to deliver excellent returns over the long term and potential for significant future growth. Our unique partnership approach creates powerful incentives for continued strong performance by providing Affiliate management with direct equity participation in their firms alongside AMG. In our investments in each of our Affiliates, we hold a substantial equity interest while the remaining equity interests are retained by the management of the Affiliate. This strategy provides a degree of liquidity and diversification to principal owners of boutique firms, and also addresses the succession and ownership transition issues facing many founders and principal owners. AMG’s structure ensures that Affiliates maintain operational autonomy in managing their businesses – an approach that also preserves each Affiliate’s entrepreneurial culture and distinct investment process. With meaningful equity stakes in their firms, AMG’s Affiliate partners operate strong and profitable investment firms with the objective of managing their businesses to produce long-term growth.Although we invest in firms that we expect to be successful in their own right, we are committed to helping Affiliates identify opportunities for further growth and leverage the benefits of economies of scale. These cross-Affiliate initiatives include broadening distribution in the U.S. and globally, developing new products and providing strategic support and enhanced operational capabilities.Since our founding, AMG has created shareholder value by successfully making equity investments in industry-leading boutique firms and leveraging our scale to support and enhance their growth.Read moreAMG’s Affiliates are among the leading investors in their disciplines with outstanding reputations, superior client service, and excellent track records of outperformance relative to their peers and benchmarks across a wide range of investment styles, asset classes and geographic areas.  As a group, AMG’s Affiliates manage approximately 400 investment products across each major product category: global, international and emerging markets equities, domestic equities, alternative and fixed income products.  We predominantly offer active portfolio management of international and domestic equities from some of the industry’s most respected investment firms, including AQR Capital Management, BlueMountain Capital Management, First Quadrant, Genesis Asset Managers, Harding Loevner, Third Avenue Management and Tweedy, Browne Company.Our diverse array of products enables AMG to participate broadly in the most attractive segments of the investment management industry, while generating incremental growth by introducing Affiliate products into additional distribution channels.Read moreInstitutional Investors AMG offers a diverse array of high-quality products to institutional investors worldwide, serving clients in nearly 40 countries. Through our Affiliates, we manage assets for foundations and endowments, defined benefit and defined contribution plans for corporations and municipalities, and Taft-Hartley plans, with disciplined and focused investment styles that address the specialized needs of institutional clients. The depth and breadth of our products reflects the diversity of AMG’s Affiliate group and the strength of our multi-boutique model. As institutional investors increasingly seek actively-managed products, our distribution platforms help meet the global demand for boutique asset managers.

Click a fund name to view that fund's detailed performance information.
The performance shown represents past performance and is not a guarantee of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. The investment return and the principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. From time to time the advisor has waived fees or reimbursed expenses, which may have resulted in higher returns. The listed returns and yields on the Fund are net of expenses. Performance shown does not include applicable front-end or CDSC sales charges, or redemption fees, which would have reduced the performance.
Morningstar rating as of June 30, 2017. 
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five- and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.
Morningstar Rating is for the share class indicated only (see ticker); other share classes may have different performance characteristics. The Ranking may reflect the waiver of all or a portion of the fund's fees. Without such waiver, the Rankings may have been lower. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
