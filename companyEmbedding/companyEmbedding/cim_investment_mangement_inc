Our approach

Leaders of small and mid-sized businesses have multiple roles and competing priorities. You want a best-in-class retirement plan but may be unsure about all the complexities and requirements. You may be uncertain about the costs and fees involved. You need a provider focused solely on retirement and aligned with your needs and goals—and fully committed to you, your participants, and the ongoing improvement of retirement investing.

Vanguard is committed to the retirement business and is a leader in the retirement plan industry. Best of all, you can benefit from Vanguard's unique ownership structure: We're owned by our clients and not by outside investors or stockholders. That means you never need to question whose interests come first for us. This approach serves as a foundation for all that we do with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access™, our 401(k) offer for small and mid-sized plans. You can count on our expertise to remove the uncertainties from managing your plan and our leadership to help you offer a strong plan for your participants. 



Key benefits




You can:

Have confidence in your plan.
Understand your costs.
Focus on your business.





Cost-conscious?
As a business owner and plan fiduciary, you want to eliminate ambiguity in retirement plan costs. Research has shown that plan costs for the smaller end of the market tend to be higher, and you need a retirement plan provider that not only provides transparent pricing but has a fair and reasonable cost structure.1
With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access:

You receive an All-in Fee Report that shows the total cost of your plan.
You have access to low-cost Vanguard index funds, plus the opportunity to choose from among more than 12,000 non-Vanguard funds.
Your annual recordkeeping price is based on a per-participant fee—a fee that doesn't jump as your assets grow, as with many small to mid-sized retirement plans.
You have flexibility in how you cover your plan costs—including a recordkeeping credit depending on the share class selected.




Too busy?
 As a business owner, you're pressed for time and focused on many aspects of business. With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, you can rely on high-quality recordkeeping and administration to ease your administrative burden and help your employees stay on track for retirement.

Advisory services
Many organizations like yours find it challenging to oversee their portfolio while also managing the day-to-day responsibilities of running their endowment, foundation, or charitable organization. But partnering with a provider who understands your needs can help you better balance these competing priorities.
Partnering with your organization
Vanguard Institutional Advisory Services® (VIAS) offers nonprofits the considerable resources of a large investment firm like Vanguard with the customized service of a specialized boutique. When your organization partners with VIAS, you work with a team of investment professionals that has your objectives and fiduciary responsibilities in mind. VIAS strives to:

Understand your organization's mission, spending needs, and unique situation and offer sophisticated, unbiased advice.
Develop a low-cost portfolio customized to your organization's needs.
Relieve your staff of many of the day-to-day burdens of investment program management.

OCIO: One service, many names


One approach nonprofits are increasingly considering is an outsourced chief investment officer (OCIO). An OCIO service—which is a key offering of Vanguard Institutional Advisory Services—acts as an extension of the board and investment staff. The OCIO determines an asset allocation strategy, selects investment advisors to implement it, and manages its operation and execution. Investment providers and clients call this service a variety of names, including discretionary management, advisory services, and investment management.





Investing and advising
Optimizing your portfolio to meet your long-term investment objectives requires time and skill. VIAS helps you develop a tailored portfolio that ensures your investments are diversified, risk-appropriate, and aligned with your overall strategy.
Our comprehensive advisory services include:









Portfolio construction 

Asset allocation analysis that uses a distinct, proprietary model to deliver solutions based on your portfolio needs.
Investment policy consulting designed to meet the unique investment goals of your organization.
Customized product selection that focuses on low-cost index and active investments.











Portfolio management

Performance reporting to help keep your investment committee informed.
Investment reviews that provide insights into your portfolio and the broader market and economic environment.
Steadfast commitment to risk management and process excellence through ongoing portfolio monitoring and rebalancing.








Research & expertise

Investment expertise and commentary on financial issues that provide context for your decision-making.
Investment committee best practices that are designed to increase your group's effectiveness.





Notes:

Advice services offered through Vanguard Institutional Advisory Services are provided by Vanguard Advisers, Inc., a registered investment advisor.
All investments are subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. 
Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market.

Enduring. Holistic.Defendable. Vanguard Target Retirement Funds










 



Not all target-date funds are created equal.™ 






Our infographic can help you evaluate your target-date fund (TDF) strategy. It includes three steps that focus on TDF costs, stability, and investor focus.                                 Learn more.






















Target-date strategies
Selecting a target-date fund (TDF) series for your qualified default investment alternative can be a critical step in designing a defined contribution (DC) retirement plan that can stand up to the scrutiny from many quarters, including regulators.

Vanguard Target Retirement Funds offer a sophisticated design and a clear, straightforward glide path that's a natural fit for autoenrollment and default investment programs—a TDF strategy that can help lower your fiduciary risk and help improve the odds of your plan participants achieving their retirement goals.



Fiduciaries value not only the sophisticated methodology behind the Vanguard Target Retirement portfolio, but also the clarity of the glide path, index implementation, and high degree of transparency.
John Croke
Target Retirement Fund Product Manager










Enduring investment solution
With Vanguard, you'll have a target-date retirement solution that is implemented with a well-diversified set of market-cap-weighted index funds. The embedded diversification of this approach provides balance against the markets‘ natural ups and downs.





Reaching goals through a holistic approach
Vanguard's target-date funds are designed by investment, plan design, and participant behavior experts. This integrated approach puts participants at the heart of your target-date offering so you can have confidence that your target-date offering can help your participants reach their retirement goals.





Defendable performance year after year
The combination of consistent, prudent product oversight and our history of reducing costs help you deliver defensible performance to investment committees and plan participants year after year.


Sophisticated portfolio construction
The Target Retirement Funds are designed by Vanguard's respected investment managers and asset allocation experts and are grounded in ongoing, cross-disciplinary research. The glide path reflects a long-term, holistic view of retirement investing.



MORE ABOUT TARGET-DATE STRATEGIES
Research & commentary

* Vanguard Target Retirement Funds offer the simplicity of an index-oriented, well-diversified portfolio that is strategic and straightforward in its approach. The funds are composed of five underlying index funds and follow an easy-to-understand asset allocation glide path. Underlying this simplicity is Vanguard's deep investment expertise, knowledge of the capital markets, and insights into participant behavior.
Investments in Target Retirement Funds are subject to the risks of their underlying funds. The year in the fund name refers to the approximate year (the target date) when an investor in the fund would retire and leave the workforce. The fund will gradually shift its emphasis from more aggressive investments (stocks) to more conservative ones (bonds and short-term reserves) based on its
                   target date. An investment in a Target Retirement Fund is not guaranteed at any time, including on or after the target date.
              
All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest.
Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.
There is no guarantee that any particular asset allocation or mix of funds will meet your investment objectives or provide you with a given level of income.

CIM Investment Management, Inc.  Investment Philosophy   

Balanced     |   
			Fixed    |   
			Equity   
 
Balanced 
			Account Investment Philosophy     

We believe that a well diversified, conservatively managed 
			portfolio consisting of multiple asset classes will, over time, 
			produce reasonable investment returns.   

Our focus is on achieving long-term results; we avoid market 
			timing and short-term trading.   
Asset allocation is customized to each client’s requirements and 
			is based on long-term or secular trends.   
Value is added through multiple strategies including allocation, 
			sector emphasis and security selection.   

Fixed Income 
			Account Investment Philosophy   
We believe that Fixed Income is a relatively conservative asset 
			class that over time outperforms cash and inflation but with 
			substantially less volatility and risk than equities.   

Our focus is on high quality - we do not buy below investment 
			grade.   
Portfolios are diversified across sectors.  We utilize treasury, 
			agency, CMBS, corporate and pass-through MBS securities.   
Value is added through sector emphasis, duration adjustments, 
			yield curve positioning and security selection.   

Equity 
			Account Investment Philosophy   
We actively manage Large Cap Core, Small Cap Core, Large Cap 
			Value and Large Cap Growth equity products based on each client’s 
			requirements.   

Our style involves a conservative approach that minimizes 
			portfolio tracking error versus the benchmark.   
Sector and industry analysis is utilized to provide opportunities 
			for additional return above the benchmark.   
Security selection involves earnings growth, price momentum and 
			other favorable fundamental and technical factors.

The information contained in this website is intended for:

(i)	persons to whom CIM may promote unregulated investment schemes under (a) the Financial Services and Markets Act (Promotion of Collective Investment Schemes) (Exemptions) Order 2001; (b) COBS 4.12 of the Financial Services Authority Handbook; and

(ii)	only to persons located in a jurisdiction where the funds referred to herein are registered or approved for marketing and/or sale or in which the dissemination of information on the funds or services is permitted under applicable law or regulations and would not subject CIM to any registration or licencing requirements in such jurisdiction ("Qualified Investors").

It is for information purposes only and does not constitute an offer by CIM to enter into any contract/agreement nor is it a solicitation to buy or sell any investment. The information below explains the legal and regulatory restrictions in relation to accessing the CIM website. Please read it carefully. If you accept the terms below and wish to enter the website this page constitutes a binding legal agreement.

This page is designed to filter out unsuitable categories of investor from accessing the website and as such CIM cannot be responsible for any misrepresentations you may make in gaining unauthorised access to the website.

These Terms may be amended without notice to you. Your continued use of the website following any changes will constitute acceptance of such changes.

Regulatory Disclosures

CIM is authorised and regulated by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA Firm Reference Number 443440). Most if not all of the protections provided by the United Kingdom regulatory structure including access to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme and the Financial Ombudsman Service will not apply to investments in the funds detailed within this website. CIM Dividend Income Fund Limited, CIM Dividend Income Holdings Fund Limited and, CIM Discovery Fund Limited are unregulated collective investment schemes which are not recognised schemes under s.264 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. However, these funds are registered with the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK and are therefore available to professional investors based in the UK.

No information on this website has been included with regard to any individual's circumstances, objectives, or needs and each individual must make his own independent decisions regarding any investment decisions in relation to the funds detailed within this website. Potential investors should not rely on any of the content of this website in making any investment decision. Potential investors should read the relevant offering materials of the funds carefully before any investment decision is made.

Before taking any investment decision , each individual is urged to consider the suitability of the transaction to his particular circumstances and to review independently, with professional advisors as necessary, the specific risks incurred, in particular the financial, regulatory, and tax aspects.
Capital Requirements Directive ("CRD") - Pillar 3 Disclosures
The Pillar 3 disclosures of CIM as required by the FSA Prudential Sourcebook for Banks, Building Societies and Investment Firms (BIPRU) Chapter 11 - Disclosure (Pillar 3) have been provided in the annual report of CIM.

Content of Website

By proceeding you agree, so far as this is permitted under the provisions of any applicable laws or regulations, to the exclusion by us of any liability, including without limitation that arising from any loss of profit or any other damage direct, indirect or consequential, in respect of any errors and/or omissions by CIM and/or any relevant third parties in respect of the content of this website. The contents of this website are based upon sources of information believed to be reliable, however, save to the extent required by applicable law or regulations, no guarantee, warranty or representation (express or implied) is given as to its accuracy, reliability or completeness and, CIM, its members, officers and employees do not accept any liability or responsibility in respect of the information or any views expressed herein.

This website may include forward-looking statements that are based upon our current opinions, expectations and projections. CIM undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.

Investment Risk

There are significant risks associated with investment in the funds outlined in the website. Investment in the unregulated schemes on this website is intended for sophisticated investors who can accept the risks associated with such an investment including a substantial or complete loss of their investment. Such schemes are permitted to and sometimes use gearing as an investment strategy. The effect of such gearing is that movements in the net asset value per share in the schemes will be more volatile than the movements in the prices of their underlying investments.  Past performance is not a guide to future performance. The value of investments and any income derived from them can go down as well as up and the value of an investor's investment may be extremely volatile and be subject to sudden and substantial falls. The prices of commodities contracts and all derivatives instruments, including futures and options, are highly volatile. Certain investment positions may be illiquid. The Funds may invest in securities of financially troubled companies, illiquid over-the-counter securities and non-publicly traded securities.
Investment in emerging market funds involves risk factors and special considerations which may not be typically associated with investing in more developed markets. Political or economic change and instability may be more likely to occur and have a greater effect on the economies and markets of emerging countries. Adverse government policies, taxation, restrictions on foreign investment and on currency convertibility and repatriation, currency fluctuations and other developments in the laws and regulations of emerging countries in which investment may be made, including expropriation, nationalisation or other confiscation could result in loss to the fund.

Income from investments may fluctuate. Changes in rates of exchange may have an adverse effect on the value, price or income of investments. You should be aware that investments in higher yielding bonds issued by borrowers with lower credit ratings may result in a greater risk of default and have a negative impact on income and capital value. Income payments may constitute a return of capital in whole or in part. Income may be achieved by foregoing future capital growth. Fund charges may be applied in whole or part to capital, which may result in capital erosion. The funds are not traded on an exchange or recognised market and in common with some of their investments may not be readily realisable. This factor can make it difficult to obtain independent verification of the investment value and the extent of the risks to which they are exposed. Investors should be fully aware of the restrictions on transfer of investments.

The foregoing list of risk factors is not complete and reference should be made to the relevant fund's offering memorandum.

Solicitation

The website does not constitute an offer by CIM to enter into any contract/ agreement nor is it a solicitation to buy or sell any investment. It should not be used for the purpose of an offer or solicitation in any jurisdiction or in any circumstances in which such offer or solicitation is unlawful or not authorised. This UK website is not directed at or intended for distribution to any persons who are residents of any country, including the United States of America ("USA") and South Africa, where the funds referred to herein are not registered or approved for marketing and/or sale or in which the dissemination of information on the funds or services is contrary to applicable law or regulations or would subject CIM to any registration or licencing requirements in such jurisdiction. Persons who wish to access this website are required to inform themselves about and to observe any legal or regulatory restrictions which may affect their eligibility to access the website or to subscribe for interests in the funds.
Any information on this website should not be distributed to any third party without the express approval of CIM.

United States of America

The provision of the information in this web website does not constitute an offer of securities to any person in the United States or to any U.S. Person as such term is defined under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The information contained in this website about CIM and/or any of its affiliates is not directed to any person in the United States.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Dassault Systemes SA (OTCMKTS:DASTY) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 3.00)Consensus Price Target: N/A

Our approach

Leaders of small and mid-sized businesses have multiple roles and competing priorities. You want a best-in-class retirement plan but may be unsure about all the complexities and requirements. You may be uncertain about the costs and fees involved. You need a provider focused solely on retirement and aligned with your needs and goals—and fully committed to you, your participants, and the ongoing improvement of retirement investing.

Vanguard is committed to the retirement business and is a leader in the retirement plan industry. Best of all, you can benefit from Vanguard's unique ownership structure: We're owned by our clients and not by outside investors or stockholders. That means you never need to question whose interests come first for us. This approach serves as a foundation for all that we do with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access™, our 401(k) offer for small and mid-sized plans. You can count on our expertise to remove the uncertainties from managing your plan and our leadership to help you offer a strong plan for your participants. 



Key benefits




You can:

Have confidence in your plan.
Understand your costs.
Focus on your business.





Cost-conscious?
As a business owner and plan fiduciary, you want to eliminate ambiguity in retirement plan costs. Research has shown that plan costs for the smaller end of the market tend to be higher, and you need a retirement plan provider that not only provides transparent pricing but has a fair and reasonable cost structure.1
With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access:

You receive an All-in Fee Report that shows the total cost of your plan.
You have access to low-cost Vanguard index funds, plus the opportunity to choose from among more than 12,000 non-Vanguard funds.
Your annual recordkeeping price is based on a per-participant fee—a fee that doesn't jump as your assets grow, as with many small to mid-sized retirement plans.
You have flexibility in how you cover your plan costs—including a recordkeeping credit depending on the share class selected.




Too busy?
 As a business owner, you're pressed for time and focused on many aspects of business. With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, you can rely on high-quality recordkeeping and administration to ease your administrative burden and help your employees stay on track for retirement.

OCIO: One service, many names


One approach nonprofits are increasingly considering is an outsourced chief investment officer (OCIO). An OCIO service—which is a key offering of Vanguard Institutional Advisory Services—acts as an extension of the board and investment staff. The OCIO determines an asset allocation strategy, selects investment advisors to implement it, and manages its operation and execution. Investment providers and clients call this service a variety of names, including discretionary management, advisory services, and investment management.

Enduring. Holistic.Defendable. Vanguard Target Retirement Funds










 



Not all target-date funds are created equal.™ 






Our infographic can help you evaluate your target-date fund (TDF) strategy. It includes three steps that focus on TDF costs, stability, and investor focus.                                 Learn more.






















Target-date strategies
Selecting a target-date fund (TDF) series for your qualified default investment alternative can be a critical step in designing a defined contribution (DC) retirement plan that can stand up to the scrutiny from many quarters, including regulators.

Vanguard Target Retirement Funds offer a sophisticated design and a clear, straightforward glide path that's a natural fit for autoenrollment and default investment programs—a TDF strategy that can help lower your fiduciary risk and help improve the odds of your plan participants achieving their retirement goals.



Fiduciaries value not only the sophisticated methodology behind the Vanguard Target Retirement portfolio, but also the clarity of the glide path, index implementation, and high degree of transparency.
John Croke
Target Retirement Fund Product Manager

MORE ABOUT TARGET-DATE STRATEGIES
Research & commentary

* Vanguard Target Retirement Funds offer the simplicity of an index-oriented, well-diversified portfolio that is strategic and straightforward in its approach. The funds are composed of five underlying index funds and follow an easy-to-understand asset allocation glide path. Underlying this simplicity is Vanguard's deep investment expertise, knowledge of the capital markets, and insights into participant behavior.
Investments in Target Retirement Funds are subject to the risks of their underlying funds. The year in the fund name refers to the approximate year (the target date) when an investor in the fund would retire and leave the workforce. The fund will gradually shift its emphasis from more aggressive investments (stocks) to more conservative ones (bonds and short-term reserves) based on its
                   target date. An investment in a Target Retirement Fund is not guaranteed at any time, including on or after the target date.
              
All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest.
Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.
There is no guarantee that any particular asset allocation or mix of funds will meet your investment objectives or provide you with a given level of income.
