The fund will be professionally managed in the Valley, which could be an incentive for firms to relocate to the area, said Dave Nestic, chief executive of regional operations of TBEIC.“This would be an extremely good thing for the Mahoning Valley,” he said.YBI mainly works with software and additive- manufacturing startups, whereas TBEIC works with energy startups. But both have a lot of opportunities to bring to the fund.“We’re both bringing deal flow to the table,” Nestic said.The fund also will be proposed to receive state dollars from the Ohio Third Frontier program in mid-September, which would match investor dollars.“Things are just getting started,” he said.Knight said the fund as an entity will move forward regardless of whether it will receive state money.Other stories of interestYoungstown council OKs management deals for Covelli, amphitheaterPenn National reports second-quarter earningsUS indexes fall off record highsDriver killed in crash after air-bag inflator rupturesDon't Miss a StorySign up for our newsletter to receive daily news directly in your inbox.Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.NewsDigital EditionLocal & RegionalNational & WorldBusiness & TechFrackingPR NewswirePoliticsGovernment WatchSocietyEducationValley FoodOutdoorsVindy Talk RadioHealth & HomeReligionTravelWeatherOakhillNewslettersOpinionOpinionHow We See ItLettersBertram de SouzaTodd FrankoDavid SkolnickErnie BrownLouie FreeYears AgoSubmit a letterEntertainmentEntertainment NewsEntertaining ThoughtsValley24Movie ListingsSportsLocalBlitz High School FootballHigh School BasketballGreatest GolferJason KokrakYSU SportsPhantomsKelly PavlikNational SportsOutdoor NewsServicesAdvertiseValleyDeals365Valley Digital ServicesClassifiedsPlace AdBrowse ClassifiedsVindyJobsVindyWheelsVindyHomesRecordsSearch StoriesDeathsTributes/ObituariesBirthsBirthdaysEngagementsMarriagesAnniversariesValley Weddings 365DiscussionsTalk of the ValleyLocal SportsPoliticsOutdoorsStory DiscussionsFeedbackCommunityNewspapers in EducationEventsSubmit an EventSearch UsersHelpContact Us / FeedbackStaff DirectoryTerms of UsePrivacy StatementContest RulesFormsAnniversaryBirthdayEngagementWeddingClub NewsFood SalesOut of town birthsReunionsWorth a lookNeighborsAustintown NewsBoardman NewsCanfield NewsPoland NewsHome • Terms of Use • Privacy Statement • Advertise •  Staff Directory •  Help© 2017 Vindy.com.

Venture Fund Launched to Help Valley CompaniesBy Dan O'Brien | September 3, 2015




Venture Fund Launched to Help Valley Companies

Sponsored By:Dan O'Brien

0050YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio – A partnership between the Youngstown Business Incubator, the Tech Belt Energy Innovation Center in Warren and the Mahoning Valley Economic Development Corp. is poised to launch a new for-profit venture capital fund designed to seed business development within the region’s technology and advanced manufacturing sectors.
The fund, Valley Growth Ventures LLC, will focus on providing growth capital to software, energy, advanced materials and additive manufacturing companies in the Mahoning Valley and potentially across Ohio, according to an email from Jim Cossler, CEO of the YBI.
Attempts to obtain additional comment from YBI officials were unsuccessful.



“There’s a very strong need for such a fund in the Valley,” says Michael Conway, executive director of MVEDC. “The best thing about this is that there are three development partners working together.”
Conway says that the fund will play a needed role in providing seed capital to a select number of firms related to the YBI and TBEIC in Warren.
MVEDC will be an investor in the venture and responsible for administering the fund, Conway says.
The objective is raising $3 million from private sources, institutions or foundations, to be matched by the state of Ohio’s Third Frontier Initiative, for a total of $6 million. Any contributors to the program will hold an investment position with the fund, as they would in any venture capital fund.
“Right now, we are not broadly soliciting investors,” Conway said. “The pieces are just starting to fall into place.”

Valley Growth Ventures Fund Gets $3M from State

Sponsored By:Blank

0050YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio – The Ohio Third Frontier Commission today awarded $3 million to Valley Growth Ventures LLC, a venture capital fund that is a partnership between the Youngstown Business Incubator, the Tech Belt Energy Innovation Center in Warren, the Mahoning Valley Economic Develop Corp. and Youngstown State University.
The funding comes from a total of $10.35 million allocated four venture capital funds from the state’s Pre-Seed and Seed Plus Capitalization Program.
Valley Growth Ventures LLC is a for-profit investment fund created to support high-growth companies. According to an announcement from the Third Frontier Commission, the fund will support its “current incubator portfolios” as well ‘attract out-of-region companies to the Mahoning Valley.”



The venture capital fund also has the ability to “make investments in start-ups across Ohio, with the goal of achieving strong returns to investors while creating high-paying technology jobs,” the funding announcement states.
In February the fund received a $250,000 federal grant to fund “essential financial support” for its operations. At the time the executive director of MVEDC, Michael Conway, said Valley Growth Ventures had applied for $3 million from the Ohio Third Frontier program. He noted that a similar amount had already been pledged by in matching funds.
Ohio Third Frontier is the state’s $2 billion technology-based economic development initiative to create high-wage jobs through the growth of high-tech start-up and early-stage companies.
The $10.35 million awarded today will be matched by more than $12 million of private capital, and will benefit “at least 20 emerging technology companies,” state officials say.
In addition to the $3 million for Valley Growth Ventures LLC, the Third Frontier Commission awarded $1.65 million to the North Coast Angel Fund III, $3.625 million to the North Coast Venture Fund and $2.079 million to Mutual Capital Partners Fund III LP.
