During this time, I witnessed how he effectively managed Manufacturing Production Process validation (IQ, OQ, PQ) activities. David was extremely proactive while he planned, documented, and implemented manufacturing processes with Good Manufacturing Practices. As a great team player, he understood the importance of meeting deadlines and minimized the amount of time his deliverables were in the project’s critical path. David’s “can do it” attitude contributed positively in getting other members of the team to work together. David was a dependable and a valuable member of the Aribex team throughout the projects. It was always a pleasure to have him on the cross-functional development team as his contributions brought favorable results.See moreSee lessI have known David for  three (3) years now. David serves Aribex as a Manufacturing Engineer. While I was his one-over manager, I had opportunity to work with David daily and observe the quality of his work.

David is a steady worker with great people skills. He is ambitious and continually looking for opportunities to make improvements for the manufacturing processes.

David has a variety of technical skills as an engineer, but also has a curiosity that leads him to look at problems from differing angles to find a solution. The results of his efforts improve efficiency as well as creation of comfortable tools for assemblers in performing their tasks. He is a proficient designer with SolidWorks and other tools necessary to perform his role.

I highly recommend David as a competent Manufacturing Engineer with great people skills and a sound work ethic. It would be my pleasure to work with David again given the opportunity and encourage prospective employers to consider his talents and abilities.

Our main service is providing  Illinois attorney referrals and legal guidance.  In addition to our personalized referrals, Illinoislawyers.com also provides a directory of almost all licensed attorneys in Illinois. The list, which we update daily, includes attorneys who are licensed in Illinois and who are physically in Illinois. The list does not include attorneys who have let their registration lapse or those who are out of state.
You can search by an attorney's first or last name, the name of a law firm, or their city. Each listing should include an attorney's name and the name of their firm, along with their address, phone number, fax number, e-mail address, website, and the year they were admitted to practice in Illinois. We also try to include, based on our research, the area of law in which the attorney practices.
The list is a good way to get the contact information for an Illinois attorney or law firm. We want to be clear that this list is completely different and separate from our attorney referral list. The network of attorneys we have created for referrals is a specific list of the Illinois attorneys we know and trust. Our network is made up of attorneys we would hire ourselves if we needed a lawyer. Basically, we have handpicked the attorneys we recommend to you.
If you have any questions related to this list, please do not hesitate to contact us.

                                Report abuseTranscript of Heteronormative Heroism in Harry PotterThe article is written by Tison Pugh and David L. Wallace. Written Why?The article's purpose is best explained in the introductory paragraph, it is to prove that "heteronormative heroism ultimately squelches gender equality and sexual diversity in favor of the ideological status quo," in the Harry Potter series.Written When and How?This article was published in Volume 31, Number 3 of the Children's Literature Association Quarterly during Fall of 2006. It is pages 260-281.Written ByThe Similarities between Hogwarts and HomosexualityCulturally Normative Sex RolesIn Layman's terms: The Harry Potter books are not "overly homophobic or blatantly sexist," as is stated on page 63; however, they do illustrate the normal sex roles that are culturally accepted.Subjugated to MasculinityAccording to Pugh and Wallace, although women HELD positions of power the top positions are currently held by men Women in PowerWomen occupy positions of power at Hogwarts:Professor McGonagall is the Deputy Headmistress of Hogwarts.Amelia Bones is a Department head at the Ministry of Magic.Millicent Bagnold was a Minister of MagicDilys Derwent was a previous Minister of Magic.About the ArticleHeteronormativity and Latent Queerness in Harry Potter's Fantastic RealmMarginalizing Women in the "Post Feminist" Wizarding WorldHeteronormative Heroism and Queering the School Story in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter SeriesTison Pugh is an associate professor of English at the University of Central Florida.His other works include:Queering Medieval Genres Articles in Chaucer Review, College English, Arthuriana, Philological Quarterly, and Studies in Medieval and Renaissance Teaching.David L. Wallace is a professor of rhetoric and composition at the University of Central Florida.Has written many articles on:Literacy, critical pedagogy, queer theory, and empirical research methods.The Children's Literature Association Quarterly is an academic journal that was established by Johns Hopkins University Press in 1975.Pugh and Wallace clearly state on page 261, " our purpose in examining the Harry Potter texts as a mixture of school story and hero tale is to argue that, even withing J.K. Rowling's exuberantly fantastic plot structures and the ostensibly post-feminist coeducational space of Hogwarts, heteronormative heroism narrows the range of culturally viable narrative actions and plots."In layman's terms: the article explores how the Harry Potter series attracts and discourages queer readings by displaying the similarities between the wizardry world and queerness, the role females play, and how as Harry matures his relationships with other male characters weaken.According to Pugh and Wallace, this can be harmful because they "contribute to the construction and validation of retrograde," meaning, inequality among the roles male and females play. In the entire series, none of the characters are homosexual. According to Pugh and Wallace, the wizarding world is flattened by the "omission of queer characters" and was needed to truly depict a 21st century atmosphere. Even in lack of homosexual characters, there is opportunity to make a connection between homosexuality and the world of wizards. According to Pugh and Wallace, this is displayed when:Harry "comes out of the closet" as a wizard mainly because Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon's fear of magic is similar to homophobia.Harry's first trip to London is similar to a queer coming-of-age-tale when Hagrid introduces Harry to the world in which he can be open about being a wizard; similar to the experience many homosexuals experience when they are introduced to gay life by someone more experienced.Harry having to pretend he is not a wizard when he is back in the "real world" is similar to the way some have to hide their homosexuality for acceptance.Werewolves and Gay MenPugh and Wallace say that having a werewolf in the family is similar to having a homosexual in the family. This is illustrated by:When there is a werewolf in the family, everyone has to readjust their relationships and expectations of one another. Just like loved ones have to do when someone comes out of the closet. Remus and Lupin had trouble finding employment because they are werewolves; they serve as a model that queers should not be shunned, despite the cultural prejudices.Werewolves serve as figures of pederasty and child sexual abuse because of their uncontrollable and animalistic behavior.Becoming a werewolf is like the AIDS disease, which was largely associated with homosexuality, because it can only be transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids.Werewolves are not seen as a positive force; even when families stand by those that become werewolves none of them would choose to have a werewolf in their families. With all the similarities between homosexuality and werewolves, the message can be linked to homosexuality as well; thus, enforcing heteronormative behavior.Breadwinners are men; Vernon Dursley and Arthur Weasley.Caretakers are women; Petunia Dursley and Molly Weasley. Hermione is smarter and more naturally talented than any of the guys but she is only valued as help to Harry. When she stands up for the house elves, nobody backs her or finds her significant.McGonagall is Dumbledore's second in command but only does what Dumbledore wants her to. It is not until Dumbledore is murdered that she stands up and takes authority. Umbridge is the only one that really acts on her own accord but she is seen as the villain, the "bad" one.Heteronormative Heroism and Marginalizing Masculinity in the School StoryAccording to Pugh and Wallace, heteronormative masculinity also harms straight men. Harry's relationships with Ron Weasley, Sirius Black, and Albus Dumbledore are limited by masculinity.Ron WeasleyRon is Harry's sidekick, his masculinity was always second to Harry's. For example:Ron is depicted as less sexually experienced.Ron and Hermione helped Harry with all of his challenges in the earlier books but as he matures Harry becomes more of a hero while Ron and Hermione's roles diminish.Ron is not as good at Quidditch than Harry.Sirius and DumbledoreAccording to Pugh and Wallace, Harry moves toward a lone hero when Sirius and Dumbledore die.Sirius is more smarter, a better fighter, and more of a risk taker than Harry is. This is why he has to die; so that Harry can be seen as the only one capable of facing Voldemort.Dumbledore also outshines Harry in every way.When Dumbledore dies, Harry has to step up to the plate.Pugh and Wallace claim that Dumbledore died prematurely because of heteronormative heroism.Tison Pugh. and David L. Wallace. "Heteronormative Heroism and Queering the School Story in J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter Series." Children's Literature Association Quarterly 31.3 (2006): 260-281. Project MUSE.
