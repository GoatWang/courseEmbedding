Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Spectranetics Corporation 2015 Fourth Quarter and Year-End Financial Results. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would like to now introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Lynn Pieper. Ma'am, you may begin.
Lynn Pieper - Founding Partner, Gilmartin Group LLC
Thank you. This is Lynn Pieper with the Gilmartin Group. Thank you for participating in today's call.

This conference call contains time-sensitive information and is accurate only as of the live broadcast, February 25, 2016.
I'll now turn the call over to Scott Drake. Scott?
Scott William Drake - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Lynn, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin by sharing performance for each business unit and highlight traction in our commercial execution and innovation pipeline. In the fourth quarter, we posted top-line growth of 5% on a constant-currency basis. Q4 built on a solid Q3, and we feel it represents another positive step forward. We entered 2016 positioned to capitalize on the opportunities in front of us. On our call, we'll discuss Q4 performance highlights, provide an update on strategic initiatives. Stacy will review our financials and outlook for 2016, and we look forward to answering your questions. I'll start with performance highlights from Q4. All numbers will be on a constant-currency basis.
Our Vascular business grew 12% over prior year. Growth drivers were longstanding strength in U.S. peripheral atherectomy, where we continue to significantly outpace market growth. Performance was again balanced across hospitals and office-based labs. Coronary atherectomy and Stellarex also contributed nicely to our growth. In terms of growth limiters, AngioSculpt results were flat, both year-over-year and sequentially. Laser, service and other revenue declined 24% as we transitioned from selling lasers to more of a placement model.
In Lead Management, growth was flat, as increasing mechanical device volume was offset by launch stocking orders in the comparable period. Netting out the stocking effect, LM grew mid-single digits. We continue to be pleased with our mechanical conversions globally, and our customers and we are excited about the launch of our Bridge device, which I'll highlight in a moment. Our International business was up 11% and disposable growth was up about twice that rate. This performance was primarily driven by increases in Stellarex, AngioSculpt and mechanical tools in Europe and our coronary business in Japan. Growth was largely offset by a decrease in laser sales and service due to the placement strategy previously mentioned.

In summary, our focus as an organization is to drive revenue growth by delivering innovative products, a drumbeat of compelling clinical data and strong commercial execution. Shifting attention to our strategic initiatives, we're focused on our drug-coated balloon platform, the in-stent restenosis indication and continued efforts to unlock the Lead Management market opportunity. First, I'll highlight our DCB portfolio. The European Stellarex launch is ongoing and our team is making progress on market access initiatives. The conversion pipeline is building and customer feedback continues to be very positive.
At the LINC Conference last month, Stellarex was center stage on podium talks and highlighted as a top-tier device. Professor Brodmann stated that while three drug-coated balloons have rigorously studied, only two warrant adoption due to clinical efficacy. To be abundantly clear, Stellarex is one of the two. Key opinion leaders are aligned that coatings matter and that there is no class effect. The combination of top-tier performance at relatively low drug dosage is why KOLs view Stellarex as a next-generation device. Our messaging around more with less is resonating with customers and we anticipate that clinical data presentations, over the course of 2016, will validate our impressive first in-human results.
At the JPMorgan Conference, we shared our projected timeline of clinical data releases. The first such opportunity is in April at Charing Cross, where Professor Thomas Zeller will present a 12-month subset of fully-adjudicated data from our global registry. This will be followed by presentations of our 12-month European randomized study and the U.S. pivotal trial later in the year at VIVA and TCT respectively. 2016 sets up to be an exciting year for Stellarex. We continue to anticipate European launch of the Stellarex below-the-knee platform by the end of this year. And on the coronary side, our Drug-Coated AngioSculpt program also remains on track for commercial launch. We are well positioned to have a compelling, highly-differentiated DCB portfolio in Europe by the end of this year.
Finally, in the U.S., we're on track with the PMA submission for our above-the-knee platform. Turning our attention to the in-stent restenosis opportunity, we've made some important progress in late 2015. FDA clearance of our Turbo-Power catheter, which carries the indication, is an important innovation in our effort to improve patient outcomes. ISR continues to be a key driver for our peripheral atherectomy business and this new device should augment our ability to further penetrate the market. We are the only peripheral atherectomy company with an ISR indication and it is supported by randomized controlled data. Our primary competitors remain contraindicated.
In Lead Management, we anticipate 2016 to be a meaningful step forward for improved patient outcomes. In our effort to help eliminate mortality, we are excited to bring our Bridge to Surgery device to market. Dr. Jude Clancy, a global thought leader from Yale, is calling Bridge the biggest advancement in lead extraction since the introduction of the laser. The product embodiment is a one-size-fits-all occlusive balloon, which is intended to be easily and quickly deployed in the rare event of an SVC tear. Rapid deployment mitigates blood loss and allows potentially life-saving time for surgical repair. We will begin a limited market release and intend full launch mid-year.
In addition to the Bridge device, we continue to focus on targeted market development efforts and mechanical device conversions, both of which are progressing nicely. Before I turn the call over to Stacy, I'd like to comment on our competitive position and the strength of our pipeline moving forward. On the LM side, we are the market leader and our pipeline of products and market development efforts are intended to better serve a profoundly undertreated patient population.

We will continue to expand our product offering and work to solve the issues that gate broad-based adoption of HRS guidelines. Number one on the Pareto according to our research is perceived fear of the procedure. Our Bridge device represents a significant advance in changing perception and we will methodically march forward on this opportunity. We are very well-positioned in the Lead Management market.
On the VI side, we have thoughtfully built a portfolio in anticipation of and in line with market trends. Of note, we learned through KOL engagement that vessel preparation is essential to successfully treat complex disease. We have also been clear that our customers desire durable, stent-like results without leaving an implant behind. That definitive treatment in the peripheral market would take the form of drug-coated balloons for the foreseeable future.
In short, our portfolio is well-positioned for where the market is going. From crossing solutions to vessel preparation to complex coronary to drug-coated balloons, we have a highly-differentiated and effective set of clinical solutions. Complementing our product portfolio are unique indications and compelling data. This position will strengthen in the quarters and years ahead.
In closing, I'll provide context on the 8-K we filed today regarding the departure of Kim Bridges. Two years ago, I asked our VP of Vascular Sales to move over to the LM side of our business to improve execution and further develop bench strength. He and the team did a great job with this and we moved him back to the Vascular business several months ago. This move has been very well-received by our team. He and our VP of Vascular Marketing now report directly to me.
I will now turn the call over to Stacy to review our financials and 2016 outlook.
Stacy Powell McMahan - Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon. I will begin by referring you to the press release issued this afternoon for details. We will file our Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission before the end of the month.
Consolidated fourth quarter revenue was $65.2 million, delivering a growth of 4% as reported, 5% constant currency and 6% sequentially. For the full year 2015, revenue was $246 million, growing at 20% as reported or 22% on a constant-currency basis. Total revenue, excluding AngioSculpt, grew 8% as reported or 10% constant currency. Our June 30, 2014 acquisition of AngioScore is now fully reflected in all reference periods and will be reported quarterly and annually as part of our Vascular Intervention product line revenue going forward.
We report our revenue by major product line and by geographic segments. Our three reported product lines are Vascular Intervention, comprised of coronary and peripheral products spanning the cross, prep and treat spectrum; Lead Management, made up of both laser and mechanical devices; and finally, other revenue, primarily from laser sales, rentals and associated service. Our two geographic reporting segments are the United States and International.
Viewing revenue growth by product line in the quarter, Vascular Intervention revenue was up 10% or 12% in constant currency and up 6% on the sequential quarter with a seasonally strong fourth quarter within the year. Lead Management revenue was down 1% to prior year, flat on a constant-currency basis, but up 2% on a sequential quarter basis. Laser, service and other revenue decreased 26% or 24% in constant currency.
Looking at our geographic reporting segments, U.S. revenue in the quarter grew 4%. As Scott mentioned, U.S. peripheral and coronary atherectomy grew in the double-digit range. Primary offsets to this performance were declines in the U.S. AngioSculpt peripheral business, flat Lead Management revenues and declines in laser-related revenue.

International revenue in the quarter was flat as reported, but grew 11% on a constant-currency basis, led by our Stellarex drug-coated balloon as well as strong performance in coronary products, Lead Management mechanical tools and AngioSculpt. This growth was offset by a continuing and expected decline in laser revenue.
Gross margin at 75% was slightly favorable to the fourth quarter of 2014, when excluding the acquired inventory step-up. This improvement is primarily driven by positive mix and production efficiencies as well as an approximate 40 basis point nonrecurring favorable impact associated with the recent shelf life extension for Stellarex. This was partially offset by unfavorable impact of currency and laser depreciation.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were up 1% in the quarter and represented 56% of sales due to higher spending on the Stellarex launch in Europe and U.S. sales force additions that were partially offset by lower performance-driven variable compensation expense. R&D spending was up 78% and represented 25% of sales led by our significant investment in Stellarex and our continued investment in our innovation pipeline and supporting clinical work.
Turning our attention to certain special items on our P&L, you will note decreased cost related to our AngioScore and Stellarex acquisitions and integrations. This decrease was led by reduced activity associated with the AngioScore-related litigation. The remainder is driven by an overall reduction in the amount of integration-related expenses as we have substantially completed integration activities.
You will also note a reduction in the fair value of contingent consideration liability incurred at the time of the AngioScore acquisition. This is the result of a determination that the associated revenue growth requirements for a milestone payment were unlikely to be achieved in the defined timeframe. This fair value reduction to a contingent liability was favorable to our income by $3.7 million.
Walking down the P&L, operating losses of $7.6 million in the quarter compared to $13.8 million loss in the same quarter a year ago. Net losses for the quarter were $10.5 million versus a $16 million net loss in the prior year. Excluding special items, non-GAAP net losses were $8.2 million and $1.7 million for the fourth quarters of 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Cash on hand at the end of the year was $85 million, down from $96 million at the beginning of the year. For fiscal-year 2015, proceeds from our debt financing in December funded cash used in operating activities of $60 million and cash used in acquiring the Stellarex assets of $30 million. For the quarter, cash used in operating activities was $17 million, representing a cash used increase of $6 million over the prior quarter. This was primarily driven by a reduction in current liabilities.
Regarding liquidity, as we briefly discussed on our prior earnings call, we completed a refinancing of our outstanding debt and closed on a new $110 million senior secured credit facility in December. The credit facility consists of a $60 million term loan and a $50 million revolving line of credit. Both the term loan and revolver are floating-rate debt and have covenant around minimum revenue growth and cash on hand. We believe that this new credit facility provides ample liquidity through the U.S. launch of Stellarex and beyond.
Before shifting attention to our 2016 outlook, I would like to briefly comment on our laser installed base. We have now seen new laser placements in the 40s and 50s for the last five quarters. However, our net placement rate is significantly lower. As we approach the launch of our next-generation laser, we are highly focused on the optimization of our existing fleet. These optimization activities take the form of reallocating our existing lasers in the field to drive greater productivity from each.

Now, moving on to our 2016 financial outlook. We are projecting revenue in the range of $254 million to $266 million, an increase of 3% to 8% over 2015. We are not projecting a net impact of currency in this guidance.
Vascular Intervention revenue growth is anticipated to be mid-single to low-double digits. Lead Management growth is anticipated to be low- to mid-single digit. Offsetting this growth is an expected decline in our laser service and other revenue of approximately 10%. This range can generally be characterized by a continuation of our Q4 2015 performance. The low end includes the potential for intensified competition in Vascular Intervention and LM softness. The high end contemplates an upside in growth for our key product categories.
Net loss for 2016 is expected to be within a range of $59 million to $64 million or $1.34 to $1.45 per share. Non-GAAP net loss is expected to be within a range of $45 million to $50 million, or $1.03 to $1.14 per share. Please see the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures contained in our press release.
Gross margin is expected to range from 74.4% to 75%. The primary drivers for gross margin are increased disposable sales as well as increased operational efficiencies. The primary limiter to gross margin expansion is ramping production volume associated with Stellarex as is expected with an early-stage launch. We expect more significant leverage in gross margin as we move into the U.S. launch of Stellarex in 2017.
Research and development expenses are expected to continue to be in the range of 25% to 26% of revenue, driven by the significant investment in the Stellarex program. While we have fully enrolled all ILLUMENATE studies, there remains significant cost as we complete 12-month and 24-month follow-up on the over 1,000 enrolled patients.
Selling, general and administrative expenses are expected to be in the range of 61% to 63% of revenue. This is driven by the full-year impact of investments made in our commercial footprint over the course of 2015. In addition, as compared to 2015, we expect achievement of performance-driven variable compensation, which accounted for lower-than-expected costs in 2015. Base interest expense on debt is expected to be in the range of $11 million to $12 million and could vary depending upon our revolver balances.
Thank you for your continued interest in Spectranetics. I will now turn the call back to Scott for closing remarks.
Scott William Drake - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Stacy. In summary, Q4 was another step forward. We remained focused on our innovation pipeline, clinical data and commercial execution. We are increasingly well-positioned to capitalize on the large and diverse set of opportunities our team has created. Joining us for Q&A is Shar Matin, our Chief Operating Officer.
Operator, please open the line for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Rick Wise from Stifel. Your line is now open.
Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Good afternoon, everybody. Scott, Stacy, maybe just talk about the guidance first. I mean, thank you, Stacy, for commenting on what drives the upper or lower end. But maybe, Scott, you could talk a little bit about the greater competition possibility on the low end. Are you seeing incremental competition or some pick-up that makes that more of a concern in 2016 in some specific area, U.S. or O-U.S., that we should be sensitive to?
Scott William Drake - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks for the question, Rick. I think the dynamic that we're experiencing in the market in Q4 was pretty similar to Q3. Overall procedure growth continues in the mid single-digit rate. Peripheral atherectomy, as you know, was a bit higher, and we're about 2 times overall market growth rate in the Vascular business. Drug-coated balloons continue to be rapidly adopted. That's good for patients and us over time. It represents continued pressure. You saw the flatness continue in our AngioSculpt business. But overall, the net effect on atherectomy feels similar in that there are puts and takes, but no net effect that's obvious to us. So, I think it's kind of more of the same, Rick. And as Stacy outlined in her commentary on guidance, continuation of Q4, generally speaking, is what we're calling for at the midpoint of our range.

Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Okay. As my follow-up, I'll turn to Stellarex. It's certainly going to be in a critical year with all the data. Maybe, Scott, if you could talk about in Europe, or Shar, can you give us some visibility on the early days of commercialization, who the adopters are? Is it existing laser accounts? Are they new accounts? Are you cross-selling pulling through your broader VI portfolio? Just help ground us in sort of what's happening with Stellarex in Europe in these early days.
Scott William Drake - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. Happy to, Rick. And I'll welcome Shar in, in a moment, if he wants to add any color. The first thing that I would highlight there is that it was the top driver of growth for us in Europe in Q4. It really is growing in concert with current customers, but we are converting new customers as well. I think the team is making very nice progress on our market access initiatives, including tenders and GPOs, and the conversion pipeline is building. Specifically as it regards to those that I'm most gratified that we have converted or are in the process of converting, I would say as key opinion leaders. Especially those that have been involved in virtually all of the meaningful drug-coated balloon studies that are out there. So, I think there is an overall positive impact, Rick. But I think it's also opening up new customers to us. Shar, would you add any color to that?
Shahriar Matin - Chief Operating Officer
Sure. I would just add that in addition to, as we look at the full portfolio and we saw some positive growth in our AngioSculpt business, the opportunity to do vessel prep plus drug delivery and sell that full bag has been resonating with our customers out in Europe. So, that's been a big positive pull through for us as well.
Scott William Drake - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Great point. Thanks, Shar.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Mills from Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open.
Jason R. Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Hi, Scott. Thanks for taking the question. Can you hear me okay?
Scott William Drake - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure can, Jason. Thank you.
Jason R. Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
So, I'll start where Rick left off on Stellarex. I'm hoping you could calibrate us a little bit. And I can appreciate that early days and given that you're trying to stay at a high level. If I just ask the question outright, what was revenue in the fourth quarter for Stellarex, what do you expect for this year, you may not give it. So, if you're willing to, that's where I'm going. If you aren't, perhaps calibrate us with respect to what the European market is right now for drug-eluting balloons and what sort of exiting the year, what kind of run rate or share position maybe range you'd aspire to or is factored into your guidance, so that we can – it just strikes me that that will be perhaps one of the biggest pivots as to whether you're at the low end or the high end of the range, or below or above the ranges. Thank you.
Scott William Drake - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. Absolutely, Jason. Thank you for the question. I would tell you that the launch is ongoing. We're not going to provide a specific number either for Q4 or any specificity around what we expect for the individual category, either Stellarex or others in the year. We're going to stick with the higher-level commentary that we've outlined over the past couple of quarters. I would tell you that I believe we have a top-tier device, as I think I've mentioned in prepared remarks and as we saw from the podium at LINC. The dynamics, Jason, I think you're aware, are very different in the European market than what we anticipate in the U.S. market in terms of the number of competitors. There's roughly a dozen in Europe today. There are few companies, only three, that have real data. And the share position really is falling along clinical lines. We anticipate a different environment in the U.S. where we'll be the third entrant. So, we're not going to get specific in terms of the individual numbers. But we feel as though we're in a very good position to compete.

Jason R. Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Okay. Fair enough. I gave it a shot. So, one quick follow-up on Stellarex and then one on the new products. With respect to timelines, would your assumptions have it that, given when you will plan to file with the FDA this year with Stellarex that you would still expect a 2017 approval in time to actually contribute to U.S. revenue next year? And then, with respect to new products, we've gotten really good feedback about Turbo-Power, specifically that it's a device that can be used above the knee – and not just in-stent restenosis, but above the knee much easier, whereas the ramp involved in Turbo-Tandem would get caught at some point and was not as easy to use. So, perhaps, you could comment on your atherectomy business in the periphery and whether or not Turbo-Power has actually helped you, not only in in-stent restenosis, but in sort of de novo above-the-knee disease relative to your previous positioning? As well as maybe any comment on the nexcimer, the next-generation laser? We've talked to docs that have seen it and it seems to be, perhaps, a game-changer in terms of how much space it's taking up in the cath lab. Thanks, Scott. I'll get back in queue.
Scott William Drake - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Absolutely. And Jason, thank you for your thoughtful questions. Let me take a cut at them. Hopefully, I have them all down here. Your first question was around Stellarex impacting 2017 growth. We anticipate that that, indeed, will be the case. Obviously, at this point, not ready to call for that. I would anticipate launch of the product – approval of the product in the second half of 2017, but I do think it will be in time to have an impact on our revenue growth in 2017. No further specifics at this time around that.
As it relates to Turbo-Power, you highlight ease of use. That is absolutely what we're hearing back from our customer base, Jason, that it is easier to use. And the ability to use it above the knee, both in de novo and ISR procedures, has proven to be very effective in the early days of our launch here. And I think you'll see that it will be helpful to us as we go forward in the peripheral atherectomy market. We've contemplated the launch of the device in our guidance, but we do believe it will help us penetrate the market further.
And finally, on the nexcimer front, we're looking forward to that product. You're right a number of our customers have seen it. And not only is it smaller and much more easy to move in the lab, the footprint is smaller, it takes a 110 plug versus a 220. It has virtually instant-on. The startup time is very minimal relative to the current configuration. And we believe it will be a help for us in terms of market penetration going forward. So, we're looking forward to that, but that will not be taking place in the 2016 timeframe.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brooks West from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.
Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
Hi. Thanks. Can you hear me?
Scott William Drake - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure can, Brooks.
Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
Hey, Scott. I wonder if you could comment more generally on the U.S. peripheral vascular market. And I'm trying to think about what's going on above the knee versus below the knee, the various devices. And do you still feel like really your trough around your business is ISR above the knee? And then, I'm curious below the knee, do you feel like you were able to take some share based on competitor disruption and could we see that continue? And I've got a follow-up.
Scott William Drake - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. Happy to comment there, Brooks. We see the overall market continuing to grow at virtually the same rate that we've been talking about for a long time. Procedural growth overall is about 6%. Peripheral atherectomy is a little bit higher at about 8%. And as you know, over the last five years, we've been growing two times to three times the market rate generally from quarter to quarter with some quarters being a bit higher and some a tad bit lower than that. And that performance continues here. As it relates to the below-the-knee market, there's primarily two competitors that really have share, us and one other company. We have been growing nicely in that segment of the market. And similarly, our position, to your point, has improved since we achieved the ISR indication about a year-and-a-half ago now. And I think Turbo-Power will also augment our ability to compete there, not only within ISR, but in de novo procedures as well. Not only the ease-of-use characteristics that were mentioned previously, but we treat from the tip with Turbo-Power, which is meaningful from a safety profile perspective and a decreased risk of distal embolization. So, we're doing quite well really across the landscape, the full geography of the leg and also hospitals and office-based labs.

Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then, maybe transitioning to a little bit longer-term thought, you all have talked about transitioning to cash flow positives, post the Stellarex spend kind of all in, and I know that spend has evolved over time. But is it still the case? Should we be looking at 2018 as really more of an inflection to cash generation? And how should we think about the associated Stellarex spend kind of winding down over the next two years to three years? Thanks.
Stacy Powell McMahan - Chief Financial Officer
Brooks, it's Stacy. Thanks for the question. The cash flow, as you noted, is the investment that we have going is really related to the number of trials that we have. And right now, we have about 1,000 patients active as we move into the 12 months and 24 months follow-up cycle. And then, we also have – anticipating starting a new registry with 1,000 more patients in 2016. So, the investment continues at a high level. I think the real inflection point will be when we get to the U.S. launch and we get cash flows from the U.S. launch, we get volume push through our factories, we start to get more favorable gross margin profiles and leverage in our commercial footprint. So, it really is going to be associated with the launch ramp.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Chris T. Pasquale - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks. Scott, I wanted to start with Stellarex and the clinical results you're expecting this year. The first data set we're going to see is the global registry. Given the fact that that's real world experience, is it fair to assume that the patients are going to be more challenging than what we see in the randomized trials, and as a result, the results may not be quite as clean? Or do you think the patient profile is similar?
Scott William Drake - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. It's a great question, Chris. We'll see when we see it, quite frankly. I think the data set is going to be more specific as it relates to the randomized trial and the pivotal trial, respectively. So, for the registry, time will tell on that front. And we're excited to get that data set out coming out in the April timeframe.
Chris T. Pasquale - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And then, at our conference last month, you hinted at some new clinical activity you guys could have starting this year. You didn't announce anything in particular today. Can you talk a little bit about the priorities you have and when we could see something more formal announced? And in particular, I'm thinking about anything that could add to the evidence supporting the use of atherectomy and DCBs together. That seems like a hole that still needs to be filled going forward.
Scott William Drake - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. I think that's right, Chris, and I think that's what you can expect to see in what we're calling our saber registry. That registry is slated to be up to 10,000 patients – real world patients. And I think we're going to be exploring what is required from a vessel preparation standpoint with different categories of patients. I think that's going to be very helpful from a clinical practice perspective. The other big initiative going on is the development of the technology for the below-the-knee device and the below-the-knee study and that work is ongoing right now. And we anticipate, hopefully, beginning enrollment in the below-the-knee study late this year. So, those are the big efforts. And you're exactly right, in terms of both atherectomy and, perhaps, broader in other forms of vessel preparation, in conjunction with Stellarex, really trying to show the right algorithms for different patients.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Matson from Needham & Company. Your line is now open.
Mike S. Matson - Needham & Co. LLC
Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So, I guess, I just wanted to go back to the revenue guidance. So, Stacy, I think you said you were basing that off of – at least the midpoint off of where you're kind of exiting the year. But I guess, it seems like the comps are going to be getting significantly easier as you progress through 2016. You've got a number of new products out. So, I guess, why couldn't you kind of grow faster for the full year than the guidance that you've given?
Stacy Powell McMahan - Chief Financial Officer
Well, let me generally talk about the growth during the year. We expect that our quarterly performance would be within the range of the guidance that we've given and with some modest ramp later in the year as our product launches do gain traction. So, that really is encompassed by that range of guidance that we've given.
Mike S. Matson - Needham & Co. LLC
Okay. Got it. And then, just on the Bridge product, I mean I understand that that will obviously make the physicians more willing to take leads out, because it removes sort of the fear factor. But is there an opportunity there to generate revenue with the product? In other words, does that kind of command a premium over your regular products and drive some revenue?
Scott William Drake - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. Mike, it'll be a new product that's being used in the case. So, you can anticipate that there will be some effect from the product. I don't think it's going to be profound. I think the real benefit of the device comes in the form, as you mentioned, in terms of the perception of the procedure, both for the extracting physician and for the referring physician. Our research indicates that that's where the real benefit will lie, and hopefully the commensurate volume increase that comes from that. And as we've said I think very clearly, we anticipate that's going to take time to unfold in the marketplace.

And our next question comes from the line of Charles Haff from Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open.
Charles E. Haff - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC
Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So, in terms of the guidance Stacy, for AngioScore, are you saying that you expect AngioScore revenues to be similar in 2016 versus what they were in 2015? Did I hear you right there?
Scott William Drake - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks for the question. We're not getting granular on reporting the pieces of our VI portfolio going forward. But we will continue to give you that qualitative commentary on the drivers and limiters as we have today. So, I would just bake that all in as to more of the VI portfolio commentary that I gave in the guidance.
Charles E. Haff - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC
Okay. Thanks. And then, most of my questions have been asked and answered, but wanted to ask you about mechanical tools for Lead Management. Can you give us any color on the progress that you've made going into the market share for the other mechanical tool company? Have you made much progress there or is it more of maintaining share? Any help you can give us on that front.
Scott William Drake - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. Happy to, Charles. The team has done a very nice job both in the U.S. and Europe of converting competitive share within the mechanical device category and it has contributed to that, net of stocking, mid single-digit growth that I referred to. So, I'm pleased with the progress that's been made on that front.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Suraj Kalia from Northland Securities. Your line is now open.

Suraj A. Kalia - Northland Securities, Inc.
Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions.
Scott William Drake - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Good afternoon, Suraj.
Suraj A. Kalia - Northland Securities, Inc.
So, Scott, forgive me if I missed some of this, just jumping in between a few calls. In lead removal, Scott, you can't help but miss that the fact that it's just come to an absolute grinding halt. I guess part of it is, I'm just trying to understand, is this just structural or is this just seasonal? And the reason I ask is GlideLight was at a 25% premium. It seems like, and again approximately, it seems like when the price, the whole thing was shifted, growth came to a grinding halt, nominal growth. Scott, if I use the reverse, let's say you'll actually institute a price decline, would it mean that more procedures would increase?
Scott William Drake - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
So, Suraj, I would just, just for a point of clarification, I won't kind of do anything other than try to make the numbers clear here. When you net out the stocking effect, we grew mid single digits. And if that's grinding halt, then so be it on that front. But it was a mid single-digit growth category. And I think the opportunity in Lead Management is one that we're excited in, in terms of being able to open up that market. But I don't think you're going to see us call for it, Suraj. Our hope is that it happens and we see it in the rearview mirror. So hopefully, that's somewhat responsive to your question there.
Suraj A. Kalia - Northland Securities, Inc.
And, Stacy, again, forgive me if I missed this. Just given at least some directional color in the office versus hospital-based growth, obviously there are disparities in reimbursement and the results and incentive for using atherectomy plus DCBs. Can you give us some color in your embedded guidance, how you're looking at growth within these different segments?
Stacy Powell McMahan - Chief Financial Officer
We have actually continued again with our sort of performance that we recently experienced where we've seen that growth balanced across those segments, hospital and OBL.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic from UBS. Your line is now open. Matt Miksic, if your phone is on.
Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC
Sorry. Yeah, sorry about that, guys. I had you on mute. Thanks so much for taking the question. So, I did have one question on the range that you gave. And you just talked about some of the factors that would take you to the higher end and the middle end, the lower end of that range. And in terms of better performance of new products or, I'm not sure if it was less intense or easing of some of the competitive lineups that you're facing, can you talk maybe a little about what some of the – if it's products or if it's geographies or if it's categories where you see as an opportunity for hitting the mid to higher end of the range – or higher end of the range, I should say, as I think you talked about in the prepared remarks? I have one follow-up.
Scott William Drake - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. Happy to answer that, Matt. I think the number of opportunities that we have to hit the mid or high end of the range would certainly include the new launches that we have. Of note, Turbo-Power would be on that list. Certainly, the Bridge device and the commensurate potential pull through of Lead Management products; the Stellarex below-the-knee product; continuation of the above-the-knee launch in Europe and the Drug-Coated AngioSculpt product also in Europe this year, those are all really nice shots on goal and certainly leveraging the ISR indication with Turbo-Power would be on that list. So, multiple shots on goal there. Hopefully, we were also clear on the other end with what we contemplated with the low end of the guidance. But there is quite a nice number of new products that we're launching. And frankly, I believe the clinical data also has the potential to have an impact on our European launch of the above-the-knee product.

Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And then the other was that you'd mentioned something about – and I didn't catch the numbers exactly on the stocking. There was a stocking order, it was in a – it was something to do with Lead Management. If you would quantify that or clarify whether that was in a prior year that you were going up against the comp or whether that was an order that happened in this year, just to give an idea of what the impact was?
Scott William Drake - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. Absolutely, Matt. We had pretty tough comps both in Q3 and Q4 of 2015 due to the launch of mechanical tools last year. So, when you just take a look at the business as reported or constant currency, it was roughly flat on a year-over-year basis. If you normalize for stocking of mechanical tools, you get to about a mid-single-digit growth rate for LM in Q4.
Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC
Perfect. Okay. Thanks so much.
Scott William Drake - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director

Welcome to the Spectranetics First Quarter 2017 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen only mode. Following managements prepared remarks, we'll hold a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, April 27, 2017.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Michaella Gallina, Director of Investor Relations for Spectranetics. Please go ahead.
Michaella Gallina
Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for participating in today's call. Joining me from Spectranetics is President and Chief Executive Officer, Scott Drake; and Chief Financial Officer, Stacy McMahan. Earlier today, Spectranetics released financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, which can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website.
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that management will make statements during this call that include forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. These statements involve material risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or events to materially differ from those anticipated. For a list and description of those risks and uncertainties, please see the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Spectranetics disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any financial projections or forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise. This conference call contains time-sensitive information and is accurate only as of the live broadcast today, April 27, 2017.
I will now turn the call over to Scott.
Scott William Drake
Thanks, Michaella. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. On our call, I will provide revenue highlights from the first quarter, share context on our performance and progress on key initiatives. Stacy will review our financial results. And then we'll open the line for questions.
The following revenue commentary reflects constant currency. The first quarter was a solid start to the year. Our Vascular Intervention and Lead Management businesses both delivered double-digit growth. We are focused on commercial execution and the opportunities that lie ahead.
In the first quarter, total company revenue increased 11%. Geographically, U.S. revenue increased 10%, and international grew 16%. Our vascular business grew 11% over prior year. Growth was led by U.S. peripheral atherectomy and our Turbo-Power franchise. Coronary atherectomy was also a growth driver and we're well-positioned in the expanding complex disease segment. Internationally, AngioSculpt and Stellarex were again our primary contributors of growth.
In Lead Management, revenue increased 12% over prior year. Growth was largely driven by mechanical tools and complemented by the ongoing adoption of our Bridge to Surgery device. As a reminder, we will anniversary the Bridge launch next quarter.
I am encouraged by the momentum in our business and pipeline. In Vascular Intervention, we are in the midst of expanding our clinical data compendium, launching new products internationally and domestically, and preparing for Stellarex approval in the U.S. Our Stellarex ISR study is underway and we're making progress towards the approval of our below-the-knee IDE.

As we have shared, we're exploring additional markets and indications for our drug-coated balloon platform. In Europe, we expanded activities associated with the commercialization of AngioSculptX, and commenced our Stellarex below-the-knee launch. AngioSculptX combines 2 therapies into 1 device, offering the plaque modification attributes of our proven AngioSculpt platform with the added benefit of Drug Delivery.
European physicians have shared encouraging feedback on the device, especially in challenging patients. Early clinician feedback on Stellarex below the knee is positive. Customers have highlighted its superior deliverability and cross ability. Further, they have expressed that performance, coupled with our coating stability and lower drug dosage, provide a compelling solution in the challenging anatomy associated with below the knee disease.
In the U.S., we launched our Turbo-Power 6-French product during the quarter. 6-French is an important size for expanding access and utilization to a larger customer base. Regarding our Stellarex PMA submission, progress is on track. We continue to expect approval in the second half of 2017. We believe our expanded commercial organization is prepared for the most important launch in the history of our company.
On the international front, we see opportunities for growth in emerging markets, especially BRIC nations. In fact, our first commercial peripheral atherectomy cases were performed in China during the quarter.
In Lead Management, we are pleased with the growth in mechanical tools and the adoption of Bridge. We launched TightRail Sub-C late in the quarter, providing physicians a solution for calcified lesions in the subclavian area. While early, the product is performing well and customer feedback is positive.
As you know, we launched Bridge last year with the goal of improving both actual and perceived safety of lead extraction procedures. Prior to the introduction of Bridge, many physicians showed reluctance to perform extractions due to fear of an SVC tear and the risk of patient mortality. Bridge has created a new dialogue with our customers.
Notably, reluctant extractors are sharing their increased confidence in doing cases. Feedback for moderate-to-high volume customers continues to be positive, and we look forward to showcasing Bridge and lead extraction at HRS next month.
Internationally, we're introducing Bridge into key European countries, and are in the early stages of launching Lead Management into emerging markets. Overall, we remain cautiously optimistic about the global growth prospects in Lead Management.
In summary, we are pleased with double-digit revenue growth in both businesses. Product launches across business lines and geographic regions are tracking nicely. Our expanded commercial footprint is maturing, and clinical data enhances our competitive position.
I will now turn the call over to Stacy to discuss our financial results.
Stacy Powell McMahan
Thank you, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. I will begin by referring you to the press release issued this afternoon for details. Consolidated first quarter revenue was $69.7 million, up 11% both as reported and in constant currency. By geographic reporting segment, our U.S. revenue growth was 10%, and international revenue growth was 14% as reported, and 16% on a constant-currency basis.
By line of business, Vascular Intervention revenue was up 11% in both reported and constant currency. Lead Management revenue was up 11% as reported and 12% in constant currency. Laser service and other revenue increased 8% as reported and 9% on a constant-currency basis.
In Vascular Intervention, peripheral and coronary atherectomy were the primary growth drivers. In Lead Management, growth was driven by mechanical tools and Bridge. In the U.S., growth was primarily driven by an increase in disposables revenue. Internationally, growth was again driven by AngioSculpt and Stellarex.

Regarding laser placements, we placed 43 lasers globally during the first quarter versus 53 last quarter and 44 a year ago. 14 of these placements were redeployed within the field, driving greater productivity from our installed base.
Moving down to P&L. Gross margin for the quarter was 74.1%, the 40-basis point decline from last year was driven primarily by sales mix and somewhat offset by favorable production efficiencies.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 11% versus prior year and represented 66% of sales. The increase was primarily due to our global-commercial footprint expansion.
R&D spending increased 9% year-over-year and represented 26% of our sales. The increase was primarily driven by cost associated with our FDA warning letter remediation and quality system improvement efforts, partially offset by a reduction in development cost due to the approval of AngioSculptX in the third quarter of 2016.
A total operating loss of $14.9 million in the quarter compares to a $13.9 million operating loss in the same quarter a year ago.
Net loss for the quarter was $18.5 million or $0.43 per share versus a $17.3 million net loss or $0.40 per share in the prior year's quarter. Cash on hand as of March 31, 2017, was $43.9 million. Cash used in operations during the first quarter was $14.1 million.
As a reminder, Q1 is our heaviest cash use this quarter. Of the $14 million, about $12 million was annual performance-based cash compensation, and the underlying operating cash burn was around $2 million. Lastly, our full year guidance remains unchanged.
I will now turn the call back to Scott for closing remarks.
Scott William Drake
Thanks, Stacy. In summary, I'm pleased with the broad base strength of our first quarter results. We have much to look forward to within our existing portfolio and pipeline as we build out capabilities to capitalize on near and long-term opportunities.
Shahriar Matin, our Chief Operating Officer, is also joining us for Q&A. Operator please open the lines for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We'll be taking our first question from the line of Chris Pasquale from Guggenheim.
Chris Pasquale
Scott, on Stellarex, can you just give us a little bit more color on where you stand with the agency at this point? Are there still outstanding questions about the filing that you need to respond to or you're just waiting now to hear back from them?
Scott William Drake
We're well down the path, I would say, Chris, in terms of the finalizing answering questions with the FDA. We're not completely through with that. But I think the second half of '17 the commentary stands at this point. But I think it's very well derisked as we are here today.
Chris Pasquale
Okay. And then, spend another minute on Lead Management because that was probably the biggest surprise this quarter and it's actually been a couple of quarters now where we've seen that accelerating. Can you break down at all, what you think has really changed there? How much of it has been Bridge itself contributing extra revenue per case versus maybe increased caseload because Bridge is there as a safety net or is mechanical tools a bigger piece of it? What do you think has really driven that acceleration?
Scott William Drake
Yes. We are very pleased with the step up in LM growth in the first quarter. It's split pretty evenly between the growth in mechanical tools and the Bridge device itself, Chris. What I would say in terms of further color, we're seeing volume increases in low and moderate volume accounts that is being offset a little bit by high-volume accounts coming down a bit. There's a slight net uptick in terms of procedures being done, but a little bit of trade-off there. And this next comment is anecdotal, what we're hearing is increased comfort and confidence with those lower volume customers in doing cases that generally they may have referred to higher volume accounts. So that was precisely what we were attempting to do with the device. Now the question is whether or not we can really open up the market given the effectiveness of it. So that remains to be seen. And we'll just reiterate again, let us prove instead of project sustainability of real nice growth in LM.

Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Rick Weiss from Stifel.
Matt Blackman
It's actually Matt Blackman in for Rick. Stacy, maybe starting with you. Could you help us with the calendar? This is a pretty clunky year if holiday is shifting from quarter-to-quarter. So as we think about this just reported first quarter and the remainder of the year, anything to sort of call out in terms of selling day differences?
Stacy Powell McMahan
Yes, Matt. There really is, compared to last year, is the third quarter where we have 1 fewer selling day, otherwise we're even.
Matt Blackman
Okay. That's very helpful, thanks. And then Scott, shifting to the BTK opportunity, I realized in Europe in and of itself, BTK is probably not a huge dollar opportunity. But I can't help but think that given the fact that you're now the sort of 1 of 2 on labeled devices for BTK versus 1 of 12 for SFA that this opportunity may have a positive halo effect for your European business more broadly. Is that a fair way to think about this?
Scott William Drake
I think so, Matt. I mean, customers are pretty optimistic about what Stellarex means for below the knee disease. And I think they may have incrementally more confidence in Stellarex than some of the other offerings that are currently in the market or on the market in Europe. I think it will also help us above the knee as we're able to bring a total leg solution there. But I wouldn't get overly optimistic in terms of modeling. It'll take us a little while to have the effect that we hope to have. But I think it will help drive incremental growth in Europe moving forward.
Matt Blackman
Okay. And then just, if I can sneak in one last quick one on the Turbo-Power launch. Where are we in that rollout? I suspect this could be a longer-tailed opportunity, more than simply just 4 quarters and then you anniversary it. Could you maybe, just if only directionally, kind of give us a sense on where we are in that rollout?
Scott William Drake
Yes. I think you're exactly right. I mean, the feedback from customers is such that it's being very helpful competitively in the marketplace. And we're being told that it's very useful and performing well in morphology that historically has really been seated to other companies. So we're pleased with the way that's going. And I do think there is a tale to ongoing adoption as it relates to the Turbo-Power family of products. So I would agree with your assessment there. And we're pleased with where we're at. The 7-French product has been in the market now Matt, for about a year. 6-French, we're just kind of getting underway with here more recently. So we will have some benefit in the coming quarters. But I again would agree with you that this is a longer-term opportunity than just anniversary-ing after a year's launch.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein from JPMorgan. We'll take our next question from the line of Jason Mills from Canaccord Genuity.
Jason Mills
Scott, starting with Stellarex. You've confirmed on previous calls to many questions that you're prepared for this launch and you mentioned it again today. I was wondering if you could characterize based on - I'm sure a ton of market research you've done internally, I mean, what the drug-moving blue market in the United States has done over the last couple of quarters from your perspective, what kind of market do you think they're going to be entering here in the second half of the year? And I know that you've heard - well we've heard, we've probably seen what we've seen with respect to Medtronic's propensity to try to use their breadth to maintain or gain share. Perhaps give us a sense on how you think you can successfully compete against that sort of a marketing strategy?

Scott William Drake
Yes, happy to touch on those items, Jason. I would say the market, overall, is unfolding very much in line with our commentary now over the past couple of years. I think the U.S. market in 2017 is on track to be roughly a $300 million market. And we know how share currently is split between really the 3 companies that are in the space, 2 brands. So I would say that's really unfolding how we anticipate it. And I think in terms of how we'll be going to market versus others, I would begin with the fact that we've got enormous respect for the companies that we compete with. I think we do go to market in a slightly different way, much more clinically focused versus breadth and bundling and contracting based. And I wouldn't say one is inherently better than the other. But we've been very clear for the past 6 years that we intend to have meaningful clinical solutions with level 1 data. And that's how we go to market. So it is a different approach. I think it's relatively appreciated by our customers. But obviously, our competitors are doing well also.
Jason Mills
Got it. And sticking with Stellarex, what are your below-the-knee discussions with FDA? I think you filed that, correct me if I'm wrong, with the FDA in Q4, so I presume that you're not too far away from hearing back if you haven't already? And perhaps, could be in a position this time, next quarter, on this call to talk about it. Is that the right timeline to think about? And you've talked in the past about it being unique. I think everyone on this call is really eager to hear what unique means. Any color on that?
Scott William Drake
Yes, happy to, Jason. You're exactly right. We submitted in Q4. We have addressed the study design with the FDA. And I think we're in alignment as it relates to the study design. We're still working with the agency on the preclinical questions. They very much want to understand what's going on below the knee. They're keenly aware of what's happened with other products in the market and outcomes of clinical studies that have not been successful. So I think they're being prudent in their approach. And the thing that I would be comfortable sharing is that we are going to be addressing more complex patients which are really the kind of patients that our customers see with critical limb ischemia patients. So that's what you can anticipate from us. And as it relates to kind of first patient enrolled, I would just say broadly, at this point, second half of '17, and hopefully we'll be able to give you a little more color, Jason, next quarter.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic from UBS. We will go to the next person in the queue. This one's from the line of Ethan Potasnick from Needham & Company.
Ethan Potasnick
This is Ethan Potasnick phoning in for Mike Matson. So I'm just curious, do you guys plan to add sales reps after the launch of Stellarex? And I guess, how will you guys ensure that reps don't lose focus on laser atherectomy and other products once Stellarex is launched?
Scott William Drake
Yes, Ethan, I would just characterize where we're at currently with the sales force expansion. We've shared previously that our goal is to get to somewhere in the 150 to 175 quota-carrying reps. We have hired our last kind of tranche or bolus of reps, and now we're just kind of hiring in normal course. And that will continue on really through the calendar year, so that will go beyond the initial launch of Stellarex. We're marching more toward effectivity and optimization versus trying to race the clock. So the expansion will continue beyond the initial launch of the product we anticipate. I think the team has done an incredibly thoughtful job in terms of preparing for the launch and contemplating how we can continue to grow the base business while we put the appropriate focus on Stellarex. And there's a lot of tools that we have in our armamentarium including compensation and training, and different ways that we intend to go to market when we have Stellarex in the bag. I don't want to go into detail here for competitive reasons, but rest assured it is something that we've thought very deeply about.

Ethan Potasnick
Okay. And sorry if this is repetitive, but have you guys seen any faster growth with Stellarex outside the U.S.? I guess with the presentation of the U.S. pivotal data?
Scott William Drake
Yes. You know, we don't break out specifically the growth rate of Stellarex in Europe. What I would share with you is that our international vascular growth has been driven now for many quarters by both Stellarex and our AngioSculpt platform that continued here in Q1. And the team is doing a very nice job of continuing to convert accounts over there. So I would just characterize it as being a very nice growth driver for us and now we bring to it the addition of Stellarex below the knee. And we're, obviously, in a pretty good position in France as well. So I think there's some nice incremental drivers in front of us in Europe there with our drug-coated balloon platform. It'd be remiss if I didn't mention AngioSculptX as well, very nice addition to our family of drug-coated products.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Suraj Kalia from Northland Securities.
Suraj Kalia
So Scott, forgive me, I've been just hopping in between a few calls, if some of this has been mentioned, my apologies. Scott, when you look at the current DCB market, what does your internal analysis indicate? By that, I mean if I look at 3 buckets primarily, DCBs plus laser, DCBs without any atherectomy device or standalone, and DCBs with some atherectomy device, how does that look to you? And the reason I ask is when Stellarex gets launched, I know the focus is on rep productivity and compensation. I'm more interested in how you all see this Venn diagram and how you could capitalize of it? Any color here would be great.
Scott William Drake
Yes. I'd be happy to take a shot at that, Suraj. I think the place to begin is the overall aim in the marketplace that is very clear, and that is to achieve stent-like results without leaving an implant behind. And I think there are kind of - to the point of your question, emerging algorithms in physician's minds and admittedly, it varies from 1 physician to the other around what kind of vessel preparation, whether it's atherectomy or scoring balloon, would be used or if they would be prone to use DCB on a standalone basis. It's probably not as granular as you would like, but I anticipate that we will see, and in fact, I do see in labs when I spend time with customers that in some instances, they're using just a bare balloon for predilatation, followed by a drug-coated balloon.
It seems to me that there's an increasing propensity to use vessel preparation in some form. I've seen laser used in many, many cases prior to DCB. And I've also seen our scoring balloon used as well. And I think as our customers think more deeply about the indications of use and the complexity of disease, and the desire for better patency numbers and longer durability of positive outcomes, as you know, we've been projecting for a long period of time that vessel preparation will grow in concert with drug-coated balloons. It appears that, that may be true. Certainly, it is in Europe, and I project that it will be in the U.S. market as well.
Suraj Kalia
Fair enough. And finally, Scott, I'll hop back in queue. I know not much has been said about AngioScore contribution, and you've sort of shied away over the last few quarters. Any color you all can give us how you're normalizing? How does - how much of a drag does AngioScore currently on the overall business?
Scott William Drake
Happy to address that one, Suraj. It's improved. The growth rate of our AngioScore franchise has improved over the past several quarters. This quarter, if I'm not mistaken, we were in kind of high-single-digits growth overall with Sculpt and the trends that we've talked about previously hold true. Europe growing faster than the U.S., coronary growing faster than peripheral, but we see an improvement there in terms of that category. But you're exactly right; it is growing slower than our overall vascular business.

Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Jayson Bedford from Raymond James.
Jayson Bedford
Just Scott, on that last point, I may have missed this, but AngioSculpt, you said grew high single digits in the quarter?
Scott William Drake
That's right.
Jayson Bedford
Okay, that seems like a noticeable pickup. In terms of your peripheral atherectomy business, has the growth profile been impacted at all by the on-label use of DCBs for ISR?
Scott William Drake
Yes, it's really interesting, Jason. It's still not obvious to us. I know we're so many quarters in, the net effect on our atherectomy franchise still feels like roughly a net 0 as it relates to the impact of DCBs. As I've said before and forgive the repetition here, there are clearly cases where it's being where laser atherectomy is being used in concert with DCB. And there's clearly cases where DCBs are being used on a standalone basis. But it still feels as though the net effect is roughly 0. We would anticipate over time and with data that I think will be forthcoming that chances are that it will be complimentary but we have not seen that as yet.
Jayson Bedford
Okay. Fair enough. And just the comment on Turbo-Power helping growth, I wasn't sure if that was a comment specifically related to the 6-French launch? Or was that just the family of Turbo-Power products?
Scott William Drake
Yes, the family of Turbo-Power is really helping drive our peripheral atherectomy growth, and that peripheral atherectomy was indeed one of our growth drivers in the overall VI business.
Jayson Bedford
Got it and then just maybe lastly for me, you mentioned France. Are you selling Stellarex in France right now? Is that contributing?
Scott William Drake
It is not yet, that will be in the not-too-distant future. Shar, I could be wrong there. You may want to correct me, if we are, Jayson, I can tell you it's not moving the needle. Shar, do we have first sales in France as yet, Shar?
Shahriar Matin
Yes, we do have sales in France, but to your point, it's pretty marginal because reimbursement is a challenge, so if there's a way to bundle, we can get it. But private hospitals don't get reimbursement and some public hospitals will have a small budget for it. Once reimbursement is in place, we expect that market to pick up similar to a perimental stents where it's the largest market in Europe for perimental stents.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets.
Glenn Novarro
Scott just wanted a clarification on the sales force expansion. You said 150 to 175 reps, that's the goal. Are you there now or do you anticipate getting there with these additional hires? And then can you just remind us how your numbers would compare to like a Medtronic and a Bard?
Scott William Drake
Yes, happy to, Glenn. We're not quite there yet. We anticipate that we'll get there by the end of the calendar year. But again, we're more interested in quality than speed as it relates to that, and trying very carefully not to disrupt the business as we do an inherently disruptive thing. And thus far, the team has managed it, I would say, very well. And as it relates to competitive sales forces within this space, I think we're at a bit of an advantage relative to Bard. I think we're a bit larger. I think we're getting to relative parity, relative to Medtronic. We are smaller than Boston Scientific, that's our best intel, Glenn, and hope that's helpful.
Glenn Novarro
Yes, that is. And then I think most of us are assuming the drug-coated balloon gets approved at some point in the third quarter, and the fourth quarter will be your first full quarter on the market. So Scott, I'm wondering if you can help frame or provide some color as to how you see that first quarter ramping up? Is it a measured launch? Do you have to put a lot of contracts in place? Any color for that first quarter because it's always a critical quarter for any new product story.

Scott William Drake
Yes, happy to and an incredibly challenging question to answer with precision as you can appreciate. I would start big picture, Glenn, and tell you that we've got a good deal of confidence in the share position that we will ultimately get to with Stellarex, given the data that we have and given the commercial footprint that we have in the marketplace. And our research indicates that we will ultimately take a very attractive position in the DCB market. Trying to predict that ramp with accuracy, I think would be a mistake for us. And as a result of that, I think we're just going to be muted in terms of setting expectations on that front.
To the part of your question regarding market access, that will vary from account to account. There will be accounts that we have to go through, contracting processes, there will be other accounts where we'll be able to sell trunk stock on the first day of our launch. So it will be across the board, but market access will be one of the primary efforts that we have out of the gates. And that will mitigate the steepness of that curve but we're contemplating that in terms of what the launch plans look like.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan.
Mike Weinstein
I just wanted to come back to a couple of items, so maybe if I could go first with the last question there from Glenn. We're assuming that depending on - the timing was going to dictate, kind of that pace of that ramp because if you actually did an approval sooner rather than later, you're still going to have to go through hospital committees to get approvals. Do you have any sense or percentage of accounts in which you'll have to do that? You seem to indicate there will be accounts where you won't, but I've been assuming that you would.
Scott William Drake
I think that's right, Mike. I still think even accounts with value analysis committees. I would anticipate that we'll be able to do some kind of trials in those accounts to get the product in physician's hands. But I think in the vast majority of cases, we'll have to get through a value analysis committee. And I think you've written very smartly about the fact that those in the summertime, tend not to happen quite as frequently. I think on average, value analysis committees meet bimonthly or so. But I think that will be one of the hurdles, certainly that we've got to get through.
Mike Weinstein
And our work on the market has - had been kind of suggested that there is a spread in the pricing between the 2 products that are out there today. I just want to get your own perception of what that spread looks like.
Scott William Drake
Yes, our data suggest that it's within about $100 box of one another. I'd be curious to know if you see it differently than that. And we're contemplating what may happen as we enter the market, if anybody chooses to pull the price lever or not, I don't think anybody will do that significantly, Mike, as the market is expanding very attractively, price pressure tends not to happen until the market reaches some kind of maturity point. And I think that is a little way off.
Mike Weinstein
And just to - after a question from - I don't think I heard who asked, but are you expecting anything, any type of legal response from any competitors when you get to your approval?
Scott William Drake
We are not.
Mike Weinstein
Okay, I assumed that was the case, but I don't think I ever heard it asked, so I wanted to double check.
Operator
We'll be taking our next question from the line of Matt Miksic from UBS.
Matt Miksic
So I wanted to follow up on a couple of things that have been asked, but maybe a little bit more detail. One was on Bridge and on the results you've seen there, which sounds very encouraging. If you could just remind us, we hear often that clinicians like to have the Bridge on hand. And I wanted to get a sense of I guess how - if it's driving growth, is it driving growth in the core laser sheets business, and that's where the revenue is coming from or to what degree is it driving growth from utilization of actually Bridge opening it up and using it? I'd love to get a sense of that and then I have a couple of other quick follow-ups.

Scott William Drake
Yes. Matt, what I would say, in Q4, the growth that we drove was really on both mechanical tools and the sale of the Bridge product itself. What we see that is new, and I would be very muted and careful with this, is that we are seeing procedural volume increasing in low and moderate volume accounts. That, to some degree, is being offset by volumes coming down slightly in high-volume accounts, so a slight net positive there. And the goal with the device, obviously, is to save lives but also to help us open up the market for the benefit of shareholders and patients. And there is a light signal that we may be beginning. I would underline beginning, to do that. I don't want to get carried away with that. I think we've got a lot more to prove. But we were hearing just what you are, that physicians really want to have the product in the room. And to varying degrees, they all have their thoughts on when they want to have Bridge actually deployed for cases prophylactically. But the response from customers is incredibly positive as it relates to the product.
Matt Miksic
That's great. That's very helpful. Then a follow up on the vascular business, and I think what you've been getting a lot of questions on is sort of the pace of the prospective launch post-approval of Stellarex. And understanding that, that - we've heard all your answers there, I'd love to get a sense of to what degree should we be thinking that the core business maybe takes a half a step to the side while everyone is busy training or to the extent participating or - in these committees or detailing this new exciting product. How should we think about the core business? And if it's okay, I just have 1 other quick follow-up.
Scott William Drake
Sure. I would say the overall - the core business has been performing pretty well. You see us the last several quarters with the little variation here or there growing roughly at twice the market rate. The team being able to do that while we're in the midst of sales force expansion and without yet Stellarex approved, I would say is solid performance. We have seen when others have launched their product, maybe a little slowdown in their base business growth. We've tried to learn from them and contemplate how we can mitigate that risk, but you're absolutely right to point out that, that risk exists. And we're trying to be very thoughtful in terms of how we contemplate that in our guidance and we'll continue to attempt to do that as we go forward.
Matt Miksic
Okay and then the last, just on Charing Cross. I mean, any significant [indiscernible].
Scott William Drake
Matt, you're breaking up a little bit there. But I think your question is around Charing Cross. Shar is actually in London at the conference. Shar, any color in terms of interesting things that you saw at the show that would be interesting for the audience here?
Shahriar Matin
I think the biggest takeaway as far as drug-coated balloons that we kept hearing from thought leaders on the podium was there is a no class effect, especially with the data that we've released, our two randomized studies and Medtronics' additional data that's coming out and just some analyses and what-not. Really, a lot of thought leaders are making it clear that there is no drug-coated balloon class effect, and each drug-coated balloon stands on its own so I think that's been my biggest takeaway at the meeting.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Looks like we have no other questioners in the queue at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Scott for closing comments.
Scott William Drake
Excellent, thank you very much. Thanks everybody for joining us today on the call. I look forward to talking again in another 90 days. Have a good evening.

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned

Composite Score:





                        CJ Pony Parts has received 3.68 out of 5 stars based on 4 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Based in Henderson, Nevada, just outside Las Vegas, our corporate facility spans more than two-acres that includes engineering, manufacturing, sales and warehouse space. Every day more than 10,000 products are shipped to our dealers worldwide, making Drake Automotive Group one of the largest classic Mustang and OEM aftermarket parts manufacturers in the world. 

            While we made our start in the Mustang market, over the years we’ve diversified our product line to include Off-Road and Muscle car products. Our Off-Road aftermarket parts are equal to the high quality, custom design and balanced performance that are found in our classic Mustang line and feature OEM quality products. We also manufacture a variety of GM and MOPAR parts including billet items for the new Dodge Challenger.
