The lenders called back or emailed immediately, but no one can offer any help for a vet with a credit score below 620-640 even though they advertise help for vets with low to bad credit. I have no bills and I have money being thrown at me left and right, but cannot get a house for my family.

AHERA Certified Asbestos Inspectors
 If you have suspect materials in your home that you believe may contain asbestos, turn to PNWIG's asbestos testing
                                        for peace of mind. Asbestos has been used for years in building materials, paper products, plastics, and other
                                        products. Exposure mainly occurs in indoor air where it may be released from these materials. Effects on the lung
                                        are a major health concern from asbestos, as chronic [long-term] exposure to asbestos in humans via inhalation
                                        can result in lung disease. Asbestosis is characterized by shortness of breath and cough and may lead to severe
                                        impairment of respiratory function. Cancer is also a major concern from asbestos exposure, as inhalation exposure
                                        can cause lung cancer
                                        and mesothelioma, and possibly gastrointestinal cancers in humans. We offer testing for Residential and Commercial
                                        property owners, Demolition and remodeling contractors.
 
 


XRF Lead Paint Testing 
The reliability of home lead tests has come into question in recent years. In 2007, the Consumer Product Safety Commission
                                        (CPSC) tested 300 different home kits and found that more than half of them produced false negatives, or not accurately
                                        detecting the presence of lead. According to the study, if a lead-tainted object was covered with a non-lead based
                                        coating, the kits couldn't successfully identify the metal [source: CPSC]. Also, the time required for the swab
                                        to change colors ranged from a few minutes to a few hours, which could confuse some users. Consequently, the commission
                                        recommended that consumers rely on professional in-home lead testing services. On a more positive note, the commission
                                        found a 92 percent success rate with X-ray fluorescence (XRF) screenings of lead-tainted surfaces [source: CPSC].
                                        XRF evaluates the electron activity of elements in test areas in the presence of radiation. The radiation will
                                        ionize atoms by causing them to release low-energy electrons, which are then replaced in their orbital by higher-energy
                                        electrons [source: Wirth and Barth]. Depending on the wavelength, the energy emitted from the ionization process, the scanner can detect
                                        the element, such as lead, that it came from. However, XRF technology isn't generally available to the public,
                                        and it's used primarily by The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) agrees with the CPSC's findings. It advises
                                        people to consider professional testing when moving into houses built before 1978. Professional services will examine
                                        all of the painted surfaces in a house to determine whether and where any lead-based paint is present [source:
                                        EPA]. Beyond that, it's the responsibility of the home owner to decide the optimal method for removing it.
 
 


Granite Radiation Testing
Most radon exposure occurs due to radon that seeps into our homes through the foundation. Studies have shown that granite
                                        counter-tops can emit radon and radiation, but this is usually at very low levels that are well below the level
                                        occurring in most homes, and well below the limit recommended by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In
                                        some cases, however, the radon emitted from granite countertops has been significant.
 
 


LEED Green Building Testing
LEED Indoor Air Quality, Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ), is one aspect to the Leadership in Energy and Environmental
                                        Design (LEED). There are various elements under LEED in which indoor air quality is addressed. Points are awarded
                                        under LEED for various aspects of Green Building Design and Operations. Need LEED air Testing? Call Us.

EMF Onsite Testing
EMF testing can include a variety of alternating or direct current magnetic or electric fields. The most common sources
                                        for high electromagnetic fields include flaws in the internal building electrical wiring system, proximity to power-lines,
                                        transformers or appliances and stray currents on utility power-lines. We measure the various EMF field ranges with
                                        professional emf testing equipment and assess what type of and how much EMF radiation is present. Our reporting
                                        software then generates a complete report based on buildings EMF testing levels.
