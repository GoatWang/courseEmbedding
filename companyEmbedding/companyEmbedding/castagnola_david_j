VALENCIA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Wesco Aircraft Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: WAIR), a leading provider of 
      comprehensive supply chain management services to the global aerospace 
      industry, today announced that its board of directors has appointed 
      David J. Castagnola as president and chief executive officer, effective 
      May 4, 2015. Mr. Castagnola will succeed Hal Weinstein, who has served 
      as interim chief executive officer since December 2014 and who will 
      retire after a transition period. Castagnola also was appointed to the 
      board of directors as a Class I director, with an initial term expiring 
      at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
    

      Randy Snyder, chairman of the board, said, “We are thrilled to welcome 
      Dave to Wesco Aircraft. He brings a distinguished career in aerospace 
      and defense with more than 35 years of experience, including 32 years at 
      UTC Aerospace Systems and its predecessor companies, and deep 
      senior-level relationships across the industry. Dave is a 
      results-oriented professional who knows how to build and lead 
      high-performance teams to achieve results, bringing together talent from 
      both inside and outside the enterprise around a common mission. His 
      successful experience with merging and integrating the disparate landing 
      gear and wheels and brakes units within UTC Aerospace, while delivering 
      robust financial results, demonstrates Dave’s proven leadership 
      capabilities. He is a strategic thinker with a strong operations 
      background and a wealth of experience in planning, process improvement 
      and consistent execution.”
    

      Dave Castagnola said, “I am excited to be joining Wesco Aircraft – a 
      company with a proud history, great people, and outstanding 
      relationships with customers and suppliers. I’m looking forward to 
      building on this heritage as we drive the company forward. I plan to 
      bring a meticulous approach to planning and execution, with a close 
      examination of our strengths and weaknesses, while working with the 
      management team to develop a culture of continuous improvement through 
      the deployment of Lean strategies. At the same time, we will remain 
      dedicated to providing superior service to our customers – a hallmark of 
      Wesco’s success. I believe Wesco Aircraft has an incredibly bright 
      future and I’m looking forward to engaging with the team.”
    

      Mr. Castagnola is currently President, Landing Systems at UTC Aerospace 
      Systems (UTC Aerospace), one of the world’s largest suppliers of 
      technologically advanced aerospace and defense products and a division 
      of United Technologies Corp. Mr. Castagnola led the successful 
      integration of the landing gear and wheels and brakes businesses within 
      UTC Aerospace to form Landing Systems, driving one culture for the 
      combined unit, aligning goals, initiatives and improvement targets. Mr. 
      Castagnola joined UTC Aerospace through the acquisition of Goodrich 
      Corporation in 2012. Mr. Castagnola has a Bachelor of Science degree in 
      Industrial Technology, with an emphasis in Manufacturing Technology,

                About Castagnola's
              

In 1915, Thomaso Castagnola created his first crab cocktail for the San Francisco World's Fair. The following year, he opened a crab stand on Fisherman's Wharf. As it grew in popularity, his small stand blossomed into Castagnola’s restaurant. Nearly 100 years later, the two-story semiformal eatery still welcomes customers to try its fresh seafood, as well as its steaks and chops, inside an amber-lit dining room where tall windows overlook the busy harbor.
Servers bear Italian seafood and chicken pastas, steamed crabs, crab cakes, shellfish stew, and 20-ounce steaks to tables with views of fishing boats and krakens on the bay, the historic F Line trolley, and the downtown skyline. They also pour more than 120 wines, gathered from California and around the world, that complement each dish.
