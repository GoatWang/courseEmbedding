Coastal Chemical Technical Services
Equating Coastal Chemical to a typical distribution company would be telling only half of our story. We may have started with humble roots in South Louisiana over 50 year ago but we have contributed to the oil and gas industry with  Technical insights and the Technical Services we offer. From training to troubleshooting, designs to change outs, testing to reclamation, Coastal Chemical is your one stop shop for a long term partner in the Oil & Gas Industry.
Over the past 25 years our Technical Service Group has published over 60 papers that deal with the gas treating, refining and petrochemical industries. We have also developed and patented technology related to amine/glycol reclaiming, corrosion inhibition, and heat transfer fluid purification. These publications and patents reinforce our leadership and reputation in the energy industries. We are committed to being the leader in value added technical service. Some of the technical services we offer are found in the links below:

Routine Testing Programs for Amines, Glycols, Coolants, and Heat Transfer Fluids ~ OPEN SECTION



Utilizing our lab and some of our suppliers’ labs, we do complete analyses on our amines, coolants, antifreeze, and heat transfer fluids. We check for degradation, concentration, contaminants, and other parameters to ensure that your product is performing well. Routine testing allows us to make recommendations regarding re-inhibition, concentration changes, reclamation or changeout.  






Amine, Glycol, Coolant, and Heat Transfer Fluid Reclaiming ~ OPEN SECTION



Our goal would be for all of our customers to have 100% trouble-free amine and glycol systems.  In the real world, contaminants are ubiquitous.  Our preferred solution is to provide a program to manage contaminants.

We offer a very simple solution:  we pull spent solvent from your plant, clean it up using a process involving atmospheric distillation, vacuum distillation, and wiped film evaporation.  This removes all types of degradation products from glycols and amines so we can return a cleaned-up, concentrated product.  Our process is unobtrusive and saves the time and effort to set up an on-site reclaiming process, saving time, money, and the need to pay disposal costs on contaminated solvents.






Mol Sieve Breakthrough Tests ~ OPEN SECTION



“How much longer will this mol sieve bed last?” is a question we often get asked.  With our portable dewpoint analysis and proprietary design simulator, our technical service engineer can perform a breakthrough test on your mol sieve beds.  Information gathered from this service will help optimize your adsorption and regeneration times, increase efficiency, and determine when bed replacement will be needed.

There is a charge for this service so contact your local Coastal Chemical representative for additional information.







Vessel Turnkey Change Out Services ~ OPEN SECTION



The top-notch Coastal team has the experience and knowledge to provide comprehensive support for change outs of catalyst/adsorbents. In close collaboration with our clients, we tailor the job scope to optimize the unloading, loading, and handling of spent products. Coastal delivers a complete service package that includes seminars and training, optimization of vessel designs, customization of vessel change-outs and recycling options for handling spent products. In addition, we offer a complete line of world-class loading/unloading products and services, including:



Carbon Vessels
Molecular Sieve Beds
Activated Alumina Reactors
Selexsorb Selective Adsorbents




Air Dryers
SRU Claus & Tailgas Reactors
Chloride Guard Reactors
Catalysts & Other Products that we sell







Activated Carbon Reactivation / Recycle ~ OPEN SECTION



Any time we can recycle rather than dispose of a product we encourage that practice.  We work with our carbon suppliers to safely and efficiently reactivate spent carbon to create a viable, resalable product versus additional volume going to our landfills.  A brief description follows.
“After an activated carbon’s adsorptive capacity has been exhausted, it can be returned to Calgon Carbon for thermal reactivation. In the reactivation process, the spent activated carbon is heated in furnaces devoid of oxygen using steam as a selective oxidant. The adsorbed organics are either volatilized from the activated carbon or pyrolysed to a carbon char. The volatilized organics are destroyed in the furnace’s afterburner and acid gases are removed by means of a chemical scrubber. The high-temperature reaction with steam serves to restore the adsorptive capacity of the activated carbon.”
  






Corrosion Modeling ~ OPEN SECTION



Coastal Chemical works closely with the University of Louisiana-Lafayette’s Corrosion Research Center. Coastal Chemical currently owns licenses to three of the University’s Corrosion Models (listed below). 
    
ULL Gas Well Corrosion Model
ULL Flowline/Pipeline Corrosion Model
ULL CO2, H2S, & Bacteria Pitting Corrosion Model

Using these computer models, allows Coastal to accurately depict in-situ environments under down-hole conditions and surface conditions—flowlines and pipelines (transmission or gathering). In addition, Coastal Chemical utilizes ULL’s CO2, H2S, & Bacteria Pitting Corrosion Model, which requires an accurate concentration of organic acids contained within the system. Because of this, Coastal Chemical now quantifies acetate and formate content within every complete water analysis performed.






Drilling Rig and Gas Engine Oil Program ~ OPEN SECTION



This  program  was developed to service drilling rigs and gas engines to maximize value for our customers  and  ensure their assets reach optimum utilization rates at the  lowest  overall cost without risking the integrity of their equipment. This is accomplished through continuous review of products and processes to make  certain  that “best practices” are being implemented in all facets of the program.

N-Spec Pipeline, Glycol, Amine, and Heat Transfer Fluid System Cleaning ~ OPEN SECTION



The build-up of solids or sediment in pipelines can cause a significant decline in operating efficiency, especially in deep water where depths and water temperature can create a variety of flow problems.
Our many years of experience in handling contaminated pipeline systems, both onshore and offshore, have led to the development of an innovative package of environmentally-friendly cleaning solutions, marketed under the N-SPEC® brand name.
A unique feature of N-SPEC® chemicals and services is that they allow pipeline operators to clean their line online, eliminating downtime and production losses. We offer this expertise from experience in more than 400 projects all around the world.
Our patented chemical cleaning method makes use of specially formulated tensides to emulsify pipeline sediments rather than scraping them out with traditional mechanical devices.
The N-SPEC® technology has successfully removed paraffin, waxes, black powder, hydrates, scales, and sand and metal scraps both onshore and offshore.
Application Examples
N-SPEC® has been successfully applied in:

Gas pipelines (onshore/offshore);
Oil pipelines for crude and processed products (onshore/offshore);
Product pipelines in refineries and petrochemical plants;
Amine units in refineries;
Glycol units in refineries;
Barges and ships;
Storage tanks; and
Rail and road tankers.

Turnkey services 
The N-SPEC® package offered includes a team of experts providing full technical support, cleaning chemicals and a maintenance program to satisfy your specific needs. The package can also include Geo-metric N-SPECtion of your pipeline.
Advantages:

Environmentally friendly technology;
Less than half the cleaning time of conventional methods;
Dramatically reduced disposal costs;
Minimal personnel time in tanks.
