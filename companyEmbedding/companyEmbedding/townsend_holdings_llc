The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Thinking beyond      
the expected.Tailored intelligence. Real asset solutions.













In memory of our dear colleague and friend, Kevin Lynch.
Kevin co-founded The Townsend Group with our CEO, Terry Ahern, in 1983. During that time, he was a driving force in the growth of our great company, a friend to us all, and a constant source of encouragement and laughter for those of us who were fortunate to know him well.  Kevin’s energy, light-heartedness and optimism will be missed by all at our firm.
