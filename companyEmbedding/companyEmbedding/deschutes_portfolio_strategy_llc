Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60) 

DAYS





      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
Starting Quarter

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.

Leaving Your Employer?

A 401(k) account offers great flexibility when job changes occur, but it’s important to understand your options.  Our advisors at Deschutes can answer your questions and help you make the best decision for your personal situation.




Withdraw Your Money (Lump Sum Distribution)
Advantages

Access to your money, should you need it.

Disadvantages

If you are under age 59 1/2, your withdrawal will be subject to a 10% IRS penalty and 20% tax withholding, unless you meet strict IRS exception guidelines.  For more information, contact Deschutes Portfolio Strategies or your tax advisor.
Any withdrawal from your retirement savings - even a small amount – will hurt your overall long-term goals.







Roll over to an IRA
Advantages

You may invest in a wide-array of investment options, including stocks, bonds, or mutual funds.
By consolidating your retirement accounts, it is easier to manage and track what you own.
No taxes or penalties for doing a rollover, and there is no limit to how many rollovers you may request during your career.
If permitted, you may be allowed to move your IRA into a future employer’s plan.

Disadvantages
For some people, the investment flexibility offered by an IRA is overwhelming.  If you do not have the time or expertise to make investment decisions yourself, you may want to consider teaming-up with a financial advisor.
Contact us at Deschutes Portfolio Strategies for a free consultation to discuss how we can assist with your Rollover IRA.






Remain in 401(k) Plan

Advantages

You can continue to take advantage of the investment options offered in the plan and make changes as necessary
At a later date, you can move out of your previous employer’s plan and into your new employer’s plan, if allowed.

Disadvantages

You are limited to the investment options available within the plan.
You may not contribute to your account.
Some plans require you maintain a minimum balance to stay in the plan (often $5,000).

IRA Rollover

The most convenient and flexible option for your retirement plan money is a Rollover Individual Retirement Account, or Rollover IRA. With a few easy steps, your retirement plan funds will move directly to your new IRA completely tax-free, without penalties. And, you’ll still benefit from tax-deferred growth until you begin taking withdrawals, just as in your former retirement plan.
The greatest benefit of a Rollover IRA with Deschutes is the professional guidance and expertise you’ll receive and the peace-of-mind that you have a trusted partner helping you achieve your financial goals.
Advantages

You may invest in a wide-array of investment options, including stocks, bonds, or mutual funds.
By consolidating your retirement accounts, it is easier to manage and track what you own.
No taxes or penalties for doing a rollover, and there is no limit to how many rollovers you may request during your career.
If permitted, you may be allowed to move your IRA into a future employer’s plan.

Disadvantages
For some people, the investment flexibility offered by an IRA is overwhelming.  If you do not have the time or expertise to make investment decisions yourself, you may want to consider teaming-up with a financial advisor. 
 
For more information on the advantages of a Rollover IRA, visit our “Leaving Your Employer” page or contact a rollover specialist at Deschutes directly at 855-210-3001.
