We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the common stock offered 
through this Prospectus by the selling shareholders.


The company is aware of other consulting companies in the industry providing 
service for business, employee, and customer relationships. We have not located 
information for any other company or firm that is currently providing the 
services that we offer or with the focused approach of YGCG, which is 
maintaining the business owner/employee and customer relationships. 

There may be consultants that assist business owners with attracting and 
retaining clients. At YGCG, we focus on providing the means to establish and 
maintain the personal aspect of the relationship.


Company Description
Ygeia Consulting Group, Inc. (hereinafter "YGCG") is incorporated in the State
of Florida in June 2014. We were formed as a consultant to the Healthcare
industry. The Healthcare industry is subject to constant change due to market
trends, thereby making it extremely competitive. The Healthcare


 industry is
complex, because several segments are regulated by both federal and state
governments. YGCG's approach assists general business operations with the growth
and development, international expansion and marketing aspects of their
business, allowing our potential customers to focus on the business aspects of
operations. By using the services provided by YGCG, our clients are free to
focus on compliance with regulations within their industry, and to complete
their primary business goals.

Ygeia Consulting Group, Inc. focuses on three main aspects of the consulting
business: operations management, international expansion strategy and marketing.
Assisting business owners to build strong relationships with their vendors,
partners and contractors will allow our client companies to add business
stability through retention of key personnel, project success and brand
sustainability.

Our programs will be tailored to meet the needs and requests of our clients. We
will assist our clients with growth by increasing their customer base and
assisting their operations and growth management in new markets.

We will provide customized business strategies, based upon client preference,
which may include any or all of the following:

  · International and domestic corporate development strategies;

  · Strategic and financial partnering specific to healthcare revenue;

  · Project management;

  · Seminars and Special Events; and,

  · Marketing.

The company has consulted on a number of projects on a pro-bono basis to
establish a strong corporate history toward obtaining a strong paying client
base. The rate charged for our services will be dependent upon the level of
consulting services the client company is interested in utilizing and the
complexity of the client company business. YGCG consulting fees will be
negotiated and established based upon factors such as the level of services
requested by the client.

Thus far we have marketed our services primarily to Healthcare organizations
located in the United States of America (the "U.S."). YGCG has been doing
business since inception, June 2014.  Originally formed to do any and all legal
business, the intent of the corporation was to specialize in corporate
development and growth management consultation.  Tania Martin-Mercado, our
president has been involved in the company since inception and is the founder.
We focus on geographic areas, projects and budget levels where we believe there
are significant demand for our services and the potential for attractive returns
to our company and investors. We do not consider our company to be a "blank
check company" as such term is defined in Securities and Exchange Commission
Rule 419; however, we are a company with minimal revenues and limited operations
and our auditor has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as
a going concern. The company is not a "blank-check company" and is not being
formed for the purposes of a reverse merger or any other like transaction. The
company has no present plans to be acquired or to merge with another company nor
does the company, nor any of its shareholders, have plans to enter into a change
of control or similar transaction The company does now and will continue to
operate as an advisory company, on a fee-based compensation basis, for
independent clients requiring our expertise, experience and international
contact networks. Any acquisitions that the company may make in the future,
would be of companies similar in nature to our own, operating in similar or
complementary industry segments or geographic location; that would provide YGCG
with new growth opportunities or competitive advantage. However, even though our
business plan does contemplate potential growth through the acquisition of
specialty service providers and other independent consulting services companies
that would complement our business plan we are first and foremost a business
consulting company YGCG anticipates growth through the consolidation of
consulting service providers, proprietary processes and small to mid-sized
independent management consulting companies that operate in related industries.
Our management has designed an aggressive but straightforward strategy to
transition YGCG to a full service independent consultant to the Healthcare
industry solutions provider in addition to our consulting with minimal risk to
the existing operation.

We believe that our conduct to date evidences significant, bona fide business
operations and a scenario that is wholly inapposite to any attempt to create the
mere appearance of a specific business plan and effort to avoid the application
of Rule 419.

The Company is focused on addressing areas of business, which concentrate on
healthcare business operations, hospital operations, healthcare information
technology trends, and those related components that assist in advancing
healthcare on a national and global scale. These include:

1. Healthcare Strategy and Planning

2. Accountable Care Organizations

3. Healthcare Information Technology

4. Business Intelligence and Analysis

5. Healthcare Reform Trends and Analysis

Who Needs a Breast Pump?
 
 
 





Moms with Concerns
						 A mother whose baby is not nursing well (or not nursing at all). 
					
 
 
 




Moms who Work
						 A mother who plans to return to full- or part-time work and wants to provide breast milk for baby. 
					
 
 
 




Moms who Need More
						 A mother who needs to increase milk supply. 
					
 
 
 
 


What is Included with Your Breast Pump?
 
 
 











 










 







 
 


How Do You Clean Your Breast Pump?
 
Remove tubing and dual-port filter and set them aside in a clean dry area.
Separate flanges from collection containers and remove valves from flanges.
Thoroughly hand wash the flanges, valves, collection containers, rings and
covers with a soft cloth in warm, soapy water. Rinse completely. Automatic dish washing is not recommended. DO NOT WASH OR WET THE TUBING OR DUAL-PORT FILTERS UNLESS THEY COME IN CONTACT WITH MILK.
Allow all parts to air dry on a clean towel or drying rack.
Do not wash tubing or dual-port filter.
 
 
 


How Do You Get Started?
 

Plug in power cord into any standard electrical outlet.
Attach the other end of the power adapter to the pump.
Twist the threaded dual-port filter onto the front of the pump in a clockwise motion until secured. A slight gap between the pump and dual-port filter is normal.
Place the loose end of the tubing on each stem of the dual-port filter.
If you wish to pump one breast only, secure the port cap on one stem of the filter.
Securely install valve on underside of flange.
Push the orange end of each tube into the back of each flange.
Secure each milk collection container by twisting it onto each flange.

 
 
 


How Do You Pump?
 

N

Wash Your Hands
						 Always wash your hands thoroughly before handling your breast pump and accessories. 
					
 
 

N

Get Comfortable & Relax
						 Warm packs and/or gentle breast massage before you begin pumping may help with milk production. Plan to pump just one breast at a time while you are learning, capping off one stem of the filter (see Getting Started above). Center the flange(s) over your nipple(s). 
					
 
 

N

Adjust Speed
						 To begin pumping, turn the upper ON/OFF Speed dial clockwise to an upright position. Leave the lower Strength dial at a minimum setting until your milk begins to flow, then reduce the pump Speed and increase the suction Strength gradually to the highest level that is comfortable for you. 
					
 
 

N

Disassemble
						 When your pumping session is complete, turn off the pump and unplug the tubing from the back of the flanges. Unscrew the breastmilk storage container and properly store your breastmilk. 
					
 
 

N

Clean Up
						 After every use, please follow the instructions in the Cleaning Section above to ensure necessary parts are cleaned before the next use.

As a veteran mom, you’ve just about got this thing figured out.  You’re stronger, more prepared and the experience shows.

Stay at Home Moms (SAHM)


The importance of your job cannot be put into words. You will spend countless, irreplaceable hours, full of the most precious moments with your child. Is a pump even necessary when you don’t plan to leave your child? You need a pump that is convenient and easy to use in a moment’s notice. When you overproduce or have trouble with latching? We’re there for you with resources and support. When you are spending an evening away?

We can help you. Read how you can get more.
 






 






First Time Moms

First time moms like you are excited and just a little nervous.  No matter how much research you do on the internet, with your friends, in the stacks of books you have next to your bed, you can always find one more thing to learn, to prepare for.  Our job at Hygeia is to make sure you are as prepared as you can be.  We give you the resources and support you need to have a successful pregnancy and breastfeeding experience.  Not sure about your breastfeeding options?  Or what experience is right for you and your baby?  We’re here to help.

 
 
+1 Moms

 
As a veteran mom, you’ve just about got this thing figured out.  You’re stronger, more prepared and the experience shows. What you also know is that every child is different.  Your needs and questions change depending on the uniqueness of your littlest one.  Get help with feeding the newest addition to your family or order a few more accessories and parts for your pump.  No matter what you need today, we’re here to make sure your baby’s tomorrow is a great one.
 
 
Stay at Home Moms (SAHM)


The importance of your job cannot be put into words. You will spend countless, irreplaceable hours, full of the most precious moments with your child. Is a pump even necessary when you don’t plan to leave your child? You need a pump that is convenient and easy to use in a moment’s notice. When you overproduce or have trouble with latching? We’re there for you with resources and support. When you are spending an evening away? From a hospital-grade personal-use breast pump to breast pump accessories, we make it simple to pump conveniently and quickly, even when you aren’t in daily practice.  

 
 
Working Moms

Take a breath.  We know you have trouble slowing down.  Working moms know how to maximize the minutes in every hour, and you need a breastfeeding experience that works right along side you.  Do what’s right for you and for your baby by working smart and efficiently. Use the best breast pump that’s going to be there for you on the run and when you find a moment of quiet time.  Need lactation advice or a quick opinion?  Our consultation connections will get you headed in the right direction quickly. Learn more.

 
 
Moms of Multiples (MOMs)

Each of your babies is a unique little human, even if they happen to be identical on the outside.  Figuring out what each of them need and facing each individual challenge can be a tough job.  We understand and want to help you every step of the way.  Keep your nursing station(s) stocked and ready with additional breast pump accessories and other things you might need like drinks, snacks, etc.  When it’s time to nurse or pump, make sure you’re ready with the best breast pump for all of your little ones.
