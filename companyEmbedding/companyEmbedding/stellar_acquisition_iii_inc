We are offering 6,500,000 units at an offering price of $10.00 per unit. We
estimate that the net proceeds of this offering together with the funds we will

forth in the following table.

(1) Includes amounts payable to public shareholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) In addition, a portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the
    proceeds of loans from certain of our sponsors of up to $250,000 in the
    aggregate that we may draw down as described in this prospectus. These loans
    will be repaid upon completion of this offering out of the $725,000 of
    offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering
    expenses other than underwriting commissions. In the event that offering
    expenses are less than set forth in this table, any such amounts will be
    used for post-closing working capital expenses.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to2.5%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial
    business combination, up to $1,625,000, which constitutes the underwriters’
    deferred commissions (or up to $1,868,750 if the underwriters’ 
    over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters
    from the funds held in the trust account, such amount to be reduced pro rata
    based on the number of shares of common stock that are redeemed by our
    shareholders in connection with our business combination, and the remaining
    funds, less amounts released to the trustee to pay redeeming shareholders,
    will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the 
    purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial business
    combination occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of
    principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our 
    initial business combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or
    for working capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest
    accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.

(4) Of the proceeds we receive from this offering and the sale of the private
    placement warrants described in this prospectus, $66.3 million or 
    approximately $76.25 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
    exercised in full ($10.20 per unit), will initially be deposited into a
    trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as 
    trustee.  We will have until 12 months from the closing of this offering to
    consummate our initial business combination. However, if we anticipate that
    we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination within 12
    months, we may extend the period of time to consummate a business
    combination up to three times, each by an additional three months (for a 
    total of up to 21 months to complete a business combination). In order to
    extend the time available for us to consummate our initial business
    combination, our sponsors or their affiliates or designees must deposit into
    the trust account $379,167, or $436,042 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
    option is exercised in full ($0.058 per unit in either case), up to an 
    aggregate of $1,137,501 (or $1,308,126 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
    option is exercised in full), or $0.175 per unit, prior to the applicable
    deadline for each three month extension.

(5) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or
    all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For 
    example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry 
    subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In 
    addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which 
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in
    the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust
    account. Based on the current interest rate environment, we would expect
    approximately $348,000 to be available to us from interest earned on the 
    funds held in the trust account over 21 months following the closing of this
    offering; however, we can provide no assurances regarding this amount. This 
    estimate assumes an interest rate of 0.3% per annum based upon current
    yields of securities in which the trust account may be invested.

(6) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for
    financing.

The rules of the NASDAQ Capital Market provide that at least 90% of the gross
proceeds from this offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants, approximately $66,300,000 (or approximately $76,245,000 if
the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), including up to
$1,625,000 (or up to $1,868,750 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full) of deferred underwriting commissions, will initially be
placed in a trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting
as trustee, subject to increase in the event that our sponsors elect to extend
the period of time to consummate a business combination, and will be invested
only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in
money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the
Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury
obligations. We estimate that the interest earned on the trust account will be
approximately $198,900 per year, assuming an interest rate of 0.3% per year. We
will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or interest held in the
trust account, except for the withdrawal of interest to pay taxes or working
capital expenses (which may include repayment of loans made to us by the
sponsors or the application of withdrawn or accrued interest to the sponsors’
obligation to loan us money in connection with an extension), until the earlier
of (i) the completion of our initial business combination or (ii) the redemption
of 100% of our public shares if we are unable to complete a business combination
within 12 months from the closing of this offering (or up to 21 months from the
closing of this offering if we extend the period of time to consummate a
business combination, as described in more detail in this prospectus) (subject
to the requirements of law). Depending on interest rates, interest earned on the
trust account may not be sufficient to pay taxes or a substantial portion of
working capital expenses.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using stock or debt
securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for
payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination, we may
apply the balance of the cash released from the trust account for general
corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the
post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on
indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund
the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We have entered into an Administrative Services Agreement pursuant to which we
will pay an affiliate of our executive officers a total of $10,000 per month for
office space, utilities and secretarial support. Upon completion of our initial
business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly
fees.

As of the date of this prospectus, certain of our sponsors have agreed to loan
us up to $250,000 in the aggregate to be used for a portion of the expenses of
this offering. These loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at
the earlier of December 31, 2016 or the closing of this offering. These loans
will be repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the $725,000 of offering
proceeds that has been allocated to the payment of offering expenses.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account including interest permitted to be withdrawn as
described herein. In the event that our initial business combination does not
close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust
account including interest permitted to be withdrawn as described herein to
repay such loaned amounts but no other proceeds from our trust account would be
used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $2,000,000 of such loans (including any
loans made in connection with the extension of the time available for us to
consummate our initial business combination) may be convertible into warrants of
the post-business combination entity at a price of $0.50 per warrant at the
option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement
warrants. All other terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any,
have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such
loans.

If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either
prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination.
However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon the consummation of our business
combination (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and
the agreement for our business combination may require as a closing condition
that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public
shareholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net
tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements, we would not
proceed with the redemption of our public shares or the business combination,
and instead may search for an alternate business combination.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those shares of our common stock
that such shareholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations
described herein, (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
complete our business combination within 12 months from the closing of this 
offering (or up to 21 months from the closing of this offering if we extend the
period of time to consummate a business combination, as described in more detail
in this prospectus), following the closing of this offering, subject to
applicable law and as further described herein and any limitations (including
but not limited to cash requirements) created by the terms of the proposed
business combination or (iii) the redemption of our public shares in connection
with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated
articles of incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of our
obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an
initial business combination within 12 months from the closing of this offering
(or up to 21 months from the closing of this offering if we extend the period of
time to consummate a business combination, as described in more detail in this
prospectus), from the closing of our initial public offering. In no other
circumstances will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account.

Our initial shareholders have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant
to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their
founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our
initial business combination. In addition, our initial shareholders have agreed
to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with
respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our business combination
within the prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our
officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this
offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust
account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial
business combination within the prescribed time frame.


In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our business
combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a
business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies,
private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses
seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and
have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations
directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess
greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to
acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial
resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the
acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in
connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may
reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and
our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent,
may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these
factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating
an initial business combination.


Company Description
We are a newly-organized blank check company formed pursuant to the laws of the
Republic of the Marshall Islands for the purpose of acquiring, through a merger,
capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization,
recapitalization, exchangeable share transaction or other


 similar business
transaction with one or more operating businesses or assets that we have not yet
identified. We intend to focus our efforts on seeking and completing an initial
business combination with a company that has an enterprise value of between $250
million and $500 million, although a target entity with a smaller or larger
enterprise value may be considered. While our efforts in identifying a
prospective target business for our initial business combination will not be
limited to a particular industry or geographic region, we will initially focus
our search on identifying a prospective target business in the international
energy logistics industry. We do not have any specific merger, capital stock
exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, recapitalization,
exchangeable share transaction or other similar business transaction under
consideration and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, contacted any
prospective target business or had any discussions, formal or otherwise, with
respect to such a transaction.

We have assembled a group of directors, including independent directors, who
will provide public company governance, executive leadership, operations
oversight, private equity investment management and capital markets experience.
Our Board members have extensive experience, having served as directors, CEO’s
or CFO’s, or in other executive and advisory capacities for publicly-listed and
privately-owned companies. Our directors have experience with acquisitions, 
divestitures and corporate strategy and implementation, which we believe will be
of significant benefit to us as we evaluate potential acquisition or merger
candidates as well as following the completion of our initial business 
combination.

We believe that the international oil and gas logistics, land and maritime oil
and gas transportation, terminal and energy storage industries, which we refer
to in this prospectus as the “energy logistics industry,” presents attractive
opportunities for consolidation and growth and a favorable area in which to
attempt to consummate a business combination. Our executive officers and
directors have an aggregate of over 80 years of experience in the energy
logistics industry, as managers, principals or directors of major worldwide
maritime companies, where they have sourced, negotiated and structured
transactions in these industries. We intend to leverage the industry experience
of our executive officers, including their contacts and relationships, by
focusing our efforts on identifying a prospective target business in the
international energy logistics industry. While the amount of time our executive
officers will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target
business has been selected for the initial business combination and the stage of
the initial business combination process the company is in, we expect Messrs.
Tsirigakis and Syllantavos to devote, in the aggregate, an average of
approximately 20 hours per week to our business.
