               Company: University of North Florida
Job Details
               With UNF becoming less of a commuter school and more of a four-year university, the athletics department hopes to get more students involved with the sports programs on campus. The athletics department has started a movement called Osprey Nation that looks to band current UNF students into one of the rowdiest groups of student fans in the Atlantic Sun. Former UNF student Joshua Baker is leading the charge. Baker, who graduated from UNF in 2010, began working with the athletics department in mid-2011. Baker said schools similar to UNF already have student groups in place, such as the Rowdy Reptiles of the University of Florida and the Knightmare student group of the University of Central Florida. "We wanted to come together and create something that would excite the students, and we [the athletics department] think Osprey Nation is the thing that can do that," Baker said. This is the first year for the group, and the athletics department has expressed it will be a challenge to spread the word to current students. In order to make news about the group more widespread, the department has taken to social and electronic media to gain attention from students on campus. Osprey Nation has a page on the athletics website, a Facebook page and its own Twitter account in order to offer more information on the group. An issue that could possibly deter some students to sign up for the Nation is the fact that only current students can be in the group. The group is not open to alumni of the school, but Baker doesn't feel this issue will cause students to turn down the opportunity to be a part of a new uprising in fan support at the school. "The goal was to get our younger students involved," Baker said. Another prevalent issue is the group doesn't typically sit together at sporting events. At basketball games, you can see groups of students wearing an Osprey Nation T-Shirt, but the groups are spread out, and there is no definite section for crazy Osprey faithfuls. "The biggest thing with that [the lack of a combined section] is we do have a number of students who are signed up … but they don't always want to sit in section five, they want to sit with their friends," Baker said. With the group, UNF Athletics has brought a new culture to fan support at the school. In order for students to join the group, they must pay $10 a year, or they can sign up for a four-year plan for $30, if they are freshmen or juniors who are planning on taking graduate classes.

This program addressed the rise in Jacksonville's crime and resulted in a multifaceted approach which was implemented by Mayor Peyton. Mr. Rood is a board member of the Tiger Academy which provides the children of Jacksonville's northwest quadrant a structured and nurturing learning environment. In 2009, Ambassador Rood was appointed by Florida Governor Crist as the Republican Party of Florida Finance Chairman. Since May of 2009, Mr. Rood has served on the board of Alico Inc. (ALCO). Mr. Rood is a current member of the Florida Council of 100. In January 2010, Mr. Rood was appointed by Governor Crist to serve on the Board of Governors of the State University System.

Department History
Since its creation in 1789, the Department of State has carried out a series
                        of reorganizations and has created new offices and bureaus to deal with new
                        diplomatic challenges.
This portion of our website contains a short history of the
                            department, biographies of the Secretaries of State, a database of Principal
                            Officers and Chiefs of Mission, and a history of the buildings of the Department
                            of State.
The Department of State has grown significantly over the years. The first
                        Secretary of State, Thomas Jefferson, oversaw a small staff of one chief
                        clerk, three other clerks, a translator, and a messenger and only maintained
                        two diplomatic posts, in London and Paris, as well as 10 consular posts. 
World War I (1914–1918) and World War II (1939–1945) brought vastly increased
                        global responsibilities to the United States as it emerged as a preeminent
                        power. New challenges after the end of the Cold War and the fall of the
                        Soviet Union, included: 
the newly independent states,
the global economy,
terrorism, and
the security of the American overseas presence. 

To address these changing global circumstances, the number of domestic and
                        overseas employees (not counting local employees) grew to: 
1,228 in 1900,
1,968 in 1940,
13,294 in 1960,
and 15,751 in the year 2000.

The number of diplomatic posts increased from 41 in 1900 to 168 in 2004 and
                        continues to grow.

Rood John D



















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Florida:













Does Rood John D carry a valid contracting license?



If you pay someone to construct a building or a structure, make structural alterations to load bearing walls, or perform services such as plumbing or air conditioning work, that person must have a state contractor's license.
Rood John D currently holds license FRO3081, 0003081 (Construction Financial Officer), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Florida?



The Florida Construction Industry License Board maintains high standards for contractor licensing. Prior to receiving their license, Florida contractors are required to prove four years of relevant work experience or education; pass a board examination and prove financial solvency.











Your liability risk when hiring Rood John D



In Florida, licensed contractors with employees are required to carry workers' compensation insurance and attest they have obtained public liability and property damage insurance in the amounts determined by the Board.











Financial recourse when hiring Rood John D



Florida maintains a recovery fund, called the Florida Homeowners' Construction Recovery Fund, which is available to a natural person who has suffered monetary damages by the financial mismanagement or misconduct of a contractor, and who has exhausted all other sources of payment. The Board makes the determination of eligibility for an award. Florida contractors are not required to carry an active bond.











What else should I know before hiring Rood John D



As of 2007, the Florida DBPR began requiring license applicants to submit their fingerprints, which are used to run a criminal background check with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. In addition, they are required to provide a credit report during the license application process to demonstrate financial stability. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Florida Construction Industry License Board recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
