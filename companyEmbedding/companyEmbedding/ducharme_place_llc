DuCharme Place, Detroit’s Premier Downtown Apartment Community



Share Article


















Groundbreaking Planned for June 11th.







DuCharme Place, Detroit Michigan



Detroit, Michigan (PRWEB)
April 02, 2015
 The City of Detroit will soon proudly welcome its most significant new residential development in nearly half a century.  Nestled in historic Lafayette Park designed by world-renowned architect Mies van der Rohe,  DuCharme Place is a 185 unit, $42 million upscale residential community that will begin construction at 1544 E. Lafayette, just east of the iconic 1300 East Lafayette Building.  Scheduled to accept residents in the first quarter of 2016, DuCharme will support the City and local employers by serving the growing need for high-quality housing in a market where rental occupancy exceeds 97%. 
Set in a lush, park-like landscaped area amongst the simple steel and glass structures of Lafayette Park which epitomize the International Style of architecture, DuCharme will find its place amongst the masterpieces of Detroit’s urban gems. DuCharme is positioned to be Detroit’s premier greater downtown community with all the amenities and conveniences of contemporary living.  
DuCharme is being developed by well-known local developer, Walter Cohen, who developed Stroh River Place, The Park Shelton along with more than 1,000 other apartments in the City. Over the past 30 years, Cohen and his affiliates have developed and built more than 3,000 apartments in the Metropolitan Detroit Area.  Mr. Cohen commissioned McIntosh Poris to design DuCharme and Sachse Construction to build it.  Long-term HUD mortgage financing was recently secured.
DuCharme is within walking distance to the attractions and employment of the Central Business District, adjacent to the Dequindre Cut and a short stroll from the River Walk. It is within close proximity to all main thoroughfares serving the downtown area and is conveniently located near public transportation.  
The luxury new construction will offer an attractive floor plan mix with sizes ranging from 500 to over 1,000 square feet and rents in the $900 to $1,800 range.  The apartment mix includes 107 two-bedrooms, 66 one-bedrooms and 12 studios.  Each apartment will have dedicated, secured, enclosed, on-site parking along with a large range of on-site amenities not currently present in the market.  With an open air feel and modern kitchen appliances, a large glass enclosed fully-equipped fitness center, rooftop gardens, high speed Internet, fully connected business center, 24/7 full-site monitored security and a resort style swimming pool with deck, residents will experience an oasis within Detroit.  DuCharme will have a one-of-a-kind, private 1.5 acre sky terrace where residents can relax amongst plush landscaping, a Zen meditation area and a unique barbequing area.  Select apartments will feature private balconies/terraces, fireplaces, steam showers and dual master suite for private shared living arrangements.  Apartment finishes include hardwood flooring, upgraded tile, designer cabinetry with stainless steel appliances, in-unit washer/dryer and built-in dishwashers. 
“DuCharme’s private, serene living is steps away from the vibrancy of downtown. With beautiful views of the Detroit River from the DuCharme Sky Terrace, residents will be able to meditate at the Zen gardens, relax with friends at the pool or enjoy a bike ride or run on the Dequindre Cut. We are excited to be the first to bring such a unique living environment to Detroit,” shared David Cohen, Co-Managing Member, DuCharme Place, LLC.
Through Detroit’s recent resurgence, the central business district has become a significant center for entertainment and the arts, with expanding theater districts, the presence of three major professional sporting venues, and the opening of three casinos. Further, major employers have moved back into the City. This significant influx has created additional demand for rental units in and around the greater downtown area.
“It is these positive developments that prompted us to continue our long-term investment in the City and build our next major community here. We are privileged to have industry leaders in our own backyard dedicated to the continued growth of the greater downtown area and look forward to long-term relationships with the many companies fueling the growth of our urban core,” affirms Mr. Cohen.

Groundbreaking for DuCharme Place in Detroit is set for June 11.
 


Construction on the $42 million DuCharme Place apartment development in Lafayette Park is scheduled to begin in June, and the development will begin accepting residents in its 185 planned units in the first quarter of next year.
Plans call for 12 studio units, 66 one-bedroom and 107 two-bedrooms apartments. DuCharme Place is being developed by DuCharme Place LLC, the co-managing member of which is Walter Cohen of 21 Century Holdings, who has been behind other city developments like Stroh River Place, University Club, the Park Shelton and the Franklin Wright Village.
A groundbreaking is scheduled for June 11, according to Mark Bennett, managing director of Birmingham-based MJBennett PLLC, which is providing legal and advisory services to Cohen on the development.
Located at 1544 E. Lafayette Blvd., the four-building development will have apartments ranging from 500 to more than 1,000 square feet that will rent from $900 to $1,800 per month.
The 3-acre project site is vacant land.
There will be on-site parking, a fitness center, rooftop gardens, a business center, a swimming pool and around-the-clock security, according to a news release. Some units will have private balconies or terraces, and fireplaces.
Project funding comes from a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development mortgage, state equity and brownfield tax credits, among other sources.
Detroit-based Sachse Construction is the general contractor on the project. Birmingham-based McIntosh Poris Associates is the project architect.

DuCharme Place – Lafayette Park
Ten years since architects came up with design plans for a town home community in Lafayette Park, the DuCharme Place residential project is ready to take off—this time with a scaled-down design and backed by a $5 million tax increment awarded by the Detroit Brownfield Redevelopment Authority.
The vacant parcel located at 1544 E. Lafayette between Rivard and Orleans streets, directly across from the Lafateyye Foods grocery store, will be replaced by a three-building apartment complex that will be built by local developer Walter Cohen through his development company DuCharme Place LLC, under plans designed by McIntosh Poris Associates. Model D reports that construction at the long-stalled DuCharme Place will start this fall.
Scheduled for completion in late 2015, DuCharme Place will have 185 market-rate apartments in a mix of studios, one-bedroom and two-bedroom units. The contemporary amenities

include a common courtyard and pool, green roof and ground level parking with nearly 270 spaces. According to the news source, the parking spaces will be incorporated underneath three platforms that will raise one story above the ground to support the residential buildings.
According to MLive.com, the cost per unit hasn’t been determined yet, but the development team estimates that it will be slightly less than other residential units located in the Downtown and Midtown areas. Estimated to cost around $30 million, the DuCharme Place project is partly financed under the HUD 221 (d) program that allows up to 40-year mortgage loans to encourage the new construction or substantial rehabilitation of multifamily rental or co-op housing for moderate-income families, elderly and the handicapped. Earlier this month the residential project received $5 million in tax incentives from the Detroit Brownfield Redevelopment Authority, Model D reported.
