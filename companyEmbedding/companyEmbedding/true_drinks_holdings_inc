Additional Products – True Drinks




 























 





















        

















True Drinks development team is actively pursuing additional beverage products that will complement our current lineup.  There has been a trend in the marketplace towards drinks that are low in calories, free of artificial ingredients, and supportive of a healthy diet and lifestyle.
The soda industry is on the ropes as study after study lays childhood obesity, juvenile diabetes, early onset heart disease and more at their feet.
We are pursuing line extensions into schools (primary and secondary) as vitamin-infused, sugar-free alternatives.
As well as a new option for Mom and Dads, vitamin enhanced water available in natural flavors that parents appreciate.

We welcome communication and feedback from our customers.

AQUABALL
Because True Drinks we recognize that childhood obesity and juvenile diabetes have become epidemics among our nation’s youth.  As parents ourselves, we recognize that children need to stay properly hydrated, and they can only maintain that hydration through the consumption of water and zero calorie water based drinks.  AquaBall Naturally Flavored Water is one way that children can stay hydrated without the calories and other risks associated with consuming sugary drinks.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  Forward-Looking Statements  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains "forward-looking" statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and  The following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this Quarterly Report. Fluctuations in annual and quarterly results may occur as a result of factors affecting demand for our products such as the timing of new product introductions by us and by our competitors and our customers' political and budgetary constraints. Due to such fluctuations, historical results and percentage relationships are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period.  Overview  True Drinks Holdings, Inc., the holding company for True Drinks, Inc., is a healthy beverage provider which produces AquaBall(R) Naturally Flavored Water. AquaBall(R) is a healthy alternative to the other products in the children's beverage market. True Drinks has licensing agreements with Disney and Marvel for use of their characters on bottles of AquaBall(R). AquaBall(R) is a naturally flavored, vitamin-enhanced, zero-calorie, preservative-free, dye-free, sugar-free alternative to juice and soda. AquaBall(R) is currently available in four flavors: fruit punch, grape, strawberry lemonade and berry. Our target consumers: kids, young adults, and their guardians, are attracted to the product by the entertainment and media characters on the bottle and continue to consume the beverage because of its health benefits and great taste. True Drinks Holdings, Inc. (the "Company", "us" or "we") was incorporated in the state of Nevada in January 2001 and is the holding company for True Drinks, Inc. ("True Drinks"), a beverage company incorporated in the state of Delaware in January 2012.  We distribute AquaBall(R) nationally through select retail channels, such as grocery stores, mass merchandisers, convenience stores and online. We also market and distribute Bazi(R) All Natural Energy, a liquid nutritional supplement drink, which is currently distributed online and through our existing database of customers.  True Drinks is continuing to innovate to meet the healthy hydration demands of the American consumer. Health and wellness awareness has increased significantly, resulting in growing demand for beverages with little or no calories and natural ingredients. AquaBall(R) is directly responsive to this need for children and we plan to increase our offerings for this and other age groups.  Our strategy is to continue to i) grow our presence - both in store and online - and continue to build out our distribution network, ii) increase brand awareness though public relations, social media and guerrilla marketing and iii) expand our platform through line extensions.  Our sales have been seasonal with the highest volume typically realized during the summer and warmer months. As a result, our operating results from one fiscal quarter to the next may not be comparable. Additionally, our operating results are affected by numerous factors, including changes in consumer preference for beverage products, competitive pricing in the marketplace and weather conditions.  Our principal place of business is 18662 MacArthur Boulevard, Suite 110, Irvine, California, 92612. Our telephone number is (949) 203-2500. Our corporate website address is http://www.truedrinks.com. Our common stock, par value $0.001 per share ("Common Stock"), is currently listed for quotation on the OTC Pink Marketplace under the symbol "TRUU."  Critical Accounting Polices and Estimates  Discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates; including those related to collection of receivables, inventory obsolescence, sales returns and non-monetary transactions such as stock and stock options issued for services. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe there have been no changes to our critical accounting policies subsequent to the filing of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.  Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 to the Three Months Ended March 31, 2016.  Net Sales  Net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were $1,529,752, compared with sales of $583,298for the three months ended March 31, 2016, a 162% increase. This increase is primarily the result of chain authorizations secured by our sales team for reset of accounts beginning in February 2017 and continuing through May 2017. These authorizations have also allowed our team to secure distributor partners in 45 states. Many of these distributors received their initial shipments in February and March, with the remaining distributors set to receive their initial shipments in April and May.  We have expanded distribution of AquaBall(R) with national accounts in the grocery and convenience markets, and we have built out our direct store delivery ("DSD") network into 45 states during the past twelve months with resets continuing through May 2017. Our marketing and sales teams are now focused on increasing brand awareness and improving velocities moving through our current retailers, as well as adding new placements with strategic accounts.  The percentage that each product category represented of our net sales is as follows:  Three Months Ended  -14- Table of Contents  Gross Profit (Loss) and Gross Margin  Gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $556,139, compared to gross loss of $150,113 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue (gross margin) during three months ended March 31, 2017 was 36%, compared to negative 26% for the same period in 2016. This increase in gross profit is a great improvement for our Company, and is a direct result of our relationship with Niagara Bottling who provides finished goods to the Company and bills the Company for the product as it is shipped to customers, allowing our costs to become more consistent. It is also attributable to our shift away from focusing on the low-margin club channel to the mainstream grocery and convenience channels. We expect margins to maintain margins in the 35-40% range moving forward.  Sales, General and Administrative Expense  Sales, general and administrative expenses were $3,001,439 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to $2,137,263 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. This period over period increase of $946,454 is the result of increased people-related expenses and travel expenses, as well as marketing expenses at new retailers, each resulting from the first quarter of 2017 being a much more active selling season for AquaBall(R) as we continue to introduce our new preservative-free product to the marketplace. In 2016, sales of the previous version of our product were winding down as we were working on our first production run with Niagara Bottling.  Change in Fair Value of Derivative Liabilities  The Company recorded a gain on the change in fair value of derivative liabilities for the three months ended March 31, 2017 of $2,243,518, as compared to a gain of$1,139,365for the change in fair value of derivative liabilities for the three months ended March 31, 2016.  Interest Expense  Interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $20,538, as compared to interest expense of $12,214 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Interest expense consists of interest and fees due on promissory notes generated in the third quarter of 2015, all of which were either converted into shares of Series C Preferred during the January Note Exchange, as described in Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report, or were repaid by the Company in full during the first quarter of 2016.  Income Taxes  There is no income tax expense recorded for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, as the Company's calculated provision (benefit) for income tax is based on annual expected tax rates. As of March 31, 2017, the Company has tax net operating loss carryforwards and a related deferred tax asset, offset by a full valuation allowance.  Net Loss  Our net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $270,274 as compared to a net loss of $1,179,148for the three months ended March 31, 2016. This year-over-year improvement of approximately $0.9 million in net income is due to an increase of almost $1.1 million in other income. On a per share basis, our loss was $0.00 per share for the three months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to a loss of $0.01 per share for the three months ended March 31, 2016.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Our auditors have included a paragraph in their report on our consolidated financial statements, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, indicating that there is substantial doubt as to the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company had a net loss of $270,274, has working capital of $1,171,305, and an accumulated deficit of $36,064,480. Although, during the year ended December 31, 2016 and the three-months ended March 31, 2017 the Company raised approximately $9.7 million from financing activities, including sale of shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, additional capital will be necessary to advance the marketability of the Company's products to the point at which the Company can sustain operations. Management's plans are to continue to contain expenses, expand distribution and sales of its AquaBall(R)Naturally Flavored Water as rapidly as economically possible, and raise capital through equity and/or debt offerings to execute the Company's business plan and achieve profitability from continuing operations. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result in the event the Company is unsuccessful in its plans.  The Company has financed its operations through sales of equity and, to a lesser degree, cash flow provided by sales of AquaBall(R). Despite recent sales of preferred stock as described below, funds generated from sales of shares of our preferred stock or other equity or debt securities, and cash flow provided by sales may be insufficient to fund our operating requirements for the next twelve months. As a result, we may require additional capital to continue operating as a going concern. No assurances can be given that we will be successful. In the event we are unable to obtain additional financing in the next year, we may not be able to fund our working capital requirements, and therefore may be unable to continue as a going concern.  -15- Table of Contents  Recent Capital Raising Activity  January 2016 Note Exchange. On January 20, 2016, the Company and holders of Secured Notes in the principal amount of $500,000 entered into Note Exchange Agreements pursuant to which the holders agreed to convert the outstanding principal balance of their Secured Notes into an aggregate total of 4,413 shares of Series C Preferred and warrants to purchase up to an agate total of 1,029,413 shares of Common Stock for $0.17 per share. Neither holder received warrants to purchase shares of the Company's Common Stock in connection with their respective Secured Notes, and agreed to waive any unpaid interest accrued under the Secured Notes prior to the execution of the Note Exchange Agreement.  April 2016 Series C Offering. On April 13, 2016, the Company and Red Beard entered into a securities purchase agreement, pursuant to which Red Beard agreed to purchase an aggregate total of 50,000 shares of Series C Preferred for $100 per share over the course of two closings. The Company issued 25,000 shares of Series C Preferred to Red Beard on April 13, 2016. As additional consideration, investors will receive five-year warrants to purchase up to an aggregate total of approximately 33.3 million shares of Common Stock for $0.15 per share. On April 13, 2016, the Company issued to Red Beard warrants to purchase approximately 16.7 million shares of Common Stock.  On July 13, 2016, the securities purchase agreement was amended to modify the closing schedule for the remaining 25,000 shares of Series C Preferred to be purchased. As amended, 10,000 shares of Series C Preferred were purchased on July 15, 2016, and the remaining 25,000 shares were purchased between August 31, 2016 and September 13, 2016.  Series D Offering and Warrant Exchange. On February 8, 2017, the Company and Series D Investors entered into the Series D Purchase Agreement, wherein the Company may offer and sell to Series D Investors up to 50,000 shares of Series D Preferred for $100 per share. As additional consideration, Series D Investors will also receive Series D Warrants to purchase up to 200% of the Conversion Shares issuable upon conversion of shares of Series D Preferred purchased under the Series D Offering for $0.15 per share.  On the Initial Investment Date, the Company issued to Series D Investors an aggregate total of 31,750 shares of Series D Preferred, as well as Series D Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate total of 42,333,341 shares of Common Stock. Between the Initial Investment Date and March 31, 2017, the Company issued an additional 5,000 shares of Series D Preferred and Series D Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate total of 6,666,669 shares of Common Stock. The issuance of the shares of Series D Preferred in the quarter resulted in gross proceeds to the Company of $3.675 million. Each Series D Warrant contains a price protection feature that adjusts the exercise price in the event of certain dilutive issuances of securities. Such price protection feature is determined to be a derivative liability and, as such, the value of all such warrants issued during the quarter, totaling $2,262,334, was recorded to derivative liabilities. Between April 1, 2017 and the date of this Report, the Company has issued an additional 1,200 shares of Series D Preferred and Series D Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate total of 1,600,002 shares of Common Stock. The issuance of the shares of Series D Preferred since March 31, 2017 has resulted in gross proceeds to the Company of $120,000.  Warrant Exchange.Beginning on February 8, 2017, the Company and certain holders of Outstanding Warrants, entered into Exchange Agreements, pursuant to which each holder agreed to cancel their respective Outstanding Warrants in exchange for one-half of a share of Common Stock for every share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon exercise of Outstanding Warrants. The Company expects to issue up to 76.0 million shares of Common Stock in exchange for the cancellation of 152.0 million Outstanding Warrants, including the Warrants issued in connection with the Series D Offering, over the course of the Warrant Exchange Program.  During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company issued 73,106,466 shares of Common Stock in exchange for the cancellation of 146,212,905 Outstanding Warrants. Between April 1, 2017 and the date of this Report, the Company has issued an additional 800,001 shares of Common Stock in exchange for the cancellation of 1,600,002 Outstanding Warrants.  Off-Balance Sheet Items  We had no off-balance sheet items as of March 31, 2017.  May 15, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
