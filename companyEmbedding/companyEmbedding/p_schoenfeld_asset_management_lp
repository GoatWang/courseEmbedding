About Us
P. Schoenfeld Asset Management (PSAM) is a leading global alternative asset management firm focused on investing in event driven transactions. PSAM utilizes a fundamental research based approach to analyze corporate events that may alter the control, capital structure or corporate strategy of an organization. We believe these events can frequently create mispricings of securities relative to their inherent or ultimate realizable value. Three main strategies are considered when investing: Merger Arbitrage, Distressed/Stressed Credit Opportunities and Special Situations.
In addition to offering institutional quality investment research and risk management, we are committed to industry best practices through our continued investment in operations, compliance, client service and technology.
