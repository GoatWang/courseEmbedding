Supplier Diversity
Boyd Gaming Diversity Mission Statement
Boyd Gaming Corporation is a leading diversified owner and operator of gaming entertainment properties.
   We embrace diversity in every aspect of our business from our employees, to our purchasing programs, 
   philanthropic endeavors, and our customers.  Our commitment to diversity strengthens our company, our 
   communities, and our people.
Letter from Marianne:
The Boyd Gaming Family firmly believes that embracing and cultivating diversity is the base upon which 
   our company grows and thrives. For over thirty years, our door has been open to any vendor who wishes 
   to submit a bid, regardless of sex, ethnicity or cultural orientation. We at Boyd believe it is both 
   the right business strategy and the right thing to do.
Integrity and respect is our cornerstone and impacts every facet of our business. We proactively 
   encourage women, minorities and disadvantaged businesses to contact us if there is a product or 
   service on which they would like to bid. 
Our richly diverse employees have enabled us to become one of the premier gaming companies over the 
   years and we sincerely appreciate their efforts. Through experiences with them we understand that when 
   we partner with minority based and women owned businesses there are limitless opportunities to share 
   business knowledge and expertise and ultimately assist each other to grow, expand and prosper.
Our doors and minds are open. If you share these principles and are able to supply a product that meets 
   our expectations for quality and service, please contact us at Boyd Gaming. 
Marianne Boyd Johnson,
   Executive Vice President & Chief Diversity Officer
   Vice Chairman of the Board
   Boyd Gaming Corporation
