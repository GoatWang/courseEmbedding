Summary of our Investment Approach

On this page:

Philosophy
Selection Criteria
Value Investing
Risk Management
Conviction

Philosophy	      
Our views on the equity markets combined with our specific skill set provide a framework for our investment methodology.
Nature of Insights
 We believe the market often misprices stocks due to neglect, emotion, misinterpretation, and a short-term perspective. The best way to capitalize on these inefficiencies is through bottom-up company research. Stock selection is limited to those businesses we are able to confidently value and purchase at a significant discount. Our analyses of companies allow us to establish an informational edge with an emphasis on identifying how our insights about a company differ from the market’s as well as our degree of conviction in these insights. 
Time Horizon
 We think of our universe of companies not as a stock market but as a cross section of opportunities. We are owners of partial interests in businesses, and our investment time horizon reflects this mindset. Our holding period is conceptually varied as we are always looking for the valuation gap to narrow or close, and in many cases, companies are purchased based on a specific investment premise that we expect to unfold over time. We constantly assess the risk/reward relationships (more a function of discount to intrinsic value and the volatility of a company’s operating results than the volatility of its market price) associated with the stocks we own.
Concentration
 We believe good ideas should be positioned to have a meaningful impact on client portfolio performance; our portfolios own the 25 to 35 best ideas we can find. Individual position sizes range from 2% to 10%, and weightings are directly correlated to our level of conviction. Our portfolio structure is not influenced by a given benchmark. We emphasize effective diversification, thinking in terms of investment opportunities instead of active exposures.
Back to top
Selection Criteria
In an early edition of Security Analysis by Graham and Dodd, the authors stated that nearly every stock could conceivably be a good investment at the right price. The foundation of our investment approach is built on several of the principles formulated by Graham and Dodd; however, price is not our only investment consideration. We often find and purchase businesses with more vibrant qualities. Our selection criteria include the following:

Businesses we understand that possess sound capital structures and maintain conservative accounting policies.
 A current market price that is 35–50% below our estimate of intrinsic value.
 A business model that provides strong potential for per share intrinsic value growth.
				Management teams led by strong operators and proven capital allocators who have clearly aligned incentives in place to maximize shareholder value.
			

Back to top
Value Investing
 We consider our investment style to have a clear value orientation, but  our investments are not limited to low expectation and out of favor companies or industries. We tend to avoid very high growth businesses because they are often hard to value and therefore do not correspond with our risk-averse mindset and skeptical tendencies. We allocate client assets to companies that fall into three sub-categories of value:

Deep discount opportunities based on current earnings and asset values.
 Companies where a recognized catalyst is in place to uncover value — spinoffs, restructurings, and turnarounds. 
 Discounted franchise businesses that possess durable competitive advantages and compete in markets with attractive long-term prospects.

We believe this “controlled flexibility” is integral to meeting our return objectives.
Valuation Methodology
 In assessing the intrinsic value of our portfolio companies, we utilize the valuation technique that best reflects the true economic worth of a company’s assets. Our superseding goal is to determine what we would pay to own the whole enterprise based on the cash flow we believe the business will produce over the long haul (discounted at an appropriate rate). Accordingly, we primarily rely on discounted cash flow analysis and comparable private market transactions. However, we also often employ other methodologies such as liquidation analysis or replacement cost when appropriate.
Back to top
Risk Management
 Our approach to risk management focuses on controlling against permanent capital loss.
Our risk control efforts emphasize:

 Diligence and know-how in developing accurate insights about the companies we own.
 Avoiding companies we cannot effectively value or business models that we do not understand.
 Requiring a significant “margin of safety” between price and intrinsic value when we purchase businesses.
 Effectively diversifying exposure to stock-specific risks and macroeconomic factor variables and maintaining adequate industry and sector diversification.
 Partnering with competent management teams whose interests are aligned with those of their shareholders.
 Maintaining objectivity in evaluating winning and losing positions.

Also worth mentioning are the risk control methods which are common to our industry that we do not emphasize. We do not manage portfolios to a low tracking error target; we do not consider traditional beta or price volatility metrics as a proxy for risk; and we do not own low-conviction stocks solely for diversification purposes. 
Back to top
Conviction
 Among the various labels that are used to describe investment managers, “having high conviction” is one that we embrace. We believe investing is about knowledge and interpretation, and the term suggests that clients are receiving a good value for their active fees. Our decisions regarding purchase, sale, and portfolio weighting of individual companies within our portfolios are directly correlated to our assessment of these variables: 

 The size of the discount.
 The potential for intrinsic value growth.
 Identification of and confidence in a variant view.
 Identification of a meaningful catalyst.
 A positive impact on portfolio diversification. 
 Liquidity.

NewSouth Capital Management switches to Advent software
12 April 2007  |  1709 views  |  0
Source: Advent Software
Advent Software (Nasdaq: ADVS), the leading provider of software and solutions for the investment management industry, today announced that registered investment advisor NewSouth Capital Management, Inc. recently migrated to Advent Portfolio Exchange (APX) and implemented the newly enhanced version of Advent Corporate Actions (ACA) to achieve substantial time savings and greater reliability across a broad range of corporate actions.

	NewSouth Capital Management, Inc., which manages approximately $1.4 billion in assets, had long relied on a combination of Axys, Advent's original portfolio accounting product, Qube, Advent's CRM module, and ACA for the collection of corporate actions data on its holdings. The firm realized that a single, secure platform integrating portfolio management with client relationship management (CRM) data could provide enhanced functionality and time savings over their existing configuration.When the firm migrated to APX, it simultaneously upgraded to the APX-enhanced version of ACA to harness an even more powerful solution. ACA simplifies the process of compiling data from key sources and updating portfolios on corporate actions that affect portfolio values, such as mergers and acquisitions, name and ticker-symbol changes, spinoffs and exchanges. This data is essential to ensuring accuracy in valuations, trading and reporting.Tracking and processing corporate actions is still a largely manual process at many investment firms, making it prone to errors and delays. ACA automates this key process, aggregating data from high-quality data providers, matching it to a firm's holdings and providing timely reports and transactions on actions that affect those holdings."We are particularly excited about the ability to deal with complex mergers, acquisitions and other actions through ACA with APX, over and above what we were able to do in Axys," said Andrew L. MacQueen, NewSouth Capital Management, Inc. Head Trader and Director of Information Systems. "Processing the more complex mergers and spinoffs used to take about two or three hours. With ACA on APX we expect to shave that down to 20 or 30 minutes, which is pretty amazing given the complexity of the deals."Among the new features available in ACA for APX is the ability to have multiple updates on reorganization transactions in real time, automatically revising fair market values, cash-in-lieu and cost bases. This new functionality creates extraordinary efficiency gains, eliminating the need to back out and repost transactions."We're very pleased to welcome NewSouth Capital Management, Inc. to the growing list of investment advisors using Advent's next-generation suite," said Pete Hess, EVP and General Manager of the Investment Management Group for Advent. "The combination of APX and ACA is just the latest example of how Advent continues to innovate our suite of mission-critical solutions in ways that free our customers to focus on their core activities and provide even greater service directly to their clients."
