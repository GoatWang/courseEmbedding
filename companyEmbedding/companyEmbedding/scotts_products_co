Scotts' headquarters in Marysville


Scotts was founded in 1868, by Orlando Scott as a premium seed company for the U.S. agricultural industry. In the early 1900s, the company began a lawn grass seed business for homeowners and, in 1924, became the first to ship grass seed products directly to stores. Prior to that, consumers could purchase Scotts seed only through the mail.[3] By 1940, Scotts's sales had reached $1,000,000 and the company had 66 associates.
For the next 15 years the company focused on developing new products to combat weeds, fertilize grass and develop automated electronic seed processing and packaging plants.
In the early 1960s, Scotts started selling a "program" of products for lawns; established special training classes to help retailers better assist customers in developing their lawns; received a U.S. Patent for Trionized bonding which produced fertilizers that delivered sustained feeding; and introduced a complete line of Turf Builder combination products. By the end of 1971, the company had added two new divisions to its portfolio: the Golf Course Division, developed to promote an exclusive line of professional products for golf courses and other large institutional accounts; and Scotts LawnService, established after Scotts found a significant "do-it-for-me" customer segmentation. The service offers on-site lawn, tree and shrub fertilization, insect control and other related services through its network of 160 locations. The company also launched a direct-to-consumer helpline allowing lawn owners to call Scotts for advice and assistance.
Later that year, privately owned O.M. Scott & Sons was purchased by ITT, the international business conglomerate. Fifteen years later, Scotts became an independent company through a leveraged buyout from ITT. In 1992, Scotts became a publicly traded company with an initial offering of $19.00 a share. Three years later, it merged with Miracle-Gro, a gardening company, to create the Scotts Miracle-Gro Company.[4]
During the United States presidential election, 2012 the company endorsed the election of Republican Party candidate Mitt Romney[5]
Sale of bird seed in 2005–2008[edit]
On January 27, 2012, Scotts Miracle-Gro agreed to plead guilty in federal court and pay $4.5 million in fines for selling 73 million units of bird seed from November 2005 to March 2008 that was coated with pesticide known to be deadly to birds and fish. Pesticides were added to protect the product from insects during storage, notwithstanding that Storcide II, one of the pesticides used, was clearly marked as extremely toxic to birds. Records show that its own experts warned of the risk in the summer and fall of 2007 and yet Scotts continued to sell the deadly product until March 2008. In 2008, Scotts Miracle-Gro also falsified pesticide registration numbers required by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on its products.[6]
On September 7, 2012, in Ohio, a federal court sentenced Scotts to pay a $4 million fine and perform community service for 11 criminal violations of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). In a separate agreement with the Environmental Protection Agency, Scotts agreed to pay more than $6 million in penalties and spend $2 million on environmental projects. According to the Justice Department, both the criminal and civil settlements are the largest under FIFRA to date.[7]
GM Grass[edit]
Scotts has developed several genetically modified grasses, including herbicide-tolerant Kentucky bluegrass and creeping bentgrass. In 2007, the U.S. Department of Agriculture fined Scotts Miracle-Gro $500,000 when modified DNA from GM creeping bentgrass, was found within relatives of the same genus (Agrostis)[8] as well as in native grasses up to 21 km (13 mi) from the test sites.[9]
Peat bogs in the UK[edit]
In 2001 Scotts was involved in a major dispute with nature conservation bodies and the UK Government about the future of several peat bogs in the north of England. Under pressure from the European Union the UK government moved to declare a number of peat bogs, covering an area of 4097 acres in Yorkshire and Cumbria, as Special Areas of Conservation, thus ending Scotts ability to harvest peat for their garden products. During the course of the dispute Nick Kirkbride, the then managing director of Scotts in Britain, described the peat bogs as having "no more conservation interest than a ploughed field".[10] The peat bogs were eventually saved from further destruction by the payment by the UK government of compensation of £17 million to Scotts for loss of the right to extract peat.[11]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]

1914 - The O.M. Scott & Sons Company was incorporated.
1977 - Scotts introduced its retail product line into Canada through a distributorship arrangement with Home Hardware.
1988 - Scotts acquired the lawn and garden business of Hyponex Corporation, the largest producer and marketer of organic growing media products in the U.S.

1993 - Scotts acquired the Grace-Sierra Horticultural Products Company, adding controlled-release fertilizer technologies such as Osmocote, along with other brands including Metro-Mix, Banrot and Peters. In addition, Sierra also brought on board a well-established international organization for manufacturing, sales, and distribution. This organization began in 1964 when Archer Daniels Midland Company produced the first-ever resin-coated controlled-release fertilizer.
1995 - Scotts merged with Miracle-Gro Products, Inc.
1997 - Miracle Care Garden Ltd.: Approximately a third of the growing U.K. lawn and garden products company was owned by Miracle-Gro at the time of the 1995 merger, and in January 1997, Scotts purchased the remaining interest in the company.

1998 - The company acquired the organics company EarthGro, Inc., expanding access to mass merchant retailers and home centers in the Northeast region
1998 - The company acquired 80% ownership of plant breeding company Sanford Scientific, Inc. (SSI).

Rhône-Poulenc Jardin manufactures and sells a full line of consumer lawn and garden pesticides, fertilizers and growing media products in France, Germany, the Benelux countries, Austria, Italy, and Spain.
1998 - Scotts acquired the Shamrock brand of U.K. and Irish peat products form Bord na Mona, Ireland.

1998 - Scotts completed an acquisition with ASEF — a privately held Benelux-based lawn and garden products company. ASEF is a leading consumer lawn and garden products company—with operations in the Netherlands and Belgium — selling fertilizers, growing media, and pesticides.
1999 - Entering into the pesticide industry, Scotts completed agreements with Monsanto Company for exclusive U.S., Canada, U.K., France, Germany, and Australia agency and marketing rights to Monsanto's consumer Roundup herbicide products and for the purchase of the Ortho and related lawn and garden businesses.
2000 - Scotts acquired Substral, a leading consumer fertilizer brand in many European countries, including Germany, Austria, Belgium, France and Nordics. Scotts also purchased Smith & Hawken, a leading brand of garden-inspired products that includes pottery, watering equipment, gardening tools, outdoor furniture and live goods.

Scotts' headquarters in Marysville


Scotts was founded in 1868, by Orlando Scott as a premium seed company for the U.S. agricultural industry. In the early 1900s, the company began a lawn grass seed business for homeowners and, in 1924, became the first to ship grass seed products directly to stores. Prior to that, consumers could purchase Scotts seed only through the mail.[3] By 1940, Scotts's sales had reached $1,000,000 and the company had 66 associates.
For the next 15 years the company focused on developing new products to combat weeds, fertilize grass and develop automated electronic seed processing and packaging plants.
In the early 1960s, Scotts started selling a "program" of products for lawns; established special training classes to help retailers better assist customers in developing their lawns; received a U.S. Patent for Trionized bonding which produced fertilizers that delivered sustained feeding; and introduced a complete line of Turf Builder combination products. By the end of 1971, the company had added two new divisions to its portfolio: the Golf Course Division, developed to promote an exclusive line of professional products for golf courses and other large institutional accounts; and Scotts LawnService, established after Scotts found a significant "do-it-for-me" customer segmentation. The service offers on-site lawn, tree and shrub fertilization, insect control and other related services through its network of 160 locations. The company also launched a direct-to-consumer helpline allowing lawn owners to call Scotts for advice and assistance.
Later that year, privately owned O.M. Scott & Sons was purchased by ITT, the international business conglomerate. Fifteen years later, Scotts became an independent company through a leveraged buyout from ITT. In 1992, Scotts became a publicly traded company with an initial offering of $19.00 a share. Three years later, it merged with Miracle-Gro, a gardening company, to create the Scotts Miracle-Gro Company.[4]
During the United States presidential election, 2012 the company endorsed the election of Republican Party candidate Mitt Romney[5]
Sale of bird seed in 2005–2008[edit]
On January 27, 2012, Scotts Miracle-Gro agreed to plead guilty in federal court and pay $4.5 million in fines for selling 73 million units of bird seed from November 2005 to March 2008 that was coated with pesticide known to be deadly to birds and fish. Pesticides were added to protect the product from insects during storage, notwithstanding that Storcide II, one of the pesticides used, was clearly marked as extremely toxic to birds. Records show that its own experts warned of the risk in the summer and fall of 2007 and yet Scotts continued to sell the deadly product until March 2008. In 2008, Scotts Miracle-Gro also falsified pesticide registration numbers required by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on its products.[6]
On September 7, 2012, in Ohio, a federal court sentenced Scotts to pay a $4 million fine and perform community service for 11 criminal violations of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). In a separate agreement with the Environmental Protection Agency, Scotts agreed to pay more than $6 million in penalties and spend $2 million on environmental projects. According to the Justice Department, both the criminal and civil settlements are the largest under FIFRA to date.[7]
GM Grass[edit]
Scotts has developed several genetically modified grasses, including herbicide-tolerant Kentucky bluegrass and creeping bentgrass. In 2007, the U.S. Department of Agriculture fined Scotts Miracle-Gro $500,000 when modified DNA from GM creeping bentgrass, was found within relatives of the same genus (Agrostis)[8] as well as in native grasses up to 21 km (13 mi) from the test sites.[9]
Peat bogs in the UK[edit]
In 2001 Scotts was involved in a major dispute with nature conservation bodies and the UK Government about the future of several peat bogs in the north of England. Under pressure from the European Union the UK government moved to declare a number of peat bogs, covering an area of 4097 acres in Yorkshire and Cumbria, as Special Areas of Conservation, thus ending Scotts ability to harvest peat for their garden products. During the course of the dispute Nick Kirkbride, the then managing director of Scotts in Britain, described the peat bogs as having "no more conservation interest than a ploughed field".[10] The peat bogs were eventually saved from further destruction by the payment by the UK government of compensation of £17 million to Scotts for loss of the right to extract peat.[11]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]

1914 - The O.M. Scott & Sons Company was incorporated.

In addition, Sierra also brought on board a well-established international organization for manufacturing, sales, and distribution. This organization began in 1964 when Archer Daniels Midland Company produced the first-ever resin-coated controlled-release fertilizer.
1995 - Scotts merged with Miracle-Gro Products, Inc.
1997 - Miracle Care Garden Ltd.: Approximately a third of the growing U.K. lawn and garden products company was owned by Miracle-Gro at the time of the 1995 merger, and in January 1997, Scotts purchased the remaining interest in the company.

The company's principal consumer brands in North America are Scotts, Miracle-Gro, and Ortho. In addition, Scotts is Monsanto's exclusive agent for the marketing and distribution of consumer Roundup.
Scotts LawnService serves the "do-it-for-me" consumer in the U.S. with on-site lawn, tree and shrub fertilization, insect control and other related services through its network of 160 locations. Scotts LawnService is considered a leader of this USD$5 billion category.[citation needed]

Scotts' headquarters in Marysville


Scotts was founded in 1868, by Orlando Scott as a premium seed company for the U.S. agricultural industry. In the early 1900s, the company began a lawn grass seed business for homeowners and, in 1924, became the first to ship grass seed products directly to stores. Prior to that, consumers could purchase Scotts seed only through the mail.[3] By 1940, Scotts's sales had reached $1,000,000 and the company had 66 associates.
For the next 15 years the company focused on developing new products to combat weeds, fertilize grass and develop automated electronic seed processing and packaging plants.
In the early 1960s, Scotts started selling a "program" of products for lawns; established special training classes to help retailers better assist customers in developing their lawns; received a U.S. Patent for Trionized bonding which produced fertilizers that delivered sustained feeding; and introduced a complete line of Turf Builder combination products. By the end of 1971, the company had added two new divisions to its portfolio: the Golf Course Division, developed to promote an exclusive line of professional products for golf courses and other large institutional accounts; and Scotts LawnService, established after Scotts found a significant "do-it-for-me" customer segmentation. The service offers on-site lawn, tree and shrub fertilization, insect control and other related services through its network of 160 locations. The company also launched a direct-to-consumer helpline allowing lawn owners to call Scotts for advice and assistance.
Later that year, privately owned O.M. Scott & Sons was purchased by ITT, the international business conglomerate. Fifteen years later, Scotts became an independent company through a leveraged buyout from ITT. In 1992, Scotts became a publicly traded company with an initial offering of $19.00 a share. Three years later, it merged with Miracle-Gro, a gardening company, to create the Scotts Miracle-Gro Company.[4]
During the United States presidential election, 2012 the company endorsed the election of Republican Party candidate Mitt Romney[5]
Sale of bird seed in 2005–2008[edit]
On January 27, 2012, Scotts Miracle-Gro agreed to plead guilty in federal court and pay $4.5 million in fines for selling 73 million units of bird seed from November 2005 to March 2008 that was coated with pesticide known to be deadly to birds and fish. Pesticides were added to protect the product from insects during storage, notwithstanding that Storcide II, one of the pesticides used, was clearly marked as extremely toxic to birds. Records show that its own experts warned of the risk in the summer and fall of 2007 and yet Scotts continued to sell the deadly product until March 2008. In 2008, Scotts Miracle-Gro also falsified pesticide registration numbers required by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on its products.[6]
On September 7, 2012, in Ohio, a federal court sentenced Scotts to pay a $4 million fine and perform community service for 11 criminal violations of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). In a separate agreement with the Environmental Protection Agency, Scotts agreed to pay more than $6 million in penalties and spend $2 million on environmental projects. According to the Justice Department, both the criminal and civil settlements are the largest under FIFRA to date.[7]
GM Grass[edit]
Scotts has developed several genetically modified grasses, including herbicide-tolerant Kentucky bluegrass and creeping bentgrass. In 2007, the U.S. Department of Agriculture fined Scotts Miracle-Gro $500,000 when modified DNA from GM creeping bentgrass, was found within relatives of the same genus (Agrostis)[8] as well as in native grasses up to 21 km (13 mi) from the test sites.[9]
Peat bogs in the UK[edit]
In 2001 Scotts was involved in a major dispute with nature conservation bodies and the UK Government about the future of several peat bogs in the north of England. Under pressure from the European Union the UK government moved to declare a number of peat bogs, covering an area of 4097 acres in Yorkshire and Cumbria, as Special Areas of Conservation, thus ending Scotts ability to harvest peat for their garden products. During the course of the dispute Nick Kirkbride, the then managing director of Scotts in Britain, described the peat bogs as having "no more conservation interest than a ploughed field".[10] The peat bogs were eventually saved from further destruction by the payment by the UK government of compensation of £17 million to Scotts for loss of the right to extract peat.[11]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]

1914 - The O.M. Scott & Sons Company was incorporated.
1977 - Scotts introduced its retail product line into Canada through a distributorship arrangement with Home Hardware.
1988 - Scotts acquired the lawn and garden business of Hyponex Corporation, the largest producer and marketer of organic growing media products in the U.S.
1992 - Scotts acquired Republic Tool & Manufacturing Company, providing total quality control over the manufacture of Scotts spreaders.
1993 - Scotts acquired the Grace-Sierra Horticultural Products Company, adding controlled-release fertilizer technologies such as Osmocote, along with other brands including Metro-Mix, Banrot and Peters. In addition, Sierra also brought on board a well-established international organization for manufacturing, sales, and distribution. This organization began in 1964 when Archer Daniels Midland Company produced the first-ever resin-coated controlled-release fertilizer.
1995 - Scotts merged with Miracle-Gro Products, Inc.
1997 - Miracle Care Garden Ltd.: Approximately a third of the growing U.K. lawn and garden products company was owned by Miracle-Gro at the time of the 1995 merger, and in January 1997, Scotts purchased the remaining interest in the company.
1997 - Scotts acquired Emerald Green Lawn Service, which would become Scotts Lawn Service in 1998.

Rhône-Poulenc Jardin manufactures and sells a full line of consumer lawn and garden pesticides, fertilizers and growing media products in France, Germany, the Benelux countries, Austria, Italy, and Spain.
1998 - Scotts acquired the Shamrock brand of U.K. and Irish peat products form Bord na Mona, Ireland.
1998 - Scotts entered into a collaboration with the Monsanto Company to apply biotechnology products to the turfgrass and ornamental plants business.

1998 - Scotts completed an acquisition with ASEF — a privately held Benelux-based lawn and garden products company. ASEF is a leading consumer lawn and garden products company—with operations in the Netherlands and Belgium — selling fertilizers, growing media, and pesticides.
1999 - Entering into the pesticide industry, Scotts completed agreements with Monsanto Company for exclusive U.S., Canada, U.K., France, Germany, and Australia agency and marketing rights to Monsanto's consumer Roundup herbicide products and for the purchase of the Ortho and related lawn and garden businesses.

WHY TOSS THE TUBE FOR GOOD?

This can be utilized to grow and display various plants. I noticed that I got a large amount of algae in this area. I finally got the time to tackle this issue. I utilized this ready to use cleaner to tackle this problem. I followed the directions and waited for required time for the chemical to work. It worked pretty good BUT required a scrub brush to get into any crevices. I had to apply a second application and wash it off. It looks pretty good overall. I still got to wait a day or so to see if the algae returns or not.

It does not clean vinyl siding unless you scrub really hard with a scrub brush. Try doing that on a 25 foot ladder! Since it only "cleans" 500 sq. ft. of area (and doesn't do that really), it is a very, very poor value. I ended up using the entire bottle on one small area trying to get it to work and then finally just used a power washer. I wish I could give it zero stars because that is what it is worth.

I have been looking at several clean-up projects that need doing and I've walked past my tasks and my bottle of Scotts Outdoor Cleaner Plus OxiClean concentrate for a couple weeks deciding how I was going to approach it. I don't like cheap tools, but for my occasional need for a power washer, I can't justify one that meets my standards. I bought a cheapo today on sale and rushed home to put it to work. I don't get much notice or compliments, but my wife actually noticed my clean front siding, my clean porch, steps and sidewalk. I am totally sure that if I wanted to spend many extra hours, 1600 psi at point blank range would blast away everything, including the paint! The Scotts is the difference between tedious work, which might also be destructive to the siding. I didn't know my sidewalk was so impacted with algae and dirt. The difference is astounding. No more green siding, sidewalk and porch. Tomorrow I am going after the rest of the siding and the deck, all from the same bottle ... all of this with no scrubbing. (and it is safe on my plants)VSMost Liked Negative Review Outdoor Cleaner Plus OxiCleanI used this year to clean my patio furniture & Tabel. In the past I used Formula 409.

I did not see any difference between the 2 products.I had a rust stain on the table and neither product removed the stain.I had what appeared to be a rust stain on my Paver blocks and it did remove it to some extent, it is a little lighter now.That being said I would compare the price of 409 and the Outdoor Cleaner and purchase the leasser expensive of the 2Reviewed by 269 customersSort byNewestOldestHighest ratingLowest ratingMost helpfulLeast helpfulClear all filtersDisplaying reviews 1-30Back to topPrevious | Next »7/9/2017 3.0worked where I used it By tomp01from 8736ProsEasy to UseEffectiveConsBest UsesComments about Scotts 128 Oz Liquid Outdoor Cleaner (51070):The product worked where I was able to use it.

I like that it is safe to use around plants. I have had a problem with algae growing on the vinyl siding on the North side of my building and I was advised to use a solution of bleach to remove it. That would be detrimental to the vegetation and the odor would be detrimental to me. I'm sure I would also ruin my clothing if I used a bleach solution. This product safely removed the algae on vinyl siding and composite decking. It was easy to mix, had a pleasant odor and was safe to use.

First I applied it to my vinyl siding which had dirt, oxidation and moss on the north side. I sprayed the cleaner on, gave it a few minutes then a light brushing. When I rinsed the wall I was pleased to see that the siding looked like new. I also tested it on the outside walls of my above ground pool which have never been cleaned since we got the pool 8 years ago. same process and the pool looks like it did the day we had it installed. the last tests were on concrete patio blocks and 2 very dirty 100 lb propane tanks. The tanks are brilliant white again but the concrete could have looked better with a pressure washer. Overall I am very pleased with how well the cleaner works and am now faced with doing the rest of my siding to make the rest of the house look like the test area. I recommend this cleaner and I'm sure I'll find many other uses for it as the summer goes on.

By justmefrom Macomb, MI 48044, USAProsGood DirectionsConsDidn't work as expectedMessyBest UsesComments about Scotts 128 Oz Liquid Outdoor Cleaner (51070):I hosed off the cement patio to get rid of loose dirt and debris, and went to work. On a high traffic area, I cleaned it the way my Mother taught me to scrub her kitchen floor, with a pail and a scrub brush on my hands and knees. It was mixed per the label, in a 6:2 ratio. The results were a disappointment. It got maybe a shade or two lighter. Hardly worth my effort. When spraying it off, it just kept foaming, another undesirable feature.

The items came very clean without a lot of effort. Normally i use a brush and scrub and it did not come as clean as using the Scott's Outdoor Cleaner plus OxiClean. I simply used a sponge and the dirt and stains came right out. There was no harmful order as well.

The siding was quite dirty, green moss covered, dirt and also covered with what appeared to be mold in areas. I mixed up the Plus OxicClean concentrate in a bucket according to the directions and whipped the worse areas first before I put the solution in a sprayer. I was really amazed at how fast and thorough the solution worked All the before mentioned problems were erased and taken care of.. I used a brush and a rag. It was quite easy and fast working. I definitely recommend this product. lnBottom Line Yes, I would recommend this to a friendREVIEWED ATWas this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review5/17/2017 5.0Outdoor Cleaner great for vinyl fencing By djptoledofrom Toledo, OH, USAProsEasy to UseEffectiveConsBest UsesComments about Scotts 128 Oz Liquid Outdoor Cleaner (51070):Our white vinyl fencing looked sad with dirt, mold and grass stains using Scott's outdoor cleaner plus oxiclean made our fence look brand new.Bottom Line Yes, I would recommend this to a friendREVIEWED ATWas this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review5/17/2017 5.0Procrastination By GIJoefrom New Freedom, PA, USAProsEasy to UseEffectiveGood Directionsnice fresh aromaQualityValueConsBest UsesComments about Scotts 128 Oz Liquid Outdoor Cleaner (51070):Today was the day. I have been looking at several clean-up projects that need doing and I've walked past my tasks and my bottle of Scotts Outdoor Cleaner Plus OxiClean concentrate for a couple weeks deciding how I was going to approach it. I don't like cheap tools, but for my occasional need for a power washer, I can't justify one that meets my standards. I bought a cheapo today on sale and rushed home to put it to work. I don't get much notice or compliments, but my wife actually noticed my clean front siding, my clean porch, steps and sidewalk. I am totally sure that if I wanted to spend many extra hours, 1600 psi at point blank range would blast away everything, including the paint! The Scotts is the difference between tedious work, which might also be destructive to the siding. I didn't know my sidewalk was so impacted with algae and dirt. The difference is astounding. No more green siding, sidewalk and porch. Tomorrow I am going after the rest of the siding and the deck, all from the same bottle ... all of this with no scrubbing. (and it is safe on my plants)Bottom Line Yes, I would recommend this to a friendREVIEWED ATWas this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review5/15/2017 5.0Very effective outdoor cleaner By moprafrom Troy, MI, USAProsEasy to UseEffectiveGood DirectionsQualityValueConsBest UsesComments about Scotts 128 Oz Liquid Outdoor Cleaner (51070):I used this product to clean out door furniture and patio.

I have been looking at several clean-up projects that need doing and I've walked past my tasks and my bottle of Scotts Outdoor Cleaner Plus OxiClean concentrate for a couple weeks deciding how I was going to approach it. I don't like cheap tools, but for my occasional need for a power washer, I can't justify one that meets my standards. I bought a cheapo today on sale and rushed home to put it to work. I don't get much notice or compliments, but my wife actually noticed my clean front siding, my clean porch, steps and sidewalk. I am totally sure that if I wanted to spend many extra hours, 1600 psi at point blank range would blast away everything, including the paint! The Scotts is the difference between tedious work, which might also be destructive to the siding. I didn't know my sidewalk was so impacted with algae and dirt. The difference is astounding. No more green siding, sidewalk and porch. Tomorrow I am going after the rest of the siding and the deck, all from the same bottle ... all of this with no scrubbing. (and it is safe on my plants)VSMost Liked Negative Review Outdoor Cleaner Plus OxiCleanI used this year to clean my patio furniture & Tabel. In the past I used Formula 409.

I did not see any difference between the 2 products.I had a rust stain on the table and neither product removed the stain.I had what appeared to be a rust stain on my Paver blocks and it did remove it to some extent, it is a little lighter now.That being said I would compare the price of 409 and the Outdoor Cleaner and purchase the leasser expensive of the 2Reviewed by 269 customersSort byNewestOldestHighest ratingLowest ratingMost helpfulLeast helpfulClear all filtersDisplaying reviews 1-30Back to topPrevious | Next »7/9/2017 3.0worked where I used it By tomp01from 8736ProsEasy to UseEffectiveConsBest UsesComments about Scotts 128 Oz Liquid Outdoor Cleaner (51070):The product worked where I was able to use it.

I like that it is safe to use around plants. I have had a problem with algae growing on the vinyl siding on the North side of my building and I was advised to use a solution of bleach to remove it. That would be detrimental to the vegetation and the odor would be detrimental to me. I'm sure I would also ruin my clothing if I used a bleach solution. This product safely removed the algae on vinyl siding and composite decking. It was easy to mix, had a pleasant odor and was safe to use.

First I applied it to my vinyl siding which had dirt, oxidation and moss on the north side. I sprayed the cleaner on, gave it a few minutes then a light brushing. When I rinsed the wall I was pleased to see that the siding looked like new. I also tested it on the outside walls of my above ground pool which have never been cleaned since we got the pool 8 years ago. same process and the pool looks like it did the day we had it installed. the last tests were on concrete patio blocks and 2 very dirty 100 lb propane tanks. The tanks are brilliant white again but the concrete could have looked better with a pressure washer. Overall I am very pleased with how well the cleaner works and am now faced with doing the rest of my siding to make the rest of the house look like the test area. I recommend this cleaner and I'm sure I'll find many other uses for it as the summer goes on.

Living in the city the siding requires a good cleaning evey year to remove dust and dirt. I have been using other outdoor cleaners and was not very pleased. This outdoor cleaner was a nice change.

On a high traffic area, I cleaned it the way my Mother taught me to scrub her kitchen floor, with a pail and a scrub brush on my hands and knees. It was mixed per the label, in a 6:2 ratio. The results were a disappointment. It got maybe a shade or two lighter. Hardly worth my effort. When spraying it off, it just kept foaming, another undesirable feature.

I have been looking at several clean-up projects that need doing and I've walked past my tasks and my bottle of Scotts Outdoor Cleaner Plus OxiClean concentrate for a couple weeks deciding how I was going to approach it. I don't like cheap tools, but for my occasional need for a power washer, I can't justify one that meets my standards. I bought a cheapo today on sale and rushed home to put it to work. I don't get much notice or compliments, but my wife actually noticed my clean front siding, my clean porch, steps and sidewalk. I am totally sure that if I wanted to spend many extra hours, 1600 psi at point blank range would blast away everything, including the paint! The Scotts is the difference between tedious work, which might also be destructive to the siding. I didn't know my sidewalk was so impacted with algae and dirt. The difference is astounding. No more green siding, sidewalk and porch. Tomorrow I am going after the rest of the siding and the deck, all from the same bottle ... all of this with no scrubbing. (and it is safe on my plants)Bottom Line Yes, I would recommend this to a friendREVIEWED ATWas this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review5/15/2017 5.0Very effective outdoor cleaner By moprafrom Troy, MI, USAProsEasy to UseEffectiveGood DirectionsQualityValueConsBest UsesComments about Scotts 128 Oz Liquid Outdoor Cleaner (51070):I used this product to clean out door furniture and patio.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
