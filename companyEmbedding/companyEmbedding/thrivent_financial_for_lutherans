Predecessor groups[edit]
Thrivent Financial was officially formed on January 1, 2002, with the merger of Aid Association for Lutherans (AAL) and Lutheran Brotherhood (LB), which had been established in 1902 and 1917 respectively. The merger formed the largest fraternal benefit society in the United States.[5]
Aid Association for Lutherans[edit]




Head Office of the Aid Association for Lutherans, circa 1930-1945.


History[edit]
In the late 19th and early 20th century, the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod forbade its members to join fraternal societies because these required initiation rites and secret oaths. Life insurance was also frowned upon in some quarters because Martin Luther had written against similar enterprises in his day, the practice could be considered a form of usury, and it reflected a distrust in God.[6]
In 1899, Albert Voecks, a member of St. Paul Lutheran Church in Appleton, Wisconsin broached the idea of creating an insurance society for Lutherans to fellow church members Gottlieb Ziegler and William Zuehlke.[7] They each gave $13 to the fund, and found several hundred others willing to contribute $5 each.[6] In 1902 the founders of the society recruited the 500 applicants necessary to receive a charter from the State of Wisconsin for their group.[7] It was chartered on November 24, 1902 as the Aid Association for Lutherans in Wisconsin and Other States.[6]
Like most fraternal benefit societies of the time, the AAL operated on the actuarially unsound graded assessment system. In 1905, it began a move to the legal reserve system, a transformation that was completed in 1911.[8] 1905 was also the year women were admitted as members.[7] Most of the early business was conducted in German, until this was discontinued in 1927.[8]
Membership was open only to members of the Missouri Synod and other Lutherans who were in fellowship with it until the mid-1960s, when it became open to Lutherans of all denominations. In the late 1960s, the Association had 792,000 members; this increased to about 1,200,000 members in 5,019 branches in 1978.[9] By 1979, it was the largest member of the National Fraternal Congress of America and ranked 13th among the 1,800 insurance firms in the country.[8][clarification needed]
Rituals[edit]
The AAL had no initiation rites, oaths, or other rituals.[8]
Non-profit Organization[edit]
The Association was organized on two levels: the local branches attached to Lutheran congregations, and the national level, which consisted only of a board of directors that met four times a year. The AAL was particular about it locals not being called "lodges" because that was too similar to the nomenclature of oath-bound, ritualistic groups such as the Freemasons or the Oddfellows. The AAL was headquartered in Appleton, Wisconsin[10]
Philanthropy[edit]
The AAL was also involved philanthropically, giving money to scholarships, support for educational institutions and training for church workers. Grants were made to agencies, boards and homes for the aged, disabled and to minorities. The Association was also had its own family health program, and sponsored blood drives and family health workshops. It also joined the National Center for Voluntary Action.[8]
Lutheran Brotherhood[edit]
History[edit]
The roots of Lutheran Brotherhood go back to the founding convention of the Norwegian Lutheran Church of America when Jacob Preus, the state insurance commissioner of Minnesota, proposed launching a not-for-profit aid society.[7] As with other Lutheran denominations, this move proved controversial, with some saying it indicated a lack of faith in God. Those who favored the society prevailed by arguing that the new aid society would prevent Norwegian Lutherans from joining unacceptable secret beneficial societies or "lodges" which was forbidden by conservative Lutheran doctrine.[11]
The organization authorized by the convention was called the Luther Union, and was incorporated in the State of Minnesota on September 18, 1918. That month the Luther Union entered into negotiations with Lutheran Brotherhood of America of Des Moines, Iowa. These two organizations merged in the Lutheran Brotherhood in 1920.[11]
The articles of incorporation of Lutheran Brotherhood stated its purpose:
“To aid the Lutheran Church in extending the Lutheran Faith, to foster patriotism, loyalty, justice, charity and benevolence, to provide education, instruction, proper entertainment and amusements, to encourage industry, saving, thrift and development on the part of its members, to give aid in the case of poverty, sickness, accident or old age, and otherwise promote the spiritual, intellectual and physical welfare of its members.”[12] Membership was open only to Lutherans. There were 550,000 members in 1965 and 900,000 in 1979.[11]
Rituals[edit]
Like the AAL, the LB had no rituals, secrets, or oaths.[11]
Non-profit Organization[edit]
Local units were called "branches", which were divided into three categories: A-1, affiliated to Lutheran congregations; A-2, usually sponsored by a group within a Lutheran parish; and A-3, geographic branches. The Lutheran Brotherhood had a quadrennial convention and a board of directors who managed its business. It was headquartered in Minneapolis.[13]
Philanthropy[edit]
The LB helped establish new Lutheran congregations through the Church Extension Fund, sponsored scholarships for Lutheran clergy, and arranged seminars on Christian topics.[11]
Mergers[edit]
Lutheran Life Insurance Society of Canada[edit]
In 1972 the Canadian branches of the Lutheran Brotherhood and the Aid Association for Lutherans merged, as a result of the desire to have an indigenous Canadian fraternal benefit society. They formed a new fraternal order called the Faith Life.[13]
Like the AAL and LB, the LLISC was organized into branches and run by a board of directors. There were 120 branches in 1979. The society was based in Kitchener, Ontario.[13]
The LLISC provided scholarships to Lutheran educational institutions, gave grants to churches and church-related organizations and projects, and gave reduced rate mortgages for Lutheran churches.[13]
Thrivent Financial for Lutherans[edit]
The AAL and LB functioned independently throughout the 20th century. In June 2001, after close consideration of how combining the two organizations would be of benefit to members, the AAL and LB merged, with the merger completed by the end of that year. Following the merger, in 2002 a new name was voted upon and approved by the members of the merged organization: Thrivent Financial for Lutherans.
Financial services[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (September 2013)


Financial standing[edit]
In 2016 Thrivent Financial ranked 318 on the Fortune 500.[14] In 2016, Thrivent received an A.M. Best rating of AA+ (Superior)[15] and a Fitch rating of AA+ (Very Strong).[16]
Outreach[edit]
Thrivent Financial members made donations to Haiti relief following the 2010 Haiti earthquake through Lutheran World Relief, ELCA Domestic Disaster Response, LCMS World Relief/Human Care, and WELS Committee on Relief.[17] Thrivent Financial provided funding for the 2003 film Luther.[citation needed]
Thrivent Choice[edit]
Thrivent Choice is a program that offers members the opportunity to make recommendations for where some of Thrivent Financial's charitable outreach funds are directed.[18]
Thrivent Builds with Habitat for Humanity[edit]
Thrivent has formed an alliance with Habitat for Humanity called Thrivent Builds with Habitat for Humanity through which it contributes financial assistance for building affordable homes. The initiative also sponsors homebuilding trips by Thrivent members throughout the world.[19]
The Thrivent Builds alliance began in September, 2005,[20] with a four-year commitment of $105 million. Thrivent Financial chose Habitat for Humanity as an ally because in the ten years previous, its members had already proven their interest in volunteering with them by building over 500 homes.[21] In December, 2007, Thrivent Financial increased its total commitment to $125 million.[22] The alliance makes Thrivent Financial one of Habitat’s largest single allies and aims to increase Habitat’s annual house production by hundreds of U. S. homes per year and more around the world.[23]
Programs[edit]
There are two programs within the Thrivent Builds alliance.

Through Thrivent Builds Homes, Thrivent Financial and other Lutheran volunteers help build more than 300 homes a year within the United States with more than 200 Habitat for Humanity affiliates.[24] As of year-end 2008, over 1,000 homes were built with Habitat for Humanity families through this program.[25]
Thrivent Builds Worldwide offers Thrivent Financial members the opportunity to volunteer for one- to three-week homebuilding trips around the world where there are existing Habitat for Humanity programs. Thrivent Builds volunteers have helped build Habitat homes in Romania,[26] Poland,[27] South Africa,[28] New Zealand,[29] Guatemala,[30] El Salvador,[31] the Mississippi Gulf Coast[32] and many more destinations.

Additionally, there are two whole communities being built:

In the Mississippi Gulf Coast, Thrivent Builds is sponsoring a community of 28 homes with families displaced by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.[33]
An additional community of 75 homes is being sponsored in Santa Ana, El Salvador, with 40 teams of Thrivent Financial volunteers helping to build in 2009.

Library[edit]
The Aid Association for Lutherans maintained a library of over 12,000 books on business management, fraternalism, and life and health insurance.[34]
Recognition[edit]
In 2017, Thrivent Financial was named on its list of The World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere Magazine. Assessment is based upon the Ethisphere Institute's Ethics Quotient® (EQ) framework which offers a quantitative way to assess a company's performance in an objective, consistent and standardized way. Scores are generated in five key categories: ethics and compliance program (35%), corporate citizenship and responsibility (20%), culture of ethics (20%), governance (15%) and leadership, innovation and reputation (10%), and provided to all companies who participate in the process.

8.1 Thrivent Builds with Habitat for Humanity





Predecessor groups[edit]
Thrivent Financial was officially formed on January 1, 2002, with the merger of Aid Association for Lutherans (AAL) and Lutheran Brotherhood (LB), which had been established in 1902 and 1917 respectively. The merger formed the largest fraternal benefit society in the United States.[5]
Aid Association for Lutherans[edit]




Head Office of the Aid Association for Lutherans, circa 1930-1945.


History[edit]
In the late 19th and early 20th century, the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod forbade its members to join fraternal societies because these required initiation rites and secret oaths. Life insurance was also frowned upon in some quarters because Martin Luther had written against similar enterprises in his day, the practice could be considered a form of usury, and it reflected a distrust in God.[6]
In 1899, Albert Voecks, a member of St. Paul Lutheran Church in Appleton, Wisconsin broached the idea of creating an insurance society for Lutherans to fellow church members Gottlieb Ziegler and William Zuehlke.[7] They each gave $13 to the fund, and found several hundred others willing to contribute $5 each.[6] In 1902 the founders of the society recruited the 500 applicants necessary to receive a charter from the State of Wisconsin for their group.[7] It was chartered on November 24, 1902 as the Aid Association for Lutherans in Wisconsin and Other States.[6]
Like most fraternal benefit societies of the time, the AAL operated on the actuarially unsound graded assessment system. In 1905, it began a move to the legal reserve system, a transformation that was completed in 1911.[8] 1905 was also the year women were admitted as members.[7] Most of the early business was conducted in German, until this was discontinued in 1927.[8]
Membership was open only to members of the Missouri Synod and other Lutherans who were in fellowship with it until the mid-1960s, when it became open to Lutherans of all denominations. In the late 1960s, the Association had 792,000 members; this increased to about 1,200,000 members in 5,019 branches in 1978.[9] By 1979, it was the largest member of the National Fraternal Congress of America and ranked 13th among the 1,800 insurance firms in the country.[8][clarification needed]
Rituals[edit]
The AAL had no initiation rites, oaths, or other rituals.[8]
Non-profit Organization[edit]
The Association was organized on two levels: the local branches attached to Lutheran congregations, and the national level, which consisted only of a board of directors that met four times a year. The AAL was particular about it locals not being called "lodges" because that was too similar to the nomenclature of oath-bound, ritualistic groups such as the Freemasons or the Oddfellows. The AAL was headquartered in Appleton, Wisconsin[10]
Philanthropy[edit]
The AAL was also involved philanthropically, giving money to scholarships, support for educational institutions and training for church workers. Grants were made to agencies, boards and homes for the aged, disabled and to minorities. The Association was also had its own family health program, and sponsored blood drives and family health workshops. It also joined the National Center for Voluntary Action.[8]
Lutheran Brotherhood[edit]
History[edit]
The roots of Lutheran Brotherhood go back to the founding convention of the Norwegian Lutheran Church of America when Jacob Preus, the state insurance commissioner of Minnesota, proposed launching a not-for-profit aid society.[7] As with other Lutheran denominations, this move proved controversial, with some saying it indicated a lack of faith in God. Those who favored the society prevailed by arguing that the new aid society would prevent Norwegian Lutherans from joining unacceptable secret beneficial societies or "lodges" which was forbidden by conservative Lutheran doctrine.[11]
The organization authorized by the convention was called the Luther Union, and was incorporated in the State of Minnesota on September 18, 1918. That month the Luther Union entered into negotiations with Lutheran Brotherhood of America of Des Moines, Iowa. These two organizations merged in the Lutheran Brotherhood in 1920.[11]
The articles of incorporation of Lutheran Brotherhood stated its purpose:
“To aid the Lutheran Church in extending the Lutheran Faith, to foster patriotism, loyalty, justice, charity and benevolence, to provide education, instruction, proper entertainment and amusements, to encourage industry, saving, thrift and development on the part of its members, to give aid in the case of poverty, sickness, accident or old age, and otherwise promote the spiritual, intellectual and physical welfare of its members.”[12] Membership was open only to Lutherans. There were 550,000 members in 1965 and 900,000 in 1979.[11]
Rituals[edit]
Like the AAL, the LB had no rituals, secrets, or oaths.[11]
Non-profit Organization[edit]
Local units were called "branches", which were divided into three categories: A-1, affiliated to Lutheran congregations; A-2, usually sponsored by a group within a Lutheran parish; and A-3, geographic branches. The Lutheran Brotherhood had a quadrennial convention and a board of directors who managed its business. It was headquartered in Minneapolis.[13]
Philanthropy[edit]
The LB helped establish new Lutheran congregations through the Church Extension Fund, sponsored scholarships for Lutheran clergy, and arranged seminars on Christian topics.[11]
Mergers[edit]
Lutheran Life Insurance Society of Canada[edit]
In 1972 the Canadian branches of the Lutheran Brotherhood and the Aid Association for Lutherans merged, as a result of the desire to have an indigenous Canadian fraternal benefit society. They formed a new fraternal order called the Faith Life.[13]
Like the AAL and LB, the LLISC was organized into branches and run by a board of directors. There were 120 branches in 1979. The society was based in Kitchener, Ontario.[13]
The LLISC provided scholarships to Lutheran educational institutions, gave grants to churches and church-related organizations and projects, and gave reduced rate mortgages for Lutheran churches.[13]
Thrivent Financial for Lutherans[edit]
The AAL and LB functioned independently throughout the 20th century. In June 2001, after close consideration of how combining the two organizations would be of benefit to members, the AAL and LB merged, with the merger completed by the end of that year. Following the merger, in 2002 a new name was voted upon and approved by the members of the merged organization: Thrivent Financial for Lutherans.
Financial services[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (September 2013)


Financial standing[edit]
In 2016 Thrivent Financial ranked 318 on the Fortune 500.[14] In 2016, Thrivent received an A.M. Best rating of AA+ (Superior)[15] and a Fitch rating of AA+ (Very Strong).[16]
Outreach[edit]
Thrivent Financial members made donations to Haiti relief following the 2010 Haiti earthquake through Lutheran World Relief, ELCA Domestic Disaster Response, LCMS World Relief/Human Care, and WELS Committee on Relief.[17] Thrivent Financial provided funding for the 2003 film Luther.[citation needed]
Thrivent Choice[edit]
Thrivent Choice is a program that offers members the opportunity to make recommendations for where some of Thrivent Financial's charitable outreach funds are directed.[18]
Thrivent Builds with Habitat for Humanity[edit]
Thrivent has formed an alliance with Habitat for Humanity called Thrivent Builds with Habitat for Humanity through which it contributes financial assistance for building affordable homes. The initiative also sponsors homebuilding trips by Thrivent members throughout the world.[19]
The Thrivent Builds alliance began in September, 2005,[20] with a four-year commitment of $105 million. Thrivent Financial chose Habitat for Humanity as an ally because in the ten years previous, its members had already proven their interest in volunteering with them by building over 500 homes.[21] In December, 2007, Thrivent Financial increased its total commitment to $125 million.[22] The alliance makes Thrivent Financial one of Habitat’s largest single allies and aims to increase Habitat’s annual house production by hundreds of U. S. homes per year and more around the world.[23]
Programs[edit]
There are two programs within the Thrivent Builds alliance.

Through Thrivent Builds Homes, Thrivent Financial and other Lutheran volunteers help build more than 300 homes a year within the United States with more than 200 Habitat for Humanity affiliates.[24] As of year-end 2008, over 1,000 homes were built with Habitat for Humanity families through this program.[25]
Thrivent Builds Worldwide offers Thrivent Financial members the opportunity to volunteer for one- to three-week homebuilding trips around the world where there are existing Habitat for Humanity programs. Thrivent Builds volunteers have helped build Habitat homes in Romania,[26] Poland,[27] South Africa,[28] New Zealand,[29] Guatemala,[30] El Salvador,[31] the Mississippi Gulf Coast[32] and many more destinations.

Additionally, there are two whole communities being built:

In the Mississippi Gulf Coast, Thrivent Builds is sponsoring a community of 28 homes with families displaced by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.[33]
An additional community of 75 homes is being sponsored in Santa Ana, El Salvador, with 40 teams of Thrivent Financial volunteers helping to build in 2009.

Library[edit]
The Aid Association for Lutherans maintained a library of over 12,000 books on business management, fraternalism, and life and health insurance.[34]
Recognition[edit]
In 2017, Thrivent Financial was named on its list of The World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere Magazine. Assessment is based upon the Ethisphere Institute's Ethics Quotient® (EQ) framework which offers a quantitative way to assess a company's performance in an objective, consistent and standardized way. Scores are generated in five key categories: ethics and compliance program (35%), corporate citizenship and responsibility (20%), culture of ethics (20%), governance (15%) and leadership, innovation and reputation (10%), and provided to all companies who participate in the process.

Predecessor groups[edit]
Thrivent Financial was officially formed on January 1, 2002, with the merger of Aid Association for Lutherans (AAL) and Lutheran Brotherhood (LB), which had been established in 1902 and 1917 respectively. The merger formed the largest fraternal benefit society in the United States.[5]
Aid Association for Lutherans[edit]




Head Office of the Aid Association for Lutherans, circa 1930-1945.


History[edit]
In the late 19th and early 20th century, the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod forbade its members to join fraternal societies because these required initiation rites and secret oaths. Life insurance was also frowned upon in some quarters because Martin Luther had written against similar enterprises in his day, the practice could be considered a form of usury, and it reflected a distrust in God.[6]

Like most fraternal benefit societies of the time, the AAL operated on the actuarially unsound graded assessment system. In 1905, it began a move to the legal reserve system, a transformation that was completed in 1911.[8] 1905 was also the year women were admitted as members.[7] Most of the early business was conducted in German, until this was discontinued in 1927.[8]
Membership was open only to members of the Missouri Synod and other Lutherans who were in fellowship with it until the mid-1960s, when it became open to Lutherans of all denominations. In the late 1960s, the Association had 792,000 members; this increased to about 1,200,000 members in 5,019 branches in 1978.[9] By 1979, it was the largest member of the National Fraternal Congress of America and ranked 13th among the 1,800 insurance firms in the country.[8][clarification needed]
Rituals[edit]
The AAL had no initiation rites, oaths, or other rituals.[8]
Non-profit Organization[edit]
The Association was organized on two levels: the local branches attached to Lutheran congregations, and the national level, which consisted only of a board of directors that met four times a year. The AAL was particular about it locals not being called "lodges" because that was too similar to the nomenclature of oath-bound, ritualistic groups such as the Freemasons or the Oddfellows. The AAL was headquartered in Appleton, Wisconsin[10]
Philanthropy[edit]
The AAL was also involved philanthropically, giving money to scholarships, support for educational institutions and training for church workers. Grants were made to agencies, boards and homes for the aged, disabled and to minorities. The Association was also had its own family health program, and sponsored blood drives and family health workshops. It also joined the National Center for Voluntary Action.[8]
Lutheran Brotherhood[edit]
History[edit]
The roots of Lutheran Brotherhood go back to the founding convention of the Norwegian Lutheran Church of America when Jacob Preus, the state insurance commissioner of Minnesota, proposed launching a not-for-profit aid society.[7] As with other Lutheran denominations, this move proved controversial, with some saying it indicated a lack of faith in God. Those who favored the society prevailed by arguing that the new aid society would prevent Norwegian Lutherans from joining unacceptable secret beneficial societies or "lodges" which was forbidden by conservative Lutheran doctrine.[11]
The organization authorized by the convention was called the Luther Union, and was incorporated in the State of Minnesota on September 18, 1918. That month the Luther Union entered into negotiations with Lutheran Brotherhood of America of Des Moines, Iowa. These two organizations merged in the Lutheran Brotherhood in 1920.[11]
The articles of incorporation of Lutheran Brotherhood stated its purpose:
“To aid the Lutheran Church in extending the Lutheran Faith, to foster patriotism, loyalty, justice, charity and benevolence, to provide education, instruction, proper entertainment and amusements, to encourage industry, saving, thrift and development on the part of its members, to give aid in the case of poverty, sickness, accident or old age, and otherwise promote the spiritual, intellectual and physical welfare of its members.”[12] Membership was open only to Lutherans. There were 550,000 members in 1965 and 900,000 in 1979.[11]
Rituals[edit]
Like the AAL, the LB had no rituals, secrets, or oaths.[11]
Non-profit Organization[edit]
Local units were called "branches", which were divided into three categories: A-1, affiliated to Lutheran congregations; A-2, usually sponsored by a group within a Lutheran parish; and A-3, geographic branches. The Lutheran Brotherhood had a quadrennial convention and a board of directors who managed its business. It was headquartered in Minneapolis.[13]
Philanthropy[edit]
The LB helped establish new Lutheran congregations through the Church Extension Fund, sponsored scholarships for Lutheran clergy, and arranged seminars on Christian topics.[11]
Mergers[edit]
Lutheran Life Insurance Society of Canada[edit]
In 1972 the Canadian branches of the Lutheran Brotherhood and the Aid Association for Lutherans merged, as a result of the desire to have an indigenous Canadian fraternal benefit society. They formed a new fraternal order called the Faith Life.[13]
Like the AAL and LB, the LLISC was organized into branches and run by a board of directors. There were 120 branches in 1979. The society was based in Kitchener, Ontario.[13]
The LLISC provided scholarships to Lutheran educational institutions, gave grants to churches and church-related organizations and projects, and gave reduced rate mortgages for Lutheran churches.[13]
Thrivent Financial for Lutherans[edit]
The AAL and LB functioned independently throughout the 20th century. In June 2001, after close consideration of how combining the two organizations would be of benefit to members, the AAL and LB merged, with the merger completed by the end of that year. Following the merger, in 2002 a new name was voted upon and approved by the members of the merged organization: Thrivent Financial for Lutherans.

Financial standing[edit]
In 2016 Thrivent Financial ranked 318 on the Fortune 500.[14] In 2016, Thrivent received an A.M. Best rating of AA+ (Superior)[15] and a Fitch rating of AA+ (Very Strong).[16]
Outreach[edit]
Thrivent Financial members made donations to Haiti relief following the 2010 Haiti earthquake through Lutheran World Relief, ELCA Domestic Disaster Response, LCMS World Relief/Human Care, and WELS Committee on Relief.[17] Thrivent Financial provided funding for the 2003 film Luther.[citation needed]
Thrivent Choice[edit]
Thrivent Choice is a program that offers members the opportunity to make recommendations for where some of Thrivent Financial's charitable outreach funds are directed.[18]
Thrivent Builds with Habitat for Humanity[edit]
Thrivent has formed an alliance with Habitat for Humanity called Thrivent Builds with Habitat for Humanity through which it contributes financial assistance for building affordable homes. The initiative also sponsors homebuilding trips by Thrivent members throughout the world.[19]
The Thrivent Builds alliance began in September, 2005,[20] with a four-year commitment of $105 million. Thrivent Financial chose Habitat for Humanity as an ally because in the ten years previous, its members had already proven their interest in volunteering with them by building over 500 homes.[21] In December, 2007, Thrivent Financial increased its total commitment to $125 million.[22] The alliance makes Thrivent Financial one of Habitat’s largest single allies and aims to increase Habitat’s annual house production by hundreds of U. S. homes per year and more around the world.[23]
Programs[edit]
There are two programs within the Thrivent Builds alliance.

Through Thrivent Builds Homes, Thrivent Financial and other Lutheran volunteers help build more than 300 homes a year within the United States with more than 200 Habitat for Humanity affiliates.[24] As of year-end 2008, over 1,000 homes were built with Habitat for Humanity families through this program.[25]
Thrivent Builds Worldwide offers Thrivent Financial members the opportunity to volunteer for one- to three-week homebuilding trips around the world where there are existing Habitat for Humanity programs. Thrivent Builds volunteers have helped build Habitat homes in Romania,[26] Poland,[27] South Africa,[28] New Zealand,[29] Guatemala,[30] El Salvador,[31] the Mississippi Gulf Coast[32] and many more destinations.

Additionally, there are two whole communities being built:

In the Mississippi Gulf Coast, Thrivent Builds is sponsoring a community of 28 homes with families displaced by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.[33]
An additional community of 75 homes is being sponsored in Santa Ana, El Salvador, with 40 teams of Thrivent Financial volunteers helping to build in 2009.

Library[edit]
The Aid Association for Lutherans maintained a library of over 12,000 books on business management, fraternalism, and life and health insurance.[34]
Recognition[edit]
In 2017, Thrivent Financial was named on its list of The World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere Magazine. Assessment is based upon the Ethisphere Institute's Ethics Quotient® (EQ) framework which offers a quantitative way to assess a company's performance in an objective, consistent and standardized way. Scores are generated in five key categories: ethics and compliance program (35%), corporate citizenship and responsibility (20%), culture of ethics (20%), governance (15%) and leadership, innovation and reputation (10%), and provided to all companies who participate in the process.

8.1 Thrivent Builds with Habitat for Humanity





Predecessor groups[edit]
Thrivent Financial was officially formed on January 1, 2002, with the merger of Aid Association for Lutherans (AAL) and Lutheran Brotherhood (LB), which had been established in 1902 and 1917 respectively. The merger formed the largest fraternal benefit society in the United States.[5]
Aid Association for Lutherans[edit]




Head Office of the Aid Association for Lutherans, circa 1930-1945.


History[edit]
In the late 19th and early 20th century, the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod forbade its members to join fraternal societies because these required initiation rites and secret oaths. Life insurance was also frowned upon in some quarters because Martin Luther had written against similar enterprises in his day, the practice could be considered a form of usury, and it reflected a distrust in God.[6]
In 1899, Albert Voecks, a member of St. Paul Lutheran Church in Appleton, Wisconsin broached the idea of creating an insurance society for Lutherans to fellow church members Gottlieb Ziegler and William Zuehlke.[7] They each gave $13 to the fund, and found several hundred others willing to contribute $5 each.[6] In 1902 the founders of the society recruited the 500 applicants necessary to receive a charter from the State of Wisconsin for their group.[7] It was chartered on November 24, 1902 as the Aid Association for Lutherans in Wisconsin and Other States.[6]
Like most fraternal benefit societies of the time, the AAL operated on the actuarially unsound graded assessment system. In 1905, it began a move to the legal reserve system, a transformation that was completed in 1911.[8] 1905 was also the year women were admitted as members.[7] Most of the early business was conducted in German, until this was discontinued in 1927.[8]
Membership was open only to members of the Missouri Synod and other Lutherans who were in fellowship with it until the mid-1960s, when it became open to Lutherans of all denominations. In the late 1960s, the Association had 792,000 members; this increased to about 1,200,000 members in 5,019 branches in 1978.[9] By 1979, it was the largest member of the National Fraternal Congress of America and ranked 13th among the 1,800 insurance firms in the country.[8][clarification needed]
Rituals[edit]
The AAL had no initiation rites, oaths, or other rituals.[8]
Non-profit Organization[edit]
The Association was organized on two levels: the local branches attached to Lutheran congregations, and the national level, which consisted only of a board of directors that met four times a year. The AAL was particular about it locals not being called "lodges" because that was too similar to the nomenclature of oath-bound, ritualistic groups such as the Freemasons or the Oddfellows. The AAL was headquartered in Appleton, Wisconsin[10]
Philanthropy[edit]
The AAL was also involved philanthropically, giving money to scholarships, support for educational institutions and training for church workers. Grants were made to agencies, boards and homes for the aged, disabled and to minorities. The Association was also had its own family health program, and sponsored blood drives and family health workshops. It also joined the National Center for Voluntary Action.[8]
Lutheran Brotherhood[edit]
History[edit]
The roots of Lutheran Brotherhood go back to the founding convention of the Norwegian Lutheran Church of America when Jacob Preus, the state insurance commissioner of Minnesota, proposed launching a not-for-profit aid society.[7] As with other Lutheran denominations, this move proved controversial, with some saying it indicated a lack of faith in God. Those who favored the society prevailed by arguing that the new aid society would prevent Norwegian Lutherans from joining unacceptable secret beneficial societies or "lodges" which was forbidden by conservative Lutheran doctrine.[11]
The organization authorized by the convention was called the Luther Union, and was incorporated in the State of Minnesota on September 18, 1918. That month the Luther Union entered into negotiations with Lutheran Brotherhood of America of Des Moines, Iowa. These two organizations merged in the Lutheran Brotherhood in 1920.[11]
The articles of incorporation of Lutheran Brotherhood stated its purpose:
“To aid the Lutheran Church in extending the Lutheran Faith, to foster patriotism, loyalty, justice, charity and benevolence, to provide education, instruction, proper entertainment and amusements, to encourage industry, saving, thrift and development on the part of its members, to give aid in the case of poverty, sickness, accident or old age, and otherwise promote the spiritual, intellectual and physical welfare of its members.”[12] Membership was open only to Lutherans. There were 550,000 members in 1965 and 900,000 in 1979.[11]
Rituals[edit]
Like the AAL, the LB had no rituals, secrets, or oaths.[11]
Non-profit Organization[edit]
Local units were called "branches", which were divided into three categories: A-1, affiliated to Lutheran congregations; A-2, usually sponsored by a group within a Lutheran parish; and A-3, geographic branches. The Lutheran Brotherhood had a quadrennial convention and a board of directors who managed its business. It was headquartered in Minneapolis.[13]
Philanthropy[edit]
The LB helped establish new Lutheran congregations through the Church Extension Fund, sponsored scholarships for Lutheran clergy, and arranged seminars on Christian topics.[11]
Mergers[edit]
Lutheran Life Insurance Society of Canada[edit]
In 1972 the Canadian branches of the Lutheran Brotherhood and the Aid Association for Lutherans merged, as a result of the desire to have an indigenous Canadian fraternal benefit society. They formed a new fraternal order called the Faith Life.[13]
Like the AAL and LB, the LLISC was organized into branches and run by a board of directors. There were 120 branches in 1979. The society was based in Kitchener, Ontario.[13]
The LLISC provided scholarships to Lutheran educational institutions, gave grants to churches and church-related organizations and projects, and gave reduced rate mortgages for Lutheran churches.[13]
Thrivent Financial for Lutherans[edit]
The AAL and LB functioned independently throughout the 20th century. In June 2001, after close consideration of how combining the two organizations would be of benefit to members, the AAL and LB merged, with the merger completed by the end of that year. Following the merger, in 2002 a new name was voted upon and approved by the members of the merged organization: Thrivent Financial for Lutherans.

Financial standing[edit]
In 2016 Thrivent Financial ranked 318 on the Fortune 500.[14] In 2016, Thrivent received an A.M. Best rating of AA+ (Superior)[15] and a Fitch rating of AA+ (Very Strong).[16]

Thrivent Financial members made donations to Haiti relief following the 2010 Haiti earthquake through Lutheran World Relief, ELCA Domestic Disaster Response, LCMS World Relief/Human Care, and WELS Committee on Relief.[17] Thrivent Financial provided funding for the 2003 film Luther.[citation needed]
Thrivent Choice[edit]
Thrivent Choice is a program that offers members the opportunity to make recommendations for where some of Thrivent Financial's charitable outreach funds are directed.[18]
Thrivent Builds with Habitat for Humanity[edit]
Thrivent has formed an alliance with Habitat for Humanity called Thrivent Builds with Habitat for Humanity through which it contributes financial assistance for building affordable homes. The initiative also sponsors homebuilding trips by Thrivent members throughout the world.[19]
The Thrivent Builds alliance began in September, 2005,[20] with a four-year commitment of $105 million. Thrivent Financial chose Habitat for Humanity as an ally because in the ten years previous, its members had already proven their interest in volunteering with them by building over 500 homes.[21] In December, 2007, Thrivent Financial increased its total commitment to $125 million.[22] The alliance makes Thrivent Financial one of Habitat’s largest single allies and aims to increase Habitat’s annual house production by hundreds of U. S. homes per year and more around the world.[23]
Programs[edit]
There are two programs within the Thrivent Builds alliance.

Through Thrivent Builds Homes, Thrivent Financial and other Lutheran volunteers help build more than 300 homes a year within the United States with more than 200 Habitat for Humanity affiliates.[24] As of year-end 2008, over 1,000 homes were built with Habitat for Humanity families through this program.[25]
Thrivent Builds Worldwide offers Thrivent Financial members the opportunity to volunteer for one- to three-week homebuilding trips around the world where there are existing Habitat for Humanity programs. Thrivent Builds volunteers have helped build Habitat homes in Romania,[26] Poland,[27] South Africa,[28] New Zealand,[29] Guatemala,[30] El Salvador,[31] the Mississippi Gulf Coast[32] and many more destinations.

Additionally, there are two whole communities being built:

In the Mississippi Gulf Coast, Thrivent Builds is sponsoring a community of 28 homes with families displaced by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.[33]
An additional community of 75 homes is being sponsored in Santa Ana, El Salvador, with 40 teams of Thrivent Financial volunteers helping to build in 2009.

Library[edit]
The Aid Association for Lutherans maintained a library of over 12,000 books on business management, fraternalism, and life and health insurance.[34]
Recognition[edit]
In 2017, Thrivent Financial was named on its list of The World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere Magazine. Assessment is based upon the Ethisphere Institute's Ethics Quotient® (EQ) framework which offers a quantitative way to assess a company's performance in an objective, consistent and standardized way. Scores are generated in five key categories: ethics and compliance program (35%), corporate citizenship and responsibility (20%), culture of ethics (20%), governance (15%) and leadership, innovation and reputation (10%), and provided to all companies who participate in the process.

Predecessor groups[edit]
Thrivent Financial was officially formed on January 1, 2002, with the merger of Aid Association for Lutherans (AAL) and Lutheran Brotherhood (LB), which had been established in 1902 and 1917 respectively. The merger formed the largest fraternal benefit society in the United States.[5]
Aid Association for Lutherans[edit]




Head Office of the Aid Association for Lutherans, circa 1930-1945.


History[edit]
In the late 19th and early 20th century, the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod forbade its members to join fraternal societies because these required initiation rites and secret oaths. Life insurance was also frowned upon in some quarters because Martin Luther had written against similar enterprises in his day, the practice could be considered a form of usury, and it reflected a distrust in God.[6]
In 1899, Albert Voecks, a member of St. Paul Lutheran Church in Appleton, Wisconsin broached the idea of creating an insurance society for Lutherans to fellow church members Gottlieb Ziegler and William Zuehlke.[7] They each gave $13 to the fund, and found several hundred others willing to contribute $5 each.[6] In 1902 the founders of the society recruited the 500 applicants necessary to receive a charter from the State of Wisconsin for their group.[7] It was chartered on November 24, 1902 as the Aid Association for Lutherans in Wisconsin and Other States.[6]
Like most fraternal benefit societies of the time, the AAL operated on the actuarially unsound graded assessment system. In 1905, it began a move to the legal reserve system, a transformation that was completed in 1911.[8] 1905 was also the year women were admitted as members.[7] Most of the early business was conducted in German, until this was discontinued in 1927.[8]
Membership was open only to members of the Missouri Synod and other Lutherans who were in fellowship with it until the mid-1960s, when it became open to Lutherans of all denominations. In the late 1960s, the Association had 792,000 members; this increased to about 1,200,000 members in 5,019 branches in 1978.[9] By 1979, it was the largest member of the National Fraternal Congress of America and ranked 13th among the 1,800 insurance firms in the country.[8][clarification needed]
Rituals[edit]
The AAL had no initiation rites, oaths, or other rituals.[8]
Non-profit Organization[edit]
The Association was organized on two levels: the local branches attached to Lutheran congregations, and the national level, which consisted only of a board of directors that met four times a year. The AAL was particular about it locals not being called "lodges" because that was too similar to the nomenclature of oath-bound, ritualistic groups such as the Freemasons or the Oddfellows. The AAL was headquartered in Appleton, Wisconsin[10]
Philanthropy[edit]
The AAL was also involved philanthropically, giving money to scholarships, support for educational institutions and training for church workers. Grants were made to agencies, boards and homes for the aged, disabled and to minorities. The Association was also had its own family health program, and sponsored blood drives and family health workshops. It also joined the National Center for Voluntary Action.[8]
Lutheran Brotherhood[edit]
History[edit]
The roots of Lutheran Brotherhood go back to the founding convention of the Norwegian Lutheran Church of America when Jacob Preus, the state insurance commissioner of Minnesota, proposed launching a not-for-profit aid society.[7] As with other Lutheran denominations, this move proved controversial, with some saying it indicated a lack of faith in God. Those who favored the society prevailed by arguing that the new aid society would prevent Norwegian Lutherans from joining unacceptable secret beneficial societies or "lodges" which was forbidden by conservative Lutheran doctrine.[11]
The organization authorized by the convention was called the Luther Union, and was incorporated in the State of Minnesota on September 18, 1918. That month the Luther Union entered into negotiations with Lutheran Brotherhood of America of Des Moines, Iowa. These two organizations merged in the Lutheran Brotherhood in 1920.[11]
The articles of incorporation of Lutheran Brotherhood stated its purpose:
“To aid the Lutheran Church in extending the Lutheran Faith, to foster patriotism, loyalty, justice, charity and benevolence, to provide education, instruction, proper entertainment and amusements, to encourage industry, saving, thrift and development on the part of its members, to give aid in the case of poverty, sickness, accident or old age, and otherwise promote the spiritual, intellectual and physical welfare of its members.”[12] Membership was open only to Lutherans. There were 550,000 members in 1965 and 900,000 in 1979.[11]
Rituals[edit]
Like the AAL, the LB had no rituals, secrets, or oaths.[11]
Non-profit Organization[edit]
Local units were called "branches", which were divided into three categories: A-1, affiliated to Lutheran congregations; A-2, usually sponsored by a group within a Lutheran parish; and A-3, geographic branches. The Lutheran Brotherhood had a quadrennial convention and a board of directors who managed its business. It was headquartered in Minneapolis.[13]
Philanthropy[edit]
The LB helped establish new Lutheran congregations through the Church Extension Fund, sponsored scholarships for Lutheran clergy, and arranged seminars on Christian topics.[11]
Mergers[edit]
Lutheran Life Insurance Society of Canada[edit]
In 1972 the Canadian branches of the Lutheran Brotherhood and the Aid Association for Lutherans merged, as a result of the desire to have an indigenous Canadian fraternal benefit society. They formed a new fraternal order called the Faith Life.[13]
Like the AAL and LB, the LLISC was organized into branches and run by a board of directors. There were 120 branches in 1979. The society was based in Kitchener, Ontario.[13]
The LLISC provided scholarships to Lutheran educational institutions, gave grants to churches and church-related organizations and projects, and gave reduced rate mortgages for Lutheran churches.[13]
Thrivent Financial for Lutherans[edit]
The AAL and LB functioned independently throughout the 20th century. In June 2001, after close consideration of how combining the two organizations would be of benefit to members, the AAL and LB merged, with the merger completed by the end of that year. Following the merger, in 2002 a new name was voted upon and approved by the members of the merged organization: Thrivent Financial for Lutherans.

In 2016 Thrivent Financial ranked 318 on the Fortune 500.[14] In 2016, Thrivent received an A.M. Best rating of AA+ (Superior)[15] and a Fitch rating of AA+ (Very Strong).[16]

Thrivent Choice[edit]
Thrivent Choice is a program that offers members the opportunity to make recommendations for where some of Thrivent Financial's charitable outreach funds are directed.[18]
Thrivent Builds with Habitat for Humanity[edit]
Thrivent has formed an alliance with Habitat for Humanity called Thrivent Builds with Habitat for Humanity through which it contributes financial assistance for building affordable homes. The initiative also sponsors homebuilding trips by Thrivent members throughout the world.[19]
The Thrivent Builds alliance began in September, 2005,[20] with a four-year commitment of $105 million. Thrivent Financial chose Habitat for Humanity as an ally because in the ten years previous, its members had already proven their interest in volunteering with them by building over 500 homes.[21] In December, 2007, Thrivent Financial increased its total commitment to $125 million.[22] The alliance makes Thrivent Financial one of Habitat’s largest single allies and aims to increase Habitat’s annual house production by hundreds of U. S. homes per year and more around the world.[23]
Programs[edit]
There are two programs within the Thrivent Builds alliance.

Through Thrivent Builds Homes, Thrivent Financial and other Lutheran volunteers help build more than 300 homes a year within the United States with more than 200 Habitat for Humanity affiliates.[24] As of year-end 2008, over 1,000 homes were built with Habitat for Humanity families through this program.[25]
Thrivent Builds Worldwide offers Thrivent Financial members the opportunity to volunteer for one- to three-week homebuilding trips around the world where there are existing Habitat for Humanity programs. Thrivent Builds volunteers have helped build Habitat homes in Romania,[26] Poland,[27] South Africa,[28] New Zealand,[29] Guatemala,[30] El Salvador,[31] the Mississippi Gulf Coast[32] and many more destinations.

Additionally, there are two whole communities being built:

In the Mississippi Gulf Coast, Thrivent Builds is sponsoring a community of 28 homes with families displaced by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.[33]
An additional community of 75 homes is being sponsored in Santa Ana, El Salvador, with 40 teams of Thrivent Financial volunteers helping to build in 2009.

Library[edit]
The Aid Association for Lutherans maintained a library of over 12,000 books on business management, fraternalism, and life and health insurance.[34]
Recognition[edit]
In 2017, Thrivent Financial was named on its list of The World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere Magazine. Assessment is based upon the Ethisphere Institute's Ethics Quotient® (EQ) framework which offers a quantitative way to assess a company's performance in an objective, consistent and standardized way. Scores are generated in five key categories: ethics and compliance program (35%), corporate citizenship and responsibility (20%), culture of ethics (20%), governance (15%) and leadership, innovation and reputation (10%), and provided to all companies who participate in the process.

Predecessor groups[edit]
Thrivent Financial was officially formed on January 1, 2002, with the merger of Aid Association for Lutherans (AAL) and Lutheran Brotherhood (LB), which had been established in 1902 and 1917 respectively. The merger formed the largest fraternal benefit society in the United States.[5]
Aid Association for Lutherans[edit]




Head Office of the Aid Association for Lutherans, circa 1930-1945.


History[edit]
In the late 19th and early 20th century, the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod forbade its members to join fraternal societies because these required initiation rites and secret oaths. Life insurance was also frowned upon in some quarters because Martin Luther had written against similar enterprises in his day, the practice could be considered a form of usury, and it reflected a distrust in God.[6]

The AAL was also involved philanthropically, giving money to scholarships, support for educational institutions and training for church workers. Grants were made to agencies, boards and homes for the aged, disabled and to minorities. The Association was also had its own family health program, and sponsored blood drives and family health workshops. It also joined the National Center for Voluntary Action.[8]

8.1 Thrivent Builds with Habitat for Humanity





Predecessor groups[edit]
Thrivent Financial was officially formed on January 1, 2002, with the merger of Aid Association for Lutherans (AAL) and Lutheran Brotherhood (LB), which had been established in 1902 and 1917 respectively. The merger formed the largest fraternal benefit society in the United States.[5]
Aid Association for Lutherans[edit]




Head Office of the Aid Association for Lutherans, circa 1930-1945.


History[edit]
In the late 19th and early 20th century, the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod forbade its members to join fraternal societies because these required initiation rites and secret oaths. Life insurance was also frowned upon in some quarters because Martin Luther had written against similar enterprises in his day, the practice could be considered a form of usury, and it reflected a distrust in God.[6]
In 1899, Albert Voecks, a member of St. Paul Lutheran Church in Appleton, Wisconsin broached the idea of creating an insurance society for Lutherans to fellow church members Gottlieb Ziegler and William Zuehlke.[7] They each gave $13 to the fund, and found several hundred others willing to contribute $5 each.[6] In 1902 the founders of the society recruited the 500 applicants necessary to receive a charter from the State of Wisconsin for their group.[7] It was chartered on November 24, 1902 as the Aid Association for Lutherans in Wisconsin and Other States.[6]
Like most fraternal benefit societies of the time, the AAL operated on the actuarially unsound graded assessment system. In 1905, it began a move to the legal reserve system, a transformation that was completed in 1911.[8] 1905 was also the year women were admitted as members.[7] Most of the early business was conducted in German, until this was discontinued in 1927.[8]
Membership was open only to members of the Missouri Synod and other Lutherans who were in fellowship with it until the mid-1960s, when it became open to Lutherans of all denominations. In the late 1960s, the Association had 792,000 members; this increased to about 1,200,000 members in 5,019 branches in 1978.[9] By 1979, it was the largest member of the National Fraternal Congress of America and ranked 13th among the 1,800 insurance firms in the country.[8][clarification needed]
Rituals[edit]
The AAL had no initiation rites, oaths, or other rituals.[8]
Non-profit Organization[edit]
The Association was organized on two levels: the local branches attached to Lutheran congregations, and the national level, which consisted only of a board of directors that met four times a year. The AAL was particular about it locals not being called "lodges" because that was too similar to the nomenclature of oath-bound, ritualistic groups such as the Freemasons or the Oddfellows. The AAL was headquartered in Appleton, Wisconsin[10]
Philanthropy[edit]
The AAL was also involved philanthropically, giving money to scholarships, support for educational institutions and training for church workers. Grants were made to agencies, boards and homes for the aged, disabled and to minorities. The Association was also had its own family health program, and sponsored blood drives and family health workshops. It also joined the National Center for Voluntary Action.[8]
Lutheran Brotherhood[edit]
History[edit]
The roots of Lutheran Brotherhood go back to the founding convention of the Norwegian Lutheran Church of America when Jacob Preus, the state insurance commissioner of Minnesota, proposed launching a not-for-profit aid society.[7] As with other Lutheran denominations, this move proved controversial, with some saying it indicated a lack of faith in God. Those who favored the society prevailed by arguing that the new aid society would prevent Norwegian Lutherans from joining unacceptable secret beneficial societies or "lodges" which was forbidden by conservative Lutheran doctrine.[11]
The organization authorized by the convention was called the Luther Union, and was incorporated in the State of Minnesota on September 18, 1918. That month the Luther Union entered into negotiations with Lutheran Brotherhood of America of Des Moines, Iowa. These two organizations merged in the Lutheran Brotherhood in 1920.[11]
The articles of incorporation of Lutheran Brotherhood stated its purpose:
“To aid the Lutheran Church in extending the Lutheran Faith, to foster patriotism, loyalty, justice, charity and benevolence, to provide education, instruction, proper entertainment and amusements, to encourage industry, saving, thrift and development on the part of its members, to give aid in the case of poverty, sickness, accident or old age, and otherwise promote the spiritual, intellectual and physical welfare of its members.”[12] Membership was open only to Lutherans. There were 550,000 members in 1965 and 900,000 in 1979.[11]
Rituals[edit]
Like the AAL, the LB had no rituals, secrets, or oaths.[11]
Non-profit Organization[edit]
Local units were called "branches", which were divided into three categories: A-1, affiliated to Lutheran congregations; A-2, usually sponsored by a group within a Lutheran parish; and A-3, geographic branches. The Lutheran Brotherhood had a quadrennial convention and a board of directors who managed its business. It was headquartered in Minneapolis.[13]
Philanthropy[edit]
The LB helped establish new Lutheran congregations through the Church Extension Fund, sponsored scholarships for Lutheran clergy, and arranged seminars on Christian topics.[11]
Mergers[edit]
Lutheran Life Insurance Society of Canada[edit]
In 1972 the Canadian branches of the Lutheran Brotherhood and the Aid Association for Lutherans merged, as a result of the desire to have an indigenous Canadian fraternal benefit society. They formed a new fraternal order called the Faith Life.[13]
Like the AAL and LB, the LLISC was organized into branches and run by a board of directors. There were 120 branches in 1979. The society was based in Kitchener, Ontario.[13]
The LLISC provided scholarships to Lutheran educational institutions, gave grants to churches and church-related organizations and projects, and gave reduced rate mortgages for Lutheran churches.[13]
Thrivent Financial for Lutherans[edit]
The AAL and LB functioned independently throughout the 20th century. In June 2001, after close consideration of how combining the two organizations would be of benefit to members, the AAL and LB merged, with the merger completed by the end of that year. Following the merger, in 2002 a new name was voted upon and approved by the members of the merged organization: Thrivent Financial for Lutherans.
Financial services[edit]

Financial standing[edit]
In 2016 Thrivent Financial ranked 318 on the Fortune 500.[14] In 2016, Thrivent received an A.M. Best rating of AA+ (Superior)[15] and a Fitch rating of AA+ (Very Strong).[16]
Outreach[edit]
Thrivent Financial members made donations to Haiti relief following the 2010 Haiti earthquake through Lutheran World Relief, ELCA Domestic Disaster Response, LCMS World Relief/Human Care, and WELS Committee on Relief.[17] Thrivent Financial provided funding for the 2003 film Luther.[citation needed]
Thrivent Choice[edit]
Thrivent Choice is a program that offers members the opportunity to make recommendations for where some of Thrivent Financial's charitable outreach funds are directed.[18]
Thrivent Builds with Habitat for Humanity[edit]
Thrivent has formed an alliance with Habitat for Humanity called Thrivent Builds with Habitat for Humanity through which it contributes financial assistance for building affordable homes. The initiative also sponsors homebuilding trips by Thrivent members throughout the world.[19]
The Thrivent Builds alliance began in September, 2005,[20] with a four-year commitment of $105 million. Thrivent Financial chose Habitat for Humanity as an ally because in the ten years previous, its members had already proven their interest in volunteering with them by building over 500 homes.[21] In December, 2007, Thrivent Financial increased its total commitment to $125 million.[22] The alliance makes Thrivent Financial one of Habitat’s largest single allies and aims to increase Habitat’s annual house production by hundreds of U. S. homes per year and more around the world.[23]
Programs[edit]
There are two programs within the Thrivent Builds alliance.

Through Thrivent Builds Homes, Thrivent Financial and other Lutheran volunteers help build more than 300 homes a year within the United States with more than 200 Habitat for Humanity affiliates.[24] As of year-end 2008, over 1,000 homes were built with Habitat for Humanity families through this program.[25]
Thrivent Builds Worldwide offers Thrivent Financial members the opportunity to volunteer for one- to three-week homebuilding trips around the world where there are existing Habitat for Humanity programs. Thrivent Builds volunteers have helped build Habitat homes in Romania,[26] Poland,[27] South Africa,[28] New Zealand,[29] Guatemala,[30] El Salvador,[31] the Mississippi Gulf Coast[32] and many more destinations.

Additionally, there are two whole communities being built:

In the Mississippi Gulf Coast, Thrivent Builds is sponsoring a community of 28 homes with families displaced by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.[33]
An additional community of 75 homes is being sponsored in Santa Ana, El Salvador, with 40 teams of Thrivent Financial volunteers helping to build in 2009.

Library[edit]
The Aid Association for Lutherans maintained a library of over 12,000 books on business management, fraternalism, and life and health insurance.[34]
Recognition[edit]
In 2017, Thrivent Financial was named on its list of The World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere Magazine. Assessment is based upon the Ethisphere Institute's Ethics Quotient® (EQ) framework which offers a quantitative way to assess a company's performance in an objective, consistent and standardized way. Scores are generated in five key categories: ethics and compliance program (35%), corporate citizenship and responsibility (20%), culture of ethics (20%), governance (15%) and leadership, innovation and reputation (10%), and provided to all companies who participate in the process.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

8.1 Thrivent Builds with Habitat for Humanity





Predecessor groups[edit]
Thrivent Financial was officially formed on January 1, 2002, with the merger of Aid Association for Lutherans (AAL) and Lutheran Brotherhood (LB), which had been established in 1902 and 1917 respectively. The merger formed the largest fraternal benefit society in the United States.[5]
Aid Association for Lutherans[edit]




Head Office of the Aid Association for Lutherans, circa 1930-1945.


History[edit]
In the late 19th and early 20th century, the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod forbade its members to join fraternal societies because these required initiation rites and secret oaths. Life insurance was also frowned upon in some quarters because Martin Luther had written against similar enterprises in his day, the practice could be considered a form of usury, and it reflected a distrust in God.[6]
In 1899, Albert Voecks, a member of St. Paul Lutheran Church in Appleton, Wisconsin broached the idea of creating an insurance society for Lutherans to fellow church members Gottlieb Ziegler and William Zuehlke.[7] They each gave $13 to the fund, and found several hundred others willing to contribute $5 each.[6] In 1902 the founders of the society recruited the 500 applicants necessary to receive a charter from the State of Wisconsin for their group.[7] It was chartered on November 24, 1902 as the Aid Association for Lutherans in Wisconsin and Other States.[6]
Like most fraternal benefit societies of the time, the AAL operated on the actuarially unsound graded assessment system. In 1905, it began a move to the legal reserve system, a transformation that was completed in 1911.[8] 1905 was also the year women were admitted as members.[7] Most of the early business was conducted in German, until this was discontinued in 1927.[8]
Membership was open only to members of the Missouri Synod and other Lutherans who were in fellowship with it until the mid-1960s, when it became open to Lutherans of all denominations. In the late 1960s, the Association had 792,000 members; this increased to about 1,200,000 members in 5,019 branches in 1978.[9] By 1979, it was the largest member of the National Fraternal Congress of America and ranked 13th among the 1,800 insurance firms in the country.[8][clarification needed]
Rituals[edit]
The AAL had no initiation rites, oaths, or other rituals.[8]
Non-profit Organization[edit]
The Association was organized on two levels: the local branches attached to Lutheran congregations, and the national level, which consisted only of a board of directors that met four times a year. The AAL was particular about it locals not being called "lodges" because that was too similar to the nomenclature of oath-bound, ritualistic groups such as the Freemasons or the Oddfellows. The AAL was headquartered in Appleton, Wisconsin[10]
Philanthropy[edit]
The AAL was also involved philanthropically, giving money to scholarships, support for educational institutions and training for church workers. Grants were made to agencies, boards and homes for the aged, disabled and to minorities. The Association was also had its own family health program, and sponsored blood drives and family health workshops. It also joined the National Center for Voluntary Action.[8]
Lutheran Brotherhood[edit]
History[edit]
The roots of Lutheran Brotherhood go back to the founding convention of the Norwegian Lutheran Church of America when Jacob Preus, the state insurance commissioner of Minnesota, proposed launching a not-for-profit aid society.[7] As with other Lutheran denominations, this move proved controversial, with some saying it indicated a lack of faith in God. Those who favored the society prevailed by arguing that the new aid society would prevent Norwegian Lutherans from joining unacceptable secret beneficial societies or "lodges" which was forbidden by conservative Lutheran doctrine.[11]
The organization authorized by the convention was called the Luther Union, and was incorporated in the State of Minnesota on September 18, 1918. That month the Luther Union entered into negotiations with Lutheran Brotherhood of America of Des Moines, Iowa. These two organizations merged in the Lutheran Brotherhood in 1920.[11]
The articles of incorporation of Lutheran Brotherhood stated its purpose:
“To aid the Lutheran Church in extending the Lutheran Faith, to foster patriotism, loyalty, justice, charity and benevolence, to provide education, instruction, proper entertainment and amusements, to encourage industry, saving, thrift and development on the part of its members, to give aid in the case of poverty, sickness, accident or old age, and otherwise promote the spiritual, intellectual and physical welfare of its members.”[12] Membership was open only to Lutherans. There were 550,000 members in 1965 and 900,000 in 1979.[11]
Rituals[edit]
Like the AAL, the LB had no rituals, secrets, or oaths.[11]
Non-profit Organization[edit]
Local units were called "branches", which were divided into three categories: A-1, affiliated to Lutheran congregations; A-2, usually sponsored by a group within a Lutheran parish; and A-3, geographic branches. The Lutheran Brotherhood had a quadrennial convention and a board of directors who managed its business. It was headquartered in Minneapolis.[13]
Philanthropy[edit]
The LB helped establish new Lutheran congregations through the Church Extension Fund, sponsored scholarships for Lutheran clergy, and arranged seminars on Christian topics.[11]
Mergers[edit]
Lutheran Life Insurance Society of Canada[edit]
In 1972 the Canadian branches of the Lutheran Brotherhood and the Aid Association for Lutherans merged, as a result of the desire to have an indigenous Canadian fraternal benefit society. They formed a new fraternal order called the Faith Life.[13]
Like the AAL and LB, the LLISC was organized into branches and run by a board of directors. There were 120 branches in 1979. The society was based in Kitchener, Ontario.[13]
The LLISC provided scholarships to Lutheran educational institutions, gave grants to churches and church-related organizations and projects, and gave reduced rate mortgages for Lutheran churches.[13]
Thrivent Financial for Lutherans[edit]
The AAL and LB functioned independently throughout the 20th century. In June 2001, after close consideration of how combining the two organizations would be of benefit to members, the AAL and LB merged, with the merger completed by the end of that year. Following the merger, in 2002 a new name was voted upon and approved by the members of the merged organization: Thrivent Financial for Lutherans.
Financial services[edit]

Financial standing[edit]
In 2016 Thrivent Financial ranked 318 on the Fortune 500.[14] In 2016, Thrivent received an A.M. Best rating of AA+ (Superior)[15] and a Fitch rating of AA+ (Very Strong).[16]
Outreach[edit]
Thrivent Financial members made donations to Haiti relief following the 2010 Haiti earthquake through Lutheran World Relief, ELCA Domestic Disaster Response, LCMS World Relief/Human Care, and WELS Committee on Relief.[17] Thrivent Financial provided funding for the 2003 film Luther.[citation needed]
Thrivent Choice[edit]
Thrivent Choice is a program that offers members the opportunity to make recommendations for where some of Thrivent Financial's charitable outreach funds are directed.[18]
Thrivent Builds with Habitat for Humanity[edit]
Thrivent has formed an alliance with Habitat for Humanity called Thrivent Builds with Habitat for Humanity through which it contributes financial assistance for building affordable homes. The initiative also sponsors homebuilding trips by Thrivent members throughout the world.[19]
The Thrivent Builds alliance began in September, 2005,[20] with a four-year commitment of $105 million. Thrivent Financial chose Habitat for Humanity as an ally because in the ten years previous, its members had already proven their interest in volunteering with them by building over 500 homes.[21] In December, 2007, Thrivent Financial increased its total commitment to $125 million.[22] The alliance makes Thrivent Financial one of Habitat’s largest single allies and aims to increase Habitat’s annual house production by hundreds of U. S. homes per year and more around the world.[23]
Programs[edit]
There are two programs within the Thrivent Builds alliance.

Through Thrivent Builds Homes, Thrivent Financial and other Lutheran volunteers help build more than 300 homes a year within the United States with more than 200 Habitat for Humanity affiliates.[24] As of year-end 2008, over 1,000 homes were built with Habitat for Humanity families through this program.[25]
Thrivent Builds Worldwide offers Thrivent Financial members the opportunity to volunteer for one- to three-week homebuilding trips around the world where there are existing Habitat for Humanity programs. Thrivent Builds volunteers have helped build Habitat homes in Romania,[26] Poland,[27] South Africa,[28] New Zealand,[29] Guatemala,[30] El Salvador,[31] the Mississippi Gulf Coast[32] and many more destinations.

Additionally, there are two whole communities being built:

In the Mississippi Gulf Coast, Thrivent Builds is sponsoring a community of 28 homes with families displaced by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.[33]
An additional community of 75 homes is being sponsored in Santa Ana, El Salvador, with 40 teams of Thrivent Financial volunteers helping to build in 2009.

Library[edit]
The Aid Association for Lutherans maintained a library of over 12,000 books on business management, fraternalism, and life and health insurance.[34]
Recognition[edit]
In 2017, Thrivent Financial was named on its list of The World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere Magazine. Assessment is based upon the Ethisphere Institute's Ethics Quotient® (EQ) framework which offers a quantitative way to assess a company's performance in an objective, consistent and standardized way. Scores are generated in five key categories: ethics and compliance program (35%), corporate citizenship and responsibility (20%), culture of ethics (20%), governance (15%) and leadership, innovation and reputation (10%), and provided to all companies who participate in the process.

Past performance does not guarantee future results. Annualized total returns reflect the change in unit price, the reinvestment of all dividends and capital gains, and the effects of compounding. Since performance varies, the annualized total return, which assumes a steady rate of growth, differs from the subaccount's actual total return for the time period indicated. These returns reflect all recurring fees that are charged to contract owners and represent past performance. Both the investment return and the principal value of an investment fluctuate so that units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original investment. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted.
Note: The separate account was established on October 31, 2002.
These returns do not include the annual administrative charge of $30 deducted from any W-BC-FPVA(05) contract if (a) the Accumulated Value of the Contract on the Contract Anniversary is less than $15,000, (b) the sum of premiums paid on, less all surrenders made from, the Contract is less than $15,000, and (c) the sum of premiums paid, less all surrenders made during the Contract Year just ended is less than $2,400. Inclusion of the administrative charge would reduce the total return figures shown. These figures do not include the cost of optional living or death benefits. Inclusion of the cost of additional benefits would reduce the total return figures shown. Periods less than one year are not annualized. Subaccount total return calculations assume an initial investment of $10,000. At various times, the adviser has contractually or voluntarily reimbursed Portfolio expenses. Had the adviser not done so, the total returns would have been lower. This reimbursement of expenses may be discontinued at any time. See the Variable Series Fund, Inc. prospectus for more information. Call 800-THRIVENT or visit www.thrivent.com for more current performance results.
Variable insurance products, where available, are offered and underwritten by Thrivent Financial for Lutherans, Appleton, WI, 54919-0001, and distributed by Thrivent Investment Management Inc., 625 Fourth Ave. S., Minneapolis, MN 55415-1665, (1-800-THRIVENT; 1-800-847-4836), a wholly owned subsidiary of Thrivent Financial for Lutherans.

Investing in a variable annuity contract involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. More complete information on the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the variable annuity contract and underlying investment options is included in the prospectus, which investors should read and consider carefully before investing. Prospectuses are available from a Thrivent Financial representative or at www.thrivent.com.
Non-standardized. Annualized total returns are based on the change in unit values at the subaccount level for the time period mentioned. Expenses included are the current mortality and expense risk charge of 1.25% and applicable annual operating Portfolio expenses ranging from [0.36% to 1.50%]. (The maximum annual operating expenses would be 0.36% to 1.80% without reimbursement.) Standardized calculation was used; however, neither annual administrative charges or surrender charges have been included. If they had been included, the quoted performance would have been lower.
* Standardized. "If surrendered" values reflect surrender charges applied during the first seven years. These charges are 7 percent in the first contract year, and decrease by 1 percent each subsequent year until they are zero. Up to 10% of your accumulated value may be withdrawn each contract year without a surrender charge and is reflected in the calculation of performance. Expenses that were included are the maximum mortality and expense risk charge of 1.25% and net annual Portfolio operating expenses ranging from 0.42% to 2.67%. (The maximum annual Portfolio operating expenses would be 0.42% to 2.67% without reimbursement.) Annual expenses are subject to change.
