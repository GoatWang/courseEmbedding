Rate review information
For the first time since 2010, we’ve adjusted our electric and natural gas prices (base rates) in Wisconsin for residential customers.
Why? Because we’re focused on a long-term strategy to achieve a cleaner, more efficient power mix. That requires an investment in our generation fleet. At the same time, we’re managing costs and keeping stable rates for customers.

                            "Very informative and great site and so quick. Pretty slick."

                            "The service was great, with a reasonable price and great results. We have now started using another supplier from China. We just ordered our first container from the new supplier and with the savings it more than paid for the ImportGenius.com service on the first container load."

                            "Import Genius is not merely an investment for our organization, it’s a vital instrument to effectively manage our time. It has afforded us the ability to quickly segment, target and position ourselves in front of prospective clients. Thank you, Import Genius!"

                            "Import Genius data is fantastic for evaluating component manufacturers in China."

                            "We have confidence that we're working with the best manufacturers in part because Import Genius showed us that they already supply some of the world's top brands"
