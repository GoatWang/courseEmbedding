Main heading: Our value chainSub heading: Bulk commodities to the food on your table 



Connecting harvests to homes, from South America to North Africa, Bunge brings food from where it’s produced to where it’s needed. Our integrated value chain links origination, storage and transportation to activities further down the line, including processing, packaging and distribution. This helps farmers and communities prosper, puts better food on the shelf, increases sustainability, strengthens global food security and improves diets.
We are guided by four strategic pillars: we stand for safety to make sure our employees go home every day to their families in good shape; we apply best-in-class practices and share knowledge across our operations to do things better; we strike the right balance to achieve a profitable mix of commodity and value-added businesses and we continue to refine our winning footprint, which helps us serve our customers and outperform our competitors.

Bunge is a leading producer of sugar and ethanol from sugarcane in Brazil and a global sugar trader. Brazil is now easily the biggest producer in the world, with an annual harvest of around 600 million metric tons, of a world total of 1.6 billion.

Fitch Rates Bunge's EUR200MM Sr. Unsecured Notes 'BBB' | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Rates Bunge's EUR200MM Sr. Unsecured Notes 'BBB'
    





November 10, 2016 01:50 PM Eastern Standard Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch rates Bunge Finance Europe B.V.'s (BFE) EUR200 million senior 
      unsecured notes 'BBB'. The notes are being issued under the same terms 
      as the previous EUR600 million BFE notes due 2023 issued in June 2016. 
      The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Bunge Ltd. 
      (Bunge). Bunge intends to use net proceeds from the issuance for general 
      corporate purposes, including repayment of outstanding indebtedness such 
      as borrowings under Bunge's revolving credit facilities. The Rating 
      Outlook is Stable.
    

      A full list of ratings follows at the end of this release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Agribusiness Segment Concentration
    

      Bunge has a leading position in oilseed processing and logistics that 
      supports the approximate $40 billion in consolidated annual revenues. 
      Bunge has considerable geographical diversification with its global 
      asset footprint covering all major export and import markets although it 
      has substantial exposure to South America including approximately 36% of 
      its total processing capacity. While there is some diversification of 
      the business portfolio provided by the food and ingredients businesses, 
      the agribusiness segment currently represents more than 80% of operating 
      income.
    

      In an effort to offset earnings concentration and help reduce 
      volatility, over the longer term, Bunge targets increasing the value 
      added contribution of the food and ingredients businesses (edible oil 
      and milling products) to approximately 35% of total operating income 
      through a combination of organic growth and asset purchases. This 
      compares to 16% in 2015.
    

      Fitch views Bunge's business risk profile as weaker relative to its 
      peers, Cargill or ADM, due to smaller operational scale and less 
      geographic and commodity diversification. Bunge also has experienced 
      challenges with driving sustained growth in operational earnings as 
      EBITDA has vacillated in the $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion range during 
      the past six years. When combined with moderately higher average 
      leverage, these factors result in a three notch ratings differential 
      between Bunge and its peers (ADM and Cargill).
    

      Earnings Pressure Expected to Reverse in 2017
    

      In the first nine months of 2016, EBIT in the Agribusiness segment 
      declined to $533 million from $863 million driven primarily by lower 
      gross profit from grain origination and oilseed processing in South 
      America, weaker soy and canola oilseeds processing in North America and 
      weaker softseeds processing in Europe.
    

      South America weakness has been negatively affected by adverse weather 
      and weakening of the U.S. dollar against key grain growing region 
      currencies. Consequently, South American farmers have been unwilling to 
      sell grains, thus creating limited merchandising and crushing 
      opportunities that will likely extend into 2017. Brazilian farmers have 
      also chosen to defer a higher portion of sales for next year's 
      production that typically occurs in the third quarter of 2016, in hope 
      of higher commodity prices.
    

      Based on the current trajectory, the remaining Food & Ingredients, 
      Fertilizer and Sugar & Bioenergy segments are expected to partially 
      offset the weakness in the agribusiness segment and contribute in 
      aggregate at least $320 million in EBIT in 2016 versus $175 million in 
      2015. As such, Fitch expects Bunge's overall operating income will 
      decline in the low-double digit range in 2016 and that EBITDA will be 
      around $1.7 billion, at the lower end of average EBITDA over the last 
      four years.
    

      However, several factors support an improved earnings outlook in 2017 
      that is underpinned by a favorable long-term outlook for the agriculture 
      industry given higher consumption of protein in developing countries and 
      increasing demand for biofuels. The earnings recovery reflects the 
      expectations that South American farmers will need to commercialize 
      their crops leading to increased capacity utilization particularly in 
      crush, a return to normal pricing patterns in South America, meal demand 
      returns to more normalized levels, benefits flow through from cost 
      initiatives and contributions ramp-up from bolt-on acquisitions. The 
      Food & Ingredients, Fertilizer and Sugar & Bioenergy segments are also 
      expected to realize in aggregate double-digit EBIT growth.
    

      The outlook assumes a commodity price environment should remain low in 
      2017 absent weather dislocations in the southern and northern 
      hemisphere. Processors and ingredient users are thus expected to 
      experience improved margins while farm level margins will remain 
      challenged.
    

      Exposure to Commodity Volatility
    

      Bunge along with other agricultural processors are subject to variations 
      with commodity pricing that can be affected by a range of unpredictable 
      macro environmental conditions that include weather, crop disease 
      outbreaks, and government agricultural policy changes. Thus, Bunge can 
      be exposed to periods of volatile agricultural commodity pricing swings 
      stemming from periodic supply/demand imbalances, timing of cash payments 
      or foreign exchange movements that can negatively affect U.S. exports. 
      Consequently, operating earnings can be pressured and/or debt can 
      increase, which can quickly increase leverage. During the past several 
      years, global grain supplies have been replenished from large harvests 
      of key crops, limiting volatility and resulting in lower prices.
    

      RMI Supports Ratings
    

      Agricultural commodity trading and processing companies maintain 
      substantial grain and oilseed inventories that are hedged and could 
      readily be converted into cash to enhance their liquidity and reduce 
      debt. This high level of liquid readily marketable inventories (RMI), 
      when combined with cash and short-term marketable securities, provides 
      substantial financial flexibility during periods of earnings volatility 
      associated with agricultural cycles, partially mitigating financial 
      risk. Commercial paper, accounts receivable securitizations and bank 
      credit facilities are generally used to finance seasonal working capital 
      needs, primarily related to RMI.
    

      For credit purposes, Fitch calculates RMI adjusted leverage by first 
      subtracting the minimum or base level inventory required to operate a 
      downstream processing facility. This inventory is not generally readily 
      available for liquidation purposes with a going concern entity. An 
      additional 10% discount is taken for the remaining merchandisable 
      inventory (reported RMI less minimum base processing inventory) to 
      account for potential basis risk loss on their hedging positions.
    

      Leverage Expected to Moderate
    

      RMI adjusted leverage (total debt with equity credit less RMI / EBITDA 
      less RMI interest) increased modestly to 1.8x and gross leverage 
      increased to 3.4x for the latest-12-month (LTM) period as of Sept. 30, 
      2016, from 1.7x and 2.9x, respectively in 2015. This was primarily 
      driven by working capital usage due to increases with RMI and softer LTM 
      EBITDA. Bunge's reported RMI increased during the first three quarters 
      of 2016 by approximately $600 million to $4.2 billion. Fitch expects 
      debt levels to further decline from the peak at the end of the first 
      half in 2016 as RMI levels normalize, partially offset by EBITDA 
      pressure resulting in RMI adjusted leverage in the upper 1x range. For 
      2017, Fitch expects RMI leverage should decline modestly to less than 
      1.8x given the recovery in EBITDA and stable debt levels.
    

      KEY ASSUMPTIONS
    

      Key assumptions within Fitch's rating case in 2016 for Bunge include:
    

      --EBITDA declining from 2015 levels to around $1.7 billion;
    

      --Capital spending to remain below historical levels at approximately 
      $850 million;
    

      --Free cash flow (FCF) modestly negative due to increased working 
      capital requirements;
    

      --Modest acquisition activity focused on bolt-on purchases;
    

      --RMI adjusted leverage in the upper 1x range and gross debt leverage in 
      the 3.3x-3.4x range.
    

      In 2017, Fitch's assumptions include:
    

      --EBITDA recovering to around the $1.9 billion range;
    

      --Capital spending of approximately $750 million;
    

      --RMI adjusted leverage of less than 1.8x and gross debt leverage of 
      less than 3x.
    

      Fitch's assumption also includes that commodity prices remain relatively 
      stable over the forecast period.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Future developments that may individually or collectively, lead to a 
      negative rating action:
    

      --RMI adjusted leverage sustained above 2x range driven by EBITDA 
      compression and/or a meaningfully higher debt levels most likely from 
      changing macro environmental conditions or increase in working capital;
    

      --Gross leverage sustained above 3.5x;
    

      --A material increase in leverage from a significant debt financed 
      acquisition, with lack of meaningful deleverage that returns RMI 
      adjusted leverage to below 2x 24 months post transaction;
    

      --Change in financial policy;
    

      --Lack of FCF generation lasting over two years.
    

      Given the inherent earnings volatility within the business, the 
      significant periodic supply/demand imbalances and where Bunge is 
      expected to manage its capital structure, Fitch views a positive rating 
      action as unlikely over the intermediate term.
    

      Future developments that could, individually or collectively, lead to a 
      positive rating action include:
    

      --Materially improved diversification and profitability of the corporate 
      portfolio with increased contribution from the value-added food and 
      ingredients businesses such that Bunge can achieve EBITDA growth over a 
      multiyear period and exhibit more stability over the commodity pricing 
      cycle;
    

      --A commitment to operate RMI adjusted leverage consistently below 1.5x 
      coupled with improved consistency with FCF generation.
    

      LIQUIDITY
    

      Bunge's internal sources of liquidity include $297 million of cash and 
      cash equivalents, $179 million of marketable securities and short-term 
      investments as of the third quarter 2016. FCF can fluctuate from 
      positive to negative from year to year due to numerous factors. For 
      2016, Fitch expects FCF could remain modestly negative.
    

      A key credit concern of commodity processors is access to sufficient 
      liquidity given historically volatile working capital needs. Bunge has 
      abundant sources of external liquidity provided by various credit 
      facilities available to fund its operations globally, with approximately 
      $5 billion in capacity under its revolving bank agreements and 
      commercial paper program, of which $4.6 billion was available at the end 
      of the third quarter of 2016. In addition to the committed credit 
      facilities, Bunge through its financing subsidiaries will from 
      time-to-time enter into bilateral short-term credit lines as necessary. 
      As of Sept. 30, 2016, there were no borrowings outstanding.
    

      The bank commitments at Bunge Limited Finance Corp. (BLFC) are comprised 
      of unsecured bilateral three-year agreements of $200 million maturing in 
      June 2019 and $500 million maturing September 2019 with no borrowings 
      outstanding, a $865 million five-year CoBank revolving credit agreement 
      maturing May 30, 2018 with no borrowing outstandings, and a five-year 
      syndicated unsecured revolver totalling $1.1 billion maturing in 
      November 2019 with no borrowings outstanding. In addition, Bunge has a 
      three-year $1.75 billion revolving credit facility established by Bunge 
      Finance Europe B.V. (BFE) with $377 million in borrowings outstanding. 
      The revolver, which can be expanded by $250 million, matures in August 
      2018 and can be extended by two one-year periods. A $600 million 
      liquidity facility at Bunge Asset Funding Corp. (BAFC) backstops a $600 
      million commercial paper program that had no borrowings outstanding.
    

      Bunge also participates in a receivables securitization program that 
      provides funding up to $700 million. Bunge subsidiaries sell receivables 
      to a bankruptcy remote entity (Bunge Securitization B.V.) that 
      subsequently sells the receivables. Receivables sold under the program 
      (and derecognized on the balance sheet) were $604 million and $524 
      million as of Sept. 30, 2016 and Dec. 31, 2015, respectively.
    

      Bunge has material maturities in the next 12 months including $250 
      million of unsecured notes due in April 2017 and $600 million of 
      unsecured notes due in June 2017. Earlier in 2016, Bunge issued EUR600 
      million and US$700 million of senior notes in the European and U.S 
      public debt markets respectively, which when combined with this EUR200 
      million issuance are expected to be sufficient financings to repay next 
      year's debt maturities and recent bolt-on acquisitions.
    

      Fitch currently rates Bunge and its subsidiaries as follows:
    

      Bunge Limited
    

      --Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'BBB';
    

      --Preference shares 'BB+'.
    

      Bunge Limited Finance Corp. (BLFC)
    

      --Long-Term IDR 'BBB';
    

      --Senior unsecured bank facility 'BBB';
    

      --Senior unsecured notes 'BBB'.
    

      Bunge Finance Europe B.V. (BFE)
    

      --Long-Term IDR 'BBB';
    

      --Senior unsecured bank facility 'BBB';
    

      --Senior unsecured notes 'BBB'.
    

      Bunge N.A. Finance L.P. (BNAF)
    

      --Senior unsecured notes 'BBB'.
    

      The Rating Outlook is Stable.

      Summary of Financial Statement Adjustments - Financial statement 
      adjustments that depart materially from those contained in the published 
      financial statements of the relevant rated entity or obligor are 
      disclosed below:
    

      --Financial statement adjustments for adding back off-balance sheet 
      receivables securitization.
    

      --Fitch grants 50% equity credit to Bunge's 4.875% cumulative 
      convertible preferred shares after considering the junior ranking, the 
      permanence (non-redeemable by the company), the option to defer the 
      dividend and cumulative coupon deferral.
    

      --Reported RMI is reduced by determining the base level of processing 
      RMI required that supports Bunge's processing facilities (approximately 
      $3.2 billion is considered merchandisable as reported for the third 
      quarter 2016) along with a discretionary 10% of the remaining RMI to 
      determine adjusted RMI available for credit purposes.

      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable

      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third-party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk,

      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not

      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or
