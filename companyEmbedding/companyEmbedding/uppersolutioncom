About the companyUpperSolution.com is a shell company. The Company's business is to create an independent and unbiased mobile application that enables consumers to find the cellular rate plan for their need and getting real-time notifications when a new cellular plan is available. It is in the development stage of developing and commercializing a mobile application for existing cellular phone users. Its mobile application, Upper Plan Monitor (UPM), will allow consumers to keep track on new cellular plans from different cellular carriers, locate the closest phone dealer and find the cellular phone plan that fit their needs. UPM will run in the background and automatically check if a new cellular plan is available. In case a new plan is available, it will match approximately three parameters, such as talk, data and text messages, to the users' existing plan. In case the new plan is better or cheaper than the existing plan, a pop-up notification will appear on the user's screen to notify the user.FT Lexicon{0}{0}{2}{0}{0}{2}For more information, visit the FT LexiconLexicon on this pageExplore our toolsAlertsData archivePortfolioWorld marketsEquities screenerFunds overview

* Offering Expenses $0.0042/share

Our management will have broad discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds
of any offering. Pending such uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds in
short-term, investment grade, interest-bearing securities. The Company could
operate even with no proceeds from this offering but that the marketing and
advertising efforts would be greatly diminished thus greatly slowing the growth
of the Company.


Competition within the mobile app industry is intense. We believe there is no
one app on the market that allows existing cellular phone users to get
notifications when a better cellular plan is available according to their
individual choices. Although we couldn’t find iPhone app that do that, there are
many websites that offer similar service of cellular phone plan comparison.

Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater financial,
sales, marketing and technological resources and longer established client
relationships than we do. However, we believe that UPM all-in-one bundle and
relatively low price point of $1.99 (flat rate) will differentiate us from the
competitors listed below:

Whistle Out (www.whistleout.com) -


Company Description
UpperSolution.com was formed on April 20, 2013. 

Our business will be to create an independent and unbiased mobile app that 
enables consumers to find the best cellular rate plan for their need and 
getting real-time notifications when a new cellular plan is available. We 
intend to use the net


 proceeds from this offering to develop our business 
operations. From inception until the date of this filing we have had limited 
operating activities, we have incorporated our company and paid the state 
fees, we have prepared a business plan, we have only obtained our website 
url (uppersolution.com) along the logo for our brand, we have made high-level 
decisions about the features and design of our proposed app. Our plan of 
operations needs to be executed in order to fully develop our business and 
begin generating revenue, a number of steps have to be accomplished within 
the plan. 

The Company’s revenues are expected to be derived primarily from sales of the
Company’s apps. We do not anticipate earning revenues until we have successfully
launched our mobile app. Since we are presently in the development stage of our
business, we can provide no assurance that we will successfully prepare and
produce our mobile app.

We are in the development stage of developing and commercializing a mobile app
for existing cellular phone users. Our goal is to help consumers to save money
each month by notifying them when a more cost-effective plan based on their
actual usage is available.

Our mobile app, to be named “Upper Plan Monitor (“UPM”)”, will help consumers to
keep track on new cellular plans from different cellular carriers, locate the
closest phone dealer in their area, find the best cellular phone plan that fit
their needs.
