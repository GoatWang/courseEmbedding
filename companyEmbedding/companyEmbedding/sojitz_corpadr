Sojitz Corporation (Japanese: 双日株式会社, Hepburn: Sōjitsu Kabushiki-gaisha) is a sogo shosha (general trading company) based in Tokyo, Japan. It is engaged in a wide range of businesses globally, including buying, selling, importing, and exporting goods, manufacturing and selling products, providing services, and planning and coordinating projects, in Japan and overseas. Sojitz also invests in various sectors and conducts financing activities. The broad range of sectors in which Sojitz operates includes automobiles, energy, mineral resources, chemicals, foodstuff resources, agricultural and forestry resources, consumer goods, and industrial parks.
Sojitz was formed in 2004 by the merger of Nissho Iwai Corporation (日商岩井株式会社, Nisshō Iwai Kabushiki-gaisha) and Nichimen Corporation (ニチメン株式会社, Nichimen Kabushiki-gaisha).[1] The name "Sojitz" is derived from the names of Nissho Iwai and Nichimen, both of which include the character "日" (sun). "Sojitz", literally meaning "twin suns", implies a merger of equals between the two companies. The corporate logo is a stylized version of the first character in its Japanese name.[2]

History[edit]
Nichimen[edit]
Beginning around 1878, the Japanese government promoted the development of cotton spinning as an initial means of developing modern industry in Japan in the wake of the Meiji Restoration. Japan's native raw cotton supply proved inadequate to meet demand, and there was only one Japanese importer of raw cotton at the time, making the industry highly reliant on foreign merchants. To improve this situation, a group of spinning companies established Japan Cotton Trading Co., Ltd. (日本綿花株式会社, Nippon Menka Kabushiki Kaisha) in Osaka in 1892 under the leadership of Tsuneki Sano, a 38-year-old former government official.[3]
After the Russo-Japanese War, Nichimen expanded its business from importing. The company began cotton spinning operations in Manchuria and established offices in China, Korea, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom to supply local markets. In 1910, Nichimen opened a subsidiary in Fort Worth, Texas to enter the raw cotton trade in the United States. World War I strained cotton supply in Europe, boosting Nichimen's international business further. In the late 1910s the company expanded into South America and Africa, trading in cotton as well as wool, food products, and machinery.[4]
The Great Depression harmed Nichimen's cotton business, spurring the company's diversification beyond cotton to trade in silk, rayon and other materials. During World War II, Nichimen was tapped by the Japanese military to manage production of flour, matches and starch. The company changed its name to Nichimen Enterprise (Nichimen Jitsugyo) in 1943 to reflect its more diverse business.[4]
The largest zaibatsu trading companies were dismantled after the war, giving Nichimen an early lead among the sogo shosha in the 1950s and a six percent share of Japanese foreign trade by 1958. Nichimen became closely affiliated with Osaka-based Sanwa Bank in 1955, which financed all of Nichimen's domestic business. Nichimen was not the main trading company for the Sanwa keiretsu as that position was already held by Iwai & Co. Nichimen Jitsugyo renamed itself Nichimen Co., Ltd. in 1957.[4]
By 1970, Nichimen was trading in steel, electronics, motor vehicles and fibers in addition to textiles. Nichimen served as the joint venture partner for Nabisco when it began operations in Japan in the 1970s. Nichimen Co., Ltd. changed its name to Nichimen Corporation in 1982. Nichimen, like other sogo shosha, was hit hard by the collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble in the early 1990s, and subsequently made a strategic shift from the "soft" businesses of lumber, food, and chemicals trading to the "hard" businesses of machinery, steel, and construction.[4]
Nissho Iwai[edit]
Nissho Iwai was formed in 1968 by the merger of Nissho Company and Iwai Sangyo Company.[5]
Nissho Company was founded in Kobe in 1902 as Suzuki & Company under the leadership of Iwajiro Suzuki and Naokichi Kaneko. Suzuki was originally a sugar trading firm but later diversified into flour, steel, tobacco, beer, insurance, shipping and shipbuilding; it became the second Japanese member of the Baltic Exchange in London. Iwai & Company was founded as a steel trading firm in 1901 and established a number of prominent group enterprises including Daicel, Nisshin Steel, Tokuyama Soda, Kansai Paint and Fuji Photo Film. It changed its name to Iwai Sangyo Company in 1943.[5]
Both Nissho and Iwai emerged as metals and machinery trading companies after World War II but were significantly smaller than the four largest sogo shosha competitors (Mitsubishi Corporation, Mitsui & Co., Itochu and Marubeni). Iwai was poorly managed after the war and was on the brink of failure in the early 1960s, while Nissho was profitable and successfully expanding overseas. The Japanese government directed the merger of the two companies in 1968, forming the fifth largest trading company in Japan (falling back to sixth place in 1972 behind Sumitomo Corporation).[6] Sanwa Bank played a role in the merger and the combined firm became the trading arm of the Sanwa Group keiretsu.[7]
Nissho Iwai was involved in a corruption scandal in 1979 after it passed on a 500 million yen bribe from McDonnell Douglas to the director general of the Japan Defense Agency in an attempt to influence the sale of F-4 Phantom aircraft to the Japan Air Self-Defense Force. In the wake of the scandal, one Nissho Iwai executive committed suicide by jumping from the company's headquarters building. The scandal was uncovered only three years after a similar scandal involving Lockheed and Marubeni conspiring to bribe Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka.[8]
In subsequent years, the company had a strong focus on liquefied natural gas and steel trading, as well as industrial project development.[6]
Merger[edit]
Nichimen and Nissho Iwai consolidated on a holding company level in 2003 and consolidated their operating units in 2004, adopting the Sojitz name at that time. The merged holding company, Sojitz Holdings, combined with the merged operating company, Sojitz Corporation, in 2005.[1]
Current operations[edit]




The current headquarters of Sojitz Corporation, Iino Building in Kasumigaseki, Chiyoda, Tokyo.


Today, the Sojitz Group consists of approximately 440 subsidiaries and affiliates located in Japan and throughout the world, and it is developing its wide-ranging general trading company operations in roughly 50 countries and regions across the globe.
Sojitz (through its subsidiary Sojitz Aerospace Company) is the largest seller of commercial aircraft in Japan, as it acts as a sales agent for both Boeing and Bombardier Aerospace. It distributes Mitsubishi Motors and Hyundai Motors automobiles in various countries, and also develops and operates power plants, industrial plants in various countries. In 2013 it received an order to develop a freight rail corridor between Delhi and Mumbai in India.[9] The Sojitz Aerospace Company also acts as Sojitz's primary arm for defense related business.
Sojitz owns oil and natural gas concessions in the North Sea, Gulf of Mexico, Qatar, Gabon, Egypt and Brazil. It owns most of the Minerva Coal Mine in Australia and distributes nuclear fuel in Japan for Areva.[10]
Its operations in the chemicals sector include methanol production in Indonesia, barite mining in Mexico and industrial salt trading in various markets worldwide.[11] In November 2010, it signed an agreement with the Australian rare earths mining company Lynas to import $350 million worth of rare earth minerals from Linas's mine in Mount Weld, Australia.[12]
Its consumer business operations include trading in grains, feed, sugar, coffee, fish, wood and paper. It owns the Japanese rights to several consumer brands such as Eastpak and McGregor.[13]
ADV Films partnership[edit]
In June 2006, Sojitz entered into a partnership with American anime distributor ADV Films. This was done as a means of acquiring more titles in the Japanese market.[14] From this point on, virtually all titles that ADV acquired were with Sojitz's help. However, in January 2008, ADV mysteriously removed a large number of titles from their website.[15] All the titles removed were titles acquired since the Sojitz collaboration including Gurren Lagann, which had test disks sent out with dubbed episodes. As of May 2008, Gurren Lagann was licensed by Bandai Entertainment. ADV Films made booth appearances at the Anime Central 2008 convention, but they canceled their planned panel.[16] In July 2008, Funimation announced the acquisition of thirty of these titles.[17]
The titles removed from ADV's website are as follows: 009-1, 5 Centimeters per Second, Ah! My Goddess: Flights of Fancy, both the film and television adaptions of the Key visual novel Air, Best Student Council, Blade of the Phantom Master, Comic Party Revolution, Coyote Ragtime Show, Devil May Cry, the 2006 live-action horror film Ghost Train, Guyver: The Bioboosted Armor, Innocent Venus, Jing King of Bandits: 7th Heaven, Jinki: Extend, the 2006 anime remake of yet another Key visual novel, Kanon, Kurau: Phantom Memory, Le Chevalier D'Eon, Magikano, Moeyo Ken, Moonlight Mile, Nerima Daikon Brothers, Pani Poni Dash!, Project Blue Earth SOS, Pumpkin Scissors, Red Garden, Tokyo Majin, UFO Princess Valkyrie, the first anime of Utawarerumono, Venus vs. Virus, The Wallflower, Welcome to the NHK and Xenosaga.

Japan's native raw cotton supply proved inadequate to meet demand, and there was only one Japanese importer of raw cotton at the time, making the industry highly reliant on foreign merchants.

After the Russo-Japanese War, Nichimen expanded its business from importing. The company began cotton spinning operations in Manchuria and established offices in China, Korea, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom to supply local markets. In 1910, Nichimen opened a subsidiary in Fort Worth, Texas to enter the raw cotton trade in the United States. World War I strained cotton supply in Europe, boosting Nichimen's international business further.

Nissho Iwai[edit]
Nissho Iwai was formed in 1968 by the merger of Nissho Company and Iwai Sangyo Company.[5]
Nissho Company was founded in Kobe in 1902 as Suzuki & Company under the leadership of Iwajiro Suzuki and Naokichi Kaneko. Suzuki was originally a sugar trading firm but later diversified into flour, steel, tobacco, beer, insurance, shipping and shipbuilding; it became the second Japanese member of the Baltic Exchange in London. Iwai & Company was founded as a steel trading firm in 1901 and established a number of prominent group enterprises including Daicel, Nisshin Steel, Tokuyama Soda, Kansai Paint and Fuji Photo Film. It changed its name to Iwai Sangyo Company in 1943.[5]
Both Nissho and Iwai emerged as metals and machinery trading companies after World War II but were significantly smaller than the four largest sogo shosha competitors (Mitsubishi Corporation, Mitsui & Co., Itochu and Marubeni).

Sojitz Corporation (Japanese: 双日株式会社, Hepburn: Sōjitsu Kabushiki-gaisha) is a sogo shosha (general trading company) based in Tokyo, Japan. It is engaged in a wide range of businesses globally, including buying, selling, importing, and exporting goods, manufacturing and selling products, providing services, and planning and coordinating projects, in Japan and overseas. Sojitz also invests in various sectors and conducts financing activities. The broad range of sectors in which Sojitz operates includes automobiles, energy, mineral resources, chemicals, foodstuff resources, agricultural and forestry resources, consumer goods, and industrial parks.
Sojitz was formed in 2004 by the merger of Nissho Iwai Corporation (日商岩井株式会社, Nisshō Iwai Kabushiki-gaisha) and Nichimen Corporation (ニチメン株式会社, Nichimen Kabushiki-gaisha).[1] The name "Sojitz" is derived from the names of Nissho Iwai and Nichimen, both of which include the character "日" (sun). "Sojitz", literally meaning "twin suns", implies a merger of equals between the two companies. The corporate logo is a stylized version of the first character in its Japanese name.[2]

History[edit]
Nichimen[edit]
Beginning around 1878, the Japanese government promoted the development of cotton spinning as an initial means of developing modern industry in Japan in the wake of the Meiji Restoration. Japan's native raw cotton supply proved inadequate to meet demand, and there was only one Japanese importer of raw cotton at the time, making the industry highly reliant on foreign merchants. To improve this situation, a group of spinning companies established Japan Cotton Trading Co., Ltd. (日本綿花株式会社, Nippon Menka Kabushiki Kaisha) in Osaka in 1892 under the leadership of Tsuneki Sano, a 38-year-old former government official.[3]
After the Russo-Japanese War, Nichimen expanded its business from importing. The company began cotton spinning operations in Manchuria and established offices in China, Korea, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom to supply local markets. In 1910, Nichimen opened a subsidiary in Fort Worth, Texas to enter the raw cotton trade in the United States. World War I strained cotton supply in Europe, boosting Nichimen's international business further. In the late 1910s the company expanded into South America and Africa, trading in cotton as well as wool, food products, and machinery.[4]
The Great Depression harmed Nichimen's cotton business, spurring the company's diversification beyond cotton to trade in silk, rayon and other materials. During World War II, Nichimen was tapped by the Japanese military to manage production of flour, matches and starch. The company changed its name to Nichimen Enterprise (Nichimen Jitsugyo) in 1943 to reflect its more diverse business.[4]
The largest zaibatsu trading companies were dismantled after the war, giving Nichimen an early lead among the sogo shosha in the 1950s and a six percent share of Japanese foreign trade by 1958. Nichimen became closely affiliated with Osaka-based Sanwa Bank in 1955, which financed all of Nichimen's domestic business. Nichimen was not the main trading company for the Sanwa keiretsu as that position was already held by Iwai & Co. Nichimen Jitsugyo renamed itself Nichimen Co., Ltd. in 1957.[4]
By 1970, Nichimen was trading in steel, electronics, motor vehicles and fibers in addition to textiles. Nichimen served as the joint venture partner for Nabisco when it began operations in Japan in the 1970s. Nichimen Co., Ltd. changed its name to Nichimen Corporation in 1982. Nichimen, like other sogo shosha, was hit hard by the collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble in the early 1990s, and subsequently made a strategic shift from the "soft" businesses of lumber, food, and chemicals trading to the "hard" businesses of machinery, steel, and construction.[4]
Nissho Iwai[edit]
Nissho Iwai was formed in 1968 by the merger of Nissho Company and Iwai Sangyo Company.[5]
Nissho Company was founded in Kobe in 1902 as Suzuki & Company under the leadership of Iwajiro Suzuki and Naokichi Kaneko. Suzuki was originally a sugar trading firm but later diversified into flour, steel, tobacco, beer, insurance, shipping and shipbuilding; it became the second Japanese member of the Baltic Exchange in London. Iwai & Company was founded as a steel trading firm in 1901 and established a number of prominent group enterprises including Daicel, Nisshin Steel, Tokuyama Soda, Kansai Paint and Fuji Photo Film. It changed its name to Iwai Sangyo Company in 1943.[5]
Both Nissho and Iwai emerged as metals and machinery trading companies after World War II but were significantly smaller than the four largest sogo shosha competitors (Mitsubishi Corporation, Mitsui & Co., Itochu and Marubeni). Iwai was poorly managed after the war and was on the brink of failure in the early 1960s, while Nissho was profitable and successfully expanding overseas. The Japanese government directed the merger of the two companies in 1968, forming the fifth largest trading company in Japan (falling back to sixth place in 1972 behind Sumitomo Corporation).[6] Sanwa Bank played a role in the merger and the combined firm became the trading arm of the Sanwa Group keiretsu.[7]
Nissho Iwai was involved in a corruption scandal in 1979 after it passed on a 500 million yen bribe from McDonnell Douglas to the director general of the Japan Defense Agency in an attempt to influence the sale of F-4 Phantom aircraft to the Japan Air Self-Defense Force. In the wake of the scandal, one Nissho Iwai executive committed suicide by jumping from the company's headquarters building. The scandal was uncovered only three years after a similar scandal involving Lockheed and Marubeni conspiring to bribe Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka.[8]
In subsequent years, the company had a strong focus on liquefied natural gas and steel trading, as well as industrial project development.[6]
Merger[edit]
Nichimen and Nissho Iwai consolidated on a holding company level in 2003 and consolidated their operating units in 2004, adopting the Sojitz name at that time. The merged holding company, Sojitz Holdings, combined with the merged operating company, Sojitz Corporation, in 2005.[1]
Current operations[edit]




The current headquarters of Sojitz Corporation, Iino Building in Kasumigaseki, Chiyoda, Tokyo.


Today, the Sojitz Group consists of approximately 440 subsidiaries and affiliates located in Japan and throughout the world, and it is developing its wide-ranging general trading company operations in roughly 50 countries and regions across the globe.
Sojitz (through its subsidiary Sojitz Aerospace Company) is the largest seller of commercial aircraft in Japan, as it acts as a sales agent for both Boeing and Bombardier Aerospace. It distributes Mitsubishi Motors and Hyundai Motors automobiles in various countries, and also develops and operates power plants, industrial plants in various countries. In 2013 it received an order to develop a freight rail corridor between Delhi and Mumbai in India.[9] The Sojitz Aerospace Company also acts as Sojitz's primary arm for defense related business.
Sojitz owns oil and natural gas concessions in the North Sea, Gulf of Mexico, Qatar, Gabon, Egypt and Brazil. It owns most of the Minerva Coal Mine in Australia and distributes nuclear fuel in Japan for Areva.[10]
Its operations in the chemicals sector include methanol production in Indonesia, barite mining in Mexico and industrial salt trading in various markets worldwide.[11] In November 2010, it signed an agreement with the Australian rare earths mining company Lynas to import $350 million worth of rare earth minerals from Linas's mine in Mount Weld, Australia.[12]
Its consumer business operations include trading in grains, feed, sugar, coffee, fish, wood and paper. It owns the Japanese rights to several consumer brands such as Eastpak and McGregor.[13]
ADV Films partnership[edit]
In June 2006, Sojitz entered into a partnership with American anime distributor ADV Films. This was done as a means of acquiring more titles in the Japanese market.[14] From this point on, virtually all titles that ADV acquired were with Sojitz's help. However, in January 2008, ADV mysteriously removed a large number of titles from their website.[15] All the titles removed were titles acquired since the Sojitz collaboration including Gurren Lagann, which had test disks sent out with dubbed episodes. As of May 2008, Gurren Lagann was licensed by Bandai Entertainment. ADV Films made booth appearances at the Anime Central 2008 convention, but they canceled their planned panel.[16] In July 2008, Funimation announced the acquisition of thirty of these titles.[17]
The titles removed from ADV's website are as follows: 009-1, 5 Centimeters per Second, Ah! My Goddess: Flights of Fancy, both the film and television adaptions of the Key visual novel Air, Best Student Council, Blade of the Phantom Master, Comic Party Revolution, Coyote Ragtime Show, Devil May Cry, the 2006 live-action horror film Ghost Train, Guyver: The Bioboosted Armor, Innocent Venus, Jing King of Bandits: 7th Heaven, Jinki: Extend, the 2006 anime remake of yet another Key visual novel, Kanon, Kurau: Phantom Memory, Le Chevalier D'Eon, Magikano, Moeyo Ken, Moonlight Mile, Nerima Daikon Brothers, Pani Poni Dash!, Project Blue Earth SOS, Pumpkin Scissors, Red Garden, Tokyo Majin, UFO Princess Valkyrie, the first anime of Utawarerumono, Venus vs. Virus, The Wallflower, Welcome to the NHK and Xenosaga.

In 1910, Nichimen opened a subsidiary in Fort Worth, Texas to enter the raw cotton trade in the United States. World War I strained cotton supply in Europe, boosting Nichimen's international business further.

Nissho Iwai was formed in 1968 by the merger of Nissho Company and Iwai Sangyo Company.[5]
Nissho Company was founded in Kobe in 1902 as Suzuki & Company under the leadership of Iwajiro Suzuki and Naokichi Kaneko. Suzuki was originally a sugar trading firm but later diversified into flour, steel, tobacco, beer, insurance, shipping and shipbuilding; it became the second Japanese member of the Baltic Exchange in London. Iwai & Company was founded as a steel trading firm in 1901 and established a number of prominent group enterprises including Daicel, Nisshin Steel, Tokuyama Soda, Kansai Paint and Fuji Photo Film. It changed its name to Iwai Sangyo Company in 1943.[5]
Both Nissho and Iwai emerged as metals and machinery trading companies after World War II but were significantly smaller than the four largest sogo shosha competitors (Mitsubishi Corporation, Mitsui & Co., Itochu and Marubeni). Iwai was poorly managed after the war and was on the brink of failure in the early 1960s, while Nissho was profitable and successfully expanding overseas. The Japanese government directed the merger of the two companies in 1968, forming the fifth largest trading company in Japan (falling back to sixth place in 1972 behind Sumitomo Corporation).[6] Sanwa Bank played a role in the merger and the combined firm became the trading arm of the Sanwa Group keiretsu.[7]
Nissho Iwai was involved in a corruption scandal in 1979 after it passed on a 500 million yen bribe from McDonnell Douglas to the director general of the Japan Defense Agency in an attempt to influence the sale of F-4 Phantom aircraft to the Japan Air Self-Defense Force. In the wake of the scandal, one Nissho Iwai executive committed suicide by jumping from the company's headquarters building. The scandal was uncovered only three years after a similar scandal involving Lockheed and Marubeni conspiring to bribe Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka.[8]
In subsequent years, the company had a strong focus on liquefied natural gas and steel trading, as well as industrial project development.[6]
Merger[edit]
Nichimen and Nissho Iwai consolidated on a holding company level in 2003 and consolidated their operating units in 2004, adopting the Sojitz name at that time. The merged holding company, Sojitz Holdings, combined with the merged operating company, Sojitz Corporation, in 2005.[1]
Current operations[edit]




The current headquarters of Sojitz Corporation, Iino Building in Kasumigaseki, Chiyoda, Tokyo.


Today, the Sojitz Group consists of approximately 440 subsidiaries and affiliates located in Japan and throughout the world, and it is developing its wide-ranging general trading company operations in roughly 50 countries and regions across the globe.
Sojitz (through its subsidiary Sojitz Aerospace Company) is the largest seller of commercial aircraft in Japan, as it acts as a sales agent for both Boeing and Bombardier Aerospace. It distributes Mitsubishi Motors and Hyundai Motors automobiles in various countries, and also develops and operates power plants, industrial plants in various countries. In 2013 it received an order to develop a freight rail corridor between Delhi and Mumbai in India.[9] The Sojitz Aerospace Company also acts as Sojitz's primary arm for defense related business.
Sojitz owns oil and natural gas concessions in the North Sea, Gulf of Mexico, Qatar, Gabon, Egypt and Brazil. It owns most of the Minerva Coal Mine in Australia and distributes nuclear fuel in Japan for Areva.[10]
Its operations in the chemicals sector include methanol production in Indonesia, barite mining in Mexico and industrial salt trading in various markets worldwide.[11] In November 2010, it signed an agreement with the Australian rare earths mining company Lynas to import $350 million worth of rare earth minerals from Linas's mine in Mount Weld, Australia.[12]
Its consumer business operations include trading in grains, feed, sugar, coffee, fish, wood and paper. It owns the Japanese rights to several consumer brands such as Eastpak and McGregor.[13]
ADV Films partnership[edit]
In June 2006, Sojitz entered into a partnership with American anime distributor ADV Films. This was done as a means of acquiring more titles in the Japanese market.[14] From this point on, virtually all titles that ADV acquired were with Sojitz's help. However, in January 2008, ADV mysteriously removed a large number of titles from their website.[15] All the titles removed were titles acquired since the Sojitz collaboration including Gurren Lagann, which had test disks sent out with dubbed episodes. As of May 2008, Gurren Lagann was licensed by Bandai Entertainment. ADV Films made booth appearances at the Anime Central 2008 convention, but they canceled their planned panel.[16] In July 2008, Funimation announced the acquisition of thirty of these titles.[17]
The titles removed from ADV's website are as follows: 009-1, 5 Centimeters per Second, Ah! My Goddess: Flights of Fancy, both the film and television adaptions of the Key visual novel Air, Best Student Council, Blade of the Phantom Master, Comic Party Revolution, Coyote Ragtime Show, Devil May Cry, the 2006 live-action horror film Ghost Train, Guyver: The Bioboosted Armor, Innocent Venus, Jing King of Bandits: 7th Heaven, Jinki: Extend, the 2006 anime remake of yet another Key visual novel, Kanon, Kurau: Phantom Memory, Le Chevalier D'Eon, Magikano, Moeyo Ken, Moonlight Mile, Nerima Daikon Brothers, Pani Poni Dash!, Project Blue Earth SOS, Pumpkin Scissors, Red Garden, Tokyo Majin, UFO Princess Valkyrie, the first anime of Utawarerumono, Venus vs. Virus, The Wallflower, Welcome to the NHK and Xenosaga.

History  










































 













 





History
(In Japan) 
1868: Meiji Restoration in Japan. After over 250 years of isolation during the Edo period, Japan opened its borders and industrialized during the Meiji era. In the rapid change taking place at the end of the 1800s, Naokichi Kaneko (below, left) and Katsujiro Iwai (below, right), were instrumental in growing the companies that would eventually become Sojitz.
The history section of the Sojitz Corporation website includes a video summary of the last 150 years and a link to the extensive online archives of The Sojitz History Museum.

Enforcement Report For Q2 '10

By   Richard L. Cassin |   Thursday, July 1, 2010 at 7:28AM 

The first quarter of 2010   was the busiest  ever for FCPA-related enforcement. This past quarter was one of the quietest for new enforcement actions, with just one from the DOJ and three  from the SEC.
There were some sentencings -- including the longest prison term  ever for an FCPA-related offense -- a few sentencing delays, a guilty plea, and some odds and ends.  But  during most of the quarter the  DOJ was MIA and the SEC barely popped its head out.
Here's what happened:
DOJ / SEC Enforcement Actions

Bobby  J. Elkin, Jr., Baxter J. Myers, Thomas G. Reynolds, and Tommy L.  Williams (April 29) The SEC brought a civil enforcement action  against the former employees of Dimon, Inc., now Alliance One  International, Inc. Defendants Myers and Reynolds agreed to pay civil  penalties of $40,000 each. All four defendants also consented to the  entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the  anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA (Section 30A of the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934) and aiding and abetting violations of Sections  13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B).
Technip S.A. (June 28) The Paris-based engineering and construction firm resolved FCPA-related charges resulting from bribes to Nigerian officials through the KBR-related TSKJ joint venture. It agreed to pay  the DOJ  a $240 million criminal penalty. It also settled a civil complaint filed by the SEC by disgorging  $98 million in  profits. It  was charged in a two-count criminal information with one count of conspiracy and one count of violating the FCPA. Its  two-year deferred prosecution agreement with the DOJ requires Technip to retain an independent compliance monitor and cooperate in ongoing investigations.
Veraz Networks, Inc. (June 29) paid $300,000 to settle charges brought by the SEC that it violated the books and records and internal controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by making illegal payments to foreign officials in China and Vietnam.

Sentenced

Charles Paul Edward Jumet (April 19), 53, was sentenced  to 87 months in prison and fined $15,000. Prosecutors  said it's the longest sentence ever in an FCPA-related case. He pleaded guilty in November 2009 to being part of a decade-long  bribery  conspiracy in Panama. A  two-count criminal information charged him with   conspiring  to violate the FCPA and giving a false statement to the FBI  about how he paid some of the bribe money.
Robert  Antoine (June 2), 62, of Miami and Haiti, a former employee of  Haiti’s state-owned national telecommunications  company, was sentenced   to 48 months in prison for being part of  a bribery and  money-laundering scheme. He  pleaded guilty in March this year to  conspiracy to commit money laundering. He was also ordered by a  federal judge in Miami to pay $1,852,209 in restitution and to forfeit  $1,580,771, and serve three years of supervised release following his  prison term.
John  Webster Warwick (June 25), 64,  was sentenced  to 37 months in  prison for his role in a conspiracy to pay bribes to former Panamanian  government officials to secure maritime contracts. He also received two  years of supervised release following his prison term and forfeited  $331,000 in proceeds of the crime. The DOJ did not explain why his  sentence was five years shorter than his co-defendant, Charles Jumet  (see above).

Guilty Plea

Ousama  M. Naaman (June 25), 61, a dual citizen of Canada and Lebanon,  pleaded  guilty  to conspiracy and to violating the Foreign  Corrupt Practices Act. Innospec's former agent in Iraq  was charged in a  June 24, 2010 superseding information with engaging in an eight-year  conspiracy to defraud the United Nations oil-for-food program and  bribing Iraqi officials. No sentencing date was set.

Extradition

Wojciech  Chodan (April 21), 71, a U.K.  citizen, was ordered extradited from Britain to the U.S. by a London court. He was  indicted in February 2009 by a federal grand jury in Houston for helping  KBR and its partners bribe Nigerian officials. His fellow countryman Jeffery  Tesler, a London lawyer indicted at the same time, also lost  his extradition hearing in March this year. With appeals, their extraditions  may not be final for at least a year.

Sentencing Delays

Gerald  and Patricia Green (April 29 and June 7) Their sentencing  was delayed and then  removed from the court's  calendar. The judge in Los Angeles federal court is examining evidence about Mr. Green's medical  condition and sentences in similar cases.
Albert  "Jack" Stanley (mid June), 66, had final sentencing delayed  until at least September 23, 2010. The former chairman and CEO of KBR pleaded  guilty in September 2008 to a two-count criminal information charging  him with conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and to  commit mail and wire fraud. He's free on unsecured bail of $100,000  pending final sentencing, which has been rescheduled a half dozen times. He  was sentenced to 84 months in prison and a restitution payment of $10.8  million. The jail term is subject to review based on his cooperation  with the government in related prosecutions (see Chodan and Tesler  above).

Intervention

Sojitz (May 27) The DOJ  intervened in the second  civil suit brought  by Aluminium Bahrain BSC -- known as Alba -- against a raw material  supplier and broker. It asked for a stay in Alba's suit against  Japanese trading company Sojitz Corp. More than  two years ago, the Justice Department obtained a stay in Alba's civil  suit against Alcoa,  Inc. The DOJ said discovery in the cases could interfere with  the government's own investigation into potential criminal wrongdoing including possible violations of the  Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by  Alcoa, Sojitz and other parties.

New Charging Document

Shot-show prosecution (April 19) The government  filed a superseding indictment in the prosecution of the 22 shot-show defendants, charging them under a consolidated grand jury indictment with 44 counts, including conspiracy to violate the FCPA, substantive FCPA offenses, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and aiding and abetting.

In the Pipeline

Panalpina (April 29) The Swiss logistics giant said it expects settlement "in the near future"  with the DOJ and SEC of FCPA-related charges. The case  dates back to at least early February 2007. The DOJ noted then in connection with Vetco's FCPA settlement that bribes in Nigeria "were paid through a major international freight forwarding and customs clearance company to employees of the Nigerian Customs Service . . .”

Civil Suit  Private parties have no   right of action under the FCPA. Only the DOJ  and SEC   can  enforce it. Plaintiffs bring FCPA-related claims under RICO (18   U.S.C. § 1962(c)), conspiracy to violate RICO (18 U.S.C. § 1962(d)),   fraud,  civil conspiracy, breach of fiduciary duties, and others.

Parker Drilling's directors (early June) were sued in a derivative action in Harris County, Texas after the company's detailed disclosure  about a DOJ / SEC investigation of  compliance problems in Nigeria and Kazakhstan.

Feds Seek Sojitz Stay

By   Richard L. Cassin |   Tuesday, June 1, 2010 at 7:18AM 

The Justice Department has intervened for the second time   in  civil suits brought by Aluminium Bahrain BSC -- known as Alba -- against its raw material suppliers and brokers. Last week, the DOJ asked for a stay in Alba's suit against Japanese trading company Sojitz Corp. and its U.S. subsidiary. More than two years ago,  the Justice Department obtained a stay in Alba's civil suit against Alcoa, Inc. The DOJ said discovery in the cases could interfere with the government's own investigation into potential criminal wrongdoing by Alcoa, Sojitz and other parties, including possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
Alba sued Sojitz in  December 2009, filing  a $31 million claim in federal court in Houston.  The suit alleged that from 1993 to 2006, Sojitz paid $14.8 million in  bribes to two of Alba's employees in exchange for access to metals at  below-market prices. Alba is majority-owned by the government of  Bahrain.
In March 2008, Alba sued  Alcoa Inc., its long-time raw materials supplier, for  corruption and fraud. The suit in federal court in Pittsburg alleged  that Alba paid $2 billion in overcharges during a 15-year period. The  money, according to the suit, first went to overseas accounts controlled  by Alcoa's agent, London-based Victor Dahdaleh, and some was then used to bribe Alba's executives in  return for  supply contracts.
Just  weeks after Alba sued Alcoa, the  Justice Department   intervened in the case. It asked the  court for a stay while the  government investigates possible criminal violations of the FCPA and  other  laws by Alcoa and its executives and agent. The DOJ said the stay  was needed to protect potential witnesses against civil discovery. The court granted the stay, which is still in effect. The DOJ hasn't commented on  the status of its criminal investigation. Alcoa  denied  wrongdoing and  said it is cooperating. Sources with knowledge of  the government's investigation  have reported  to the FCPA Blog that the Justice Department had questions  about  Alcoa's  initial explanations, which may have delayed potential  settlement talks.
Alba did  not oppose the DOJ's requests for stays in the Alcoa and Sojitz cases.
There's no   private right of action under the Foreign Corrupt  Practices  Act. So Alba's claims against Alcoa and Sojitz were based on other federal laws, including RICO (18  U.S.C. §  1962(c)), conspiracy to violate RICO (18 U.S.C. § 1962(d)),  fraud, and  civil conspiracy to defraud. The complaint against   Sojitz alleged the Japanese company used  bribes to buy underpriced product and then "resold the  aluminum it  bought from Alba at below-market rates to U.S. companies  including  Enron Corp." Alcoa's conspiracy, Alba said in the  civil complaint, "succeeded in exacting hundreds of millions of dollars in over payments, which continue to accumulate to this day. Among other things, Plaintiff seeks damages in excess of $1 billion, including punitive damages, for this massive, outrageous fraud."
Sojitz Corp. consists of 522 companies including 147 subsidiaries and affiliates in Japan and 375 overseas. Together they have  17,331 employees. The parent company's ADRs  trade in the over-the-counter pink sheets under the symbol SZHFF.PK.

Bribery Allegations Against Sojitz

By   Richard L. Cassin |   Sunday, December 20, 2009 at 6:08PM 

Aluminium Bahrain BSC -- known as Alba -- has filed a $31 million civil suit in federal court in Houston against  Japanese trading company Sojitz Corp. and its U.S. subsidiary, Sojitz Corporation of America. The suit alleges that from 1993 to 2006, Sojitz paid $14.8 million in bribes to two of Alba's employees in exchange for access to metals at below-market prices. Alba is majority-owned by the government of Bahrain.
There's no private right of action under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. So Alba's claims against Sojitz are based on RICO (18 U.S.C. § 1962(c)), conspiracy to violate RICO (18 U.S.C. § 1962(d)), fraud, and civil conspiracy to defraud. The complaint alleges that Sojitz used bribes to buy underpriced product and then "resold the aluminum it bought from Alba at below-market rates to U.S. companies including Enron Corp."
In September, the Wall Street Journal reported  the U.S. Justice Department's investigation into "payments that Bahraini prosecutors allege were made by units of Japanese commodities-trading giant Sojitz Group to employees of an aluminum producer in Bahrain." The DOJ has never  commented on the story. See our post here.
This is the second civil action Alba has filed in U.S. courts  with allegations about potential FCPA violations. In March 2008, Alba sued Alcoa Inc., its long-time raw materials supplier, for corruption and fraud. The suit in federal court in Pittsburg alleged that Alba paid $2 billion in overcharges during a 15-year period. The money, according to the suit, first went to overseas accounts controlled by Alcoa's agent and some was then used to bribe Alba's executives in return for  supply contracts.
Just  weeks after Alba sued Alcoa, the  Justice Department  intervened in the case. It asked the  court for a stay while the government investigates possible criminal violations of the FCPA and other  laws by Alcoa and its executives and agent. The DOJ said the stay was needed to protect potential witnesses against civil discovery. The stay the court granted is still in effect. The DOJ hasn't commented on the status of its criminal investigation. Alcoa  denied  wrongdoing and said it is cooperating. See our post here.
Will the DOJ also intervene in Alba's suit against Sojitz? It needed the stay in the Alcoa case, it said, because:

The public is "an unnamed party in every lawsuit." United States v. Reaves, 636 F.Supp. 1575, 1578 (E.D. Ky. 1986) Here, the Complaint alleges that the defendants arranged for Alcoa, a public corporation, through its affiliates and agents, to make payments in violation of the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA, among other crimes. The proposed stay enables the government to investigate these charges without potential prejudice to its investigation resulting from civil discovery . . . This would thus enable the government to vindicate the paramount public interest in the enforcement of federal criminal laws and resolution of the federal criminal investigation, should the government's investigation reveal evidence that federal criminal laws were violated. . . .

Sojitz Corp.'s  website says that as of September 2009, its   business consists of 555 companies including 165 subsidiaries and affiliates in Japan and 390 overseas, with   17,147 employees. Sojitz's U.S. subsidiary is headquartered in New York. The parent company's ADRs trade in the over-the-counter pink sheets under the symbol SZHFF.PK.

Another Alba-Related Investigation

By   Richard L. Cassin |   Wednesday, September 9, 2009 at 8:08PM 

The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday (here) that the Justice Department is "investigating payments that Bahraini prosecutors allege were made by units of Japanese commodities-trading giant Sojitz Group to employees of an aluminum producer in Bahrain." The story says $8.7 million in alleged bribes to employees at Aluminum Bahrain BSC, or Alba, were paid into secret accounts they controlled in Liechtenstein banks. Some of the payments reportedly passed through U.S. banks.Sojitz acts as a broker for Alba's products, including aluminum billet and alloys. It allegedly enjoyed lower prices in exchange for the payments. The DOJ investigation of Sojitz, which does some business in the U.S.,  is reportedly based on information provided by Bahraini authorities. The Journal said they "have shared their findings with U.S. Justice Department prosecutors, according to people briefed on the investigation." The payments were allegedly made by units of Nissho Iwai, which merged with Nichimen in 2004 to form Sojitz.In March 2008, Alba -- majority owned by the government of Bahrain -- sued Alcoa Inc., its long-time raw materials supplier, for corruption and fraud. The  federal court suit in Pittsburg alleged that Alba paid $2 billion in overcharges during a 15-year period. The money, according to the suit, first went to overseas accounts controlled by Alcoa's agent and some was then used to bribe Alba's executives in return for more supply contracts. The Justice Department quickly intervened in the case, asking the court for a stay while the government investigates possible criminal violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other laws by Alcoa and its executives and agent. Alcoa has denied any wrongdoing and said it is cooperating with the DOJ.The Wall Street Journal said Bahrain filed a money-laundering indictment against two former Alba employees accused of taking kickbacks from Sojitz.The Justice Department hasn't commented on the Alcoa investigation or the Wall Street Journal's story naming Sojitz.Read prior posts about Alba and Alcoa here..
