Wish it was a little more in-depth about some of the more complex processes, but overall a good beginner's guide to manufacturing and a good jumping off point for further research.

A good refererence catalog for manufacturing processes

By R. D Johnson
A catalog of processes is essentially what this book is. It's broken into 7 process sections: Cut from Solid, Sheet, Continuous, Thin & Hollow, Into Solid, Complex and Advanced. Each section has from 6-20 subset processes, eg, 'Cut From Solid' includes CNC machining, Turning, etc., 'Into Solid' has Forging, Sintering, 'Thin and Hollow' processes such as Blow Molding, Filament Winding, etc. The range of processes seems quite comprehensive and includes some I'd never heard of before such as Inflating Metal under the Sheet section, which is basically using air to inflate sheets of metal in a mold.Each process is typically described in 2-3 pages and follows a common layout. There's a picture of a typical item produced, some text describing the process, and an information section which includes economic production volume, type of surface and finish, and the typical sizes and tolerances of parts produced. This is followed by a '+' and '-' list of advantages and disadvantages of the particular process.A Further Information section on each process lists web addresses of manufacturers who supply the process and/or provide more information on it. This is a great resource, but you do wonder--given the fluidity of the web--how long some of these addresses will be viable.For the price this book is a great catalog of many of the manufacturing processes available. It doesn't go into any detail on how to design for the process (as a designer) or make it function (as a machinist/manufacturer), but it's a great reference as an overview of available processes, their benefits and limitations, and where to go to get more information.

Good visual survey of techniques, but not a how-to book

By Joan the Science Bug
Really good, simple survey of realistic techniques, at a reasonable price. I am giving it less than full credit because it could have been more useful if it was just a bit more quantitative. But for a qualitative review of what each type of process does, it's great.  Not a text on HOW to do these techniques however. It's sort of like a museum of manufacturing in book form.

Friends, Partners, and Lovers 
What It Takes to Make Your Marriage Work


Thompson, Kevin A. (Author)	
									        	
									           			,  
									        		
									        		Thompson, Kevin A. (Preface by)	
									        	
									




Helps couples have a healthy and lasting marriage by intentionally fulfilling three essential roles: friends, partners, and lovers.




Description


Great marriages don't just happen--they're made, intentionally, day by day. Yet most of us enter the covenant of marriage thinking that the role of spouse will be easy, natural, effortless. Rarely is this true. In fact, the number one cause of divorce isn't adultery or finances or disagreements. It's apathy--a lack of intentional emotional, physical, and mental investment in the relationship.With engaging stories and clear, simple language, pastor Kevin A. Thompson explains the three critical roles of a spouse--friend, partner, and lover--and shows how to nurture those roles in order to keep a marriage healthy and strong. Using solid biblical principles, he helps couples understand how to grow their friendship, be a supportive partner through the good times and the bad, and develop a healthy and satisfying sex life.Friends, Partners, and Lovers offers essential insight for couples at any stage of marriage but will be especially helpful to those who are struggling and those who are engaged or newly married and looking to start their marriage on strong footing.

Publisher's Description▼▲
Great marriages don't just happen--they're made, intentionally, day by day. Yet most of us enter the covenant of marriage thinking that the role of spouse will be easy, natural, effortless. Rarely is this true. In fact, the number one cause of divorce isn't adultery or finances or disagreements. It's apathy--a lack of intentional emotional, physical, and mental investment in the relationship. With engaging stories and clear, simple language, pastor Kevin A. Thompson explains the three critical roles of a spouse--friend, partner, and lover--and shows how to nurture those roles in order to keep a marriage healthy and strong. Using solid biblical principles, he helps couples understand how to grow their friendship, be a supportive partner through the good times and the bad, and develop a healthy and satisfying sex life.Friends, Partners, and Lovers offers essential insight for couples at any stage of marriage but will be especially helpful to those who are struggling and those who are engaged or newly married and looking to start their marriage on strong footing.


Author Bio▼▲
Kevin A. Thompson (MDiv, Beeson Divinity School) is lead pastor at Community Bible Church, a growing multi-site church with four locations in western Arkansas. Every year he meets with nearly one hundred couples with a range of needs, from pre-marital counseling to navigating the most serious betrayals. A marriage and parenting conference speaker, he and his wife, Jenny, have two children and live in Fort Smith, Arkansas. He blogs at www.kevinathompson.com.

            Friends, Partners & Lovers, by Kevin A. Thompson, tells the reader what it takes to make a marriage work.  It is not just a book for those who are struggling in their marriage, it is also a great resource for any one who is married or going to be married.  


The author points out that the number one cause of divorce is that the marriage died because one or both of the spouses neglected to intentionally invest in the marriage. In a healthy marriage both spouses play the roles of friends, partners and lovers.  By doing this, we let our spouse know that we will always be by their side, we will always have their back and we let them know someone will always see their soul. Being a good spouse takes time and is demanding.  Unless we play all three roles we are failing to give our spouse everything we promise, and everything they deserve.  


The author states that healthy marriages do not have less conflict, rather they have more positive interaction.  He also states that if both partners are willing, a marriage can radically change.  But you can't change your marriage by trying to change your spouse.  You can pray for a change in your spouse, but you must start with a change in yourself.   The conclusion of the book gives us eight questions to think about, to see if there are areas in our lives that we need to change.


I enjoyed reading some of the personal things the author puts in the book.  The one thing that stands out most in my mind is that he felt he could tell how the marriage will last by how the couple feeds each other the cake at the wedding.  I think back at weddings I have been to and seen couples smash the cake into their spouse, while other weddings the couple have been so respectful that if they get frosting on their spouse, they take a napkin and clean their spouse's face.  I have not thought of this before, but it makes sense that those who take care with their spouse show more respect and love.


Another thing that is pointed out in this book is that your spouse needs to be your friend.  But they cannot be your only friend.  You need other friends that you can turn to, that you can talk with about things that your spouse does not care to talk about.


This is a good book for married, or soon to be married people.  I really think this book is one that should be recommended at marriage enrichment classes or counseling.  There are some points within the book that may offend the reader, as the author goes deep in how we need to treat our spouse and what we need to do to help our marriage.  To get the most out of this book, I feel it should be one shared by both spouses, and not just read by one.  In my opinion, if only one is going to read the book, it will be the one who is putting in the most work to make a marriage work.  And some points in the book may make they sit back and think about things that are not being done in their marriage.  As well as things they deserve in their marriage that they are not getting from their spouse.  Each chapter ends with Be Intentional questions that will make you really sit and think.  


I received a copy of this book from Revell Publishing and I have written an honest review.

            Friends, Partners, and Lovers shares Kevin A. Thompson's thoughts and experiences on "what it takes to make your marriage work". Thompson discusses three critical roles of a spouse and offers strategies and suggestions for developing and maintaining a healthy relationship. "Healthy marriages do not have less conflict; they have more positive interactions."


I enjoyed the insight, practical approaches, and simple instructions outlined in the book, as well as the intentional thoughts and discussion questions that conclude each chapter. "Marriage at its best harnesses both the strength of two individuals and the power of a united couple." Friends, Partners, and Lovers is a great source of encouragement for couples at any stage of marriage!


I received a complimentary copy of this book. No review was required, and all thoughts expressed are my own.

            I'm married to my best friend. That's what I tell people who don't know me and want to know who my husband is. He's my best friend. When we met, I was leery of another relationship. My first marriage was not the greatest. Too many bad things happening. I didn't trust any guy. But, my husband patiently persisted and one day I took a leap of Faith after praying hard, and 4 years later we are still married. Do we fight? Oh Lord, do we ever! But, one thing I can say is we stay friends through it all. We work our problems out. We seek advice if we need it. We never give up.


Kevin A. Thompson is an author I'd not heard of before, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect with this book, especially with it being a non fiction book. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised! He takes three key aspects to making a marriage work and tells us why they work. It's definitely something I have taken to heart and really want to work on with my husband! The way Mr. Thompson describes these aspects really make me reflect on my marriage now. Four years of happiness with my best friend, sure. But, there is more that we can be doing to really make it work.


This is a 4 star worthy book, in my opinion! I enjoyed his writing style, as it makes it easy to read this non fiction book and to not get bored reading it. If you are in a happy marriage, or a marriage that you aren't sure if it's going to make it, then I highly recommend this read! It will help you think and reflect on what your doing now, and what could improve it. Definitely a great partner read with your spouse!

             There are three components to making a marriage a success. You must be three things to your partner, a friend, a lover, and a partner. Each of those things plays a very important part and can't be neglected. The author has taken from his own marriage and his experience as a pastor and speaker to write a book that is informative and honest. His counseling has shown him that these three parts of a marriage are essential for any marriage to flourish. The book is divided into three sections and each chapter ends with discussion questions to make the material intentional and doable.


The book was well laid out and interesting to read. The questions at the back were often thought provoking and inspiring. I thought the author did a great job of addressing many of the issues within each section without going overboard with too many details. He shared honest stories about his marriage and things he has taken from his counseling sessions and talks with other married couples. This is a great book for a newlywed or someone who has been married for many years. I would definitely recommend it.


I received a copy of this book from Revell. All thoughts expressed are my own.

            I'll admit. Reading a book about marriage doesn't top my list most days. I have been married for over 20 years and while we still have "moments" I would consider we are doing pretty good.  I ran across Kevin's blog and found myself soaking up his advice and words of wisdom over marriage. So when his book came out, I had to read it. I found it so encouraging and applicable. I have learned to work harder in certain areas and it has made a big difference in my marriage. If you are married or engaged, I would recommend this book! In fact, I already have to several friends.

“I’ll Transform YOU Into A JV Jedi, With The Power To Attract An Abundance Of A-List Entrepreneurs Who Will Gladly Endorse And Promote You… So You Can Expand Your Marketing Message, Grow Your Business In A Powerful Way, And Tap Into An Extremely Profitable Long-Term Revenue Stream!”









If you listened in on the Strategy Session and are ready to take action now so you can claim your spot for the JV Jedi Training and get the extra benefits I told you about, you may  to bypass the information below and immediately get registered
(If you did NOT participate on the strategy session, please do NOT skip ahead)






Today we’re here to talk about collaborating, partnering and doing joint ventures, but not just any ole joint venture, and certainly NOT the kind of thing most people think about when they hear the words “joint venture”.
What we’re actually talking about is a tested and proven process that will attract an abundance of A-List Entrepreneurs who will gladly endorse and promote you… so you can expand your marketing message, grow your business in a powerful way and tap into an extremely profitable long-term revenue stream.
A process that will allow you to easily create relationship capital and convert it into untold millions in financial capital.
Because the fact is, relationship capital is what leads to financial capital.






“When You Get The Relationship Piece Right…
The Financial Piece Naturally Takes Care Of Itself!”






The process I’m about to share with you is the very same process I’ve already used to make $13.5 Million… and that number continues to grow on a daily basis.
This process is so powerful that it’s earned me a reputation as “The JV Jedi”… and that reputation reaches far beyond the circles I’m actively engaged in.
This process is so powerful… that if you took everything else away from me…
My existing prospect list, my current clients, my existing business relationships, my existing products… take EVERYTHING away…
And knowing what I know today about partnering, collaborating and doing joint ventures… within 30 days I’d be generating a very nice income for myself, starting from scratch, by using this very same process.
And here’s the most exciting part about the process I’m about to share with you…
Though I do have long-term ongoing relationships with my partners, simply because they’re so happy with the kind of experience and results I’m able to deliver for them… our initial project typically goes from idea to execution, meaning idea to money in the bank… in less than 30 days.
I’ve partnered with everyone you can imagine, from people inside my own industry, to people who are completely outside of my own industry, where in the early days, we initially wondered if it would even work
I began collaborating and partnering with A-List Entrepreneurs long before I ever had a subscriber or customer base of my own.
With the value proposition I presented, most of them didn’t care whether I had a list of prospects or customers.
To this day, many of my partners don’t require (or even ask for) any reciprocity because I’m able to provide so much value and deliver such an incredible experience for them.






“What We’re Talking About Is NOT An…
“I’ll Promote You If You Promote Me” Proposition!”













People promote me because I bring incredible value to the table, I make my partner look like a rock star in front of their audience, what I have to offer is extremely valuable, and I deliver a great experience for everyone involved.
When we collaborate, partner and do joint ventures this way, the revenue is typically realized in less than 30 days, there’s no advertising costs or financial risk, it gives us the opportunity to collaborate with like-minded people so we can both put our best foot forward, and most of all… it provides a unique win-win-win experience for us, our partner, and all the customers who ultimately get to invest in, and benefit from what we do together.
And this is great because as you continue to move forward, providing this kind of unique experience for everyone, word spreads very quickly…and just as quickly, YOU gain a reputation for doing what you do, which causes even more A-List people to want to partner and collaborate with you.


Before you know it, you’ve got more opportunities than you can take advantage of, which forces you to choose only the very best ones.
And I speak from experience when I tell you, this is a GREAT position to be in.
As I mentioned… since doing my very first joint venture project in June of 2007 I’ve made $13.5 Million to date… SOLELY by collaborating, partnering and doing joint ventures with other A-List Entrepreneurs.
As a result, I now have the privilege and honor of sharing what I’ve discovered with people like yourself who are now successfully applying The JV Jedi Process to their own businesses.
Depending on where you’re at in your own life right now…







That 13.5 Million Dollar Figure May
Or May Not Seem Like A Big Number…






…and it’s really irrelevant, because here’s what you need to know:






This income was made completely on my own terms, partnering ONLY with A-List people who were an absolute pleasure to collaborate with, so we could provide massive value to the people we served… while never having to sacrifice our time freedom, our core values, our families or anything else that was important to us.
Anyone who’s been a partner (or a connector) and experienced “The JV Jedi Process” for themselves can attest to the success we’ve had, the lives we’ve impacted, the income we’ve made, and the ease at which we’ve done so.
Because I’ve fine-tuned The JV Jedi Process so well over the years, I’m now able to simply rinse… lather… repeat… and in most cases it takes less than 90 minutes of our time for my partner and I to do a project that makes us anywhere from $13,004.00 on the low end… to $187,618.00 on the high end.
So kudos to you for being here, because once you understand this unique process, you’ll literally be able to attract an abundance of A-List entrepreneurs who will gladly endorse and promote you… so you can expand your marketing message, grow your business in a powerful way and tap into this extremely profitable long-term revenue stream.
That being said, there are definitely some pitfalls you need to be aware of.
Even the most well-intentioned of people tend to get tripped up when it comes to collaborating, partnering and doing joint ventures, and I want to make sure that doesn’t happen to you.












So we’ll start by going over…






The 7 Deadly Joint Venture Mistakes








Mistake 1
Thinking that a joint venture requires a long-term contract or relationship. It certainly can lead to a long term relationship if you and your partner both want it to, but the process I use certainly doesn’t require any long term commitments or contracts. This is all about collaboration, and doing what feels right and best for everyone involved.




Mistake 2
Thinking that all your potential partner cares about is money. When using this process to attract the kind of A-List partners we’re talking about, you’ll quickly discover that “money” shows up way down on their list of “must haves”.
Things like providing value, improving the relationship they already have with their customers, protecting the brand they’ve created, making a difference in people’s lives, doing projects that are exciting and worthwhile, collaborating with forward-thinking like-minded people are just a few examples of things that rank FAR higher on their list.




Mistake 3
Believing that a potential partner actually gives a rip about how great we think our products or services are. It’s a given that we need to have something of value to offer. But your A-List partner doesn’t want to hear about how great you think your stuff is.
They want to know how you can help THEM. They want to be part of something worthwhile. They want to collaborate with someone who “gets them”. The JV Jedi Process is about connecting with the right people in a unique way that naturally leads to an authentic, genuine and open discussion about how you can accomplish great things together. And that’s the key word… TOGETHER!








My 5-Question JV Partner Interview lets you easily connect with your ideal partner in such a powerful way that they’re excited for the opportunity to collaborate with you.








Mistake 4
Continually trying to chase down joint venture partners… instead of having a process that ATTRACTS an abundance of ideal A-List entrepreneurs who are pre-conditioned, pre-disposed and pre-motivated to collaborate and partner on profitable projects with you… so you have the luxury of choosing ONLY the partners and projects that excite you the most and are guaranteed to be the most profitable.








My JV-Getter Email has opened doors that I once thought were impossible to open, and led to many of the most enjoyable and profitable joint venture projects I’ve ever done… including people like Bill Harris of www.Centerpointe.com, even though countless people told me that a guy as successful as Bill would never be interested in partnering or collaborating with me.








Mistake 5
Feeling obligated to do reciprocal projects, promote products and services you don’t agree with, or play the “you scratch my back and I’ll scratch your back” game… instead of having a process that attracts the right kind of A-List partners who’s #1 goal is to provide value… because they understand that the more they do this, the more their income increases, and that may… or may NOT include doing reciprocal projects.




Mistake 6
Blindly going into a joint venture project, or flying by the seat of your pants while hoping for the best results… instead of having a process that allows you to accurately predict and deliver guaranteed perfect results for you and your partner… every single time… a process that you can simply rinse, lather and repeat… and use over and over and over again… as often as you like.




Mistake 7
Not having a strategic way to capitalize on every project you do, and every partner you collaborate with… instead of having a process that delivers such an incredible experience for every one of your partners and includes a built-in mechanism for leveraging that experience into many more collaborative joint venture projects… so that what you end up with is your own private economy that continually gives you the sense of purpose, the time freedom, the satisfaction, the enjoyment and all the income you could ever want or desire. – This built-in mechanism will also naturally lead you to key people who will become HUGE connectors for you.
























These 7 mistakes are the very reason that so many entrepreneurs have failed to reach their true potential when it comes to collaborating, partnering and doing joint ventures.
I can’t tell you how many successful entrepreneurs and even experienced marketers with hundreds of joint venture projects under their belts who are only making a fraction of the income they could be making, and never experience the kind impact that’s truly possible, simply because they continue to repeat one or more of these 7 mistakes.
Now that you understand the 7 deadly mistakes, and know how to avoid them, let’s look at where you DO need to focus your attention, because…















“There Are Specific Steps You Must Follow”






…if you want to have massive success with partnering, collaborating and doing joint ventures.












There’s obviously a lot of details that go with each one of these steps, but I want to give you enough of an idea, and enough of the specifics so you’ll leave here today with a great understanding of exactly how to start attracting the kind of A-List joint venture partners and projects that will give you all the benefits we’ve been talking about… and a whole lot more.
Because I can assure you, that whatever you’re currently able to envision as your best case scenario from where you’re sitting right now (from your current vantage point), as you begin to get a grasp on The JV Jedi Process, you quickly discover that your future reality is much bigger, much better, more profitable, more rewarding and more exciting than anything you could possibly imagine at this very moment in time.
Let me show you what I’m talking about and allow you to experience this for yourself as I introduce you to…












The 7-Step Tested And Proven “JV Jedi Process”









1.




Identify your ideal joint venture partner, because whoever you’re thinking it is at this point, I’ll guarantee that you’re thinking WAY too small, and way too narrow. Now don’t get me wrong, you certainly don’t want to go off half-cocked, reaching out to anyone and everyone who has a pulse, and the potential to help you make a buck or two. You definitely want to think bigger than that, and consider the long-term impact of your actions.




2.




Contact your ideal joint venture partner with a simple message that grabs their attention and lets them know you’re the kind of A-List person who clearly has their best interest in mind.
When you get this right they’ll respond… and they’ll respond immediately (HINT: it ain’t about how great your stuff is or how much money you can make for them). You need to understand what really motivates your ideal joint venture partner (just so you know, it’s THEM and THEIR big objectives… it’s NOT us or our agenda).
The way you get them to respond is by offering a no charge Strategy Session. I know, I know… if you’ve never done anything like this before, you might be thinking, “What the heck is a strategy session, and why do I offer that”? This brings us to the 3rd step and I’ll explain why this is so critical.




3.




Make an appointment to speak on the phone (or Skype… especially if they’re overseas) for the Strategy Session, so you the two of you can collaborate together. Follow my 5-Question JV Partner Interview Process. The key is to ask each of the 5 questions, and then listen, listen, listen and take notes.
Let them know you’re taking notes, let them hear you plunking away on your keyboard. If you do this in person, use a legal pad, laptop or IPad. No one else in their organization listens to them like this.




“And When You Do, You’re Going
To Make One Heck Of An Impression”




4.




Schedule follow-up session before you hang up for 7-8 days out (maybe a little longer if you’re just getting started with The JV Jedi Process, but definitely no longer than 13 days out).
Let them know that because you value the relationship, you want to give the conversation some serious thought (this is going to build massive relationship capital for you, which directly translates into financial capital by the way). Let them know you’ll be emailing them your notes (builds HUGE and instant credibility).
This gives you time to think creatively, talk with trusted sources, talk with people in your network, talk with me ( and tap into my network) so you can come back together with your ideal partner and collaborate with them effectively… because (like I mentioned earlier) that’s what they REALLY want… to collaborate with someone who “gets them”.




5.




WOW them on your follow up session by demonstrating that you “get them”. Go over your notes from the 5-Question JV Partner Interview and convey their own words right back to them. You’ll say something like, “As promised, I’ve been giving this a lot of thought, and before we go any further, I want to make sure I clearly understand everything you’ve shared with me”.
Collaborate with them on an idea or two, keeping in mind that this is a back and forth dialog, and that you’ve got their complete and undivided attention, simply because you’ve been following this process. By doing so, you’ll get their own ideas out of their head, and into the here and now.




“You’ll Be The Guy Or Gal
They’ll Forever Associate With Doing This!”




 
Now you simply offer to be their guide in making everything you’ve been discussing a reality for them.
And here’s the big secret (as well as the key to this process)… people are committed to what they help create. They’ll follow through on what they have a hand in collaborating with you.




6.




Do a collaborative project together, have fun, let your creative side come out, make some great things happen, provide massive value to the people you serve, and get compensated REALLY well for your efforts.




7.




Give your partner a way to continue the experience, and share it with others. You need to be prepared when they say, “thank you, what’s next” (because they will). Make sure you continue to collaborate with them.
This is not a one-and-done kind of thing. We’re building relationship capital that will carry us through the rest of our lives. And yes, after your partner just had an incredible experience with you, make sure you offer them a simple way to share that experience with others (my “JV Getter” Email).
You get to go down these rabbit holes, and it’s an exciting experience, that I can promise. Before you know it, you find yourself having these incredibly engaging and collaborative discussions with people who are the movers and shakers in this world, people who feel an incredible bond, rapport and connection with you as a result of using The JV Jedi Process, people who want to pay it forward by sharing their experience with others and introducing you to even more of the world’s movers and shakers.
At this point, if you’ve grasped the process I’ve been sharing with you… you realize that what we’ve been talking about is FAR more than a way to increase revenue and profits.
