                    The area that will be discussed in this local insight is at Woodrow and Gettysburg. I currently live in this neighborhood in a 3bd 2.5ba condo and I love it.

This area is the ideal location for anyone that likes to walk places because of all of the business that surround the area. There is the new development across from Fresno State with the Maya Movie Theater and the abundance of delicious restaurants including DogHouse. Costco and Winco are also a short drive away at Ashlan and Peach which makes that weekly shopping trip less of a errand. 

The best part of living in this neighborhood though is when the SaveMart Center is having a show you can walk there and back without paying for parking and dealing with the traffic. Also, when Fresno State is having a football game you can bypass all that traffic as well.

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.
