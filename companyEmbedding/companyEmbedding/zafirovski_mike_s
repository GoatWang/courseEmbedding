Personal life[edit]
Zafirovski was born in Skopje, Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the present-day capital of the Republic of Macedonia. He immigrated to United States in 1969, arriving in Cleveland, Ohio with his family, $1500 among them and speaking no English.[3][4] Two years later, he entered Edinboro University on a swimming scholarship. In 2004, he received the Ellis Island Medal of Honor.[5]
Career[edit]
Zafirovski spent 24 years with General Electric, starting in 1975, where he went through GE's Jack Welch-style leadership training programs and served in various management positions. Between 1996 and 1999, he was head of the European division of GE Lighting, during which time the division posted record profits. He was then promoted to his last position at GE, as President and CEO of GE Lighting from July 1999 to May 2000.
Afterwards, he joined Motorola, serving as Executive Vice President and President of the Personal Communications Sector from June 2000 until July 2002. In 2002, he was passed over for the promotion to Chief Operating Officer for Edward Breen, but Breen quit later that year and Zafirovski was given the title in July 2002. His success in the PCS division among other achievements at Motorola, seemed to make him a perfect candidate for the CEO position but the title went to Edward Zander on January 5, 2004. Zafirovski resigned on January 12, 2005.[6] He was a consultant to and a director of Motorola from then until May 2005.
When Zafirovski was chosen to head up Nortel Networks in early October, Motorola filed a suit against him, alleging that his new position would break the terms of the non-disclosure agreement he had signed. As part of that agreement, he had received a payoff from Motorola. The payoff had a clawback element should Zafirovski return to work within a defined period he would agree to refund a percentage of the payoff. The problem was he did not want to refund any of the money. As a consequence Nortel agreed to pay $11.5 million on his behalf.[7] Zafirovski became the President and Chief Executive Officer of Nortel Networks, replacing Bill Owens as of November 15, 2005.
Zafirovski announced he was stepping down as CEO of Nortel on August 10, 2009, following the sale of the company's CDMA and LTE businesses to Ericsson as part of a bankruptcy restructuring process.[8][9]
He was elected to the Board of Directors at Boeing on October 25, 2004.[10]
In July 2007 President George W. Bush appointed Zafirovski to the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee.[11][12]
In August 2009, Mike Zafirovski sought a $12 million payout from Nortel. While employees who worked for years with the company lost their jobs with no compensation at all. [13]

Between 1996 and 1999, he was head of the European division of GE Lighting, during which time the division posted record profits. He was then promoted to his last position at GE, as President and CEO of GE Lighting from July 1999 to May 2000.
Afterwards, he joined Motorola, serving as Executive Vice President and President of the Personal Communications Sector from June 2000 until July 2002. In 2002, he was passed over for the promotion to Chief Operating Officer for Edward Breen, but Breen quit later that year and Zafirovski was given the title in July 2002. His success in the PCS division among other achievements at Motorola, seemed to make him a perfect candidate for the CEO position but the title went to Edward Zander on January 5, 2004. Zafirovski resigned on January 12, 2005. He was a consultant to and a director of Motorola from then until May 2005.
When Zafirovski was chosen to head up Nortel Networks in early October, Motorola filed a suit against him, alleging that his new position would break the terms of the non-disclosure agreement he had signed. Nortel agreed to pay $11.5 million to settle the suit. Zafirovski became the President and Chief Executive Officer of Nortel Networks, replacing Bill Owens as of November 15, 2005. He was elected to the Board of Directors at Boeing on October 25, 2004. 
In July 2007 President George W. Bush appointed Zafirovski to the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee.

October 4, 2011
By Angela Sormani






Mike Zafirovski has been named director of Apria Healthcare Group Inc. and senior advisor to The Blackstone Group. Zafirovski’s 35-year career includes roles as president, chief executive officer and chief operating officer with Nortel, Motorola and five General Electric (GE) businesses in the high tech, industrial, consumer, financial services and insurance industries.
PRESS RELEASE
Apria Healthcare Group Inc. (the “Company”), a leading national home healthcare services provider and a portfolio company of The Blackstone Group, today announced that Mike S. Zafirovski has been named a member of the Board of Directors of the Company. In addition, The Blackstone Group announced Mr. Zafirovski’s appointment as a Senior Advisor to the firm.
Mr. Zafirovski’s 35-year career includes roles as President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer with Nortel, Motorola and five General Electric (GE) businesses in the high tech, industrial, consumer, financial services and insurance industries. In addition, he is a current member of The Boeing Company’s Board of Directors and has held other board positions in various companies and councils in both the United States and Europe.
Blackstone Senior Managing Director Neil Simpkins said, “I am delighted that Mike will be supporting our efforts at Blackstone as a Senior Advisor and that his first responsibility in this regard is with Apria Healthcare.” 





Norman C. Payson, MD, Apria’s Chief Executive Officer, added, “By working collaboratively with the Apria Board and executive leadership team, Mike’s past experience leading change in diverse businesses will be an asset to the organization in the years ahead.”
A 1975 graduate of Edinboro University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Mathematics and recipient of an Honorary Doctorate from the same university in 2002, Mr. Zafirovski joined GE in 1975 and held progressively more responsible management and executive roles in various operating units through 2000, the most recent being the President and Chief Executive Officer of GE Lighting. As President and Chief Executive Officer of Motorola’s Personal Communications Sector (mobile devices) from 2000-2002, he led the $12 billion business unit’s turnaround and expanded investments in new product development. From July 2002 to January 2005 he served as President, Chief Operating Officer and Board Member of Motorola Inc., and was responsible for the strategies and operational execution of its six global businesses. From November 2005 to August 2009, he was the President, Chief Executive Officer and Director of Nortel Networks Corporation.
Mr. Zafirovski commented, “I am looking forward to serving Apria Healthcare as a board member and working with the executive leadership team to continue to expand Apria Healthcare’s presence in the home healthcare service segment. As health reform is implemented in the next few years, I look forward to sharing my experience from other industries with the team.” 





In addition to his public company board service, Mike is active in several not-for-profit organizations, including serving as Vice Chairman for the Academy for Urban School Leadership (an organization turning around the most challenged public schools in Chicago), a member of the Macedonia 2025 Board, one of the co-chairs of the Duke University Parents Board and a member of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. In 2008, Mike received the Distinguished Leadership Award from the New York Hall of Science and in 2004 he received the Ellis Island Medal of Honor.

Personal life[edit]
Zafirovski was born in Skopje, Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the present-day capital of the Republic of Macedonia. He immigrated to United States in 1969, arriving in Cleveland, Ohio with his family, $1500 among them and speaking no English.[3][4] Two years later, he entered Edinboro University on a swimming scholarship. In 2004, he received the Ellis Island Medal of Honor.[5]
Career[edit]
Zafirovski spent 24 years with General Electric, starting in 1975, where he went through GE's Jack Welch-style leadership training programs and served in various management positions. Between 1996 and 1999, he was head of the European division of GE Lighting, during which time the division posted record profits. He was then promoted to his last position at GE, as President and CEO of GE Lighting from July 1999 to May 2000.
Afterwards, he joined Motorola, serving as Executive Vice President and President of the Personal Communications Sector from June 2000 until July 2002. In 2002, he was passed over for the promotion to Chief Operating Officer for Edward Breen, but Breen quit later that year and Zafirovski was given the title in July 2002. His success in the PCS division among other achievements at Motorola, seemed to make him a perfect candidate for the CEO position but the title went to Edward Zander on January 5, 2004. Zafirovski resigned on January 12, 2005.[6] He was a consultant to and a director of Motorola from then until May 2005.
When Zafirovski was chosen to head up Nortel Networks in early October, Motorola filed a suit against him, alleging that his new position would break the terms of the non-disclosure agreement he had signed. As part of that agreement, he had received a payoff from Motorola. The payoff had a clawback element should Zafirovski return to work within a defined period he would agree to refund a percentage of the payoff. The problem was he did not want to refund any of the money. As a consequence Nortel agreed to pay $11.5 million on his behalf.[7] Zafirovski became the President and Chief Executive Officer of Nortel Networks, replacing Bill Owens as of November 15, 2005.
Zafirovski announced he was stepping down as CEO of Nortel on August 10, 2009, following the sale of the company's CDMA and LTE businesses to Ericsson as part of a bankruptcy restructuring process.[8][9]
He was elected to the Board of Directors at Boeing on October 25, 2004.[10]
In July 2007 President George W. Bush appointed Zafirovski to the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee.[11][12]
In August 2009, Mike Zafirovski sought a $12 million payout from Nortel. While employees who worked for years with the company lost their jobs with no compensation at all. [13]

Personal life[edit]
Zafirovski was born in Skopje, Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the present-day capital of the Republic of Macedonia. He immigrated to United States in 1969, arriving in Cleveland, Ohio with his family, $1500 among them and speaking no English.[3][4] Two years later, he entered Edinboro University on a swimming scholarship. In 2004, he received the Ellis Island Medal of Honor.[5]
Career[edit]
Zafirovski spent 24 years with General Electric, starting in 1975, where he went through GE's Jack Welch-style leadership training programs and served in various management positions. Between 1996 and 1999, he was head of the European division of GE Lighting, during which time the division posted record profits. He was then promoted to his last position at GE, as President and CEO of GE Lighting from July 1999 to May 2000.
Afterwards, he joined Motorola, serving as Executive Vice President and President of the Personal Communications Sector from June 2000 until July 2002. In 2002, he was passed over for the promotion to Chief Operating Officer for Edward Breen, but Breen quit later that year and Zafirovski was given the title in July 2002. His success in the PCS division among other achievements at Motorola, seemed to make him a perfect candidate for the CEO position but the title went to Edward Zander on January 5, 2004. Zafirovski resigned on January 12, 2005.[6] He was a consultant to and a director of Motorola from then until May 2005.
When Zafirovski was chosen to head up Nortel Networks in early October, Motorola filed a suit against him, alleging that his new position would break the terms of the non-disclosure agreement he had signed. As part of that agreement, he had received a payoff from Motorola. The payoff had a clawback element should Zafirovski return to work within a defined period he would agree to refund a percentage of the payoff. The problem was he did not want to refund any of the money. As a consequence Nortel agreed to pay $11.5 million on his behalf.[7] Zafirovski became the President and Chief Executive Officer of Nortel Networks, replacing Bill Owens as of November 15, 2005.
Zafirovski announced he was stepping down as CEO of Nortel on August 10, 2009, following the sale of the company's CDMA and LTE businesses to Ericsson as part of a bankruptcy restructuring process.[8][9]
He was elected to the Board of Directors at Boeing on October 25, 2004.[10]
In July 2007 President George W. Bush appointed Zafirovski to the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee.[11][12]
In August 2009, Mike Zafirovski sought a $12 million payout from Nortel. While employees who worked for years with the company lost their jobs with no compensation at all. [13]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
