Young Brians




BIOGRAPHY

The Young Brians formed out of the remnants of The Raves. Mike Werts cleverly named the band and then quit to pursue his homework. Brian Young took over on bass. The band convinced Larry not to play reggae. They rehearsed a lot at 123 Arts and then broke into the scene at Henry's Pub and the Big Dipper. After meeting World's Greatest Manager Terry Grob, the band played a lot in Seattle and other places, having the opportunity to perform with Flop, The Young Fresh Fellows, Mudhoney, The Posies, and lots of others. Andy's Warehouse was released and was followed by the 4000 Holes single 'Around Above Beyond Below' b/w 'Bowling Shoes'. The single charted in the Rocket's Top 20, but it is suspected that someone cooked the books on that one. God Bless 'em. Lots of recording that was never released took place. The band split up and went on to other things. Jamie is in a band called The Makers and also one called Silver Treason. Brian joined the Flies, formed Burns Like Hellfire and has performed solo, with Our Mother the Mountain, and with the Healthy Scratches. Larry played in Junk Train and several other projects. Dave formed Pophead and Anyface. They are all still friends. They are still in awe of their friends in Nice World, Motherload, Big Feeling, Buzz Feedback, Funk Buffalo, The Bettys, The Fumes and Dee Farmin in general. They are also sorry for defacing the Musician's Union and making Pointed Sticks into something dirty. The band has not performed together in 20 years. Until now
