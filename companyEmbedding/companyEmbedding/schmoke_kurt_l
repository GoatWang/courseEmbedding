Early years[edit]
Schmoke was born and raised in Baltimore to Murray Schmoke, a civilian chemist for the US Army, and Irene B. Reid, a social worker. He attended the public schools of Baltimore.
High school[edit]
Schmoke attended the Baltimore City College, the third oldest high school in the United States and the largest high school in Maryland at the time of his graduation in 1967. Schmoke excelled in both football and lacrosse. His speed afoot and his passing accuracy won him the starting job as the junior varsity and later varsity quarterback. As the varsity quarterback, he led the City Knights to two undefeated seasons and successive Maryland Scholastic Association A-conference championships in 1965 and 1966.
As a student, Schmoke was a member of the Baltimore City College "A-course", a college preparatory curriculum that required him to take Latin and other advanced studies not offered to the average Baltimore high school student. Schmoke was elected president of the school's student government in his senior year but also worked in the Baltimore community with disadvantaged youth. Compulsory community service had not yet been mandated for Baltimore high school students, yet he tutored and mentored young men from the inner city as a member of the Lancers Boys Club.[1]
College and graduate school[edit]
Schmoke entered Yale University in the fall of 1967. He played quarterback on the freshman team that year. While at Yale, Schmoke and his classmates started a day care center on campus for the children of the university's janitors and cafeteria workers who lived in New Haven. The center was named after Calvin Hill, a former Yale football star who became a star running back for the Dallas Cowboys, and still stands today.[2]
Schmoke has been acknowledged as the undergraduate student leader who helped quell the possibility of riot on the Yale campus in the wake of the New Haven Black Panther trials in the spring of 1970. As New Haven filled with radical protesters, Yale students demanded the suspension of classes. A bitterly divided faculty met to discuss strategy, and invited a student leader to address the gathering. Schmoke, who was Secretary of the Class of 1971 and a leader of the Black Student Alliance at Yale, was selected to represent the students.[3] He spoke only a few sentences: "The students on this campus are confused, they're frightened. They don't know what to think. You are older than we are, and are more experienced. We want guidance from you, moral leadership. On behalf of my fellow students, I beg you to give it to us."[4] This moment is credited with helping to dispel the growing tensions: the university voted to bend its rules, making classes "voluntarily optional" to the end of the term, and despite small outbreaks of violence, no campus-wide unrest resulted.
After graduating from Yale with a degree in history in 1971,[5] Schmoke studied as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University, and graduated from Harvard Law School in 1976.
Schmoke was selected with five other distinguished former collegiate student-athletes for a Silver Anniversary Award by the NCAA in 1996.
Early career[edit]
After graduating from Harvard Law School, Schmoke joined the Baltimore law firm of Piper and Marbury. In 1977, he was selected to be part of the White House Domestic Policy Staff during the Carter Administration to work in the Department of Transportation. However, after only one year working in President Carter's administration, Schmoke returned to Baltimore to serve as the Assistant United States Attorney, a position he held from 1978 to 1981.[6]
Elective office[edit]




Schmoke and Curt Anderson in 1982 as they both launch their political careers


In 1982 Schmoke ran for his first elected office. He challenged incumbent Baltimore City State's Attorney William A. Swisher in a citywide contest. Swisher had won the job away from Milton B. Allen, Baltimore's first African American State's Attorney. Schmoke ran an energetic, grassroots and race-neutral campaign and upset Swisher in a landslide.[7]
On November 3, 1987, he was elected mayor. As mayor, he became known for his opposition to the "War on Drugs" and his stance in favor of drug decriminalization. Schmoke initiated programs in housing, education, public health and economic development. During his three terms in office Schmoke faced very serious challenges, including poor quality schools, drug addiction, and violent crime. Some of his controversial positions included advocating the decriminalization of drug use, and employing Nation of Islam security guards in a housing project. His achievements included improving the environment of low-income housing projects, a needle-exchange program for addicts, keeping the tax rate stable, and attracting the Ravens football team to Baltimore.[8]
In 1992, President George H. W. Bush awarded him the national Literacy Award for his efforts to promote adult literacy, and in 1994 President Bill Clinton cited Baltimore's programs to improve public housing and enhance community economic development and named Baltimore one of six cities to receive Empowerment Zone designation.[9] In 1997, Schmoke served as a committee member for the Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence.[10] After serving three terms as city mayor, Schmoke opted not to run for reelection in 1999.[11]
Advocacy for school choice and school vouchers[edit]
In 1999 Schmoke delivered some remarks on the subject of school choice and school vouchers at a Manhattan Institute luncheon in New York. An edited version of a transcript of that speech entitled "Why School Vouchers Can Help Inner-City Children" is available online[12] and in that brief web page, Schmoke explains why he believes [that] school choice and vouchers will improve the quality of public education for America’s youth, particularly inner-city minority children."
Schmoke first came out in support of school choice in a speech at Johns Hopkins University in March 1996.[12]
Life after politics[edit]
After leaving office in December 1999, Schmoke practiced law at the firm of Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering in Baltimore.[13] In 2003, Schmoke was appointed the dean of the Howard University School of Law in Washington, D.C. In 2004, Schmoke was appointed an honorary fellow of Balliol College, Oxford. He is also on the board of Global Rights, and a member of the Christian and Missionary Alliance. In 2008, Schmoke delivered the keynote lecture, “A New Hundred Years War? The Compelling Need to Reform National Drug Control Policy” for the Edward Bouchet Conference on Diversity in Graduate Education at Yale University.
He also appeared in two 2004 episodes of the acclaimed HBO series The Wire. The episodes, entitled "Middle Ground" and "Mission Accomplished", featured Schmoke in a bit part as a health commissioner.[14][15][16][17] He acts as an advisor to the fictional mayor after a rogue police major has legalized drugs in a portion of the city.[18] This is a reference to his own feelings on the drug war.
In July 2008 Kurt Schmoke became the acting Senior Vice President of Academic Matters at Howard University, a position that in effect made Schmoke provost for the university. Schmoke continued as Dean of the Howard University School of Law. It had been rumored he would be named the new president.[19] Schmoke also taught election law as a seminar class every fall semester to third year law students.
In January 2009, Schmoke was seen holding an umbrella for Illinois Senate designee Roland Burris during an outdoor press conference concerning Burris' seating controversy.[20] Schmoke was part of the legal team advising Burris during the controversy. Schmoke was appointed Vice President and General Counsel of Howard University in July 2012.[21] On May 14, 2014, the University of Baltimore announced that Schmoke would become its new president.[22]

Schmoke was born and raised in Baltimore to Murray Schmoke, a civilian chemist for the US Army, and Irene B. Reid, a social worker. He attended the public schools of Baltimore.
High school[edit]
Schmoke attended the Baltimore City College, the third oldest high school in the United States and the largest high school in Maryland at the time of his graduation in 1967. Schmoke excelled in both football and lacrosse. His speed afoot and his passing accuracy won him the starting job as the junior varsity and later varsity quarterback. As the varsity quarterback, he led the City Knights to two undefeated seasons and successive Maryland Scholastic Association A-conference championships in 1965 and 1966.
As a student, Schmoke was a member of the Baltimore City College "A-course", a college preparatory curriculum that required him to take Latin and other advanced studies not offered to the average Baltimore high school student. Schmoke was elected president of the school's student government in his senior year but also worked in the Baltimore community with disadvantaged youth. Compulsory community service had not yet been mandated for Baltimore high school students, yet he tutored and mentored young men from the inner city as a member of the Lancers Boys Club.[1]
College and graduate school[edit]
Schmoke entered Yale University in the fall of 1967. He played quarterback on the freshman team that year. While at Yale, Schmoke and his classmates started a day care center on campus for the children of the university's janitors and cafeteria workers who lived in New Haven. The center was named after Calvin Hill, a former Yale football star who became a star running back for the Dallas Cowboys, and still stands today.[2]
Schmoke has been acknowledged as the undergraduate student leader who helped quell the possibility of riot on the Yale campus in the wake of the New Haven Black Panther trials in the spring of 1970. As New Haven filled with radical protesters, Yale students demanded the suspension of classes. A bitterly divided faculty met to discuss strategy, and invited a student leader to address the gathering. Schmoke, who was Secretary of the Class of 1971 and a leader of the Black Student Alliance at Yale, was selected to represent the students.[3] He spoke only a few sentences: "The students on this campus are confused, they're frightened. They don't know what to think. You are older than we are, and are more experienced. We want guidance from you, moral leadership. On behalf of my fellow students, I beg you to give it to us."[4] This moment is credited with helping to dispel the growing tensions: the university voted to bend its rules, making classes "voluntarily optional" to the end of the term, and despite small outbreaks of violence, no campus-wide unrest resulted.
After graduating from Yale with a degree in history in 1971,[5] Schmoke studied as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University, and graduated from Harvard Law School in 1976.
Schmoke was selected with five other distinguished former collegiate student-athletes for a Silver Anniversary Award by the NCAA in 1996.
Early career[edit]
After graduating from Harvard Law School, Schmoke joined the Baltimore law firm of Piper and Marbury. In 1977, he was selected to be part of the White House Domestic Policy Staff during the Carter Administration to work in the Department of Transportation. However, after only one year working in President Carter's administration, Schmoke returned to Baltimore to serve as the Assistant United States Attorney, a position he held from 1978 to 1981.[6]
Elective office[edit]




Schmoke and Curt Anderson in 1982 as they both launch their political careers


In 1982 Schmoke ran for his first elected office. He challenged incumbent Baltimore City State's Attorney William A. Swisher in a citywide contest. Swisher had won the job away from Milton B. Allen, Baltimore's first African American State's Attorney. Schmoke ran an energetic, grassroots and race-neutral campaign and upset Swisher in a landslide.[7]
On November 3, 1987, he was elected mayor. As mayor, he became known for his opposition to the "War on Drugs" and his stance in favor of drug decriminalization. Schmoke initiated programs in housing, education, public health and economic development. During his three terms in office Schmoke faced very serious challenges, including poor quality schools, drug addiction, and violent crime. Some of his controversial positions included advocating the decriminalization of drug use, and employing Nation of Islam security guards in a housing project. His achievements included improving the environment of low-income housing projects, a needle-exchange program for addicts, keeping the tax rate stable, and attracting the Ravens football team to Baltimore.[8]
In 1992, President George H. W. Bush awarded him the national Literacy Award for his efforts to promote adult literacy, and in 1994 President Bill Clinton cited Baltimore's programs to improve public housing and enhance community economic development and named Baltimore one of six cities to receive Empowerment Zone designation.[9] In 1997, Schmoke served as a committee member for the Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence.[10] After serving three terms as city mayor, Schmoke opted not to run for reelection in 1999.[11]
Advocacy for school choice and school vouchers[edit]
In 1999 Schmoke delivered some remarks on the subject of school choice and school vouchers at a Manhattan Institute luncheon in New York. An edited version of a transcript of that speech entitled "Why School Vouchers Can Help Inner-City Children" is available online[12] and in that brief web page, Schmoke explains why he believes [that] school choice and vouchers will improve the quality of public education for America’s youth, particularly inner-city minority children."
Schmoke first came out in support of school choice in a speech at Johns Hopkins University in March 1996.[12]
Life after politics[edit]
After leaving office in December 1999, Schmoke practiced law at the firm of Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering in Baltimore.[13] In 2003, Schmoke was appointed the dean of the Howard University School of Law in Washington, D.C. In 2004, Schmoke was appointed an honorary fellow of Balliol College, Oxford. He is also on the board of Global Rights, and a member of the Christian and Missionary Alliance. In 2008, Schmoke delivered the keynote lecture, “A New Hundred Years War? The Compelling Need to Reform National Drug Control Policy” for the Edward Bouchet Conference on Diversity in Graduate Education at Yale University.
He also appeared in two 2004 episodes of the acclaimed HBO series The Wire. The episodes, entitled "Middle Ground" and "Mission Accomplished", featured Schmoke in a bit part as a health commissioner.[14][15][16][17] He acts as an advisor to the fictional mayor after a rogue police major has legalized drugs in a portion of the city.[18] This is a reference to his own feelings on the drug war.
In July 2008 Kurt Schmoke became the acting Senior Vice President of Academic Matters at Howard University, a position that in effect made Schmoke provost for the university. Schmoke continued as Dean of the Howard University School of Law. It had been rumored he would be named the new president.[19] Schmoke also taught election law as a seminar class every fall semester to third year law students.
In January 2009, Schmoke was seen holding an umbrella for Illinois Senate designee Roland Burris during an outdoor press conference concerning Burris' seating controversy.[20] Schmoke was part of the legal team advising Burris during the controversy. Schmoke was appointed Vice President and General Counsel of Howard University in July 2012.[21] On May 14, 2014, the University of Baltimore announced that Schmoke would become its new president.[22]

Schmoke has been acknowledged as the undergraduate student leader who helped quell the possibility of riot on the Yale campus in the wake of the New Haven Black Panther trials in the spring of 1970. As New Haven filled with radical protesters, Yale students demanded the suspension of classes. A bitterly divided faculty met to discuss strategy, and invited a student leader to address the gathering. Schmoke, who was Secretary of the Class of 1971 and a leader of the Black Student Alliance at Yale, was selected to represent the students.[3] He spoke only a few sentences: "The students on this campus are confused, they're frightened. They don't know what to think. You are older than we are, and are more experienced. We want guidance from you, moral leadership. On behalf of my fellow students, I beg you to give it to us."[4] This moment is credited with helping to dispel the growing tensions: the university voted to bend its rules, making classes "voluntarily optional" to the end of the term, and despite small outbreaks of violence, no campus-wide unrest resulted.
After graduating from Yale with a degree in history in 1971,[5] Schmoke studied as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University, and graduated from Harvard Law School in 1976.
Schmoke was selected with five other distinguished former collegiate student-athletes for a Silver Anniversary Award by the NCAA in 1996.
Early career[edit]
After graduating from Harvard Law School, Schmoke joined the Baltimore law firm of Piper and Marbury. In 1977, he was selected to be part of the White House Domestic Policy Staff during the Carter Administration to work in the Department of Transportation. However, after only one year working in President Carter's administration, Schmoke returned to Baltimore to serve as the Assistant United States Attorney, a position he held from 1978 to 1981.[6]
Elective office[edit]

In 1982 Schmoke ran for his first elected office. He challenged incumbent Baltimore City State's Attorney William A. Swisher in a citywide contest. Swisher had won the job away from Milton B. Allen, Baltimore's first African American State's Attorney. Schmoke ran an energetic, grassroots and race-neutral campaign and upset Swisher in a landslide.[7]
On November 3, 1987, he was elected mayor. As mayor, he became known for his opposition to the "War on Drugs" and his stance in favor of drug decriminalization. Schmoke initiated programs in housing, education, public health and economic development. During his three terms in office Schmoke faced very serious challenges, including poor quality schools, drug addiction, and violent crime. Some of his controversial positions included advocating the decriminalization of drug use, and employing Nation of Islam security guards in a housing project. His achievements included improving the environment of low-income housing projects, a needle-exchange program for addicts, keeping the tax rate stable, and attracting the Ravens football team to Baltimore.[8]
In 1992, President George H. W. Bush awarded him the national Literacy Award for his efforts to promote adult literacy, and in 1994 President Bill Clinton cited Baltimore's programs to improve public housing and enhance community economic development and named Baltimore one of six cities to receive Empowerment Zone designation.[9] In 1997, Schmoke served as a committee member for the Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence.[10] After serving three terms as city mayor, Schmoke opted not to run for reelection in 1999.[11]
Advocacy for school choice and school vouchers[edit]
In 1999 Schmoke delivered some remarks on the subject of school choice and school vouchers at a Manhattan Institute luncheon in New York. An edited version of a transcript of that speech entitled "Why School Vouchers Can Help Inner-City Children" is available online[12] and in that brief web page, Schmoke explains why he believes [that] school choice and vouchers will improve the quality of public education for America’s youth, particularly inner-city minority children."
Schmoke first came out in support of school choice in a speech at Johns Hopkins University in March 1996.[12]
Life after politics[edit]
After leaving office in December 1999, Schmoke practiced law at the firm of Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering in Baltimore.[13] In 2003, Schmoke was appointed the dean of the Howard University School of Law in Washington, D.C. In 2004, Schmoke was appointed an honorary fellow of Balliol College, Oxford. He is also on the board of Global Rights, and a member of the Christian and Missionary Alliance. In 2008, Schmoke delivered the keynote lecture, “A New Hundred Years War? The Compelling Need to Reform National Drug Control Policy” for the Edward Bouchet Conference on Diversity in Graduate Education at Yale University.
He also appeared in two 2004 episodes of the acclaimed HBO series The Wire. The episodes, entitled "Middle Ground" and "Mission Accomplished", featured Schmoke in a bit part as a health commissioner.[14][15][16][17] He acts as an advisor to the fictional mayor after a rogue police major has legalized drugs in a portion of the city.[18] This is a reference to his own feelings on the drug war.
In July 2008 Kurt Schmoke became the acting Senior Vice President of Academic Matters at Howard University, a position that in effect made Schmoke provost for the university. Schmoke continued as Dean of the Howard University School of Law. It had been rumored he would be named the new president.[19] Schmoke also taught election law as a seminar class every fall semester to third year law students.
In January 2009, Schmoke was seen holding an umbrella for Illinois Senate designee Roland Burris during an outdoor press conference concerning Burris' seating controversy.[20] Schmoke was part of the legal team advising Burris during the controversy. Schmoke was appointed Vice President and General Counsel of Howard University in July 2012.[21] On May 14, 2014, the University of Baltimore announced that Schmoke would become its new president.[22]

Kurt L. Schmoke, interim provost and general counsel at Howard, is no stranger to Baltimore. He was a three-term mayor of the city from 1987 to 1999. In the past decade Schmoke has held a variety of positions at the historically black university in Northwest Washington, including law school dean. The school he will lead, starting in July, is part of the public University System of Maryland. The University of Baltimore, with about 6,500 students, has business and law schools and a college of public affairs. Its enrollment has grown by about a third since 2003, and its campus has expanded significantly in midtown Baltimore. A key development occurred in 2007 when the university admitted freshmen for the first time in more than 30 years, marking a return to four-year undergraduate education.

Kurt L. Schmoke to Head University of Baltimore

	Former Baltimore mayor Kurt L. Schmoke will assume the helm of the University of Baltimore in July, Maryland education officials announced May 14.
	Schmoke, 64, a native of Baltimore and product of its public schools, became Charm City’s first Black mayor in 1987. In his first inaugural address, Schmoke announced his intention to make Baltimore "The City That Reads" and he created a cabinet-level agency to direct adult literacy programs across the city.
	During his three-term tenure, he also successfully secured increased state funding for the city’s public schools and supported programs that assisted the growth of higher education institutions in the city. He also initiated several programs in the areas of housing, public health, community revitalization and economic development.
	"Kurt Schmoke has a wealth of higher education, legal, public policy, and community service experience that will serve the University of Baltimore and the University System of Maryland extremely well in the years ahead," said James L. Shea, chairman of the University System Maryland (USM) Board of Regents, in a statement. "With his knowledge of the City of Baltimore and the surrounding region, he will be able to have an immediate impact on enhancing opportunities for students, faculty, staff, and the city. The Board of Regents is confident that he will be an effective and successful leader."
	After deciding not to run for reelection in 1999, Schmoke—a Rhodes Scholar who holds degrees from Yale University and Harvard Law School—returned to private law practice. He also served in several capacities at Howard University over the past 11 years: He served as dean of the Howard University School of Law from 2003-2012 and currently is interim provost and general counsel at the famed historically Black university.
	"I am thrilled and honored to be selected as the next president of the University of Baltimore, an outstanding higher education institution located in a great city and a great state,” Schmoke said in a statement. “Offering a high quality education at an affordable cost has been a hallmark of the university, and I am committed to continuing that tradition. I look forward to working with faculty, students, staff, alumni, and friends to make a great university even greater."
	Howard Interim President Wayne A. I. Frederick, in a letter to the school’s community, thanked Schmoke for his many contrbutions and said his appointment “fulfill[s] Howard’s desire to disperse our talents around the nation and the world.”
	“The Howard family thanks him for his extraordinary service to our University and true commitment to our students, faculty, staff and alumni. We wish him tremendous success,” the letter read.
	Schmoke’s appointment follows an extensive six-month search, after UB’s current president Robert Bogomolny announced he would retire this summer. In his 12-year tenure as president, Bogomolny oversaw the revival of the school’s four-year undergraduate program and redevelopment of the school’s infrastructure and that of the surrounding neighborhoods.

	Officials say they believe Schmoke is the right person to carry that torch.
	"Kurt Schmoke has an outstanding record of accomplishments and he understands that the University of Baltimore's mission is closely aligned with the advancement of the city," said William E. Kirwan, chancellor of the University System of Maryland. "He is interested in pursuing even more UB collaborations with the city and the region. Furthermore, he wants to build on the university's momentum made possible by the academic, infrastructure, and fundraising enhancements of the last several years."

Kurt L. Schmoke, born in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1949, came from a middle class background.  His father, Murray, a civilian chemist for the U.S. Army, was a graduate of Morehouse College, and his mother, Irene was a social worker. Schmoke attended the city's prestigious public high school, Baltimore City College, winning both academic and athletic distinctions, and leading his school to a state championship in football.  Schmoke entered Yale University in 1967 and three years later, he acted as a student leader to help defuse a crisis in 1970 over the New Haven murder trial of Black Panther Bobby Seale.  After graduating from Yale, Schmoke studied as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University.  In 1976 he graduated from Harvard Law School.  Following a brief career in Washington, D.C., serving on the White House Domestic Policy Staff and at the Department of Transportation during the Administration of President Jimmy Carter, he returned to Baltimore and was elected to the position of State's Attorney in 1982, and five years later he won the election for mayor of Baltimore.    

His opponent in the first mayoral race was an African American incumbent, Clarence Burns who had been chosen by the former white mayor, William Donald Schaefer, when he left office upon his election as Governor of Maryland.  Incumbent Burns, who ran on Schaefer's record, emphasized the spectacular development of the Inner Harbor area, which had been transformed from a dilapidated waterfront into a glittering tourist attraction.  Claiming that Baltimore had become "prettier but poorer," Schaefer focused on other areas of the city, particularly the black community, and at the age of 38 won a very close election.   Schmoke would win reelection twice, serving as mayor of Baltimore for twelve years from 1987 to 1999.

During his three terms in office Schmoke faced typical big-city problems, including poor quality schools, drug addiction, and violent crime.  Some of his controversial positions included advocating the decriminalization of drug use, and employing Nation of Islam security guards in a housing project.   His achievements included improving the environment of low-income housing projects, a needle-exchange program for addicts, keeping the tax rate stable, and attracting the Ravens football team to Baltimore.  Despite his achievements, Schmoke acquired a reputation as a bland technocrat, not an inspiring leader.  Declining to run for a fourth term, he accepted a position in 1999 with the Baltimore office of the law firm of Wilmer, Cutler and Pickering.

In 2003 Kurt Schmoke became Dean of the Howard University School of Law.  He assumed his duties as the 50th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court's 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education was approaching, and led the school in playing a major part in the national commemorations.  Schmoke continued to be influential in Maryland politics.  In 2005, when he supported the gubernatorial candidacy of Montgomery County Executive Douglas Duncan, speculation arose about his own plans to run as U.S. Senator.   After the semi centennial of Brown v. Board, he continued to keep the School of Law in a leadership position through the appointment of prominent faculty, as well as his own activities, including leading the preparation of Howard's amicus curiae brief in the University of Michigan affirmative action case Grutter v. Bollinger in 2003, and assisting in the defense of Mychal Bell, one of the six youths on trial in Jena, Louisiana, in June of 2007.

Product Description


Abstract:The newly elected mayor of Baltimore, faced with both serious budget problems and a campaign pledge to increase funding for the city's school system, decides to save money by doing what previous mayors have tried to do and failed: close several of the city's older fire stations widely considered to be unnecessary, given the capabilities of modern fire fighting apparatus. As a black mayor poised to close stations in white working-class neighborhoods, however, Schmoke must decide how to make the news public. Among his options: an address to the city at large; a message to the city council; an announcement by the fire chief. This case about communication as an aspect of political strategy is followed by the B case, which raises issues about how elected officials should respond to interest groups-in this case, protests led by neighborhoods aggrieved by the fire station closings.

Petition ClosedPetitioning University of Baltimore President, Kurt L. SchmokeDecision makersKurt L. SchmokeUniversity of Baltimore President,Focus on the LAW at UBLawAlison Rajk Baltimore, MDAlison RajkBaltimore, MD201SupportersThe students of the University of Baltimore School of Law have made it clear that the purpose of our law school building seems to have been lost somewhere during its first three years of operation.  It’s understood amongst the students of UB Law that our building must remain accessible to the public.  However, it is a point of confusion for many, if not all, students as to why the importance of public access is superior to the importance of law students being able to safely and comfortably pursue our legal education.
Our building is open to the public to help facilitate the access of students, faculty, clinic clients, guests, and law library users.  It is not a public restroom.  It is not a public hang out space.  It is not a space for people to congregate just because it’s cold outside.  It is not a place for people to come to when they are tired and want to nap. 
As a student body, we should be able to come to school and feel safe.  We should be able to access our school building, a place we utilize for furthering our educational and professional pursuits, without feeling uncomfortable or insecure.
It is time that the University of Baltimore recognizes that the focus of this building must be the safety, security, and success of its law students – anything less is insufficient and not conducive to the study of law here at the University.
I am only one student of hundreds here at the University of Baltimore School of Law.  I am only one student, but I am not the only student who feels that the security issues in our building need to be reassessed.  So here I am, a single student, willing to speak on behalf of my fellow students, to encourage taking the steps toward necessary and meaningful change – change that will benefit all students - past, present, and future.
We need to make this building safer, and in order to do that I need your help.  It is my goal to make this building a safer and more comfortable learning environment for everyone.  I believe that the best way to do this is by regulating public access to the building at all times.  I believe that the most reasonable way to regulate public access is to make it mandatory that all people entering the building must be asked to show photo identification during business hours.  After business hours, I would like to see that the building be restricted to Bee Card access only. 
Please sign this petition to show your support for making our law school building a safer place to be.  It’s time we as a student body make our concerns and opinions known to the decision makers here at the University of Baltimore.

Early years[edit]
Schmoke was born and raised in Baltimore to Murray Schmoke, a civilian chemist for the US Army, and Irene B. Reid, a social worker. He attended the public schools of Baltimore.
High school[edit]
Schmoke attended the Baltimore City College, the third oldest high school in the United States and the largest high school in Maryland at the time of his graduation in 1967. Schmoke excelled in both football and lacrosse. His speed afoot and his passing accuracy won him the starting job as the junior varsity and later varsity quarterback. As the varsity quarterback, he led the City Knights to two undefeated seasons and successive Maryland Scholastic Association A-conference championships in 1965 and 1966.
As a student, Schmoke was a member of the Baltimore City College "A-course", a college preparatory curriculum that required him to take Latin and other advanced studies not offered to the average Baltimore high school student. Schmoke was elected president of the school's student government in his senior year but also worked in the Baltimore community with disadvantaged youth. Compulsory community service had not yet been mandated for Baltimore high school students, yet he tutored and mentored young men from the inner city as a member of the Lancers Boys Club.[1]
College and graduate school[edit]
Schmoke entered Yale University in the fall of 1967. He played quarterback on the freshman team that year. While at Yale, Schmoke and his classmates started a day care center on campus for the children of the university's janitors and cafeteria workers who lived in New Haven. The center was named after Calvin Hill, a former Yale football star who became a star running back for the Dallas Cowboys, and still stands today.[2]
Schmoke has been acknowledged as the undergraduate student leader who helped quell the possibility of riot on the Yale campus in the wake of the New Haven Black Panther trials in the spring of 1970. As New Haven filled with radical protesters, Yale students demanded the suspension of classes. A bitterly divided faculty met to discuss strategy, and invited a student leader to address the gathering. Schmoke, who was Secretary of the Class of 1971 and a leader of the Black Student Alliance at Yale, was selected to represent the students.[3] He spoke only a few sentences: "The students on this campus are confused, they're frightened. They don't know what to think. You are older than we are, and are more experienced. We want guidance from you, moral leadership. On behalf of my fellow students, I beg you to give it to us."[4] This moment is credited with helping to dispel the growing tensions: the university voted to bend its rules, making classes "voluntarily optional" to the end of the term, and despite small outbreaks of violence, no campus-wide unrest resulted.
After graduating from Yale with a degree in history in 1971,[5] Schmoke studied as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University, and graduated from Harvard Law School in 1976.
Schmoke was selected with five other distinguished former collegiate student-athletes for a Silver Anniversary Award by the NCAA in 1996.
Early career[edit]
After graduating from Harvard Law School, Schmoke joined the Baltimore law firm of Piper and Marbury. In 1977, he was selected to be part of the White House Domestic Policy Staff during the Carter Administration to work in the Department of Transportation. However, after only one year working in President Carter's administration, Schmoke returned to Baltimore to serve as the Assistant United States Attorney, a position he held from 1978 to 1981.[6]
Elective office[edit]




Schmoke and Curt Anderson in 1982 as they both launch their political careers


In 1982 Schmoke ran for his first elected office. He challenged incumbent Baltimore City State's Attorney William A. Swisher in a citywide contest. Swisher had won the job away from Milton B. Allen, Baltimore's first African American State's Attorney. Schmoke ran an energetic, grassroots and race-neutral campaign and upset Swisher in a landslide.[7]
On November 3, 1987, he was elected mayor. As mayor, he became known for his opposition to the "War on Drugs" and his stance in favor of drug decriminalization. Schmoke initiated programs in housing, education, public health and economic development. During his three terms in office Schmoke faced very serious challenges, including poor quality schools, drug addiction, and violent crime. Some of his controversial positions included advocating the decriminalization of drug use, and employing Nation of Islam security guards in a housing project. His achievements included improving the environment of low-income housing projects, a needle-exchange program for addicts, keeping the tax rate stable, and attracting the Ravens football team to Baltimore.[8]
In 1992, President George H. W. Bush awarded him the national Literacy Award for his efforts to promote adult literacy, and in 1994 President Bill Clinton cited Baltimore's programs to improve public housing and enhance community economic development and named Baltimore one of six cities to receive Empowerment Zone designation.[9] In 1997, Schmoke served as a committee member for the Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence.[10] After serving three terms as city mayor, Schmoke opted not to run for reelection in 1999.[11]
Advocacy for school choice and school vouchers[edit]
In 1999 Schmoke delivered some remarks on the subject of school choice and school vouchers at a Manhattan Institute luncheon in New York. An edited version of a transcript of that speech entitled "Why School Vouchers Can Help Inner-City Children" is available online[12] and in that brief web page, Schmoke explains why he believes [that] school choice and vouchers will improve the quality of public education for America’s youth, particularly inner-city minority children."
Schmoke first came out in support of school choice in a speech at Johns Hopkins University in March 1996.[12]
Life after politics[edit]
After leaving office in December 1999, Schmoke practiced law at the firm of Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering in Baltimore.[13] In 2003, Schmoke was appointed the dean of the Howard University School of Law in Washington, D.C. In 2004, Schmoke was appointed an honorary fellow of Balliol College, Oxford. He is also on the board of Global Rights, and a member of the Christian and Missionary Alliance. In 2008, Schmoke delivered the keynote lecture, “A New Hundred Years War? The Compelling Need to Reform National Drug Control Policy” for the Edward Bouchet Conference on Diversity in Graduate Education at Yale University.
He also appeared in two 2004 episodes of the acclaimed HBO series The Wire. The episodes, entitled "Middle Ground" and "Mission Accomplished", featured Schmoke in a bit part as a health commissioner.[14][15][16][17] He acts as an advisor to the fictional mayor after a rogue police major has legalized drugs in a portion of the city.[18] This is a reference to his own feelings on the drug war.
In July 2008 Kurt Schmoke became the acting Senior Vice President of Academic Matters at Howard University, a position that in effect made Schmoke provost for the university. Schmoke continued as Dean of the Howard University School of Law. It had been rumored he would be named the new president.[19] Schmoke also taught election law as a seminar class every fall semester to third year law students.
In January 2009, Schmoke was seen holding an umbrella for Illinois Senate designee Roland Burris during an outdoor press conference concerning Burris' seating controversy.[20] Schmoke was part of the legal team advising Burris during the controversy. Schmoke was appointed Vice President and General Counsel of Howard University in July 2012.[21] On May 14, 2014, the University of Baltimore announced that Schmoke would become its new president.[22]

Early years[edit]
Schmoke was born and raised in Baltimore to Murray Schmoke, a civilian chemist for the US Army, and Irene B. Reid, a social worker. He attended the public schools of Baltimore.
High school[edit]
Schmoke attended the Baltimore City College, the third oldest high school in the United States and the largest high school in Maryland at the time of his graduation in 1967. Schmoke excelled in both football and lacrosse. His speed afoot and his passing accuracy won him the starting job as the junior varsity and later varsity quarterback. As the varsity quarterback, he led the City Knights to two undefeated seasons and successive Maryland Scholastic Association A-conference championships in 1965 and 1966.
As a student, Schmoke was a member of the Baltimore City College "A-course", a college preparatory curriculum that required him to take Latin and other advanced studies not offered to the average Baltimore high school student. Schmoke was elected president of the school's student government in his senior year but also worked in the Baltimore community with disadvantaged youth. Compulsory community service had not yet been mandated for Baltimore high school students, yet he tutored and mentored young men from the inner city as a member of the Lancers Boys Club.[1]
College and graduate school[edit]
Schmoke entered Yale University in the fall of 1967. He played quarterback on the freshman team that year. While at Yale, Schmoke and his classmates started a day care center on campus for the children of the university's janitors and cafeteria workers who lived in New Haven. The center was named after Calvin Hill, a former Yale football star who became a star running back for the Dallas Cowboys, and still stands today.[2]
Schmoke has been acknowledged as the undergraduate student leader who helped quell the possibility of riot on the Yale campus in the wake of the New Haven Black Panther trials in the spring of 1970. As New Haven filled with radical protesters, Yale students demanded the suspension of classes. A bitterly divided faculty met to discuss strategy, and invited a student leader to address the gathering. Schmoke, who was Secretary of the Class of 1971 and a leader of the Black Student Alliance at Yale, was selected to represent the students.[3] He spoke only a few sentences: "The students on this campus are confused, they're frightened. They don't know what to think. You are older than we are, and are more experienced. We want guidance from you, moral leadership. On behalf of my fellow students, I beg you to give it to us."[4] This moment is credited with helping to dispel the growing tensions: the university voted to bend its rules, making classes "voluntarily optional" to the end of the term, and despite small outbreaks of violence, no campus-wide unrest resulted.
After graduating from Yale with a degree in history in 1971,[5] Schmoke studied as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University, and graduated from Harvard Law School in 1976.
Schmoke was selected with five other distinguished former collegiate student-athletes for a Silver Anniversary Award by the NCAA in 1996.
Early career[edit]
After graduating from Harvard Law School, Schmoke joined the Baltimore law firm of Piper and Marbury. In 1977, he was selected to be part of the White House Domestic Policy Staff during the Carter Administration to work in the Department of Transportation. However, after only one year working in President Carter's administration, Schmoke returned to Baltimore to serve as the Assistant United States Attorney, a position he held from 1978 to 1981.[6]
Elective office[edit]




Schmoke and Curt Anderson in 1982 as they both launch their political careers


In 1982 Schmoke ran for his first elected office. He challenged incumbent Baltimore City State's Attorney William A. Swisher in a citywide contest. Swisher had won the job away from Milton B. Allen, Baltimore's first African American State's Attorney. Schmoke ran an energetic, grassroots and race-neutral campaign and upset Swisher in a landslide.[7]
On November 3, 1987, he was elected mayor. As mayor, he became known for his opposition to the "War on Drugs" and his stance in favor of drug decriminalization. Schmoke initiated programs in housing, education, public health and economic development. During his three terms in office Schmoke faced very serious challenges, including poor quality schools, drug addiction, and violent crime. Some of his controversial positions included advocating the decriminalization of drug use, and employing Nation of Islam security guards in a housing project. His achievements included improving the environment of low-income housing projects, a needle-exchange program for addicts, keeping the tax rate stable, and attracting the Ravens football team to Baltimore.[8]
In 1992, President George H. W. Bush awarded him the national Literacy Award for his efforts to promote adult literacy, and in 1994 President Bill Clinton cited Baltimore's programs to improve public housing and enhance community economic development and named Baltimore one of six cities to receive Empowerment Zone designation.[9] In 1997, Schmoke served as a committee member for the Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence.[10] After serving three terms as city mayor, Schmoke opted not to run for reelection in 1999.[11]
Advocacy for school choice and school vouchers[edit]
In 1999 Schmoke delivered some remarks on the subject of school choice and school vouchers at a Manhattan Institute luncheon in New York. An edited version of a transcript of that speech entitled "Why School Vouchers Can Help Inner-City Children" is available online[12] and in that brief web page, Schmoke explains why he believes [that] school choice and vouchers will improve the quality of public education for America’s youth, particularly inner-city minority children."
Schmoke first came out in support of school choice in a speech at Johns Hopkins University in March 1996.[12]
Life after politics[edit]
After leaving office in December 1999, Schmoke practiced law at the firm of Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering in Baltimore.[13] In 2003, Schmoke was appointed the dean of the Howard University School of Law in Washington, D.C. In 2004, Schmoke was appointed an honorary fellow of Balliol College, Oxford. He is also on the board of Global Rights, and a member of the Christian and Missionary Alliance. In 2008, Schmoke delivered the keynote lecture, “A New Hundred Years War? The Compelling Need to Reform National Drug Control Policy” for the Edward Bouchet Conference on Diversity in Graduate Education at Yale University.
He also appeared in two 2004 episodes of the acclaimed HBO series The Wire. The episodes, entitled "Middle Ground" and "Mission Accomplished", featured Schmoke in a bit part as a health commissioner.[14][15][16][17] He acts as an advisor to the fictional mayor after a rogue police major has legalized drugs in a portion of the city.[18] This is a reference to his own feelings on the drug war.
In July 2008 Kurt Schmoke became the acting Senior Vice President of Academic Matters at Howard University, a position that in effect made Schmoke provost for the university. Schmoke continued as Dean of the Howard University School of Law. It had been rumored he would be named the new president.[19] Schmoke also taught election law as a seminar class every fall semester to third year law students.
In January 2009, Schmoke was seen holding an umbrella for Illinois Senate designee Roland Burris during an outdoor press conference concerning Burris' seating controversy.[20] Schmoke was part of the legal team advising Burris during the controversy. Schmoke was appointed Vice President and General Counsel of Howard University in July 2012.[21] On May 14, 2014, the University of Baltimore announced that Schmoke would become its new president.[22]

Early years[edit]
Schmoke was born and raised in Baltimore to Murray Schmoke, a civilian chemist for the US Army, and Irene B. Reid, a social worker. He attended the public schools of Baltimore.
High school[edit]
Schmoke attended the Baltimore City College, the third oldest high school in the United States and the largest high school in Maryland at the time of his graduation in 1967. Schmoke excelled in both football and lacrosse. His speed afoot and his passing accuracy won him the starting job as the junior varsity and later varsity quarterback. As the varsity quarterback, he led the City Knights to two undefeated seasons and successive Maryland Scholastic Association A-conference championships in 1965 and 1966.
As a student, Schmoke was a member of the Baltimore City College "A-course", a college preparatory curriculum that required him to take Latin and other advanced studies not offered to the average Baltimore high school student. Schmoke was elected president of the school's student government in his senior year but also worked in the Baltimore community with disadvantaged youth. Compulsory community service had not yet been mandated for Baltimore high school students, yet he tutored and mentored young men from the inner city as a member of the Lancers Boys Club.[1]
College and graduate school[edit]
Schmoke entered Yale University in the fall of 1967. He played quarterback on the freshman team that year. While at Yale, Schmoke and his classmates started a day care center on campus for the children of the university's janitors and cafeteria workers who lived in New Haven. The center was named after Calvin Hill, a former Yale football star who became a star running back for the Dallas Cowboys, and still stands today.[2]
Schmoke has been acknowledged as the undergraduate student leader who helped quell the possibility of riot on the Yale campus in the wake of the New Haven Black Panther trials in the spring of 1970. As New Haven filled with radical protesters, Yale students demanded the suspension of classes. A bitterly divided faculty met to discuss strategy, and invited a student leader to address the gathering. Schmoke, who was Secretary of the Class of 1971 and a leader of the Black Student Alliance at Yale, was selected to represent the students.[3] He spoke only a few sentences: "The students on this campus are confused, they're frightened.

After graduating from Yale with a degree in history in 1971,[5] Schmoke studied as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University, and graduated from Harvard Law School in 1976.
Schmoke was selected with five other distinguished former collegiate student-athletes for a Silver Anniversary Award by the NCAA in 1996.
Early career[edit]
After graduating from Harvard Law School, Schmoke joined the Baltimore law firm of Piper and Marbury. In 1977, he was selected to be part of the White House Domestic Policy Staff during the Carter Administration to work in the Department of Transportation. However, after only one year working in President Carter's administration, Schmoke returned to Baltimore to serve as the Assistant United States Attorney, a position he held from 1978 to 1981.[6]
Elective office[edit]




Schmoke and Curt Anderson in 1982 as they both launch their political careers


In 1982 Schmoke ran for his first elected office. He challenged incumbent Baltimore City State's Attorney William A. Swisher in a citywide contest. Swisher had won the job away from Milton B. Allen, Baltimore's first African American State's Attorney. Schmoke ran an energetic, grassroots and race-neutral campaign and upset Swisher in a landslide.[7]
On November 3, 1987, he was elected mayor. As mayor, he became known for his opposition to the "War on Drugs" and his stance in favor of drug decriminalization. Schmoke initiated programs in housing, education, public health and economic development. During his three terms in office Schmoke faced very serious challenges, including poor quality schools, drug addiction, and violent crime. Some of his controversial positions included advocating the decriminalization of drug use, and employing Nation of Islam security guards in a housing project. His achievements included improving the environment of low-income housing projects, a needle-exchange program for addicts, keeping the tax rate stable, and attracting the Ravens football team to Baltimore.[8]
In 1992, President George H. W. Bush awarded him the national Literacy Award for his efforts to promote adult literacy, and in 1994 President Bill Clinton cited Baltimore's programs to improve public housing and enhance community economic development and named Baltimore one of six cities to receive Empowerment Zone designation.[9] In 1997, Schmoke served as a committee member for the Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence.[10] After serving three terms as city mayor, Schmoke opted not to run for reelection in 1999.[11]
Advocacy for school choice and school vouchers[edit]
In 1999 Schmoke delivered some remarks on the subject of school choice and school vouchers at a Manhattan Institute luncheon in New York. An edited version of a transcript of that speech entitled "Why School Vouchers Can Help Inner-City Children" is available online[12] and in that brief web page, Schmoke explains why he believes [that] school choice and vouchers will improve the quality of public education for America’s youth, particularly inner-city minority children."
Schmoke first came out in support of school choice in a speech at Johns Hopkins University in March 1996.[12]
Life after politics[edit]
After leaving office in December 1999, Schmoke practiced law at the firm of Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering in Baltimore.[13] In 2003, Schmoke was appointed the dean of the Howard University School of Law in Washington, D.C. In 2004, Schmoke was appointed an honorary fellow of Balliol College, Oxford. He is also on the board of Global Rights, and a member of the Christian and Missionary Alliance. In 2008, Schmoke delivered the keynote lecture, “A New Hundred Years War? The Compelling Need to Reform National Drug Control Policy” for the Edward Bouchet Conference on Diversity in Graduate Education at Yale University.
He also appeared in two 2004 episodes of the acclaimed HBO series The Wire. The episodes, entitled "Middle Ground" and "Mission Accomplished", featured Schmoke in a bit part as a health commissioner.[14][15][16][17] He acts as an advisor to the fictional mayor after a rogue police major has legalized drugs in a portion of the city.[18] This is a reference to his own feelings on the drug war.
In July 2008 Kurt Schmoke became the acting Senior Vice President of Academic Matters at Howard University, a position that in effect made Schmoke provost for the university. Schmoke continued as Dean of the Howard University School of Law. It had been rumored he would be named the new president.[19] Schmoke also taught election law as a seminar class every fall semester to third year law students.
In January 2009, Schmoke was seen holding an umbrella for Illinois Senate designee Roland Burris during an outdoor press conference concerning Burris' seating controversy.[20] Schmoke was part of the legal team advising Burris during the controversy. Schmoke was appointed Vice President and General Counsel of Howard University in July 2012.[21] On May 14, 2014, the University of Baltimore announced that Schmoke would become its new president.[22]

Early years[edit]
Schmoke was born and raised in Baltimore to Murray Schmoke, a civilian chemist for the US Army, and Irene B. Reid, a social worker. He attended the public schools of Baltimore.
High school[edit]
Schmoke attended the Baltimore City College, the third oldest high school in the United States and the largest high school in Maryland at the time of his graduation in 1967. Schmoke excelled in both football and lacrosse. His speed afoot and his passing accuracy won him the starting job as the junior varsity and later varsity quarterback. As the varsity quarterback, he led the City Knights to two undefeated seasons and successive Maryland Scholastic Association A-conference championships in 1965 and 1966.
As a student, Schmoke was a member of the Baltimore City College "A-course", a college preparatory curriculum that required him to take Latin and other advanced studies not offered to the average Baltimore high school student. Schmoke was elected president of the school's student government in his senior year but also worked in the Baltimore community with disadvantaged youth. Compulsory community service had not yet been mandated for Baltimore high school students, yet he tutored and mentored young men from the inner city as a member of the Lancers Boys Club.[1]
College and graduate school[edit]
Schmoke entered Yale University in the fall of 1967. He played quarterback on the freshman team that year. While at Yale, Schmoke and his classmates started a day care center on campus for the children of the university's janitors and cafeteria workers who lived in New Haven. The center was named after Calvin Hill, a former Yale football star who became a star running back for the Dallas Cowboys, and still stands today.[2]
Schmoke has been acknowledged as the undergraduate student leader who helped quell the possibility of riot on the Yale campus in the wake of the New Haven Black Panther trials in the spring of 1970. As New Haven filled with radical protesters, Yale students demanded the suspension of classes. A bitterly divided faculty met to discuss strategy, and invited a student leader to address the gathering. Schmoke, who was Secretary of the Class of 1971 and a leader of the Black Student Alliance at Yale, was selected to represent the students.[3] He spoke only a few sentences: "The students on this campus are confused, they're frightened. They don't know what to think. You are older than we are, and are more experienced. We want guidance from you, moral leadership. On behalf of my fellow students, I beg you to give it to us."[4] This moment is credited with helping to dispel the growing tensions: the university voted to bend its rules, making classes "voluntarily optional" to the end of the term, and despite small outbreaks of violence, no campus-wide unrest resulted.
After graduating from Yale with a degree in history in 1971,[5] Schmoke studied as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University, and graduated from Harvard Law School in 1976.
Schmoke was selected with five other distinguished former collegiate student-athletes for a Silver Anniversary Award by the NCAA in 1996.
Early career[edit]
After graduating from Harvard Law School, Schmoke joined the Baltimore law firm of Piper and Marbury. In 1977, he was selected to be part of the White House Domestic Policy Staff during the Carter Administration to work in the Department of Transportation. However, after only one year working in President Carter's administration, Schmoke returned to Baltimore to serve as the Assistant United States Attorney, a position he held from 1978 to 1981.[6]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
