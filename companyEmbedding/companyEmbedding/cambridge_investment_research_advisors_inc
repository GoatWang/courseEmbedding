About Cambridge



Our Purpose and Values




Fast Facts




The Fee Experts and the Hybrid Model




Our Plan for Private Ownership




Innovators. Problem Solvers. Game Changers










About Cambridge
Cambridge Investment Group, Inc. is a privately-controlled financial solutions firm focused on serving independent financial advisors and their investing clients. Cambridge is also a national corporation with a registered investment advisor as well as an industry leading independent broker-dealer.
Cambridge’s national reach includes: Cambridge Investment Research Advisors, Inc. – a large corporate RIA; and Cambridge Investment Research, Inc. – an independent broker-dealer, member FINRA/SIPC, that is among the largest privately-controlled independent broker-dealers in the country. Overall, Cambridge supports several thousand independent financial professionals nationwide who serve their hundreds of thousands of clients as registered representatives and investment advisor representatives, choosing to use either Cambridge’s firm Registered Investment Adviser or their own. 
Our purpose is to make a difference in the lives of our advisors, their clients, and our associates. We will do this by continuously improving and refining our competitive differentiation, unique culture, customizable experience, and superior quality.
Broker dealer of the year
Cambridge has been honored by the votes of our advisors as ‘Broker Dealer of the Year’ a total of nine times for 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, 2010, 2008, 2007, and 2003 per Investment Advisor ¹ magazine; and was ranked 10th in the ‘2016 FP50 IBD Revenue Growth’ by Financial Planning magazine.² We have also earned an overall average of 9 out of 10 from our advisors based on Cambridge’s Annual Advisor Satisfaction Survey over the last 18 years.
Top workplace
As an industry leader, we strive to create a workplace that reflects our four core values of integrity, commitment, flexibility, and kindness while fostering an atmosphere that allows our associates to thrive and enjoy our mutual success. Cambridge is also among the top 25 large companies honored as a ‘Top Workplace in Iowa’ for 2016, and is one of only 13 companies consecutively ranked among the Top Workplaces since the ranking began in 2011 by the Des Moines Register³.
Culture counts and values matter most
We believe a firm's culture influences its reputation. We think you can take a hard look at a firm's stated mission and values and compare that to how the firm's management and staff engage with advisors and manage business activity. Since our earliest days, our management and associates have been committed to our core values of integrity, commitment, flexibility, and kindness; and these values guide our decisions and shape our efforts on behalf of independent financial professionals and their investing clients. We are proud that independent financial professionals who share our purpose and are dedicated to our values choose Cambridge.
Stability and independence
Honored to be among the most respected firms in the industry, Cambridge remains strong and growing – in part due to our conservative financial strategies and the disciplined efforts of financial professionals in their independent businesses. More importantly, we believe our long-term success is largely due to the appeal of moderate business practices and traditional values.
Cambridge is financially sound, has been consistently profitable for nearly 20 years, and maintains a strong commitment to providing resources and support that help independent financial professionals serve the needs of their investing clients. Cambridge has net excess capital and our debt consists mostly of mortgages on our 80,000 square foot corporate headquarters. We are privately owned by our associates, management, and advisors; and our leadership has spent over 20 years consciously building a structure to ensure we can control our future so independent financial professionals can better control their own destinies and their businesses.
Maintaining flexibility and preserving choice
Cambridge’s financial solutions are designed to provide a menu of choices for the independent financial professional as they choose the customizable experience that best meets their objectives for their business and the needs of their investing clients. To best support independent financial professionals and their clients, we continue to support traditional commission options while significantly expanding our flexibility and footprint within the advisory segment as we focus our innovation efforts on fees. At Cambridge, we believe investment advice and financial and retirement planning guidance may be based on compensation in the form of fees, commissions, or both, with an independent financial professional continuing to focus on providing advice and guidance aligned with the client’s best interests.
Innovation in financial solutions
Long recognized as a pioneer of the hybrid fees and commissions model, our continual drive for innovative solutions means we are at the forefront of succession and acquisition planning while proactively transforming services and business processes with a visionary view on regulatory change, product evolution, increasing client demands, and opportunities in the marketplace. Cambridge is also actively seeking and supporting Next Gen talent for the advice industry; and this includes The Next Step® internship program focused on professional careers for aspiring professionals ranging from corporate headquarters to advisor office leadership roles.
You control the journey®
At Cambridge, we know advisors need to chart a course that works best for them and their investing clients. The independent financial professional is the pilot, but Cambridge stands ready to offer guidance and choices that includes advisor-focused financial solutions:

Succession and acquisition financial lending plus business technology expertise
Advice solutions for both asset management and financial planning with portfolio overlay management
Platform choices comprised of a corporate RIA or independent RIA for dual registration or fee only business models
A full spectrum of middle office services designed for solo/ensembles, branches, and super branches
Outsource services centered on independent advisor firms, including business consulting, client marketing, and office assistance, as well insurance services

At Cambridge, we are business innovators, financial planners, wealth advisors, business builders, next generation, retirement planners, visionaries, investment advisors, succession planners, entrepreneurs, and business owners. We believe clients come first, and we all need the freedom to customize our business, our way, to best serve our clients.
We believe every journey is important

Cambridge received the highest marks from its rep-advisors in the Investment Advisor Broker-Dealer of the Year 2016 Division IV category.

The broker-dealers receiving the highest marks in each of four divisions are declared Broker-Dealer of the Year by Investment Advisor magazine.

		Recovering Losses
		Caused By Investment Misconduct





Cambridge Investment Research, Inc. Investment Losses
Recover your losses caused by Cambridge Investment Research!

	Cambridge Investment Research, Inc. is a privately-owned broker-dealer
	 that offers products such as
	mutual funds, money management platforms,
	equity indexed annuities, college savings plans, certificate of deposits, and life insurance services.
	 In business for over 28 years, Cambridge is headquartered in Fairfield,
	 Iowa and supports over 1,600 representatives/advisors.

A securities brokerage firm licensed by FINRA, Cambridge Investment Research,
	 Inc. has a legal duty to supervise its brokers and its brokers' recommendations
	 to clients to ensure compliance with and prevent violations of the rules
	 of the security industry. When an individual broker is negligent or acts
	 in an unlawful manner against the interests of the client and that client
	 suffers damages as a result of such wrongdoing, the firm may be held liable
	 for the investor's losses.
Misconduct Claims Against Cambridge Investment Research
Do you have a claim against Cambridge Investment Research? Like any other
	 broker-dealer firm or financial advisor, Cambridge Investment Research
	 is required to abide by securities industry regulations. If they fail
	 to do so, a regulatory agency like FINRA or the SEC can penalize them
	 with a fine or required restitution. Brokers can even be permanently barred
	 from the securities industry.

	One of the more common claims against brokerage firms and stockbrokers is
	failure to supervise. Financial advisors have a duty to perform adequate supervision of their
	 clients' investment portfolios. If they fail to do so, the investor
	 can suffer substantial losses. Similarly, investment firms can fail to
	 supervise their registered brokers or fail to have adequate supervisory
	 systems in place so operations run smoothly and according to industry
	 regulations.


	Another common type of investment misconduct is
	misrepresentation. When a stockbroker fails to mention vital information or they omit certain
	 other pertinent pieces of information, investors can suffer. If you believe
	 your financial advisor failed to inform you of something and you lost
	 a significant amount of money because of it, you may have a misrepresentation
	 or omission claim.

This is by no means a comprehensive list of the types of investment fraud
	 Cambridge Investment Research and its registered advisors could be guilty
	 of. If you suspect that something is wrong but you aren't quite sure
	 what, we encourage you to contact our firm for a free consultation.
Discuss Your Case with Our Securities Fraud Attorneys
It takes considerable resources, both professional and financial, to pursue
	 claims against investment firms like Cambridge Investment Research, Inc.
	 Meyer Wilson’s investment loss attorneys possess those resources
	 because we have collectively spent over 50 years exclusively practicing
	 in the field of securities fraud and arbitration. We conduct careful investigations
	 and aggressively pursue claims against firms like Cambridge Investment
	 in federal- and state-level courts, as well as in arbitration with the
	 Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the American Arbitration
	 Authority (AAA), and private arbitration. Our efforts allowed us to reclaim
	 over $350 million for our clients.

	Meyer Wilson securities fraud and arbitration lawyers are here to recover
	 investor losses, so to determine whether you have a case against Cambridge
	 Investment Research, Inc. for your losses, call us or complete our online
	 form for a
	free case evaluation.

Securities Fraud Litigation in California: For Investors
One of the most debilitating and infuriating losses one can sustain is when they have been duped or defrauded by a person in a position of fiduciary duty, namely their investment adviser or stockbroker. If you have been defrauded, or suspect that you have been defrauded, by your investment adviser, a stockbroker, or a brokerage firm, there are steps you can take to recover your losses. If you are not versed in securities fraud litigation and the relevant laws relating to securities fraud, the first step to take is to contact an experienced, qualified investment and securities fraud attorney who can recognize the telltale signs of fraud and advise you of your legal options.
Successfully Recovering Investors' Cash
At The Law Offices of Jonathan W. Evans & Associates, we have almost 60 years of combined experience practicing law, and 35 years of serving clients who have sustained losses due to securities fraud in California. We have successfully filed suit against some of the largest brokerage firms, investment brokers and stockbrokers and recovered millions of dollars for our clients, including Merrill Lynch, J.P. Morgan Securities, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, and many others. See for yourself the list of some of our recoveries in cases that we have won for our clients in the past.
If a broker fails to properly manage your account, the brokerage fails to supervise your broker properly, your broker is guilty of negligence, recommending unsuitable securities, misrepresentation, theft, unauthorized trading, selling away, churning, or a breach of their fiduciary duty, you may have a case. We are dedicated to our clients and passionate about defending the rights of those who have been defrauded and taking action in securities litigation or arbitration. The worst thing one can do is wait to talk with a qualified securities fraud attorney when facing losses due to fraud.

California Securities Fraud Attorney
Investment Fraud and Securities Arbitration
At The Law Offices of Jonathan W. Evans & Associates, we provide experienced legal counsel to individuals, trusts, estates, and others who have suffered significant financial losses through the illegal activities of brokerage firms, financial advisors and stockbrokers. Practicing law since 1975, our founding attorney, Mr. Evans, specializes in securities arbitration matters, which is currently 95% of the practice of the firm. He limits his representation to public customers.

Why work with our firm?

Our legal team has litigated hundreds of securities arbitration claims
We have tried more than 80 cases to a conclusion at the FINRA
We have represented public individuals in mediation and with many other securities fraud matters
Attorney Evans has proudly represented hundreds of other public investors in their disputes
We have a history of success
Our objective is to assist our clients to take legal action to recover the maximum possible of their losses


Highly Knowledgeable in Security Issues
Our firm offers the highest quality, professional legal representation in securities arbitration, 
	securities mediation and 
	securities litigation. With extensive experience in 
	recognizing investment losses and identifying illegal activities through an in-depth analysis of the 
	P&L and other financial data, we can quickly ascertain if your losses are the result of 
	misconduct, 
	churning, 
	unauthorized trading, or if your investment was placed in 
	unsuitable securities, as well as cases of 
	overconcentration, 
	selling away, or 
	fraud.

Helping You Procure What Has Been Lost
If you lost significant value due to misrepresentation/omission, 
	theft/conversion, or 
	Ponzi schemes, you will require legal representation with extensive knowledge and experience to assist you to take action and protect your interests. With over 20 years of experience in 
	common claims, matters involving 
	suitability, 
	negligence, 
	breach of fiduciary duty, and 
	state securities laws, you can have confidence that your interests will be carefully protected.

We offer our services in cases of significant losses in:

Annuities
Reverse convertibles
REITs
TICs
Principal protected notes
Stocks
Bonds
Mutual funds
UITs

Whether your portfolio losses are related to structured products, 
	promissory notes, 
	private placements, 
	limited partnerships, or 
	options, we have the experience and depth of experience necessary to seek justice and recovery of losses through arbitration or in court.

One of the most common defenses asserted by the securities industry is that damages are limited to Net-Out-of-Pocket losses. This NOP Myth can be defeated only by careful claims analysis, pleading specific causes of actions, and presenting detailed damages models. Our lengthy experience in securities arbitration provides clients with opportunities to defeat the NOP Myth and recover a proper measure of damages."
Persistent and Passionate Legal Assistance - Call 888-527-3427!
These are complex issues that are usually heavily contested by corporate securities law defense attorneys representing the investment firm, brokerage, financial advisor or broker. It is necessary that you have an equally experienced California securities attorney with a record of success in arbitration, mediation, and at trial to represent you and protect your interests. We urge you to contact our firm to discuss your situation, and we can advise you as to the best course of legal action, based upon the circumstances of your case and the financial losses involved.

Securities Law Attorney
For over three decades, The Law Offices of Jonathan W. Evans & Associates have been providing skilled and dedicated legal representation to public investors. Your investment broker or firm has a legally enforceable responsibility to act solely on your benefit when investing your money and providing financial services to you. If they have acted improperly, you have legal recourse, which we can provide. We provide services to our clients in the following areas:
Securities Arbitration: Our practice specializes in securities arbitration matters. We have litigated hundreds of securities arbitration claims and have also tried more than fifty (50) cases to conclusion at the NASD. Arbitration decisions are legally binding and normally avoid lengthy and costly litigation.
Securities Mediation: Mediation is another alternative to securities litigation. A neutral third party will work with the disputing parties and attempt to help them reach agreement. Unlike arbitration, the final settlement reached through mediation is not legally binding.
Securities Litigation: It is normally recommended that resolution be reached through arbitration or mediation. This is not always possible, and sometimes is not what is best for the investor. Litigation can also be used in combination with the alternative dispute resolution proceedings.
Types of Cases We Handle
Negligence:

	These are losses due to the negligent failure to follow express instructions given to a broker as well as the negligent failure of a broker’s firm to properly supervise the broker’s activities. Negligence may also include a broker’s failure to recommend investments which are consistent with a customer’s stated investment objectives and a customer’s risk tolerance.
	

Suitability:

	These are losses resulting from investments and investment vehicles, including stocks, annuities, bonds, and options which were unsuitable based upon a client’s risk profile and/or investment objectives, even if the customer ratified or otherwise acquiesced to the broker’s “suggestion” that he/she make the investment.
	

Failure to Supervise the Activity of a Customer Account:

	A brokerage firm has an affirmative duty to formulate and implement layers of supervision to assure that a customer’s account is being monitored to prevent wrongful and sometimes abusive conduct which could result in customer losses. If trading in a client’s account is inappropriate in light of the customer’s stated investment objectives and level of risk tolerance, proper supervision should identify any “red flags” in a timely fashion, and intervention by a supervisor should protect the customer against losses that flow from the unsuitable trading.
	

Failure of the Brokerage Firm to Adequately Supervise the Broker:

	Brokerage firms must also formulate and implement systems of supervision over its individual brokers. This includes closely monitoring the broker’s trading patterns across the broker’s entire “book of business”, usually on a daily basis. If brokers’ supervisors negligently or intentionally choose to “look the other way”, notwithstanding obvious “red flags”, the brokerage firm may be held liable for the customer’s losses.
	

Breach of Fiduciary Duty:

	In California, as a matter of law, a broker owes clients a fiduciary duty in the discharge of his duties. This means a broker owes the “highest” duty of loyalty and “highest” duty to always act in a manner consistent with the client’s best interest ahead of his own. Therefore the conduct of a broker is subject to heightened scrutiny insofar as how a recommendation to a customer might benefit the broker.
	

Misrepresentation and Fraud:

	When recommending or soliciting the purchase or sale of an investment, a broker is obligated to make a full disclosure of all material facts including, but not limited to, any risk of loss of principal, all fees and costs associated with the investment product (including commissions), the existence and availability of other similar investments, and any other material disclosures which might reasonably impact the customer’s decision to invest his/her funds.
	

Overconcentration and Lack of Diversification:

	Brokers have a duty to recommend a diversified portfolio. Diversification manages and limits investment risk. Investing a disproportionately large portion of a client’s portfolio in a single market sector (i.e. all technology or telecommunication stocks), a single investment vehicle (i.e. all stocks or annuities and no bonds or fixed income securities), or a single asset class (i.e. all funds invested in growth equity mutual funds and little or none in fixed income funds), creates unacceptable “concentration risk.”
	

Churning of an Account:

	Churning is excessive trading or turnover of an account in order to generate broker commissions. This may also include unjustified mutual fund switching or so-called IRC Section 1035 switching of variable annuities.

Frequently Asked Questions
Answers to Common Securities Fraud Concerns
When you give your money to a broker or investor, that individual is bound by a fiduciary duty, which means that he has an obligation to act for your benefit. As we have seen from the headlines in recent years, a fair amount of corruption has plagued the securities industry and investment world.
If you have concerns about your investments, look through the frequently asked questions and answers provided below and then call an experienced lawyer at The Law Offices of Jonathan W. Evans & Associates. Our firm limits our representation to public customers and since 1975 we have been helping public investors to successfully resolve their arbitration claims and investor disputes.
What are the signs of securities fraud?
There are actually many signs and we will give a few here. Unsolicited investment offers from strangers is probably the first sign. You may have had trusted friends "rave" about high returns in a short period of time. Promises of high returns in short time periods, even when recommended by a trusted friend is a red flag. High-pressure sales pitches are high-risk signs that you should definitely avoid completely. If your broker is unwilling to take the time to properly and adequately inform you about investments, he is not doing his job. There are many other signs. If you are worried, call us.
How do I find someone I can trust to handle my investments?
This is an excellent question, but a challenge to answer. Based on news that some of the largest and most trusted firms have been quite corrupt, it may seem impossible to determine. The best answer is, do your homework. Take your time, ask lots of questions. Look at their Internet presence. Talk to several brokers, hopefully based on referrals from trusted friends or family members. Do not be afraid to ask any question, no matter how simple it may seem. Note how you are responded to. Trust your instincts. Do not trust the hype.
What is the difference between mediation and arbitration?
Both securities mediation and 
	securities arbitration are used as an alternative to litigation when resolving disputes. An unbiased, third party is used in both. The arbitrator will make a final decision after reviewing the case and listening to both parties' arguments. The final decision in arbitration is legally binding. The mediator discusses possible solutions with the parties and encourages them to resolve the conflict on their own.

What is your best option in California?
To get all of your questions answered, we recommend that you speak with us at your earliest convenience. We provide trusted legal representation and have been doing so for over three decades. You can feel confident that we can provide you with the information you need to determine your best course of action.

There's an advantage in working with a financial advisor who knows you – and your financial goals. That's what makes Edward Jones different from other investment firms. Supporting the relationship between you and your financial advisor shapes nearly every aspect of our business.
You may have seen one of our 12,000 offices in your community. That's because we believe you deserve more than a 1-800 number when it comes to your financial future.
What you may not know is that we're a Fortune 500 company with thousands of associates and sophisticated technology supporting your local financial advisor.
The Edward Jones approach in determining your goals, and developing tailored financial strategies, has been helping nearly 7 million clients for more than 90 years.
In fact, we like to think we became one of the largest financial services firms in the country by not acting that way. If you're ready to work with a different kind of investment firm—one that cares as much about why you're investing as what you invest in— you're ready to work with Edward Jones.

Focus On You

Focus On You




Every investment firm has principles. And they usually sound exactly the same. We believe Edward Jones is different in almost every way. Our principles were deliberately created with you in mind. We don't just talk about personal service. We're built to deliver it.
Your dedicated financial advisor – It's your financial future, so an 800-number or Internet search for financial advice doesn't cut it. You have a relationship with an Edward Jones financial advisor, who spends time to learn why you're investing and then develops a personalized strategy. No cookie-cutter plans here.
In your neighborhood – With more than 15,000 financial advisors, you shouldn't have to go far to find an Edward Jones office in your community. That means you can actually meet with a financial advisor to discuss what's important to you.
Tailored for individual investors - All of our resources – including investment research, online account access, easy-to-understand statements, sophisticated software and detailed reports – are developed with you in mind.
Experienced support team - Backing up this personal service is a Fortune 500 company with thousands of people and advanced technology. Your financial advisor uses these resources to develop the best strategy for you.
We spend the time and have the knowledge to help you sort through complicated financial questions. Most financial services firms claim to focus on you and your needs, but can they really do it? We believe Edward Jones is uniquely positioned from the ground up to provide the attention, respect and service you deserve.

Prepare for Your First Appointment

Prepare for Your First Appointment 




We're honored that you're considering working with us to help achieve your financial goals. Here are three ways you can prepare our first meeting.


Think about why you're investing
Understanding the "why" will help you be better prepared to discuss your goals and strategies to help reach them. What's important to you and your family? What do you want to achieve?


Gather your statements
If you've worked with a financial advisor before, it's helpful to know about your current investments and your experience to date. If you're new to the investing world, we promise to talk with you, not at you. Our goal is to empower you with the knowledge you'll need to pursue your goals.


Bring your questions
We want to make sure to answer any investment questions you may have, as well as how we can best work together. What do you expect? How often do you want to touch base?

Invested in the Community






We are invested in our community
We value the communities where we work, so we're committed to giving back. You'll find our associates serving clients in our offices, but you'll also find us investing our time and talents to support local organizations and great causes. Many Financial Advisors are on Chambers of Commerce and serve as board members and event coordinators for local organizations, and our associates volunteer, donate and support a variety of charitable organizations.







Tour De Ted
Each year, branch and Home Office associates take to the road to raise funds for cancer research for the firm's annual Tour de Ted. In memory of Ted Jones, former managing partner who died from cancer, the first Tour de Ted showcased the firm's community-oriented culture while paying tribute to the history of Edward Jones. Volunteers rode the path of the original "wire" that connected Pueblo, Colo., to St. Louis, Mo., which created our branch network.







Emergency Assistance
Sixteen Financial Advisors in Texas decided to set aside one day out of their busy schedules to give back to their community. They volunteered at the Montgomery County Emergency Assistance facility by painting offices and hallways, and sorting and tagging clothes.







School Supply Drive
Eight local Edward Jones Financial Advisors teamed up on behalf of school children, clearly demonstrating their commitment to family values. Their school supply drive brought in hundreds of classroom necessities, from notebooks and markers to tissues and cleaning wipes.







Habitat for Humanity
When investors wanted to save for a new home, Edward Jones was there to help. Associates from Ontario, Canada, helped a local family reach its goal of home ownership in another way when they came together for the Habitat for Humanity build in Amherstburg, Ont., the first such home built in this community.







Pedal the Cause
We're proud of our associates who joined the fight against cancer as Edward Jones Pedal the Cause riders. More than 200 bike riders from across the U.S. took to the streets (and the Katy Trail) to help fundraise for cancer research.







Walk to End Alzheimer's®
At Edward Jones, we live and work in the communities we serve. We want to make a difference in people’s lives, both in and out of the office. Alzheimer’s disease has a significant impact on individuals, family, friends and community. That’s why we’ve chosen to partner with the Alzheimer’s Association as the National Presenting Sponsor of the Walk to End Alzheimer’s®. We invite you to join us in the fight to end this terrible disease.
