TEAM Industrial Products 

Team's ISO 9001-certified engineering design and manufacturing facilities provide the world’s finest pipe repair, leak sealing and hot tapping hardware, sealants and related products. A company-wide commitment to quality control, traceability, safety and quick response drives the manufacturing of all Team products 24/7/365. 
Our 78,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Alvin, Texas features manufacturing, engineering, technical support, training, purchasing, sealants and safety departments. Manufacturing equipment at the facility includes more than 60 machines with a turning capacity of 105 inches as well as three stress relief ovens with chart recordings and CNC Machining Centers. 

Our standard products can be customized by Team’s welders who are certified to ASME Section IX requirements. Procedures are qualified to many different weld processes and metallurgies, and all weld joints are specified by Engineering to the intent of the ASME Section VIII Code. Inspection methods include magnetic particle (MT), dye penetrant (PT), radiography (RT), and ultrasonic testing (UT) to verify weld quality.
The plant has operated for more than 25 years under a documented quality program complying to 10 CFR 50, App. B nuclear requirements. Team maintains a fully staffed, independent Quality Assurance and Quality Control Department onsite to ensure compliance with all requirements and perform program audits of all branch operations.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.
