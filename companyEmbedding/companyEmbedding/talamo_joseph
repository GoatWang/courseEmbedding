Joseph Talamo (born January 12, 1990 in Marrero, Louisiana) is a Champion jockey in American Thoroughbred horse racing.
Born and raised in Marrero on the West Bank of the Mississippi River, within the Greater New Orleans Metropolitan area, Joe Talamo was influenced by a father who worked in horse racing as an assistant trainer. At age eleven, he began riding horses and worked as a stable boy. Like many successful Cajun jockeys before him, Talamo first raced at a bush track. His skills and desire was such that he decided to leave high school in order to pursue a professional riding career. He debuted at Louisiana Downs in June 2006 and went on to become the first apprentice jockey to win a riding title at the Fair Grounds Race Course in New Orleans.
In April 2007, during his breakout year fresh off his riding title at the Fair Grounds, Talamo moved to live in Playa del Rey, California from where he competes primarily at race tracks in the southern part of the state. He was the second leading jockey in wins during the Hollywood Park Racetrack 2007 Spring/Summer meet. For 2007, he notably earned five Grade I Graded stakes race wins and was voted the Eclipse Award as the 2007 United States Champion Apprentice Jockey.
Joe Talamo has been the regular jockey on I Want Revenge who was the favorite to win the 2009 Kentucky Derby but the horse was scratched on the day of the race. He had said that if he wins the Derby, he is going to donate twenty-five percent of what he earns to the Children's Hospital of New Orleans that cares for all children, regardless of a family's ability to pay. [1]
Talamo was one of the jockeys featured Animal Planet's 2009 reality documentary, Jockeys.
He was invited by the Hong Kong Jockey Club to participate in the Cathay Pacific International Jockey Championship in December 2009.
He jockeyed atop Sidney's Candy in the 2010 Kentucky Derby. The horse finished in 17th place and out of the money.

A Word from ​Mario & Joseph Talamo















The late Salvatore Talamo, ​founder of Talamo Foods




 
Forty-two years ago, at age sixteen, our father, Salvatore Talamo, left his hometown of Alia, Sicily bound for the United States with the hope of fulfilling his dream of making a better life for himself.His first job here in America was with his uncle Phil's meat company doing everything from shoveling carcasses, to truck driving, even chasing cattle.After six years working at the meat company, our father saved enough money to buy his own truck and start his own trucking company, the first of several companies he would establish through the years.In 1963, our father met and married Josephine Rubino (who also came from the old country) and raised three sons.
 








In 1964, our father's trucking company fell on hard times and eventually went out of business. After that, our father took a job with California Cheese Company, which specialized in Italian cheese. This company would link our family to the Italian Cheese industry for years to come. After 17 years with Cal Cheese and five years with Beatrice Cheese, our father decided to start his own cheese company, specializing in manufacturing Italian cheese. After 10 years of running his own manufacturing plant, he sold it and focused his effort on cheese distribution, recognizing that it was by far more profitable.
 









Town of Alia, Sicily




 



Our father found his niche in distribution. He was able to establish a distribution area, which would accommodate Italian and specialty foods, which had exceptional needs, such as: custom blending of various Italian cheeses, pack size variations, and private labeling. He offered a customized service with full line distribution capabilities.In 1992, our father passed away, leaving us to carry on the business. With our expertise in processing and manufacturing and sales and marketing, we have increased company sales by a conservative 500% since 1992, with a customer base that includes the Pacific Northwest, and expands to as far east as New York and International. Talamo Foods has maintained a solid base in the Italian cheese industry.​To date, our company is the only company in the northern California area that has its own processing department and complete distribution capabilities nationwide.Sincerely,Mario Talamo, President​Joseph Talamo, C.O.O.
