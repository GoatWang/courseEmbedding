Biography   James C Leonard


        James Leonard has emerged as one of California's leading abstract expressionist painters.  Leonard's emotionally charged landscapes often portray backdrops for figures dramatically suspended. Leonard grew up in Nashville, Tennessee and has always been drawn to the early expressionists of the 1930's and 40's.  The German painter Gerhard Richer has had an influence on his style, approach, and directness. Working with acrylics on canvas, Leonard uses bold horizontal and vertical strokes and strong color to the viewer's emotions. "Art has always been the focus of my life," he says.  "Just as our lives unfold in unique and beautiful ways, so do my paintings have their own unique and individual expression." http://www.thornwoodgallery.com/g/GalleryHome/ArtistDetails/8029#

Specialties & ExpertiseDr. James Leonard has the following 7 areas of expertise and  1 specialty.                     Family Medicine
    A family practitioner is a doctor who specializes in caring for people of all ages, at all stages of life. Rather than focusing on the treatment of one disease or patient population, family practitioners are often the doctors that people see for their everyday ailments, like cold and flu or respiratory infections, and health screenings. When necessary, family practitioners will provide referrals for conditions that require the expertise of another specialist.


    The doctors may also provide physicals, inoculations, prenatal care, treat chronic diseases, like diabetes and asthma, and provide advice on disease prevention.
