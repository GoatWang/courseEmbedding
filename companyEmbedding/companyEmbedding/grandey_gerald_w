The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Rare Element Announces Appointment of Gerald W. Grandey as Chairman of the Board
12-Jun-2015 9:24 AM










LAKEWOOD, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Rare Element Resources Ltd. (NYSE MKT: REE and TSX: RES) (the “Company”), a strategic materials company focused on delivering rare earth products to technology industries by advancing the Bear Lodge Critical Rare Earth Project in northeast Wyoming, announced that all seven director-nominees were elected by the shareholders of the Company at the 2015 Annual General Meeting held on June 10, 2015. Additionally, Mr. Gerald “Jerry” W. Grandey was appointed by the Company’s Board to serve as Chairman, replacing Lowell A. Shonk who had been in the role of Interim Chairman since February, 2015. Mr. Grandey has been a member of Rare Element Resources’ Board since August, 2013 and has over 30 years of high-level executive experience in the natural resource sector, most recently as Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Cameco Corporation, one of the world’s largest uranium producers.
 


“Jerry not only has a wealth of industry experience, but the Company will also benefit from his leadership, technical and marketing-related skills as we continue to position ourselves to help meet the need for rare earth products in the technology sector,” said Randall J. Scott, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Throughout his career, Jerry has proven himself to be a thoughtful leader with international experience who makes things happen, winning numerous industry awards over the years, including being recognized by the Harvard Business Review as one of the Top 100 CEO’s in the world in 2010. It is this vision that will help us continue to move the Bear Lodge Project forward and allow us to develop the relationships we need with those companies that understand the value of the products we expect to produce and the need for a North American rare earth supply source.
“We want to thank Lowell for assuming the role of interim Chairman. His leadership on the Company’s Board is highly valued, including his continuation as chair of both the Audit and Finance Committees.”
The Company also announced that all seven of the director nominees listed in the Company’s management information circular dated April 30, 2015 were re-elected today. Shareholders also ratified the re-appointment of EKS&H, LLLP, Certified Public Accountants, as the auditors of the Company.
