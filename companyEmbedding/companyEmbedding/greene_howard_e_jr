			Mr. Greene has served on our board of directors since January 2008. Mr. Greene is an entrepreneur who has participated in the founding and management of 11 medical technology companies over 25 years, including three companies for which he served as chief executive officer. He was the co-founder of Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a public pharmaceutical company that was acquired by Bristol Myers Squibb in August 2012, serving as the Chief Executive Officer of that company from 1987 to 1996. He also served as a director of Amylin Pharmaceuticals from 1987 to April 2009. Mr. Greene also served on the board of directors of Biosite from June 1989 until its sale in 2007. From 1986 until 1993, Mr. Greene was a founding general partner of Biovest Partners, a seed venture capital firm. He was Chief Executive Officer of Hybritech Incorporated from March 1979 until its acquisition by Eli Lilly & Co. in March 1986, and he was co-inventor of Hybritech's patented monoclonal antibody assay technology. Prior to joining Hybritech, he was an executive with the medical diagnostics division of Baxter Healthcare Corporation and a consultant with McKinsey & Company. Mr. Greene holds a B.A. in Physics from Amherst College and an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School.
We believe Mr. Greene's background as a Chief Executive Officer and director of publicly-traded biotechnology companies, his extensive experience at the executive and board level in multiple companies in the medical technology industry, and his long-term investing experience, brings to our board critical skills related to financial oversight of complex organizations, strategic planning, and corporate governance and qualify him to serve as one of our directors.

                  Vical researches and develops biopharmaceutical products based on our patented DNA delivery technologies for the prevention and treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases.

Our active independent and partnered development programs include:

    Infectious disease vaccines for use in high-risk populations
    Infectious disease vaccines for general pediatric, adolescent and adult populations
    Cancer vaccines or immunotherapies

What’s in a Name?

Vical initially was formed by former Hybritech executives Howard Greene and Timothy Wollaeger and UCSD professors Karl Hostetler and Douglas Richman to explore the development of lipid-based delivery of antiVIrals and CALcitonin – hence VICAL. A surprise outcome in an experiment - in which the lipid-free control performed better than the test lipid - led to the discovery of the core technology behind all of Vical’s current programs. The Vical mission changed as a result, but the Vical name endured

Bristol-Myers Squibb Company


                  Bristol-Myers Squibb Company

Our company has a strong legacy of innovation that began in New York in 1858 when Edward R. Squibb, M.D., founded a pharmaceutical company in Brooklyn, and in 1887 when two friends, William McLaren Bristol and John Ripley Myers purchased a struggling drug manufacturing firm in Clinton. Together, they laid the foundation for our company today — a global BioPharma leader that continues this legacy of innovation.
