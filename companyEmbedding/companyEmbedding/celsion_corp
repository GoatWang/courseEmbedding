Meet Celsion
Celsion Corporation is a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company focused on developing a portfolio of innovative cancer treatments, including directed chemotherapies, DNA-mediated immunotherapy, and RNA-based therapies. Our lead product candidate is ThermoDox®, a proprietary heat-activated liposomal encapsulation of doxorubicin, currently in a phase 3 trial combined with RFA for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. It is also in a phase 2 study for the treatment of recurrent chest wall breast cancer. Second in our pipeline is GEN-1, a DNA-mediated immunotherapy for the localized treatment of ovarian cancer.
Celsion has 3 platform technologies providing the basis for the development of a range of therapeutics for difficult-to-treat forms of cancers. With these technologies we are working to develop and commercialize more efficient, effective, and targeted oncology therapies, maximizing efficacy while minimizing side effects common to cancer treatments.
 
Our mission
Celsion’s mission is to transform the landscape of cancer treatment with novel targeting technologies. Our ultimate goal is to cure challenging cancers, transitioning from the passion of what is possible to the science of what is proven.
 
Our platform technologies
We currently have three platform technologies providing the basis for the future development of a range of therapeutics for difficult-to-treat forms of cancer.

Our first product candidate, ThermoDox® uses our LTSL (lysolipid thermally sensitive liposome) technology to encapsulate the commonly used cancer drug doxorubicin. The heat-sensitive liposome rapidly changes structure when heated to 40°C-45°C, creating openings that release doxorubicin directly into and around the targeted tumor. ThermoDox is currently being evaluated in clinical studies for primary liver cancer and recurrent chest (RCW) wall breast cancer.
Our second product candidate GEN-1, uses our TheraPlas™ technology platform to provide localized immunotherapy. GEN-1 is an interleukin-12 (IL-12) DNA plasmid vector formed into nanoparticles with a lipopolymeric delivery system. It is currently under evaluation for the treatment of ovarian cancer and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).

					Full Description



Celsion Corporation (Celsion), incorporated on May 17, 2000, is an oncology drug development company. The Company is focused on developing a portfolio of cancer treatments, including directed chemotherapies, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-mediated immunotherapy and ribonucleic acid (RNA)-based therapies. Its product candidate is ThermoDox, a heat-activated liposomal encapsulation of doxorubicin, which is in Phase III clinical trial for the treatment of primary liver cancer (the OPTIMA Study) and a Phase II clinical trial for the treatment of recurrent chest wall breast cancer (the DIGNITY Study). Its pipeline also includes GEN-1, a DNA mediated immunotherapy for the localized treatment of ovarian and brain cancers. The Company has over three platform technologies for the development of treatments for those suffering with difficult-to-treat forms of cancer, including Lysolipid Thermally Sensitive Liposomes, a heat sensitive liposomal based dosage form that targets disease with known therapeutics in the presence of mild heat; TheraPlas, a nucleic acid-based treatment for local transfection of therapeutic plasmids, and TheraSilence, a systemic dosage form for lung directed anti-cancer RNA.ThermoDox is a liposomal encapsulation of doxorubicin, an approved oncology drug for the treatment of a range of cancers. Localized heat at mild hyperthermia temperatures (approximately 40 degree Celsius) releases the encapsulated doxorubicin from the liposome enabling concentrations of doxorubicin to be deposited preferentially in and around the targeted tumor. The Company completed its first Phase I single dose escalation clinical trial that investigated ThermoDox in combination with radio frequency ablation (RFA) for the treatment of primary and metastatic liver cancer. The second Phase I dose escalation study is designed to investigate simplification of the RFA/ThermoDox treatment regimen, including a single vial formulation of ThermoDox designed for commercial distribution.The HEAT Study for ThermoDox, in combination with RFA, was conducted in patients with primary liver cancer under a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA). It has also completed computational modeling with supplementary prospective preclinical animal studies, which support the relationship between heating duration and clinical outcomes. Based on the overall survival data from the post-hoc analysis of results from HEAT Study, the Company submitted its proposed pivotal Phase III clinical protocol for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review. The OPTIMA Study trial design is based on an analysis of data from its HEAT Study.The Company commenced an open label, dose-escalating ThermoDox Phase I/Phase II clinical trial for patients with RCW breast cancer (the DIGNITY Study). The DIGNITY Study is designed to establish a safe therapeutic dose in Phase I, and in Phase II to demonstrate local control, including complete and partial responses, and stable disease as its primary endpoint. Celsion's GEN-1 approach for IL-12 delivery is designed to achieve local concentrations of IL-12 at the tumor site with minimal increases in systemic circulation. This DNA-based approach involves intraperitoneal administration of an IL-12 plasmid formulated with a lipopolymer delivery system Polyethylene Glycol- Polyetherimide (PEG-PEI) Cholesterol. TheraPlas is a technology platform for the delivery of DNA and messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics through synthetic non-viral carriers. There are two components of the TheraPlas system, a plasmid DNA or mRNA payload encoding a therapeutic protein, and a delivery system. The delivery system is designed to protect the DNA/RNA from degradation and promote trafficking into cells and through intracellular compartments. TheraSilence is a technology platform for the delivery of synthetically-generated inhibitory RNA (RNAi), such as small inhibitory RNAs (siRNAs), microRNAs, anti-microRNAs, microRNA mimics, and related molecules that can regulate protein expression at the transcript level by exploiting endogenous cell mechanisms.

Celsion's stock extends surge, climbs 86% premarket after withdrawing stock offering
Celsion's stock extends surge, climbs 86% premarket after withdrawing stock offering

Celsion's stock rockets after withdrawing stock offering
Shares of Celsion Corp.  rocketed 42% in premarket trade Friday, after the cancer drug development company filed to withdraw plans for a stock offering. The company had originally filed on April 5 an S-1 statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the sale of shares, which was amended as recently as Wednesday for the sale of 2.45 million common shares and pre-funded and base warrants to buy over 4 million shares. In Friday's filing, the company stated that it submitted the withdrawal "because it does not intend to pursue the contemplated offering at this time." Earlier this week, the company said it had regained the minimum-bid compliance for the continued listing of its stock on the Nasdaq. That followed a 1-for-14 reverse stock split on May 30. The stock has plunged 52% year to date through Thursday, while the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF  has climbed 11% and the S&P 500  has gained 8.7%.

UPDATE: Celsion shares surge 74% on news of positive trial of ovarian cancer treatment
Shares of Celsion Corp.  surged 73.7% in extremely heavy morning trade Monday, after the cancer drug developer said an early-stage trial of a treatment of ovarian cancer showed promising findings. The phase 1b clinical trial evaluated Gen-1, the company's DNA-based immunotherapy, with the standard care for patients with advanced ovarian cancer who will undergo  chemotherapy followed by surgery. Of the 14 patients treated in the study, two demonstrated a complete response, ten a partial response, and two remained stable. "This translates to a 100% disease control rate ("DCR") and an 86% objective response rate ("ORR")," said the company. Celsion shares rose 44.4% over the last three months to $4.58, while the S&P 500  has gained 2.3%.

Celsion's stock extends surge, climbs 86% premarket after withdrawing stock offering
Celsion's stock extends surge, climbs 86% premarket after withdrawing stock offering

Celsion's stock rockets after withdrawing stock offering
Shares of Celsion Corp.  rocketed 42% in premarket trade Friday, after the cancer drug development company filed to withdraw plans for a stock offering. The company had originally filed on April 5 an S-1 statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the sale of shares, which was amended as recently as Wednesday for the sale of 2.45 million common shares and pre-funded and base warrants to buy over 4 million shares. In Friday's filing, the company stated that it submitted the withdrawal "because it does not intend to pursue the contemplated offering at this time." Earlier this week, the company said it had regained the minimum-bid compliance for the continued listing of its stock on the Nasdaq. That followed a 1-for-14 reverse stock split on May 30. The stock has plunged 52% year to date through Thursday, while the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF  has climbed 11% and the S&P 500  has gained 8.7%.

UPDATE: Celsion shares surge 74% on news of positive trial of ovarian cancer treatment
Shares of Celsion Corp.  surged 73.7% in extremely heavy morning trade Monday, after the cancer drug developer said an early-stage trial of a treatment of ovarian cancer showed promising findings. The phase 1b clinical trial evaluated Gen-1, the company's DNA-based immunotherapy, with the standard care for patients with advanced ovarian cancer who will undergo  chemotherapy followed by surgery. Of the 14 patients treated in the study, two demonstrated a complete response, ten a partial response, and two remained stable. "This translates to a 100% disease control rate ("DCR") and an 86% objective response rate ("ORR")," said the company. Celsion shares rose 44.4% over the last three months to $4.58, while the S&P 500  has gained 2.3%.

Our History
 
 

 
 
 
 
 



Celsion Labs is a division of Celsion Corporation, a publicly-owned biopharmaceutical company that is in the business of developing novel therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. Celsion Corporation’s broad-based technology and product platform spans early stage drug candidates to Phase III registration products. With a built-in infrastructure supported by scientific and regulatory expertise in product development an opportunity became clear to expand into contract research services, and in late 2016 Celsion Corporation established Celsion Labs.
Rarely is this unique combination of credentials and craft present within a single organization, and it enables Celsion Labs to provide the expertise required to bring a pharmaceutical product into the marketplace as quickly and smoothly as possible. Because the preclinical phase is the most challenging part of the drug development process and has a high degree of failure, finding a CRO with a staff knowledgeable in cutting-edge science and technology and a track record of successful bench-to-bedside experience is important to the success of any drug development program.
With our roots in drug discovery and development, Celsion Labs understands the value of high quality preclinical research, its timely completion, and need to manage cost. Our Scientific team has the requisite experience, expertise and collaborative spirit to help our clients achieve their research and development goals.
