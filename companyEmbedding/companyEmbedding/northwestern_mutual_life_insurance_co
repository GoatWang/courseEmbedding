Consumer Tip: Lifely Term is a term life insurance product issued with limited underwriting and limited medical evidence of insurability. You may be able to purchase other life insurance products (including our other term life products) for substantially less cost if you apply for a life insurance product with full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability. However, if you submit to full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability, you may be required to pay more for a fully underwritten product that if you purchased a Lifely Term policy.

FAQ
These FAQs provide some information about Lifely Term and about life insurance generally. Only a policy will have complete details on how the policy works, how to qualify for benefits, what restrictions or limitations apply, and terms for keeping the policy in effect. 
What else should I know about life insurance?


What is term insurance?

Term insurance is a type of life insurance that provides protection for a set period of time. If you (the insured person) die during this period, the policy will pay a death benefit to the person or people you designate; these are called your beneficiaries. 
With Lifely Term, you can choose a term period of 10, 15, or 20 years. The policy and death benefit coverage end when the term period expires. The policy is not convertible to another policy, it does not have cash value and it does not have a return of premium feature.


What is a premium?

Premiums are the amounts you pay to begin your policy and keep it in effect. 
For Lifely Term, your premium is automatically deducted each month from the bank account you choose.

What happens if I miss a payment?

Your policy will enter a grace period. If you do not pay your premium by the end of the grace period shown in your policy, your policy will end without value and you will no longer be covered.

How do I know which term period to select?

Think about the reasons you’re purchasing the policy. Consider not only the expenses you want to help ensure your family will be able to pay without your income but also for how long they will still rely on your financial support.
Also consider that life insurance generally becomes more expensive as one gets older.  Once your policy ends, if you want to buy another policy, you typically will need to qualify again. In the time between policies, your health may change, perhaps causing you to pay a higher premium or even be denied coverage later on.

How do I know which death benefit payment period to choose?

For how many years after your death will your family need the financial support of this policy’s death benefit? The answer to this question will guide you.

How does the death benefit get paid to my beneficiaries?

The death benefit will be paid to your beneficiaries in monthly payments. These payments will be for the benefit amount you choose and for the number of years you select.
With Lifely Term, you can choose the benefit payment period—the number of years that you’d like your beneficiaries to receive payments from this policy if you pass away. You can choose benefit payment periods of 10, 15, 20, or 30 years. Please note that you cannot change the payment period after the policy is issued.

Will the monthly death benefit be taxed?

Yes. Although the death benefit of most other life insurance policies is paid out generally free of federal income tax, a portion of Lifely Term's benefit, which is paid out monthly as chosen when you apply, will be considered income to your beneficiary for income tax purposes. Please keep this in mind when considering Lifely Term.

Are death benefits paid out as the result of a suicide?

In general, if the insured person dies by suicide in the first two years from when the policy is issued, the policy will end and all premiums will be returned. A new suicide exclusion period may begin if we agree to reinstate a policy that ends because of a missed premium payment.

Why are you asking about my health and lifestyle?

We use information about your health and habits to determine your eligibility for the policy.

What if I want to change or add beneficiaries later?

As a policyholder, you can change your beneficiary designation at any time and as often as you’d like by contacting Customer Service at 844-499-0771.

If I die, when will my beneficiaries receive the money?

Monthly payment of benefits will begin after we receive proof of death and the forms we require.

When does my coverage start?

Assuming your policy is approved, coverage begins immediately once we have received your first payment and your signed acceptance of your policy.

Can I cancel my policy at any time?

Yes. Please refer to your policy for cancellation details or call Customer Service at 844-499-0771.

Where does the information come from?

We are able to search public records, such as county or city records.  We do not access or affect your credit file.

How can you check my identity online?

We are able to search public records, such as county or city records.  We do not access or affect your credit file.

What do you do with the answers?

The information you provide is used only to verify your identity.  We do not maintain a record of the information reviewed while verifying your identity.

How does Prudential protect my personal information?

Prudential respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. Please select the Customer Privacy Notice button that appears on the bottom of this website's pages to view our privacy statement.

How can I be sure my privacy is protected?

Prudential respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. Please select the Customer Privacy Notice button that appears on the bottom of this website's pages to view our privacy statement.

What is an eSignature?

Whenever you apply for a life insurance policy, you need to sign a few documents during the process. Since this process is over the Internet and you cannot physically sign the documents, we use electronic signature, or eSignature, to get your signature.

Lifely Term (PCT-2016) is issued in California by Pruco Life Insurance Company, Newark, NJ.

What else should i know about life insurance?


THE BENEFITS OF LIFE INSURANCE
If you're like most people, you don't want to think about the possibility of dying. You expect to live for a long time and purchasing life insurance is not your first priority. But, have you considered the consequences of not having life insurance?   Because of the many different types of life insurance products available, making the right choice appears to be complicated, but it needn't be so. 


WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF INSURANCE?
There are two basic types of life insurance: term life insurance and permanent life insurance.  Term Life Insurance is an attractive solution to help protect you and your family with affordable and flexible policy options.
Term insurance can provide inexpensive coverage to meet specific needs.  It provides a stated benefit when you pass away, provided your death occurs within a specified time period. Term life insurance does not provide any benefits in case of disability or accidental injury.  In general, term products do not have cash values available for loan or withdrawal. Term life insurance premiums are generally lower for a period of time. After this period, some term policies end while others may be renewed, but with dramatically higher premiums. Purchasing a new policy after the end of your term period can be very expensive and you may have to have a medical exam to prove insurability.
Term is often considered appropriate when coverage is only required for a specific period of time; for instance, until your children graduate from college. The benefits can be used to replace income you would have earned to help pay off a mortgage or help maintain your family's lifestyle, for example. In addition, benefits can help cover funeral expenses.
Return of premium term is a slightly different type of term insurance. Premiums tend to be higher with the benefit being that the premiums paid are returned to you at the end of the level term period, provided you meet the conditions set by the insurance company.
Some term insurance policies include a conversion privilege. This benefit gives you the option to convert your term policy to a permanent policy before the end of the conversion period without having to take another medical exam to be approved for coverage. However, in most cases, premiums for the permanent policy will be higher than the premiums you've been paying for the term policy.
Permanent insurance can cover you for as long as you live (as long as you pay sufficient premiums and there are no substantial loans or withdrawals). The premiums are generally higher than term insurance during the term period. After this period, however, premiums for a permanent policy may be less than term policy premiums. 
Permanent insurance combines the security of insurance protection with the ability to accumulate some cash values inside the policy. These funds are generally allowed to grow within the policy on a tax-deferred basis and may be used to supplement income, or meet emergency or other financial needs in the future. These values may be accessed through policy loans or withdrawals during the insured's lifetime.  Please note that, although you can use the cash value of your whole life insurance for these purposes, the primary reason for purchasing life insurance should be for the death benefit it provides.
Also keep in mind that unpaid loans and withdrawals will reduce future cash value, policy benefits and guarantees. Under certain circumstances withdrawals may be taxable; loans are generally not taxable. Any loans that are outstanding when a policy lapses or is surrendered will cause immediate taxation on the amount loaned in excess of the premium paid¹.  Any outstanding loans at the time of death will be deducted from the proceeds of the death benefit along with any accrued interest on the loan.
There are three types of permanent life insurance: 1) traditional (or "classic" ); 2) universal (also called "flexible premium" or "adjustable" ); 3) variable.  All types offer cash values and guaranteed death benefits. Traditional and universal life policies offer cash values that are a combination of guaranteed and non-guaranteed elements. The non-guaranteed elements usually include any dividends earned (traditional) or earnings in excess of the contractually guaranteed cash values (universal).
While most variable life policies also provide a guaranteed death benefit, the cash value of a variable life insurance policy is not guaranteed and fluctuates based on the performance of the underlying investment options that you choose. Because you bear the investment risk as opposed to the insurance company, variable life is considered a "security," subject to federal securities laws and protections, and is sold by prospectus. With a variable life insurance policy, the guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of the applicable issuing company and they do not apply to the investment performance or safety of the underlying subaccounts in the particular policy.


CONSIDERATIONS
There are some risks you should consider when purchasing life insurance.  These are:

Insurability Risk
Inadequate Coverage Risk
Premium Risk
Cash Value Accumulation Risk

Most people have a certain risk threshold - a comfort zone.  To manage your zone, it is helpful to understand the risks present in each situation and how they may apply to you.

Insurability Risk
Life insurance premiums are based on age and health.  The younger and healthier you are, the more inexpensive it is.  As you age, life insurance becomes more costly.  Typically you become less healthy over time; in addition, serious illnesses can strike at any time.  This could affect your ability to purchase life insurance in the future, or the premiums you pay.  This is called "insurability risk". 
Permanent insurance has a lower degree of insurability risk because coverage lasts throughout your lifetime without having to reapply, as long as you pay premiums when due and there are no substantial loans or withdrawals (though some variable life policies provide no guaranteed coverage). Buying permanent insurance when you are young and healthy can lock in lower premiums for life.
Some term insurance, with no conversion privilege, has a higher degree of insurability risk because your insurance coverage lasts for only a specified period of time (such as ten years). 

Inadequate Coverage Risk
Unfortunately death is a certainty.  Life insurance provides your beneficiaries with money to help meet their current and future financial obligations.  They may use the funds to pay off debts, cover college costs, continue your business or manage other financial obligations.  Without sufficient money to meet these obligations, your beneficiaries may be left with credit card bills or outstanding loans, or may be forced to alter their lifestyles significantly.
You have taken an important first step by considering the purchase of insurance at this time.  We encourage you to regularly and carefully evaluate whether your insurance portfolio is right for you given your financial status, objectives, obligations, and risk tolerance at any point in time.  It's no secret that as your life changes, your needs change too. 

Premium Risk
The two questions most people ask when considering the purchase of life insurance are: "How will I pay for this now?" and "Will I be able to afford this in the future?"
When considering which type of insurance is right for you, there are two risks associated with premium payments that you should think about: one, premiums may increase in the future; and two, premiums may need to be paid longer than you expected. These risks are called "premium risk".
From the perspective of being able to cover current premium payments, term insurance has a lower degree of premium risk because its initial cost is generally lower than of permanent insurance.  From the perspective of affording premium payments in the future, particularly if you need coverage longer than you initially thought, term insurance has a higher degree of premium risk.  The reason for this is that if you purchase new coverage in the future, as discussed earlier, premium costs become higher the older you become.  Health impairments may also increase the cost of new coverage.  And if you choose to keep your original term product, the premiums may increase sharply after the initial level term period.

Cash Value Accumulation Risk
If you are like most people, you have two distinct needs-one for a death benefit and the other to accumulate funds to meet life's expenses as they arise. A life insurance policy definitely meets the first need.  Although the primary reason to purchase life insurance is for the death benefit protection, some types of life insurance may also provide you the opportunity to accumulate accessible cash value within the policy itself. 
Permanent life insurance is the type of product that can accumulate cash values. These cash values may be accessed via loans and/or withdrawals to help in any number of ways, including paying off your mortgage early, supplementing your retirement income, or taking advantage of potential business opportunities. (Remember that withdrawals and loans will reduce policy cash values and the death benefit and may have tax consequences.)  However, you need to be aware of the costs and expenses that are associated with the policy that you purchase, and how these may impact the growth of your cash value.
Some types of permanent insurance actually allow you to pay more premiums than required to help give a boost to your cash values.  However , there is a limit on just how much you can pay into the policy; if you put in too much money, it becomes more expensive to access the cash values.  Your policy has now become a Modified Endowment Contract (MEC).  Instead of being able to withdraw up to basis (the amount equal to the premiums you have paid) and then borrow the balance of your accumulated cash values, all value you access will be taxable to the extent of income in the policy and there may be an additional 10% federal income tax on distributions prior to age 59½. 
One way that many people use to meet both their need of death benefit protection and their need for additional cash is to buy a lower cost term insurance product and then save or invest the difference between the term insurance cost and the permanent insurance cost.  The earlier you are able to put aside some funds the better as you may receive the positive affects of compound interest growth on your money.  The longer you delay, the greater your risk becomes in not being able to accumulate the funds you need.  This approach requires a commitment to regularly set money aside for savings.  This commitment may be difficult to meet when unexpected expenses arise and may not be for everyone.


MAKING YOUR DECISION
Now that you are a little more knowledgeable, take a look at your personal situation, consider the types of insurance available to you and make the decision that works for you and your family. 
Everyone has their own goals for personal financial security and the important thing is that you progress towards achieving your goals. You may wish to maximize your insurance coverage today or you may wish to purchase a policy you can "personalize" to meet your needs by adding riders that provide you with additional insurance coverage. You may wish to purchase a permanent life insurance policy and supplement it with term insurance for additional coverage during a particular period of time. For example, you may want extra protection during certain years such as coverage to help cover payments on a mortgage, or added protection for your children or spouse.
Look at your options and determine what works for you.  We're here to help.

Hi. Welcome to Lifely by Prudential! Thanks for stopping by.You may be wondering what Lifely is — and that's a good question. Lifely by Prudential is a program aimed to make purchasing life insurance easier.  We are trying to think differently about life insurance for today's consumer. To that end, we introduce Lifely Term, a policy offered by Pruco Life Insurance Company, a Prudential Financial company.  
 
When You Take Care of the Ones You Love, You Take Care of the World. 
 
There's an old adage in the insurance world that "Life insurance is sold, not bought." But we think that times are changing, and people today are more informed and more in control of their financial future. You know you need life insurance, right? So, we set out to design a way for you to be able to access, learn about, and purchase life insurance that makes it easy. We know that life insurance can be difficult to understand, can make you feel like you don't know where to start, and sometimes can turn people away (We have to mention "death." That’s uncomfortable.) 
So we're trying to change all of that. 
You are thinking big about your impact on the world and constantly looking for small ways to improve the world we live in. We want to help you understand that, by protecting the ones you love with life insurance, you can free them to go on to do great things for this world after you’re gone. Maybe even make all of humanity a little better. The way we see it, when you take care of the ones you love, you take care of the world. It's just that simple. 
 
Quick. Click. Insure our Humanity.

that keeps on giving.

Goal To support his family after he’s gone. Alex wants to provide enough to pay the mortgage and everyday expenses until the children are out of school.




How Lifely Term can help 
With Lifely Term, Alex can provide $4k a month for 20 years, to help support his family during what would have been his working years.

Consumer Tip: Lifely Term is a term life insurance product issued with limited underwriting and limited medical evidence of insurability. You may be able to purchase other life insurance products (including our other term life products) for substantially less cost if you apply for a life insurance product with full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability. However, if you submit to full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability, you may be required to pay more for a fully underwritten product that if you purchased a Lifely Term policy.

Common Questions


	                            Will my benefit amount ever decrease?
                            




Benefits are guaranteed not to decrease until insurance ends regardless of changes in your age or health.

Premiums are arranged in five-year age bands and will increase as you enter each new band. See rate chart above.




	                            How long can I keep this life insurance?
                            

This term insurance is yours to keep until you reach age 80. All we ask is that you pay your premiums on time and that your application contains no material misrepresentations about your medical history.  This protection can be exchanged for permanent coverage without a medical exam any time until insurance ends at age 80. Rates will be based on your age at that time.




	                            Are there any exclusions or limitations?
                            

Benefits will not be paid for death from suicide in the first two years.*




	                            Will I be required to have a medical exam?
                            


Acceptance is based on your answers to health questions and other information you provide or give us permission to obtain. 
However, during the first two years, New York Life reserves the right to cancel your insurance if
your Application contains material misrepresentations about your medical history. 




	                            What if I answer "yes" to a health question?
                            


Answering “yes” does not automatically disqualify you from coverage. We may contact you to ask for more information or clarification of your answer. Most who apply are accepted.





	                            Why do you need my Social Security Number?
                            


New York Life requires your social security number to verify the individual we are insuring. This assists us in protecting the privacy of your information. Life insurance companies are also
required to obtain a taxpayer identification number (which is your social security number) in the event that we release money to you that could be considered taxable.





	                            What happens after I complete my application?
                            


 You will be contacted in about 7 to 14 business days regarding your application. If approved, a policy will be mailed to you.





	                            How long does it take for coverage to begin, once my application is approved?
                            


 Coverage will take effect on the date shown in your policy – normally seven days after approval of your application. You’ll have full benefits from the day your coverage takes effect.





	                            Can I keep my coverage if my health changes?
                            


 Once approved, changes in your health will not affect your coverage. Also, since it’s your own individual policy, you will remain covered if you change jobs or retire.





	                            How does the 30-Day satisfaction guarantee work?
                            


 You'll receive a policy when coverage is approved. If you decide this coverage isn't for you, for any reason, you can return it within 30 days and receive a refund.





	                            Why should I choose New York Life Insurance Company?
                            

As one of the oldest and largest mutual life insurance companies in the United States, New York Life has been protecting generations of families for more than 170 years. New York Life has the highest possible ratings for financial strength currently awarded to any life insurer from the leading independent rating services: A.M. Best (A++) Highest Rating, Fitch (AAA)Highest Rating, Standard & Poor’s (AA+) Second-Highest Rating, Moody’s Investors Service(Aaa) Highest Rating. Ratings as of 5/01/17.




	                            What is a mutual insurance company?
                            


 It’s a company that is not publicly traded and therefore has no shareholders. Instead, policyholders share in ownership of the company. All New York Life policyholders have the right to expect that our highest priority is to safeguard their interests.





	                            Can I apply for more than $150,000 in coverage?

Common Questions


	                            Will my benefit amount ever decrease?
                            




Benefits are guaranteed not to decrease until insurance ends regardless of changes in your age or health.

Premiums are arranged in five-year age bands and will increase as you enter each new band. See rate chart above.




	                            How long can I keep this life insurance?
                            

This term insurance is yours to keep until you reach age 80. All we ask is that you pay your premiums on time and that your application contains no material misrepresentations about your medical history.  This protection can be exchanged for permanent coverage without a medical exam any time until insurance ends at age 80. Rates will be based on your age at that time.




	                            Are there any exclusions or limitations?
                            

Benefits will not be paid for death from suicide in the first two years.*




	                            Will I be required to have a medical exam?
                            


Acceptance is based on your answers to health questions and other information you provide or give us permission to obtain. 
However, during the first two years, New York Life reserves the right to cancel your insurance if
your Application contains material misrepresentations about your medical history. 




	                            What if I answer "yes" to a health question?
                            


Answering “yes” does not automatically disqualify you from coverage. We may contact you to ask for more information or clarification of your answer. Most who apply are accepted.





	                            Why do you need my Social Security Number?
                            


New York Life requires your social security number to verify the individual we are insuring. This assists us in protecting the privacy of your information. Life insurance companies are also
required to obtain a taxpayer identification number (which is your social security number) in the event that we release money to you that could be considered taxable.





	                            What happens after I complete my application?
                            


 You will be contacted in about 7 to 14 business days regarding your application. If approved, a policy will be mailed to you.





	                            How long does it take for coverage to begin, once my application is approved?
                            


 Coverage will take effect on the date shown in your policy – normally seven days after approval of your application. You’ll have full benefits from the day your coverage takes effect.





	                            Can I keep my coverage if my health changes?
                            


 Once approved, changes in your health will not affect your coverage. Also, since it’s your own individual policy, you will remain covered if you change jobs or retire.





	                            How does the 30-Day satisfaction guarantee work?
                            


 You'll receive a policy when coverage is approved. If you decide this coverage isn't for you, for any reason, you can return it within 30 days and receive a refund.





	                            Why should I choose New York Life Insurance Company?
                            

As one of the oldest and largest mutual life insurance companies in the United States, New York Life has been protecting generations of families for more than 170 years. New York Life has the highest possible ratings for financial strength currently awarded to any life insurer from the leading independent rating services: A.M. Best (A++) Highest Rating, Fitch (AAA)Highest Rating, Standard & Poor’s (AA+) Second-Highest Rating, Moody’s Investors Service(Aaa) Highest Rating. Ratings as of 5/01/17.




	                            What is a mutual insurance company?
                            


 It’s a company that is not publicly traded and therefore has no shareholders. Instead, policyholders share in ownership of the company. All New York Life policyholders have the right to expect that our highest priority is to safeguard their interests.





	                            Can I apply for more than $150,000 in coverage?

Life Insurance: Lasting Protection for What Matters Most


Life insurance can be more than a safety net. Depending on the type of life insurance, it also can be the foundation for a sound financial plan. 








« Back to Products & Services
More in Products & Services








Your family means everything to you.
That’s why you’ve worked hard to give your loved ones every advantage. But would your family have the financial resources to maintain its lifestyle if you died?
While nothing can replace you, life insurance can help ensure your loved ones have the financial security necessary to live out their dreams. Life insurance can help:
 

Pay the mortgage or any other debt you may have.
Maintain your family’s standard of living.
Keep your children in their current school and fund college.
Pay for final expenses.
Leave a legacy.

Life insurance can also be more than a safety net. Depending on the type of life insurance, it can also be the foundation for a sound financial strategy. With permanent life insurance, for example, as you pay premiums, the policy accumulates cash value that grows tax deferred and can become a source of funding you can utilize to help meet your financial goals.1 Learn more about each of the two main types of life insurance by clicking on the links below:








Permanent Life Insurance
Helps meet your protection needs throughout your lifetime and accumulate cash value. Learn More.



Term Life Insurance
Helps meet your protection needs for a specific number of years. Term life insurance includes an option to convert to permanent insurance in the future using the same health status as your term policy. Learn More.








Why Northwestern Mutual?


When buying life insurance, you want a strong company that will be there when you need it. You also want a company that provides superior value over time. Northwestern Mutual has been helping clients achieve financial security for nearly 160 years. Our company has lived through the Civil War, the Crash of 1929, the Great Depression, two world wars, and numerous recessions. Northwestern Mutual is strong. We have the highest financial strength ratings awarded to any life insurer by all four of the major credit rating agencies.2
Northwestern Mutual policyowners can also benefit from yearly dividends. While dividends are not guaranteed, Northwestern Mutual has paid one every year since 1872. In fact, Northwestern Mutual's total yearly dividend payout consistently leads the industry.3 That’s money you can use to increase the value of your policy, pay premiums or take as cash.

Permanent Life Insurance


Learn how the lifelong protection of permanent life insurance from Northwestern Mutual can be an essential part of your financial plan.








« Back to Life Insurance
More in Life Insurance













What is permanent life insurance?
Permanent life insurance is designed to provide insurance protection for as long as you live, assuming your premium payments are made as required. This is in contrast to term life insurance, which provides protection for a set number of years, or “term.”
Permanent life insurance offers two other important benefits. With a permanent life insurance policy from Northwestern Mutual, you can:

Build cash value in the policy that grows tax deferred and can become a source of funding you can utilize to help meet your financial goals.1
Earn yearly dividends2 that you can take as cash, use to pay premiums or add to your policy to increase its death benefit and cash value. While dividends are not guaranteed, Northwestern Mutual has paid one every year since 1872. In fact, Northwestern Mutual has paid more dividends than any other company in the industry for the past 18 years.3 We expect that our total dividend payout on life insurance in 2015 will lead the industry.


Is permanent life insurance right for you?
You may want to consider permanent life insurance if you want to:

Create a solid foundation for your long-term financial plan.
Keep your life insurance active for as long as you live.
Build a source of funding for life’s emergencies and opportunities.
Provide for a loved one with special needs or a child who is not yet independent.
Assist aging parents or other family members who require your support.
Sustain a business you want to see continue after you’re gone.
Equalize inheritances among beneficiaries.
Create a legacy for grandchildren, future generations, or your favorite charity.

Northwestern Mutual offers a range of permanent life insurance options that can help you achieve your long-term goals:

Whole Life offers three important guarantees: A death benefit, level premiums and the ability to build cash value.
CompLife® combines features of both permanent life insurance and optional term life insurance for flexible protection.
Universal Life provides permanent protection along with the ability to adjust your protection level, premiums and payment schedule to meet your changing needs.
Variable Life balances protection with the potential to build cash value through a choice of investment options.








The Northwestern Mutual Difference


For nearly 160 years, Northwestern Mutual has helped policyowners meet life’s challenges. We have the highest financial strength ratings awarded to any life insurer by all four of the major credit rating agencies.4 We pay industry-leading dividends, which many policyowners use to increase the value of their policies. Our clients believe in us and return for more. In a typical year existing clients account for more than half of our life insurance sales.5

Term Life Insurance


Learn how term life insurance can provide a level of financial protection and security for your family at an affordable cost.








« Back to Life Insurance
More in Life Insurance













What is term life insurance?
Term life insurance provides coverage for a specific period of time, or “term” (for example, 10 or 20 years or to a specific age, such as 80).
Term life insurance is one of the most affordable types of insurance you can buy. In return for its affordability, however, term life insurance policies do not build cash value (as is the case with permanent life insurance), and when the term of the policy ends, so does your coverage. That means your loved ones won’t receive a payment (the death benefit) from your policy should you pass away after the term ends.


Is term life insurance right for you?
Term life insurance can be an attractive choice if you’re looking for:

A high level of coverage when dollars are tight. One of the biggest advantages of term life insurance is its lower initial cost when compared to permanent life insurance. This enables you to buy high levels of coverage for a set amount of time when you need it most.
Protection to meet shorter-term needs. Depending on your situation, you may not need life insurance protection after you reach a certain age or stage of your life. For example, if you want to make sure your mortgage is paid off or your children are able to pay for college should something happen to you, term life insurance can help provide protection for only the years you need.
A policy that can be customized. Term life insurance offers a high level of flexibility. You choose the amount of death benefit protection you want and the length of the term (usually 10 or 20 years).

Learn more about our term products.
Term First, Permanent Later
Because of its affordability, many of our clients start by purchasing term life insurance and then, as their wealth and assets grow, convert some or all of their policy to permanent life insurance to give their family an even greater level of financial security. Many term life insurance policies come with the ability to convert to permanent insurance without having to take an additional health exam. That means if you convert to permanent insurance, your new premiums are based on your health status when you initially bought your term policy.1 A Northwestern Mutual financial professional can share more about the benefits of term-to-permanent conversion.







The Northwestern Mutual Difference


For nearly 160 years, Northwestern Mutual has helped policyowners meet life’s challenges. We have the highest financial strength ratings awarded to any life insurer by all four of the major credit rating agencies.2 We pay industry-leading dividends3, which many policyowners use to increase the value of their policies. Our clients believe in us and return for more. In a typical year existing clients account for more than half of our life insurance sales.4

History[edit]
Northwestern Mutual was founded as the Mutual Life Insurance Company of the State of Wisconsin on March 2, 1857. Originally located in Janesville, Wisconsin, the fledgling company relocated to Milwaukee in 1859. Shortly after, the company experienced its first two death claims, when an excursion train traveling from Janesville to Fond du Lac, Wisconsin derailed, killing 14 people, two of whom were policy owners.[citation needed] With losses amounting to $3,500 and having funds of only $2,000, company President Samuel Daggett and Treasurer Charles Nash personally borrowed the needed funds to pay the claims immediately.
Following the accident, the company saw a rapid increase in its sales and an expansion into new markets. By 1865, it was operating throughout the Midwest and had entered the market along the Eastern Seaboard. To reflect this increased presence, the board of trustees changed the company’s name to The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company. In 1864, the company paid its first dividends to policy owners. It again paid dividends in 1867 and 1870, and has done so annually since 1872.[3]
Throughout the early years of the 20th century, Northwestern Mutual focused on life insurance. At the same time, the company worked to increase its accountability. In 1907, company leaders invited policy owners who were not trustees to probe into finances for accountability. This unique tradition has continued to the present day; members of the Policy owners’ Examining Committee have unrestricted access to evaluate Northwestern Mutual’s operations, management and strategic plans independently.[4]
In 1969, the company began offering disability income insurance. Less than a decade later, a series of retirement annuities were introduced for the employee benefits market. In the 1990s, the company saw further growth with the introduction of its long-term care insurance. In 2000, the company changed its name to reflect this broadening of its product offerings to just Northwestern Mutual.[5]
A year later, in 2001, the company continued to expand its product and service offerings by launching a wholly owned subsidiary known today as Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company (NMWMC), a federal savings bank. Through NMWMC, the company offers a range of financial planning products and services including investment management, fee-based financial planning, business retirement plans, and trust and private client services.[2]
In 2015, Northwestern Mutual began construction of Northwestern Mutual Tower and Commons.[6][7]
On March 25, 2015, Northwestern Mutual bought financial planning company LearnVest for more than $250 million.[8]
Financial Standings[edit]
Northwestern Mutual has received the following industry ratings: A.M. Best Company, A++ (highest), 4/2017;[9] Fitch Ratings, AAA (highest), 5/2016;[10] Moody's Investors Service, Aaa (highest), 8/2015;[11] and an S&P Global Ratings of AA+ (second highest), 6/2016.[12]
Company subsidiary, Northwestern Mutual Investment Services, LLC (NMIS), created in 1968, is ranked 6th among independent broker-dealers.[13]

History[edit]
Northwestern Mutual was founded as the Mutual Life Insurance Company of the State of Wisconsin on March 2, 1857. Originally located in Janesville, Wisconsin, the fledgling company relocated to Milwaukee in 1859. Shortly after, the company experienced its first two death claims, when an excursion train traveling from Janesville to Fond du Lac, Wisconsin derailed, killing 14 people, two of whom were policy owners.[citation needed] With losses amounting to $3,500 and having funds of only $2,000, company President Samuel Daggett and Treasurer Charles Nash personally borrowed the needed funds to pay the claims immediately.
Following the accident, the company saw a rapid increase in its sales and an expansion into new markets. By 1865, it was operating throughout the Midwest and had entered the market along the Eastern Seaboard. To reflect this increased presence, the board of trustees changed the company’s name to The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company. In 1864, the company paid its first dividends to policy owners. It again paid dividends in 1867 and 1870, and has done so annually since 1872.[3]
Throughout the early years of the 20th century, Northwestern Mutual focused on life insurance. At the same time, the company worked to increase its accountability. In 1907, company leaders invited policy owners who were not trustees to probe into finances for accountability. This unique tradition has continued to the present day; members of the Policy owners’ Examining Committee have unrestricted access to evaluate Northwestern Mutual’s operations, management and strategic plans independently.[4]
In 1969, the company began offering disability income insurance. Less than a decade later, a series of retirement annuities were introduced for the employee benefits market. In the 1990s, the company saw further growth with the introduction of its long-term care insurance. In 2000, the company changed its name to reflect this broadening of its product offerings to just Northwestern Mutual.[5]
A year later, in 2001, the company continued to expand its product and service offerings by launching a wholly owned subsidiary known today as Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company (NMWMC), a federal savings bank. Through NMWMC, the company offers a range of financial planning products and services including investment management, fee-based financial planning, business retirement plans, and trust and private client services.[2]
In 2015, Northwestern Mutual began construction of Northwestern Mutual Tower and Commons.[6][7]
On March 25, 2015, Northwestern Mutual bought financial planning company LearnVest for more than $250 million.[8]
Financial Standings[edit]
Northwestern Mutual has received the following industry ratings: A.M. Best Company, A++ (highest), 4/2017;[9] Fitch Ratings, AAA (highest), 5/2016;[10] Moody's Investors Service, Aaa (highest), 8/2015;[11] and an S&P Global Ratings of AA+ (second highest), 6/2016.[12]
Company subsidiary, Northwestern Mutual Investment Services, LLC (NMIS), created in 1968, is ranked 6th among independent broker-dealers.[13]

Life insurance: Why it matters and how to shop for it


You work hard to provide a good life for your family, and you'd do anything to protect them. But what would happen to them financially if you died tomorrow?
If the answer troubles you, then you need life insurance. Life insurance provides a safety net tomorrow for the loved ones who depend on you today.
But where should you start? There are two main types of coverage are available: term life and permanent life insurance. The first step is to decide which of these suits you best.
Term vs. permanent life insurance
Term life insurance covers you for a certain period, such as 10, 15 or 20 years. Buyers typically choose a policy that covers them until their mortgages and other debts are paid off, or the kids have graduated from college and are living independently.
Term life is fairly straightforward, compared to permanent life, and it's less expensive than a permanent life policy. The average cost of a 20-year, $250,000 term life policy for a healthy 30-year-old is about $160 a year, roughly the cost of one latte per week, according to LIMRA and the LIFE Foundation.
A term life policy pays out if you die during the term while the coverage is in effect. Then your beneficiary collects the proceeds, called the "death benefit." You can't cash in the policy while you're still alive. With term life you risk buying something that your family might never end up using, but in return you gain the peace of mind of knowing they'd be OK if you died unexpectedly.
Permanent life insurance, such as whole life or universal life, covers you for the rest of your life. The policy pays the death benefit to your beneficiary whether you die tomorrow or in 50 years.
Permanent life insurance also includes an investment component, known as "cash value." The cash value of the policy starts off small and then gradually grows tax-free. If you hold onto the policy for many years, the cash account becomes a nest egg. You can borrow from the cash value -- the policy stays in effect as long as you repay the money, plus interest -- or surrender the policy for the cash.
Because of its cash value and lifelong coverage, permanent life insurance is pricier and more complex than term life. Some policies even provide long-term care benefits.
Which type of life insurance should you buy?
Choose term life insurance if you:

Need coverage only until a certain age (say, the age when your youngest child graduates college).
Have no dependents who will need financial help for the rest of their lives.
Don't own a family business or have a large estate to protect.
Want the most affordable type of coverage available.

Choose permanent life insurance if you:

Want to provide for lifelong dependents, such as a child with special needs.
Need to protect a large estate or family business from estate taxes.
Want to leave a legacy.
Want to provide loved ones with money for your final expenses, such as medical bills and funeral costs, no matter when you die.

How much life insurance should you buy?
Beware of easy formulas, such as multiplying your annual income by a certain number. Instead, do a thorough needs analysis. Determine how much your family would need to pay your final expenses, such as funeral costs, and how much your loved ones would need over the long haul to maintain their quality of life. Consider big expenses, such as paying off the mortgage and other debts, and funding your children's college educations.
Both parents should be insured -- not just the primary breadwinner. To determine the amount of insurance for a stay-at-home parent, consider how much it would cost to replace the services that parent provides, such as day care and other household tasks.
Don't assume your group life insurance through work will provide all the coverage you need. Most group life policies are small, and the coverage ends when your job ends. Roughly four in 10 insured married people depend solely on group life policies, according to LIMRA.
Life insurance rates
Life insurance premiums vary according to the type of policy, amount of coverage and the insurer, as well as your age and health.
That's why it's important to buy coverage sooner rather than later. The longer you wait, the higher the premiums will be and the greater the risk that you could develop a health condition that will disqualify you from coverage. Besides comparing policies, evaluate insurance companies. Insure.com's Best Life Insurance Companies Tool can help you sort through leading companies based on their customers’ reviews.
Unsure about the cost of life insurance? Get a no-obligation quote
If you’re interested in learning how much life insurance will cost for you, a sensible first step is to request some quotes. This will give you a sense of how much life insurance you can afford, and which companies are likely to be your best bets for coverage.
Insure.com compiles data from numerous leading life insurance companies to help you compare quotes easily and quickly. You can start comparing quotes by filling in your information at the top of this page.  
When it comes to securing life insurance, the first steps can be among the hardest. But if you take them today, you’ll be that much closer to knowing that your loved ones will be supported in the event of your death.
And there’s really no substitute for that knowledge.

A.M. Best Disclaimer & Ratings Definitions
                                




Methodology
Insure.com commissioned Op4G to survey more than 3,700 insurance customers nationwide in June 2016. The survey collected customer ratings for 20 leading companies in the auto category and 15 leading companies in each of the home, health and life categories. Only current customers of the insurers on our lists were surveyed, and the survey was not open to the general public on the Insure.com website.
Auto, home and health insurers were ranked according to a weighted 5-point measurement of the following factors: customer service, claims processing, value for price, would recommend and would renew. Life insurers were rated on a weighted 5-point measurement on customer service, value for price, and would recommend. Weighted measurements were derived from surveyed policyholders’ rank of prioritization of these factors.
The A.M. Best ratings, discounts and coverage options noted in the survey do not affect the scores, but are provided as a supplementary resource.
Insure.com makes these ratings freely available via this site. The views and opinions expressed by users do not reflect the views and opinions of Insure.com. Insure.com expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection with the ratings.

History[edit]
Northwestern Mutual was founded as the Mutual Life Insurance Company of the State of Wisconsin on March 2, 1857. Originally located in Janesville, Wisconsin, the fledgling company relocated to Milwaukee in 1859. Shortly after, the company experienced its first two death claims, when an excursion train traveling from Janesville to Fond du Lac, Wisconsin derailed, killing 14 people, two of whom were policy owners.[citation needed] With losses amounting to $3,500 and having funds of only $2,000, company President Samuel Daggett and Treasurer Charles Nash personally borrowed the needed funds to pay the claims immediately.
Following the accident, the company saw a rapid increase in its sales and an expansion into new markets. By 1865, it was operating throughout the Midwest and had entered the market along the Eastern Seaboard. To reflect this increased presence, the board of trustees changed the company’s name to The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company. In 1864, the company paid its first dividends to policy owners. It again paid dividends in 1867 and 1870, and has done so annually since 1872.[3]
Throughout the early years of the 20th century, Northwestern Mutual focused on life insurance. At the same time, the company worked to increase its accountability. In 1907, company leaders invited policy owners who were not trustees to probe into finances for accountability. This unique tradition has continued to the present day; members of the Policy owners’ Examining Committee have unrestricted access to evaluate Northwestern Mutual’s operations, management and strategic plans independently.[4]
In 1969, the company began offering disability income insurance. Less than a decade later, a series of retirement annuities were introduced for the employee benefits market. In the 1990s, the company saw further growth with the introduction of its long-term care insurance. In 2000, the company changed its name to reflect this broadening of its product offerings to just Northwestern Mutual.[5]
A year later, in 2001, the company continued to expand its product and service offerings by launching a wholly owned subsidiary known today as Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company (NMWMC), a federal savings bank. Through NMWMC, the company offers a range of financial planning products and services including investment management, fee-based financial planning, business retirement plans, and trust and private client services.[2]
In 2015, Northwestern Mutual began construction of Northwestern Mutual Tower and Commons.[6][7]
On March 25, 2015, Northwestern Mutual bought financial planning company LearnVest for more than $250 million.[8]
Financial Standings[edit]
Northwestern Mutual has received the following industry ratings: A.M. Best Company, A++ (highest), 4/2017;[9] Fitch Ratings, AAA (highest), 5/2016;[10] Moody's Investors Service, Aaa (highest), 8/2015;[11] and an S&P Global Ratings of AA+ (second highest), 6/2016.[12]
Company subsidiary, Northwestern Mutual Investment Services, LLC (NMIS), created in 1968, is ranked 6th among independent broker-dealers.[13]

History[edit]
Northwestern Mutual was founded as the Mutual Life Insurance Company of the State of Wisconsin on March 2, 1857. Originally located in Janesville, Wisconsin, the fledgling company relocated to Milwaukee in 1859. Shortly after, the company experienced its first two death claims, when an excursion train traveling from Janesville to Fond du Lac, Wisconsin derailed, killing 14 people, two of whom were policy owners.[citation needed] With losses amounting to $3,500 and having funds of only $2,000, company President Samuel Daggett and Treasurer Charles Nash personally borrowed the needed funds to pay the claims immediately.
Following the accident, the company saw a rapid increase in its sales and an expansion into new markets. By 1865, it was operating throughout the Midwest and had entered the market along the Eastern Seaboard. To reflect this increased presence, the board of trustees changed the company’s name to The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company. In 1864, the company paid its first dividends to policy owners. It again paid dividends in 1867 and 1870, and has done so annually since 1872.[3]
Throughout the early years of the 20th century, Northwestern Mutual focused on life insurance. At the same time, the company worked to increase its accountability. In 1907, company leaders invited policy owners who were not trustees to probe into finances for accountability. This unique tradition has continued to the present day; members of the Policy owners’ Examining Committee have unrestricted access to evaluate Northwestern Mutual’s operations, management and strategic plans independently.[4]
In 1969, the company began offering disability income insurance. Less than a decade later, a series of retirement annuities were introduced for the employee benefits market. In the 1990s, the company saw further growth with the introduction of its long-term care insurance. In 2000, the company changed its name to reflect this broadening of its product offerings to just Northwestern Mutual.[5]
A year later, in 2001, the company continued to expand its product and service offerings by launching a wholly owned subsidiary known today as Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company (NMWMC), a federal savings bank. Through NMWMC, the company offers a range of financial planning products and services including investment management, fee-based financial planning, business retirement plans, and trust and private client services.[2]
In 2015, Northwestern Mutual began construction of Northwestern Mutual Tower and Commons.[6][7]
On March 25, 2015, Northwestern Mutual bought financial planning company LearnVest for more than $250 million.[8]
Financial Standings[edit]
Northwestern Mutual has received the following industry ratings: A.M. Best Company, A++ (highest), 4/2017;[9] Fitch Ratings, AAA (highest), 5/2016;[10] Moody's Investors Service, Aaa (highest), 8/2015;[11] and an S&P Global Ratings of AA+ (second highest), 6/2016.[12]
Company subsidiary, Northwestern Mutual Investment Services, LLC (NMIS), created in 1968, is ranked 6th among independent broker-dealers.[13]

Consumer Tip: Lifely Term is a term life insurance product issued with limited underwriting and limited medical evidence of insurability. You may be able to purchase other life insurance products (including our other term life products) for substantially less cost if you apply for a life insurance product with full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability. However, if you submit to full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability, you may be required to pay more for a fully underwritten product that if you purchased a Lifely Term policy.

FAQ
These FAQs provide some information about Lifely Term and about life insurance generally. Only a policy will have complete details on how the policy works, how to qualify for benefits, what restrictions or limitations apply, and terms for keeping the policy in effect. 
What else should I know about life insurance?


What is term insurance?

Term insurance is a type of life insurance that provides protection for a set period of time. If you (the insured person) die during this period, the policy will pay a death benefit to the person or people you designate; these are called your beneficiaries. 
With Lifely Term, you can choose a term period of 10, 15, or 20 years. The policy and death benefit coverage end when the term period expires. The policy is not convertible to another policy, it does not have cash value and it does not have a return of premium feature.


What is a premium?

Premiums are the amounts you pay to begin your policy and keep it in effect. 
For Lifely Term, your premium is automatically deducted each month from the bank account you choose.

What happens if I miss a payment?

Your policy will enter a grace period. If you do not pay your premium by the end of the grace period shown in your policy, your policy will end without value and you will no longer be covered.

How do I know which term period to select?

Think about the reasons you’re purchasing the policy. Consider not only the expenses you want to help ensure your family will be able to pay without your income but also for how long they will still rely on your financial support.
Also consider that life insurance generally becomes more expensive as one gets older.  Once your policy ends, if you want to buy another policy, you typically will need to qualify again. In the time between policies, your health may change, perhaps causing you to pay a higher premium or even be denied coverage later on.

How do I know which death benefit payment period to choose?

For how many years after your death will your family need the financial support of this policy’s death benefit? The answer to this question will guide you.

How does the death benefit get paid to my beneficiaries?

The death benefit will be paid to your beneficiaries in monthly payments. These payments will be for the benefit amount you choose and for the number of years you select.
With Lifely Term, you can choose the benefit payment period—the number of years that you’d like your beneficiaries to receive payments from this policy if you pass away. You can choose benefit payment periods of 10, 15, 20, or 30 years. Please note that you cannot change the payment period after the policy is issued.

Will the monthly death benefit be taxed?

Yes. Although the death benefit of most other life insurance policies is paid out generally free of federal income tax, a portion of Lifely Term's benefit, which is paid out monthly as chosen when you apply, will be considered income to your beneficiary for income tax purposes. Please keep this in mind when considering Lifely Term.

Are death benefits paid out as the result of a suicide?

In general, if the insured person dies by suicide in the first two years from when the policy is issued, the policy will end and all premiums will be returned. A new suicide exclusion period may begin if we agree to reinstate a policy that ends because of a missed premium payment.

Why are you asking about my health and lifestyle?

We use information about your health and habits to determine your eligibility for the policy.

What if I want to change or add beneficiaries later?

As a policyholder, you can change your beneficiary designation at any time and as often as you’d like by contacting Customer Service at 844-499-0771.

If I die, when will my beneficiaries receive the money?

Monthly payment of benefits will begin after we receive proof of death and the forms we require.

When does my coverage start?

Assuming your policy is approved, coverage begins immediately once we have received your first payment and your signed acceptance of your policy.

Can I cancel my policy at any time?

Yes. Please refer to your policy for cancellation details or call Customer Service at 844-499-0771.

Where does the information come from?

We are able to search public records, such as county or city records.  We do not access or affect your credit file.

How can you check my identity online?

We are able to search public records, such as county or city records.  We do not access or affect your credit file.

What do you do with the answers?

The information you provide is used only to verify your identity.  We do not maintain a record of the information reviewed while verifying your identity.

How does Prudential protect my personal information?

Prudential respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. Please select the Customer Privacy Notice button that appears on the bottom of this website's pages to view our privacy statement.

How can I be sure my privacy is protected?

Prudential respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. Please select the Customer Privacy Notice button that appears on the bottom of this website's pages to view our privacy statement.

What is an eSignature?

Whenever you apply for a life insurance policy, you need to sign a few documents during the process. Since this process is over the Internet and you cannot physically sign the documents, we use electronic signature, or eSignature, to get your signature.

Lifely Term (PCT-2016) is issued in California by Pruco Life Insurance Company, Newark, NJ.

What else should i know about life insurance?


THE BENEFITS OF LIFE INSURANCE
If you're like most people, you don't want to think about the possibility of dying. You expect to live for a long time and purchasing life insurance is not your first priority. But, have you considered the consequences of not having life insurance?   Because of the many different types of life insurance products available, making the right choice appears to be complicated, but it needn't be so. 


WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF INSURANCE?
There are two basic types of life insurance: term life insurance and permanent life insurance.  Term Life Insurance is an attractive solution to help protect you and your family with affordable and flexible policy options.
Term insurance can provide inexpensive coverage to meet specific needs.  It provides a stated benefit when you pass away, provided your death occurs within a specified time period. Term life insurance does not provide any benefits in case of disability or accidental injury.  In general, term products do not have cash values available for loan or withdrawal. Term life insurance premiums are generally lower for a period of time. After this period, some term policies end while others may be renewed, but with dramatically higher premiums. Purchasing a new policy after the end of your term period can be very expensive and you may have to have a medical exam to prove insurability.
Term is often considered appropriate when coverage is only required for a specific period of time; for instance, until your children graduate from college. The benefits can be used to replace income you would have earned to help pay off a mortgage or help maintain your family's lifestyle, for example. In addition, benefits can help cover funeral expenses.
Return of premium term is a slightly different type of term insurance. Premiums tend to be higher with the benefit being that the premiums paid are returned to you at the end of the level term period, provided you meet the conditions set by the insurance company.
Some term insurance policies include a conversion privilege. This benefit gives you the option to convert your term policy to a permanent policy before the end of the conversion period without having to take another medical exam to be approved for coverage. However, in most cases, premiums for the permanent policy will be higher than the premiums you've been paying for the term policy.
Permanent insurance can cover you for as long as you live (as long as you pay sufficient premiums and there are no substantial loans or withdrawals). The premiums are generally higher than term insurance during the term period. After this period, however, premiums for a permanent policy may be less than term policy premiums. 
Permanent insurance combines the security of insurance protection with the ability to accumulate some cash values inside the policy. These funds are generally allowed to grow within the policy on a tax-deferred basis and may be used to supplement income, or meet emergency or other financial needs in the future. These values may be accessed through policy loans or withdrawals during the insured's lifetime.  Please note that, although you can use the cash value of your whole life insurance for these purposes, the primary reason for purchasing life insurance should be for the death benefit it provides.
Also keep in mind that unpaid loans and withdrawals will reduce future cash value, policy benefits and guarantees. Under certain circumstances withdrawals may be taxable; loans are generally not taxable. Any loans that are outstanding when a policy lapses or is surrendered will cause immediate taxation on the amount loaned in excess of the premium paid¹.  Any outstanding loans at the time of death will be deducted from the proceeds of the death benefit along with any accrued interest on the loan.
There are three types of permanent life insurance: 1) traditional (or "classic" ); 2) universal (also called "flexible premium" or "adjustable" ); 3) variable.  All types offer cash values and guaranteed death benefits. Traditional and universal life policies offer cash values that are a combination of guaranteed and non-guaranteed elements. The non-guaranteed elements usually include any dividends earned (traditional) or earnings in excess of the contractually guaranteed cash values (universal).
While most variable life policies also provide a guaranteed death benefit, the cash value of a variable life insurance policy is not guaranteed and fluctuates based on the performance of the underlying investment options that you choose. Because you bear the investment risk as opposed to the insurance company, variable life is considered a "security," subject to federal securities laws and protections, and is sold by prospectus. With a variable life insurance policy, the guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of the applicable issuing company and they do not apply to the investment performance or safety of the underlying subaccounts in the particular policy.


CONSIDERATIONS
There are some risks you should consider when purchasing life insurance.  These are:

Insurability Risk
Inadequate Coverage Risk
Premium Risk
Cash Value Accumulation Risk

Most people have a certain risk threshold - a comfort zone.  To manage your zone, it is helpful to understand the risks present in each situation and how they may apply to you.

Insurability Risk
Life insurance premiums are based on age and health.  The younger and healthier you are, the more inexpensive it is.  As you age, life insurance becomes more costly.  Typically you become less healthy over time; in addition, serious illnesses can strike at any time.  This could affect your ability to purchase life insurance in the future, or the premiums you pay.  This is called "insurability risk". 
Permanent insurance has a lower degree of insurability risk because coverage lasts throughout your lifetime without having to reapply, as long as you pay premiums when due and there are no substantial loans or withdrawals (though some variable life policies provide no guaranteed coverage). Buying permanent insurance when you are young and healthy can lock in lower premiums for life.
Some term insurance, with no conversion privilege, has a higher degree of insurability risk because your insurance coverage lasts for only a specified period of time (such as ten years). 

Inadequate Coverage Risk
Unfortunately death is a certainty.  Life insurance provides your beneficiaries with money to help meet their current and future financial obligations.  They may use the funds to pay off debts, cover college costs, continue your business or manage other financial obligations.  Without sufficient money to meet these obligations, your beneficiaries may be left with credit card bills or outstanding loans, or may be forced to alter their lifestyles significantly.
You have taken an important first step by considering the purchase of insurance at this time.  We encourage you to regularly and carefully evaluate whether your insurance portfolio is right for you given your financial status, objectives, obligations, and risk tolerance at any point in time.  It's no secret that as your life changes, your needs change too. 

Premium Risk
The two questions most people ask when considering the purchase of life insurance are: "How will I pay for this now?" and "Will I be able to afford this in the future?"
When considering which type of insurance is right for you, there are two risks associated with premium payments that you should think about: one, premiums may increase in the future; and two, premiums may need to be paid longer than you expected. These risks are called "premium risk".
From the perspective of being able to cover current premium payments, term insurance has a lower degree of premium risk because its initial cost is generally lower than of permanent insurance.  From the perspective of affording premium payments in the future, particularly if you need coverage longer than you initially thought, term insurance has a higher degree of premium risk.  The reason for this is that if you purchase new coverage in the future, as discussed earlier, premium costs become higher the older you become.  Health impairments may also increase the cost of new coverage.  And if you choose to keep your original term product, the premiums may increase sharply after the initial level term period.

Cash Value Accumulation Risk
If you are like most people, you have two distinct needs-one for a death benefit and the other to accumulate funds to meet life's expenses as they arise. A life insurance policy definitely meets the first need.  Although the primary reason to purchase life insurance is for the death benefit protection, some types of life insurance may also provide you the opportunity to accumulate accessible cash value within the policy itself. 
Permanent life insurance is the type of product that can accumulate cash values. These cash values may be accessed via loans and/or withdrawals to help in any number of ways, including paying off your mortgage early, supplementing your retirement income, or taking advantage of potential business opportunities. (Remember that withdrawals and loans will reduce policy cash values and the death benefit and may have tax consequences.)  However, you need to be aware of the costs and expenses that are associated with the policy that you purchase, and how these may impact the growth of your cash value.
Some types of permanent insurance actually allow you to pay more premiums than required to help give a boost to your cash values.  However , there is a limit on just how much you can pay into the policy; if you put in too much money, it becomes more expensive to access the cash values.  Your policy has now become a Modified Endowment Contract (MEC).  Instead of being able to withdraw up to basis (the amount equal to the premiums you have paid) and then borrow the balance of your accumulated cash values, all value you access will be taxable to the extent of income in the policy and there may be an additional 10% federal income tax on distributions prior to age 59½. 
One way that many people use to meet both their need of death benefit protection and their need for additional cash is to buy a lower cost term insurance product and then save or invest the difference between the term insurance cost and the permanent insurance cost.  The earlier you are able to put aside some funds the better as you may receive the positive affects of compound interest growth on your money.  The longer you delay, the greater your risk becomes in not being able to accumulate the funds you need.  This approach requires a commitment to regularly set money aside for savings.  This commitment may be difficult to meet when unexpected expenses arise and may not be for everyone.


MAKING YOUR DECISION
Now that you are a little more knowledgeable, take a look at your personal situation, consider the types of insurance available to you and make the decision that works for you and your family. 
Everyone has their own goals for personal financial security and the important thing is that you progress towards achieving your goals. You may wish to maximize your insurance coverage today or you may wish to purchase a policy you can "personalize" to meet your needs by adding riders that provide you with additional insurance coverage. You may wish to purchase a permanent life insurance policy and supplement it with term insurance for additional coverage during a particular period of time. For example, you may want extra protection during certain years such as coverage to help cover payments on a mortgage, or added protection for your children or spouse.
Look at your options and determine what works for you.  We're here to help.

Hi. Welcome to Lifely by Prudential! Thanks for stopping by.You may be wondering what Lifely is — and that's a good question. Lifely by Prudential is a program aimed to make purchasing life insurance easier.  We are trying to think differently about life insurance for today's consumer. To that end, we introduce Lifely Term, a policy offered by Pruco Life Insurance Company, a Prudential Financial company.  
 
When You Take Care of the Ones You Love, You Take Care of the World. 
 
There's an old adage in the insurance world that "Life insurance is sold, not bought." But we think that times are changing, and people today are more informed and more in control of their financial future. You know you need life insurance, right? So, we set out to design a way for you to be able to access, learn about, and purchase life insurance that makes it easy. We know that life insurance can be difficult to understand, can make you feel like you don't know where to start, and sometimes can turn people away (We have to mention "death." That’s uncomfortable.) 
So we're trying to change all of that. 
You are thinking big about your impact on the world and constantly looking for small ways to improve the world we live in. We want to help you understand that, by protecting the ones you love with life insurance, you can free them to go on to do great things for this world after you’re gone. Maybe even make all of humanity a little better. The way we see it, when you take care of the ones you love, you take care of the world. It's just that simple. 
 
Quick. Click. Insure our Humanity. 

Lifely Term is a practical life insurance policy designed with you in mind. The process is easy (online) and easy to understand (Just answer a few simple questions), and a policy is easy to purchase (Get it done today!). 
Right now, Lifely Term is available only in the state of California. (Sorry, remaining 49 states! We hope to be available to you soon!)
Thanks for coming by. We hope you stick around and maybe even help insure our humanity.
Lifely is a brand name of The Prudential Insurance Company of America and its subsidiaries.
Lifely Term (PCT-2016) is issued in California by the Pruco Life Insurance Company, located in Newark, NJ. The Pruco Life Insurance Company and The Prudential Insurance Company of America are Prudential Financial companies and each is solely responsible for its own financial condition and contractual obligations.

Life Insurance




There’s more to life insurance than taking care of loved ones if you pass away. 

Life insurance can also be an essential part of a financial plan. In addition to helping to protect loved ones financially with a death benefit, some products can grow money on a tax-advantaged basis that can be used during one’s lifetime. The ability to meet more than one need makes life insurance a product that adds valuable flexibility to any portfolio.

Talk to your financial professional if you think life insurance might be right for you.















                                Our easy-to-use tool can help guide you to start the conversation around life insurance with your financial professional. 
 

















Types of Life Insurance





Permanent Life Insurance
Provides coverage that lasts a lifetime and can build cash value that can be used while living. 



Term Life Insurance
Provides coverage for a specific length of time and provides the most payout for the money, but does not build cash value.

















Permanent Life Insurance
Permanent life insurance is designed to provide coverage for life. Many permanent life insurance products also have a feature called cash value. This cash value can grow over time through interest credits, market returns, or dividends, providing money that can be used for a variety of needs.  

Permanent life insurance products include: Universal Life, Indexed Universal Life, Whole Life, and Variable Universal Life.







Premier Accumulator Universal Life
Can grow cash value quickly and allows faster access to your money when you need it.
Learn More 
.


















Term Life Insurance
Term life insurance covers you for a fixed number of years, such as 1, 5, 10, 20, or 30 and pays a death benefit if you pass away during the covered time period. Most term insurance policies offer a level premium, death benefit, and the ability to convert to a permanent policy if your needs change. You can also choose coverage for current needs and add optional riders for future needs.







Guaranteed Level Term
Available in coverage amounts of $1 million or more, with premiums guaranteed to stay the same throughout the level premium period.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
