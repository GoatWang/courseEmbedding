Bursting...Julie likedPhotoJulie sharedSee all activitySummaryFun, rewarding and exciting- my working life at Jones Interiors is all about giving our customers the best possible products and service.I joined the company 29 years ago when the interiors division of Jones was a new venture. Since then, I've been privileged to see my own career develop and grow alongside the business. Jones Interiors provides products and services to the soft furnishings industry and has grown to become a market leader in the supply of fabrics, linings, trimmings, curtain poles and tracks and blind systems.I've always had a hands-on role. In the early days, I pitched in with sales calls as well as helping out in the operational side of the business, progressing though several management and field sales roles. Now, as MD, I have taken on responsibility for many areas of the business including managing our people, cost control, strategy, sales, marketing, branding, product sourcing and development – they're all part of my remit in fulfilling the Jones promise of great value and quality with a friendly service.Our success is built on our collective strengths. As a team, we have great industry awareness and can spot trends quickly. It's this experience, integrity and knowledge, together with our honesty and sense of fun that our customers most value in us.Managing such a motivated team is a pleasure. Like me, everyone at Jones Interiors likes to work hard, play hard and explore every opportunity for the benefit of our clients. We share a common ambition for the business to succeed.ExperienceManaging DirectorJones InteriorsMarch 1988  –  Present (29 years 5 months)Nottingham, United KingdomA business division of Jones & Co (Nottingham) Ltd.www.jones-interiors.comCompany DirectorJones & Co (Nottingham) LtdMarch 1988  –  Present (29 years 5 months)Nottingham, United KingdomQuality ManagerCourtaulds Clothing1984  –  1988 (4 years)Derby, United KingdomProduction SupervisorCourtaulds Clothing1982  –  1984 (2 years)Derby, United KingdomQuality ControllerCourtaulds Clothing1980  –  1982 (2 years)Derby, United KingdomEducationDerby CollegeSkillsProduct DevelopmentManufacturingContinuous ImprovementQuality ManagementQuality SystemStrategic PlanningDirectors & Officers LiabilityBusiness PlanningTeam LeadershipPerformance ImprovementStrategic VisionOrganizational EffectivenessNegotiationMarketing StrategyAccount ManagementSee 10+Change ManagementSales ManagementSupply Chain ManagementRetailTextilesCustomer ServiceBusiness StrategyNew Business DevelopmentManagementBusiness DevelopmentSee lessHow's this translation?Great•Has errorsThanks for your help!RecommendationsA preview of what LinkedIn members have to say about Julie:We are all busy people with our own business agendas, but working with Julie and her team at Jones reminds you that taking the time to show appreciation to others is so important.

I truly love this product, and I'm definitely a skeptic when it comes to skincare products, because I have tried so many. I struggle with sun damage and major hyper pigmentation, and maybe its the Vitamin E and C in this serum, but it's really evened out my skin tone, and I'm excited to continue using it and see the progress. I think with these products, it really may be possible to achieve that 'perfect' skin tone we all desire!

FIRMING NECK & DÉCOLLETÉ CREAM
	1 fl. oz./30 mL





	Give your neck and décolleté the ultimate boost! Powerful peptides help tighten and smooth the skin’s appearance, while amino acids help repair, tone, and support the skin’s health to improve the contours of the neck, chin, jawline, and décolleté. Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamin C help keep skin supple and firm.





Advice From Dr. Jessica Wu
Don’t forget to take care of your neck and chest. Start using Up, Up, & Away Firming Neck & Décolleté Cream every morning and night to improve the contours of your neck, jawline, and chest. The skin on your neck has few oil glands, so it can look especially crepey in the winter. I suggest using Up, Up & Away, which contains peptides and Vitamin C to help strengthen the skin on the neck and chest.

My husband bought this product for me at Christmas time.  I love it for the way my neck looks thighter. When I used this product it felt like I had not put any product on. It does not leave a feeling that doesn't weigh your skin down. Love Love Love This product. Thank Robin,

	POWER PEPTIDE EYE CREAM

	Fight visible signs of aging on multiple levels. This peptide-enhanced eye cream with unique soft focus technology is packed with Persian Silk Tree extract, potent humectants and Apple Fruit extract. See the appearance of dark circles, fine lines and wrinkles diminish all while helping promote healthy collagen.





Advice From Dr. Jessica Wu
Sleep deprivation has been shown to worsen fine lines and wrinkles, so be sure to smooth on eye cream as soon as you wake up. I suggest using an eye cream with peptides, to help strengthen the collagen in the thin eyelid skin. Try The Eyes Have It Power Peptide Eye Cream, which contains peptides and antioxidants to protect the delicate eye area.

I have tried so many of the advirtised 'wrinkles will vanish' creams, and wasted so much money...that I did not have, but I took a chance on Revelation and am speechless. I am 62, in August 63, and did not think there was anything out there that would actually do what they said it would to my complection and wrinkles, but there is! REVELATION! does it all! I took a bfore picture but have to take an after and I will post it. Robin, I could not look in the mirror as looking at my skin condition so depressed me, honestly I would cry at how I looked. Would not go anywhere either. I hated my face so much......But now I am not afraid of looking in the mirror thanks to you and Revelation!! The Eyes Have It! is a miracle, and the skin brightening night cream have changed my face. It is unbelievable! God Bless You and thank you.

BROAD SPECTRUM SPF 50 MOISTURIZER & SUNSCREEN
	1.7 fl. oz./ 50 mL





	Protection at its finest! Treat your skin to a multifaceted formula that boosts hydration, helps promote healthy collagen and defends skin from the harmful exposure of UVA and UVB rays. Potent ingredients like Vitamin C, CoQ10 and Peptides helps provide skin with free radical protection and an essential moisture surge to keep your skin feeling hydrated, looking plump and youthful. Let your inner glow shine all day long.





Advice From Dr. Jessica Wu
Our 50 Fierce Broad Spectrum SPF 50 Moisturizer & Sunscreen not only protects you from sunburns, it also protects against the UVA (aging) rays that break down collagen and lead to premature aging. Be sure to apply to the back of your neck and top of your ears if you wear your hair up, and also on your neck, chest, and back of your hands – areas that people often skip. It’s especially important to use sunscreen if you’re using a retinoid or vitamin C product which can make your skin more sun sensitive.

I get really nervous about what I put on my face because I'm really oily and acne prone, and I have this thing in my head that everything is gong to make me break out, especially sunscreen. I have tried a few, and they have made me break out a little bit and this one does not at all, and it doesn't feel like its clogging my pores. This leaves me feeling hydrated and I love that it's protecting me as well, but feels like a moisturizer and not a suncreen. Love love this product.

hydra qwench is my FAVORITE moisturizer.  it is super hydrating but should not be used during the day. It is too heavy for under makeup/daytime wear. I use it with the retinol serum to keep my skin from drying out.  LOVE!

Advice From Dr. Jessica Wu
Start with a retinoid serum to build collagen and elastic tissue. I recommend Welcome Back YOUth Retinol Serum, which has time-released retinol to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles with less irritation than other retinol serums. If you have sensitive skin, start by using it twice a week and work up to nightly as tolerated.

I was always scared to try a retinol product since i hear they can be harsh and dry out your skin.  I saw this one advertised with the night moisturizer and thought i should give it a try. it works really well and does not irritate my skin. I wake up glowing when i use it. I only use it 3 times a week.
