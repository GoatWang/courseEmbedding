PALM BEACH, Fla., March 16, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Virtual Piggy, creators of the only COPPA compliant technology aimed at providing payment capability for the under 18 market is changing its name to reflect the evolution of the company into broader payment-related markets. REGO Payment Architectures, Inc. (OTCQB: RPMT) becomes an umbrella under which the IP developed becomes available to many different industries beyond the under 18 market. "It's exciting to see the development process here, as we've solved some very complicated issues around Oink," says CEO John Coyne, "utilizing our proprietary technology, we believe that we have the opportunity to create something bigger here--beyond just the scope of the original market served by Oink. We believe that we have an opportunity to create revolutionary advancements in payment architecture."








REGO, is a Latin word that has multiple meanings and contexts.  First, it means "to administer" and the underlying architecture we have designed is replete with regulatory controls that assure the administration of full payment compliance.  Our payment architecture also allows sponsors to set the boundaries and conditions for the use of the payment platform.
REGO also means "to guide" and a central theme of REGO is to teach effective financial discipline and prepare users for a digital economy that moves and changes at a rapid pace.  We believe that REGO's platform framework makes it one of the most adaptable payment architectures yet created.   
Coyne further stated, "When I came on board as CEO, my goal was to transform the company from a card payment system to a mobile payment platform. I wanted to develop more than just a payment system for children--I wanted to create a business with multiple revenue sources that broaden our potential base of users and assure our investors that we are not just a one product company. This rebranding is a significant benchmark in our progress toward  fulfillment of that promise. REGO is the vehicle for that larger vision."
Founded on validated artificial intelligence techniques, REGO's core base of technology has broad capability to adapt to a broad range of payment markets and users.  This core technology comprises: ReTRO (Real Time Regulatory Oversight) a system of reasoning engines and a Contract Model (CM) that allows the creation of specific boundary conditions for its use. In totality, these underlying technologies make for a powerful and adaptive system.  Assuming we can complete our funding requirements, we believe that REGO is now poised to see significantly expanded market potential. 
"As part and parcel of the repositioning of our corporate image, we are restructuring the company to prepare for multiple market entry," says Coyne.  "REGO will be the holding company for our proprietary Intellectual Property and will license its technology to REGO operating subsidiaries and third parties."  The under 18 market will be served by REGO's new operating subsidiary, OINK, Inc., which will have an exclusive global field of use license for this market.  This restructuring of licensing and operating units protects the IP and the operating units alike.
Coyne further observed, "We have been in discussion with global system integrators that believe our platform is perfect for complex welfare payment control; especially in Europe where there has become an increased dependence on welfare benefits.  With our CM (contract model) and ReTRO, governments would now be able to map the benefits programs to their regulations and control the use of benefits proceeds to assure that the money is being spent efficiently, effectively and in the manner intended."  Welfare benefits comprise, on average, 20% of Country GDP, (OCED report, 2014)—and up to 32% for France.  Welfare benefits account for $896 Billion dollars in expenditure, for France alone. 
We are exploring "Closed loop" processing.  In a closed loop system, our platform allows the direct payment of settlements to merchants without the complexity and expense of using open payment interchanges, which is typically how debit and credit cards are processed. With our closed loop platform capability we have access to untapped potential users and direct and exclusive access to the transaction fees.
Coyne stated that "We are in discussion with retailers that want to use our system to dis-intermediate the current payment rails and save on processing fees, which can be 3% or more of retail sales.  For a large retail chain, this could mean savings of billions of dollars per year. The attraction of REGO's Architecture is more than mobility and convenience, it's dollars and cents in a very real way." 
Further, we can monitor user's activities—data related to how, where and when they spend, would become another proprietary source of revenue driven by our internal analytics engines and made available to our retail partners.
Finally, we believe that the "un-banked" can be another significant market.  These are people dependent on the cash market that have minimal access to traditional banking and the digital payment capability that comes with it. "A dollar of cash churns every six hours in the cash economy compared to twenty days or more in the banked community. This churn represents over a Trillion Dollars in annual spending and we can capture a significant piece of this market with partners that directly service this demographic," Coyne observed.  
"We think of our platform as a car chassis," says Coyne. "Using the chassis concept, we can modify the components to make a family sedan or super car where we might license one technology to Ford and another to McLaren. That is the power of adding specificity to a powerful generalized model on demand."
Based in Palm Beach, Florida REGO,Inc. holds three technology patents, US Patent No. 8,762,230, 8,650,621 and 8,812,395.

Virtual Piggy banking on kids making parent-monitored online payments







Cheryl A. Guerrero / Los Angeles Times
"We created Oink to serve as a way to provide kids and teens with a safe and parent-monitored environment to learn how to spend wisely, save for the future and even donate to charities," Virtual Piggy Chief Executive Jo Webber says.

Virtual Piggy's Oink app enables parents to open a digital wallet account for kids and set a spending limit




Parents who have found big credit card and debit card charges for unauthorized online purchases by their teens might be wondering what they can do to prevent it from happening again. That's one reason why Virtual Piggy Inc. exists.The Hermosa Beach company's primary product is an app called "Oink: Your Digital Family Wallet" for Apple, Android and — soon — Windows-based phones. It allows parents to download an app and use it to create an account and set a spending limit for their children. It also authorizes where they can spend the funds.As that spending occurs, the buying and spending patterns can be accessed by tablet or phone and discussed by both the parents and the teens, offering a record that can be refined."We created Oink to serve as a way to provide kids and teens with a safe and parent-monitored environment to learn how to spend wisely, save for the future and even donate to charities," Chief Executive Jo Webber said.

Wal-Mart, Gap and Banana Republic are among a growing number of retailers that accept Oink as a form of online payment. Stores for some of the world's biggest virtual online worlds for teens, such as Habbo and Gaea Online, also recognize Oink.
Most teens understand what we're doing in a nanosecond, but parents don't know what Oink is or does.
— Virtual Piggy Chief Executive Jo Webber

"If you have an 11-year-old, we will only show you products, companies and games that are acceptable for 11-year-olds," Webber said. "If there was a game rated for teens, it won't show up on their curated list of options."Webber said that its data systems "meet the highest standards of compliance" for privacy and security.Webber founded Virtual Piggy in 2008, but found that the global recession was the wrong time to push the idea forward.

Webber served as chairwoman from the beginning but was also running another company and didn't become chief executive of Virtual Piggy until 2012.The company is still at an early stage with little revenue, despite having signed up more than 1 million users.It has some heavyweight backing. Billionaire John Paul DeJoria is on its board of advisors and is an investor in the company.The company is hoping to capitalize on growing parental and regulatory disenchantment over big credit card bills from in-app virtual goods.The Federal Trade Commission recently filed a complaint against Amazon.com, alleging that the online retailer unlawfully billed parents millions of dollars for mobile games' in-app purchases made by their kids.Webber said her company was a solution."Ultimately, what we are doing is allowing you as a parent to have control and make the final decisions," Webber said.The latestIn July, the company announced that it had expanded its partnership network to include Oracle and EBay customers.Also in July, Virtual Piggy announced that merchants that use the Netbanx online banking system can now offer Oink as an alternative method of payment.In June, the company said it broadened its reach into online games, getting recognized as a payment option by Ubisoft Entertainment, OnNet, Woozworld, Wargaming, Crytek, Fantage and Bandai Namco Games America Inc.AccomplishmentsVirtual Piggy was a winner of the 2014 NextGen Mobile Awards. It was also named "Best Savings Coach" in Kiplinger's 2013 Best of Everything guide.Virtual Piggy was also recognized with a Parent Tested Parent Approved Award last year.ChallengesWebber said that Virtual Piggy needs to define itself and avoid being pigeonholed, referring to one publication that called it "PayPal for kids.""We have a technology that is new," Webber said. "Our challenge is to get our name out there and make sure that people understand the service.""Most teens understand what we're doing in a nanosecond, but parents don't know what Oink is or does."AnalystsThe company is not currently followed by Wall Street analysts.Edison Investment Research, which is based in London and tracks more than 700 stocks, said Virtual Piggy "continues to sign up merchants and payment processors," which should provide "additional scope for increased transaction volumes" and revenue opportunities.ron.white@latimes.comTwitter: @RonWLATimes

PALM BEACH, Fla., Aug. 9, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Virtual Piggy, Inc. (VPIG) announced a family-focused mobile banking solution whose technology is marketed as OINK.com, announces the creation of a fully automated parental control system known as Instant Monitoring Parental Account Control Technology (IMPACT) to be implemented in its new peer-to-peer payment system targeted for the under-17 market worldwide. 








Based on the same artificial intelligence technology that underpins VPIG's newly created "ReTRO™" system of regulatory controls, Impact provides parents with the same real time capability to monitor family transactions that regulators will have in assuring corporate compliance.
Impact provides every parent with the ability to individualize the rules of engagement for their child's use of OINK's Virtual Piggy's payment system- giving them more control over their children's spending, while providing freedom for the child to shop on their own and learn financial discipline.  
Using Impact, Virtual Piggy will have the capability to monitor and apply millions of compound individualized rules - a level of data complexity only available through this proprietary technique and technology.
Bob Balch, Director of Engineering for Virtual Piggy added, "Impact provides a simple interface for parents to choose between standard rules provided by Virtual Piggy or easily implement a custom set of rules and change them any time they like."
"Because we know all families are different, we recognize that parents have their own unique approach to teaching their children the importance of good financial management," VPIG CEO John Coyne explained.  So rather than force parents into a pigeonholed environment with a finite set of options, we now provide a fully customized custom payment control system."
With the Impact System now integrated into the OINK.com product, as circumstances such as age and interests change in regard to a child's online financial interactions, parents can change the "rules," such as how instant messages will be received; to viewing proposed transactions and approving or denying them; to setting the boundaries of where, when and how transactions may occur. Impact gives instant feedback to the user and the parent on a child's online financial transactions.
Through OINK.com, the Impact System will be connected to geo-centric mall beaconing systems, with localized coupon delivery and comparison pricing systems.  It will also give feedback for specialized incentive programs that promote good financial discipline.
"This capability is significantly innovative to the extent that it will become important not just for children, but the entire family's payment requirements; anywhere flexible rules can be applied to financial management," Coyne added.  "Once the power of this system is realized compared with alternative payment systems, the whole family will want to use it.  OINK 's Impact System goes beyond typical bill pay systems by automating the kind of decisions people make daily. Impact and its fundamental technology will extend Virtual Piggy to new users in new almost limitless environments."
Based in Palm Beach, Florida Virtual Piggy, Inc. holds three technology patents, US Patent No. 8,762,230, 8,650,621 and 8,812,395.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition And Results Of Operations and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on information available to us on the date hereof, and except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors described elsewhere herein. The following should be read in conjunction with our annual financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.  Overview  Virtual Piggy, Inc. (the "Company," "we", or "us") was incorporated in Delaware on February 11, 2008 under the name Chimera International Group, Inc. On April 4, 2008, we amended our certificate of incorporation and changed our name to Moggle, Inc. On August 22, 2011, we filed a Certificate of Ownership with the Secretary of State of Delaware, pursuant to which the Company's newly-formed wholly-owned subsidiary, Virtual Piggy Incorporated was merged into and with the Company (the "Merger"). In connection with the Merger and in accordance with  On December 3, 2015, the Company incorporated a newly-formed wholly-owned Subsidiary, Finity, Inc. On December 11, 2015, the Company filed a Statement of Correction with the Pennsylvania Department of State, to change the name of Finity, Inc. to Finitii, Inc. The purpose of Finitii, Inc. is to teach children financial responsibility as a not for profit organization.  Management believes that a future alternative for Virtual Piggy, Inc. will revolve around the FinTech industry with a partner-first go to market model in which established payments market leaders and vertical market participants can incorporate and integrate the company's platform into co-branded payments solutions targeting youth and family. Management believes this approach will enable the company to reduce expenses while broadening its reach.  Within this partner-first model, the company is incorporating licensing fees and customization services. This should enable the company to begin creating shareholder value above and beyond consumer transaction fees.  In addition, we are analyzing specific components of our technology for individual monetization as well as exploring opportunities in the Business to Business ("B2B") realm.  To date we have not generated material revenues. In 2015, we earned revenue by charging a percentage to the merchant or gaming publisher for each transaction processed, which continued until March 2016, when the decision was made to discontinue the Oink product offering. As we proceed through 2016, we expect to generate additional revenue streams by generating licensing and customization fees from our co-branding partners.  Strategic Outlook  We believe that the virtual goods market and the FinTech industry will continue to grow over the long term. Within the market and industry, we intend to provide services to allow transactions with children in compliance with COPPA and similar international privacy laws. We believe that this particular opportunity is relatively untapped and expect to be a leading provider of online transactions for children.  Sustained spending on technology, our ability to raise additional financing, the continued growth of the FinTech industry, and compliance with regulatory and reporting requirements are all external conditions that may affect our ability to execute our business plan. In addition, the FinTech industry is intensely competitive, and most participants have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, customer service and other resources, and greater name recognition. In addition, certain potential customers, particularly large organizations, may view our small size and limited financial resources as a negative even if they prefer our offering to those of our competitors.  Table of Contents  Our primary strategic objectives over the next 12-18 months are to increase our user base and the engagement level of that base. We plan to achieve that by implementing our partner-first go to market model in which established payments market leaders and vertical market participants can incorporate and integrate the company's platform into co-branded payments solutions targeting youth and family. Management believes this approach will enable the company to reduce expenses while broadening its reach.  Within this partner-first model, the company is incorporating licensing fees and customization services. This should enable the company to begin creating shareholder value above and beyond consumer transaction fees.  We believe that our near-term success will depend particularly on our ability to develop customer awareness and confidence in our service. Since we have limited capital resources, we will need to closely manage our expenses and conserve our cash by continually monitoring any increase in expenses and reducing or eliminating unnecessary expenditures. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties encountered by companies at an early stage of development, particularly given that we operate in new and rapidly evolving markets, that we have limited financial resources, and face an uncertain economic environment. We may not be successful in addressing such risks and difficulties.  Results of Operations  Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014  The following discussion analyzes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. The following information should be considered together with our financial statements for such periods and the accompanying notes thereto.  Revenue/Net Loss  Revenue  We have not generated significant revenue since our inception. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we generated revenues of $23,546 and $5,708. The addition of the Discover Card program in the fourth quarter of 2014 increased our transaction volume in 2015.  Revenue was generated through a number of mechanisms as follows:  Transactional Revenue  A merchant or game publisher paid fees on any transactions that were driven through the Oink payment service. Oink had several live integrated online retail merchants, gaming companies and over 1,000 Facebook games in this category. The typical fees for this service were 1.5% to 3.0%.  Affiliate Revenue  This was a new category of revenue in 2014 for Virtual Piggy and generated additional revenue in 2015 in the US only. Oink served up curated offers to consumers and received a percentage fee on any transactions that occurred by the consumer regardless of whether the consumer used Oink as the payment method. The typical fees from this service were 2% to 8%. In September 2014, the Oink app v2.0 was launched which included affiliate deals and offers. The app was free to use and a user did not have to be a member of the Oink community to access Oink deals.  Table of Contents  Partner Referrals  In 2014, Oink had signed a number of partnerships with e-commerce platform partners and received referral fees for any time a merchant or gaming publisher signed up with the partner. Our first revenue from this program was seen towards at the end of the third quarter ended September 2014 and continued into 2015.  Card Fees  In the fourth quarter of 2014, Oink launched a prepaid card tied to a user's Oink account and revenues were generated from this in 2015. The fees consisted of an annual fee and usages fees which were paid by the card user. In addition, we received fees from Discover for each transaction made using the Oink card.  Net Loss  Our net loss attributable to common stockholders decreased $7.9 million to $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $16.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, as a result of decreased operating expenses as further described below.  Sales and Marketing Expenses  Sales and marketing expenses decreased by $3.3 million, or 64% in 2015 to $1.8 million compared with $5.1 million in 2014. During 2015, we closed our London office, reduced our sales and marketing staff and consultants and decreased our spending on marketing promotions by approximately $2.3 million, while we continued marketing programs with our available cash resources.  Product Development  Product development expenses decreased by $1.6 million, or 50% in 2015 to $1.6 million compared with $3.2 million in 2014. During 2015, we reduced the size of our product development team in the United States and closed our operation in Europe while continuing to develop and build our new mobile and other applications with the resources available.  Integration and Customer Support  Integration and customer support expenses decreased by $0.6 million, or 75% in 2015 to $0.2 million compared with $0.8 million in 2014. We decreased the size of our integration team as new merchants were not developed as quickly as anticipated and we needed to conserve cash resources.  General and Administrative Expenses  General and administrative expenses decreased by $2.0 million, or 36% in 2015 to $3.4 million compared with $5.4 million in 2014. During 2015, we eliminated board fees of approximately $95,000, reduced foreign exchange losses by closing the London office, of approximately $94,000, reduced property rental expenses by approximately $105,000, reduced professional fees by approximately $163,000 utilizing our professionals more effectively, reduced travel related expenses by approximately $165,000 by initiating cost conservation measures, reduced consulting costs by approximately $172,000, reduced payroll expenses by approximately $799,000, and reduced other costs as well by implementing cost containment measures.  Strategic Consulting Expenses  Strategic consulting expenses decreased by $0.1 million, or 16% in 2015 to $0.4 million compared with $0.5 million in 2014. During 2015, we reduced the cost of strategic consultants by more effectively utilizing our consultants.  Table of Contents  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Net cash used in operating activities decreased $9.2 million to $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $14.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease resulted primarily from the decrease in the net loss of approximately $2.0 million, the decrease in the change in the fair value of the embedded derivative liability of $5.5 million, the decrease in prepaid expense and the increase in accounts payable.  Net cash used in investing activities was $0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, materially unchanged from the $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.  Net cash provided by financing activities decreased by $11.0 million to $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015, consisted of issuing convertible notes payable in the amount of $2.9 million and issuance of notes payable in the amount of $1.0 million compared to our Series A Preferred Stock offering, netting $10.9 million, our Series B Preferred Stock offering netting $2.5 million and our warrant exchange offer, netting $2.7 million, offset by the re-payment of our $1.0 million bridge loan during the year ended December 31, 2014.  Subsequent to December 31, 2015, the Company raised gross proceeds of $483,600 through the issuance of notes payable.  As we have not realized significant revenues since our inception, we have financed our operations through public and private offerings of debt and equity securities. We do not currently maintain a line of credit or term loan with any commercial bank or other financial institution.  Since our inception, we have focused on developing and implementing our business plan. We believe that our existing cash resources will not be sufficient to sustain our operations during the next twelve months. We currently need to generate sufficient revenues to support our cost structure to enable us to pay ongoing costs and expenses as they are incurred, finance the development of our platform, and execute the business plan. If we cannot generate sufficient revenue to fund our business plan, we intend to seek to raise such financing through the sale of debt and/or equity securities. The issuance of additional equity would result in dilution to existing shareholders. If we are unable to obtain additional funds when they are needed or if such funds cannot be obtained on terms acceptable to us, we will be unable to execute upon the business plan or pay costs and expenses as they are incurred, which would have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Even if we are successful in generating sufficient revenue or in raising sufficient capital in order to complete the platform, our ability to continue in business as a viable going concern can only be achieved when our revenues reach a level that sustains our business operations. We raised approximately $2.9 million through our issuance of convertible notes payable and another $1.0 million through the issuance of notes payable. The launch of the platform is expected in the fourth quarter of 2016, however, we do not project that significant revenue will be developed until later in 2017. There can be no assurance that we will raise sufficient proceeds, or any proceeds, for us to implement fully our proposed business plan. Moreover there can be no assurance that even if platform is developed and launched, that we will generate revenues sufficient to fund our operations. In either such situation, we may not be able to continue our operations and our business might fail.  As of April 14, 2016, the Company has a cash position of approximately $3,000. Based upon the current cash position and the Company's planned expense run rate, management believes the Company will not be able to finance its operations through April 2016.  The foregoing forward-looking information was prepared by us in good faith based upon assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. No assurance can be given, however, regarding the attainability of the projections or the reliability of the assumptions on which they are based. The projections are subject to the uncertainties inherent in any attempt to predict the results of our operations, especially where new products and services are involved. Certain of the assumptions used will inevitably not materialize and unanticipated events will occur. Actual results of operations are, therefore, likely to vary from the projections and such variations may be material and adverse to us. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that such results will be achieved. Moreover due to changes in technology, new product announcements, competitive pressures, system design and/or other specifications we may be required to change the current plans.  Table of Contents  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  As of December 31, 2015, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partners, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.  Critical Accounting Policies  Our financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation. A complete summary of these policies is included in Note 1 of the Notes to Financial Statements included elsewhere herein. We have identified below the accounting policies that are of particular importance in the presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows and which require the application of significant judgment by management.  Stock-based Compensation  We have adopted the fair value recognition provisions Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification ("FASB ASC") 718. In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 "Share-Based Payment" ("SAB 107") in March, 2005, which provides supplemental FASB ASC 718 application guidance based on the views of the SEC. Under FASB ASC 718, compensation cost recognized includes compensation cost for all share-based payments granted beginning January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC 718.  We have used the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the option fair values. The option-pricing model requires a number of assumptions, of which the most significant are, expected stock price volatility, the expected pre-vesting forfeiture rate and the expected option term (the amount of time from the grant date until the options are exercised or expire).  All issuances of stock options or other equity instruments to non-employees as consideration for goods or services received by the Company are accounted for based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued. Non-employee equity based payments that do not vest immediately upon grant are recorded as an expense over the service period, as if the Company had paid cash for the services. At the end of each financial reporting period, prior to the completion of the services, the fair value of the equity based payments will be re-measured and the non-cash expense recognized during the period will be adjusted accordingly. Since the fair value of equity based payments granted to non-employees is subject to change in the future, the amount of the future expense will include fair value re-measurements until the equity based payments are fully vested or the service is completed.  Revenue Recognition  In accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition (Codified in FASB ASC 605), we will recognize revenue when (i) persuasive evidence of a customer or distributor arrangement exists or acceptance occurs, (ii) a retailer, distributor or wholesaler receives the goods, (iii) the price is fixed or determinable, and  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  Recently issued accounting pronouncements are discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this report.
