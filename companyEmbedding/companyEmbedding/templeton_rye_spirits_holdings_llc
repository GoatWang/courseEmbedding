Rum is distilled from sugar cane or molasses, rum ranges in taste and character from light, mildly flavored to dark, full -bodied types, with a heavy pungent flavor. The finest rums come from the Caribbean, although rum is produced in any country that cultivates sugar cane. The two main types of rum are light-bodied generally produced to be dry with a subtle flavor most Puerto Rican rums and full bodied rums most Jamaican rums. Rum is used in cocktails like the Daiquiri, Mojito, Pina Colada, Rum Punch and Mai Tai and can be mixed with cola. Extra aged rums can be served neat like a brandy or Cognac.

The light-bodied rums of Puerto Rico are made in column stills and must be aged for at least one year to produce a light-bodied, dry rum. Amber or golden rums from Puerto Rico are aged for a minimum of three years and have caramel added to enhance the color gained from the casks. Amber rums are slightly mellower and more aromatic than white rums. A third type of light-bodied rum is añejo, aged in wood from four to six years, producing the mellowest and most flavorful of the Puerto Rican rums.In contrast, full-bodied rums are made using a skimming process in which part of the previous distillation is added to the molasses in the fermentation vats. This process results in a very flavorful, aromatic spirit that, in the case of Jamaican rum, is almost always blended and requires at least five to seven years of barrel aging.
