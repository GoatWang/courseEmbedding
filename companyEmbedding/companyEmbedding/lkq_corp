                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Corporate Profile


LKQ Corporation is a distributor of vehicle products, including replacement parts, components and systems used in the repair and maintenance of vehicles, as well as specialty vehicle products and accessories.
Buyers of vehicle replacement products have the option to purchase from
primarily five sources: new products produced by original equipment
manufacturers ("OEMs"), which are commonly known as OEM products;
new products produced by companies other than the OEMs, which are
sometimes referred to as aftermarket products; recycled products obtained
from salvage vehicles; used products that have been refurbished; and used
products that have been remanufactured. We distribute a variety of products
to collision and mechanical repair shops, including aftermarket collision
and mechanical products, recycled collision and mechanical products,
refurbished collision products such as wheels, bumper covers and lights,
and remanufactured engines. Collectively, we refer to these products as
alternative parts because they are not new OEM products.
We are the nation’s largest provider of alternative vehicle collision
replacement products and a leading provider of alternative vehicle
mechanical replacement products, with our sales, processing, and
distribution facilities reaching most major markets in the United States and
Canada. We are also a leading provider of alternative vehicle replacement
and maintenance products in the United Kingdom and the Benelux region of
continental Europe. In addition to our wholesale operations, we operate self
service retail facilities across the U.S. that sell recycled automotive products
from end-of-life-vehicles. With our January 2014 acquisition of Keystone
Automotive Holdings, Inc. (“Keystone Specialty”) we are also a leading
distributor of specialty vehicle products and accessories reaching most
major markets in the U.S. and Canada.
We are organized into four operating segments: Wholesale - North America;
Wholesale - Europe; Self Service; and Specialty.
We strive to be environmentally responsible. Our recycled automotive
products provide an alternative to the manufacture of new products, which
would require the expenditure of more resources and energy and would
generate additional pollution. In addition, we save landfill space because
the parts that we recycle would otherwise be discarded. We also collect
materials, such as metals, plastics, fuel and motor oil, from the salvage
vehicles that we procure, and use them in our operations or sell them to
other users.We are focused on creating economic value for our stockholders by
enhancing our position as a leading source for alternative collision and
mechanical repair products, and by expanding into other product lines and
businesses that may benefit from our operating strengths. We believe a
supply network with a broad inventory of quality alternative collision and
mechanical repair products and specialty vehicle aftermarket products, high
fulfillment rates, and superior customer service provides us with a
competitive advantage.Other than OEMs, the competition in the markets that we serve is extremely
fragmented and the supply of products tends to be localized, often leading to
low fulfillment rates, particularly with recycled products. In North America, the
distribution channels for aftermarket and refurbished products have
historically been distinct and separate from those for recycled and
remanufactured products despite serving the same customer segment. We
provide value to our customers by bringing these two channels together to
provide a broader product offering and more efficient distribution process.
To execute our strategy in North America, we have expanded our network of
parts warehouses and dismantling plants in major metropolitan areas and
employ a distribution system that allows for order fulfillment from regional
warehouses located across the U.S. and Canada. By increasing local
inventory levels and expanding our network to provide timely access to a
greater range of parts, we have increased fulfillment rates beyond the levels
that we believe most of our competitors realize, particularly for recycled
products.In our European operations, we are expanding our branch network in the
U.K., while simultaneously transitioning our distribution network in our
continental European operations by internalizing certain distributor customers so that we may directly serve the repair shops in those markets.
We believe aligning the distribution strategy in continental Europe with our
two-step distribution model in the U.K. will create a cohesive presence in
the respective markets. Additionally, through improved order fulfillment and
operational support, we are attempting to improve profit margins and
customer service.Sources of high quality, reliable alternatives to OEM products are important
to insurance companies and to our direct customers as they seek to control
repair costs. Lower parts costs and quicker completion of orders save
money and reduce repair times. We believe that we provide customers (and
indirectly, insurance companies) with a value proposition that includes high
quality products at a lower cost than new OEM products, extensive product
availability due to our expansive distribution network, responsive service,
and quick delivery. The breadth of our alternative parts offerings allows us to
serve as a "one-stop" solution for our customers looking for the most cost
effective way to provide quality repairs. In order to execute this strategy and
build on our progress thus far, we will continue to seek to expand into new
markets and to improve penetration both organically and through
acquisitions in targeted markets.Similarly, the supplier base for the specialty vehicle aftermarket parts and
accessories market is highly fragmented, typically consisting of suppliers
that are small to medium-sized, independent businesses that focus on a
narrow product or market niche. While our Specialty operations had an
extensive distribution network already in place, we are in process of
integrating the distribution network for our North American and Specialty
operations to create synergies and efficiencies with our existing
infrastructure. We believe this provides added value to our customers
through a broader product offering and more efficient distribution process.

            I went and pulled a fender for a 2004 Chevy truck at the Clearwater yard only for this guy, John, to try and charge me for a inner fender as well. Its one peice, not two I told him. I found the same part online for $10 to $15 more brand new and less then two minutes in the sun. Dont waste your time with them or effort in their junkyard

             A SAGACIOUS BOSSY ATTENDANT: South Congresd, Austin location, the front end attendance ( a black guy) was very unprofesdional as always but exceptionally rude to me this aftetnoon. A Customer Expirience Class will be ideal for this young man since he is the first person approached by your customers. He lacks the ethics of the profession as the image maker. 5/24/17

Grizzly Industrial


                            I purchased this planer in march of 2017 under order # 90544730. When I was researching this purchase I noticed that it was actually less expensive to buy the planer (GO453W) and add a helix cutter head (T27695) rather than just buying the GO453ZW, additionally that would provide an extra cutter should something happen to the helix head. Thinking this was a little odd I called your customer service group to be sure this was in fact the case. I...                        Read more

The truck ran fine for about a week and then all of a sudden I get an warning light and my OBDII reader stated that cylinder 4 was miss firing. I took my truck to a mechanic and $300 later for diagnosis the mechanic determined that the injector spider was faulty. I called CARiD and they said that they needed a copy of the work order from my mechanic. I sent it to them...                        Read more
