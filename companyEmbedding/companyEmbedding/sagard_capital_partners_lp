GP Strategies Announces $20.0 Million Equity Investment by Sagard Capital Partners, L.P. | Business Wire
























































GP Strategies Announces $20.0 Million Equity Investment by Sagard 
      Capital Partners, L.P.






December 30, 2009 04:02 PM Eastern Standard Time



ELKRIDGE, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--GP Strategies Corporation (NYSE: GPX), a global provider 
      of training, e-Learning solutions, management consulting, engineering 
      and technical services through its principal operating subsidiary 
      General Physics Corporation, today announced the completion of a private 
      placement of 2,857,143 shares of common stock with Sagard Capital 
      Partners, L.P., at a price of $7.00 per share, generating gross proceeds 
      to GP Strategies of $20.0 million. Sagard’s equity investment equates to 
      an ownership interest of approximately 15.4% at this time.
    


      “We are extremely pleased that an investor like Sagard Capital Partners 
      shares our vision and we view their investment as a tangible sign of 
      confidence in the direction GP Strategies is heading,” commented Scott 
      N. Greenberg, Chief Executive Officer of GP Strategies. “In expanding GP 
      Strategies’ platform as a leading customer training and performance 
      improvement company, we will continue to look for opportunities to make 
      strategic acquisitions and to fund internal growth, and this investment 
      by Sagard strengthens our ability to do both.”
    

      “We are very excited to be associated with a quality company like GP 
      Strategies. GP has become a leader in the technical training, consulting 
      and services area by building extremely strong relationships with their 
      clients,” said Daniel Friedberg, Managing Partner of Sagard Capital 
      Partners, L.P. “We look forward to supporting GP Strategies over the 
      long term as they continue to expand their product offering and bring 
      value to their clients.”
    

      In connection with the equity investment, Daniel Friedberg was elected 
      to the board of directors of GP Strategies effective as of December 30, 
      2009.
    

      The shares sold in the private placement have not been registered under 
      the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or state securities laws, and 
      may not be offered or sold in the United States without being registered 
      with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or through an 
      applicable exemption from SEC registration requirements. The shares were 
      offered and sold only to Sagard Capital Partners, L.P. GP Strategies has 
      agreed to file a resale registration statement covering all the shares 
      of the common stock issued to Sagard, up to the maximum number of shares 
      permitted to be registered under the federal securities laws.
    

      This news release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the 
      solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of any of 
      the securities referred to in this news release in any state in which 
      such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the 
      registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such 
      state. Any offering of GP Strategies common stock under the resale 
      registration statement referred to in this news release will be made 
      only by means of a prospectus.

Sagard Capital Partners, L.P. Key Developments

Bidders's Deadline Reportedly To End Soon For PSG
Jan 23 17
Potential private equity buyers appear to be steering clear of Performance Sports Group Ltd. (TSX:PSG) clearing the field for a $575-million bid from Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited (TSX:FFH) and Sagard Capital Partners, L.P. The bidders have until January 25, 2016 to submit an offer for PSG. A number of private equity firms in Canada and the United States, including Bain Capital, LP, as well as domestic pension funds, have taken a look at the company, according to sources familiar with the process. However, sources added that most of these potential private equity buyers have decided not to make a bid. If no rival offer emerges, Sagard and Fairfax stand to take control of PSG after making what is known as a stalking horse bid in October 2016.


Sagard Capital, Fairfax Financial Enter Confidentiality Agreement Relating to Performance Sports Group
Oct 24 16
Sagard Capital Partners, L.P. and some affiliates announced that they and Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited have entered into a confidentiality agreement relating to Performance Sports Group Ltd. and its confidential information and any other confidential information provided by or on behalf of Sagard Capital to Fairfax. Sagard Capital, Fairfax and their respective representatives have discussed the possibility of Sagard Capital and Fairfax, and/or one or more entities to be formed at their direction, acting together with respect to potential plans or proposals related to a potential transaction.


Fairfax Financial And Power Corporation Unit Considers Alternatives For Performance Sports
Oct 24 16
Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited (TSX:FFH) and a unit of Power Corporation of Canada (TSX:POW) are considering various proposals related to Performance Sports Group Ltd. (TSX:PSG) including a restructuring, refinancing, buying the company’s debt or other “strategic alternatives.” Sagard Capital Partners, L.P. and Fairfax have signed a confidentiality pact and will continue talks with the company’s management and other co-investors, Sagard said. Sagard and Fairfax haven’t entered into any agreements, term sheets, or other arrangements and there’s no guaranty a deal will happen, Sagard said.
