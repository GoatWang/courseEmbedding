Forging Successful Relationships Between Investors and Investment Managers
Hamersley Partners is a third-party marketing firm focused on selecting institutional-quality investment managers, and increasing their assets. We believe that the size of the institutional manager universe can cause investors to remain unaware of certain high-quality firms available to fit their needs. Our goal is to pair these managers with discerning, progressive investors in mutually beneficial relationships.
The team at Hamersley Partners has over 50 years of investment and sales experience, and has raised over $4.7 billion in assets since 2008 from US and international institutional investors. The firm has strong relationships with industry decision-makers across multiple distribution channels including institutional consultants, public and private pension funds, endowments and foundations, sub-advisory and wrap programs, RIAs, and emerging manager programs. Hamersley Partners is a broker-dealer registered with the SEC, a member of FINRA and SIPC, as well as a member of Third Party Marketers Association.

About Hamersley


 
About Hamersley Partners
Hamersley Partners was founded in 2004 in Boston, Massachusetts. In 2005, we began marketing our initial clients to the institutional marketplace. Since then we have expanded our client roster to include other complementary high-conviction managers.
We strongly believe that our diverse experiences allow us to view institutional investment manager marketing in both a traditional as well as a 21st century way. Our duality gives us many advantages; the knowledge to select high-conviction managers, the foresight to direct our marketing efforts to the appropriate types of investors, the tools to create compelling marketing collateral, the ability to innovate and continually leverage technology to improve our marketing efforts, and the energy to build relationships with key decision-makers across the entire investor-spectrum. We have the ability to reach our distribution channels efficiently and effectively.

Essex GEOS



“We believe that environmental investing is sustainable, is not a fad, and that over the long-term, companies positioned to benefit from climate change action will deliver sustainable earnings and therefore, strong stock price appreciation.”
– Bill Page, Co-Portfolio Manager

Essex Global Environmental Opportunities Strategy
   



The Essex Global Environmental Opportunities Strategy (GEOS) operates at the nexus of environment and finance, investing in companies that enable greater natural resource and energy efficiency. GEOS is a listed-equity, global, all-cap strategy investing across nine environmental technology themes in long-only fashion with about 40 holdings. GEOS is clean technology and energy infrastructure-focused, with companies that exhibit generally-high growth rates. The Strategy is benchmarked to the MSCI World Index with the addition of the Wilderhill Clean Energy Index for comparative purposes.
 
“As 2015 comes to a close, we find ourselves asking an existential question: can one achieve competitive returns while investing in clean energy technologies that have the potential to substantially change the world.  We are prompted to consider this question as the Wilderhill Clean Energy Index was down a little more than -10% for the year 2015, the fifth time in the last six years that this Index has ended the year in negative territory.  This, during a period that has been favorable to the overall stock market – the MSCI World Index is up more than 186% since it bottomed in March 2009 following the financial crisis.  The good news is that, despite the significant headwinds buffeting the clean energy sector, Essex’s Global Environmental Opportunities Strategy (“GEOS”) has performed substantially better than the Wilderhill Clean Energy Index since the inception of our Strategy in mid-2009.”

Webinars



Webinar: True Impact Investing Happens with Thematic Solutions, not ESG
Thematic Vs. ESG Webinar Presentation


Investors’ desire to make a positive impact is here to stay. Yet, there is massive confusion around impact investing. In this webinar, we covered the following points:


Companies are being compelled to disclose ESG metrics
Status of UNPRI signatories and assets
SASB – sustainability accounting metrics
ESG investing leverages these disclosures
Everyone is jumping on the ESG bandwagon
ESG focuses mainly on large cap stocks, not impact solutions
Thematic investing is focused on impact solutions
GEOS – listed thematic investment solution

We made the case that true impact happens through thematic investment solutions and not ESG.
This webinar was held on December 14, 2016.

            About Hamersley Partners Hamersley Partners was founded in 2004 by Peter Pavlina in Boston, Massachusetts. In 2005, we began marketing our initial clients to the institutional marketplace. We continue to be retained by several of our initial clients, and have expanded our client roster to include other complementary high-conviction managers. We strongly believe that our diverse experiences allow us to view institutional investment manager marketing in both a traditional as well as a 21st century way. Our duality gives us many advantages ; the knowledge to select high-conviction managers, the foresight to direct our marketing efforts to the appropriate types of investors, the tools to create compelling marketing collateral, the ability to innovate and continually leverage technology to improve our marketing efforts, and the energy to build relationships with key decision-makers across the entire investor-spectrum. We have the ability to reach our distribution channels efficiently and effectively.

Home




Forging Successful Relationships Between Investors and Investment Managers
Hamersley Partners is a third-party marketing firm focused on selecting institutional-quality investment managers, and increasing their assets. We believe that the size of the institutional manager universe can cause investors to remain unaware of certain high-quality firms available to fit their needs. Our goal is to pair these managers with discerning, progressive investors in mutually beneficial relationships.
The team at Hamersley Partners has over 50 years of investment and sales experience, and has raised over $4.7 billion in assets since 2008 from US and international institutional investors. The firm has strong relationships with industry decision-makers across multiple distribution channels including institutional consultants, public and private pension funds, endowments and foundations, sub-advisory and wrap programs, RIAs, and emerging manager programs. Hamersley Partners is a broker-dealer registered with the SEC, a member of FINRA and SIPC, as well as a member of Third Party Marketers Association.
