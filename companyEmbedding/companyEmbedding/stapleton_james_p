Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Texas:













Does Stapleton, James P carry a valid contracting license?



Only certain types of specialty contractors (e.g. HVAC, electrical) need to be licensed in Texas. There are no licensing requirements when it comes to hiring for a construction or major remodeling project.
Stapleton, James P currently holds license 249315 (Ai Residential Appliance Installer), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Texas?



The Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) regulates HVAC and electrical contractors. You should verify their license status on the TDLR Website before hiring. General contractors and home builders are not licensed so you should do additional research before hiring one.











Your liability risk when hiring Stapleton, James P



Although it isn't a regulatory requirement, you can ask your general contractor to provide evidence of workers' compensation and general liability insurance prior to hiring them. 











Financial recourse when hiring Stapleton, James P



The Texas Department of Licensing Regulation does not require general contractors to carry a surety bond nor is there a state recovery fund.











What else should I know before hiring Stapleton, James P



There is no financial or criminal background check performed on general contractors by the TDLR. The State's Department of Public Safety does maintain a publicly accessible database so you can run your own background check prior to hiring. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



The information on BuildZoom is made available as a public service and should not be considered advertising. We collect client feedback and verify contractors' permitted history with dozens of local building departments in Texas, which saves you time and helps minimize your risk when hiring. 











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Texas Attorney General's office recommends getting several bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free).

The author takes this development as her starting point in an investigation into the nature of product liability and beyond, into a consideration of important general topics in civil liability today. The first part of the book deals with the doctrinal history of the new Act, then goes on to consider the larger picture, viz. the impact of EC membership on the legislative freedom of Member States, and the contrasting dynamics of US civil liability. Part 2 evaluates the usefulness of abstract theories of civil liability from the perspective of a tort lawyer concerned with detailed legal rules; part 3 analyses where and why instability may arise in legal regimes of limited scope and in broader liabilities such as negligence.  Preview this book » What people are saying - Write a reviewWe haven't found any reviews in the usual places.Selected pagesTitle PageTable of ContentsIndexContentsProduct liability law reform 3 Evolution of product liability doctrine in the US 9 Evolution of UK product liability doctrine and 37 Lessons and limits of the US experience 66 Liability as an economic strategy 90 Critique of wealth maximization 118 Noneconomic theories of liability 163 A new theory of strict moral enterprise liability 185 Gaps in the theoretical basis of the Directive 218 Thedefectrequirement 233 Relatively stable boundaries 275 Specific sources of instability 303 Some conclusions 341 The European Communities Directive 360 Index 375 Copyright Common terms and phrasesargue argument Article bargaining basis behaviour bility boundaries but-for buyer bystander Calabresi causal cause caveat emptor Chapter cheapest cost avoider civil liability claims commercial compensation consumer protection context contract Corpn corrective justice courts damage defective product defendant's deterrence development risk defence Directive distribution doctrine Donoghue v Stevenson drug economic loss effect Epstein European reformers example exclusion clauses factors foreseeable full strict liability goal heading implied warranty imposed initial issue justice justify Law Commission liability regime liability rule limited manufacturing errors moral enterprise liability op cit outcome party personal injuries plaintiff privity problem product liability product rules profit rationale reasonable relation relevant requirement responsibility safety seller social standard Strasbourg Convention strategy suppliers supply Thalidomide tion Tort Law tort liability transaction costs Treaty of Rome unforeseeable risks vicarious liability victim wealth maximizationReferences to this bookPolicy Issues in Insurance Insurance and Expanding Systemic RisksOECDNo preview available - 2003Dimensions of Private Law: Categories and Concepts in Anglo-American Legal ...S.
