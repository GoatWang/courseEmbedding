Whether you are living within the U.S. seeking an adjustment of status, or outside the United States and in need of consular processing, a good attorney can help you determine if you are eligible for a visa, which is the first step in seeking permanent residence.Generally, a green card lawyer in New Jersey can help you seek permanent residence through such channels as:Relatives in the U.S.A jobSeeking asylumRefugee statusImmigration lottery (Diversity Immigrant Visa program)I am a green card lawyer in New Jersey with experience handling the many forms needed in the world of immigration: K-1, K-2, K-3, K-4, CR1, IR1, I129F, I130 and many more.

Do not take risks with your future!Ask a green card lawyer in New Jersey. Call me now. What is a “green card”? It is the unofficial name for a Permanent Residence Card.

Why not rely on family, friends, or people who have successfully immigrated? Why not turn to non-lawyers? I have seen some pretty disastrous results in many of these cases because:Immigration laws change regularly in this post 9/11 world.

DWI & Traffic Defense Contact a drunk driving attorney...   Immigration Lawyer Call a deportation attorney to defend... Marriage-Based Green Cards for New Jersey ImmigrantsJune 6, 2014 by damgFacebookTwitterGoogle+PinterestLinkedInNewark, NJ- One of the options available to immigrants who wish to obtain a green card or lawful permanent residence is a marriage-based green card. With a marriage-based green card, an immigrant can live and work in the U.S. and travel internationally. This is one of the most common ways to obtain and green card and there is no limit to how many are issued each year. But it is not a simple process and immigrants are advised to consult with a Jersey City immigration attorney to determine eligibility, potential pitfalls and for help with the process.In order to qualify for a marriage-based visa (green-card) an immigrant must meet a set of criteria enforced by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. An immigrant must be able to prove s/he is legally married, is in a bona fide relationship, is married to a U.S. citizen or permanent resident and entered the U.S. with inspection and admission or some other acceptable entry. Any previous marriages must have ended either through divorce or death.To be eligible for a marriage-based visa an immigrant must prove they are in a marriage legally recognized in the state or country where they were married. Typically, an immigrant must provide official documentation issued by a government agency (for example: a marriage certificate) that shows they are legally married. The required documentation varies depending on the details of each case, so an applicant is advised to contact an immigration attorney to determine if s/he has the correct documents and assistance obtaining them if they don’t.    An immigrant must also prove the marriage is a serious commitment entered into for the purpose of building a life together. A marriage cannot be entered into for the sole purpose of obtaining a green card. USCIS agents are trained to carefully screen green card applicants to determine if their marriage is fraudulent. For this reason, an immigrant will be required to provide immigration officials with extensive documentation about the relationship; failure to do so will result in denial of the application and possibly referral to immigration court for removal proceedings.Immigrants are allowed to apply for marriage-based green cards before they enter the U.S. through a multi-step process involving USCIS, the Department of State and the local consulate. A potential green card applicant living in the U.S. may be able to obtain status without returning to their native country; others will be required to return to their native country for a brief or extended period before receiving a green card. The particular route an immigrant chooses depends on their individual circumstances.Obtaining a marriage-based green card requires more than filing the necessary petitions; it requires extensive documentation and meetings with immigration officials. A simple mistake can cause an application to be denied and an immigrant must start the process over again, or worse, be deported or forever denied admission to the U.S. This can mean long delays which an applicant can avoid if they retain me to help them throughout all stages of the process from filing the necessary applications to meeting with immigration officials.Because immigration is the focal part of my New Jersey practice, I understand the complexities of U.S. immigration laws and will take the necessary steps to ensure my clients obtain the visa or green card they are seeking. Whatever your immigration needs, I will use my knowledge and commitment to your advantage.

Lenovo Awarded the First TUV Rheinland Green Product Mark on Display Product Worldwide 
2012-05-29 15:30
















































 








 



HONG KONG, May 29, 2012 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- Lenovo ThinkVision LT2323z VoIP display product successfully passed TUV Rheinland Integrated Green Product Certification, which will be issued the world 1st green product mark. The award ceremony was held at the Shenzhen Westin Hotel, with Holger Kunz, Vice President of TUV Rheinland Greater China, and Eric Yu, Executive Director and General Manager of Lenovo Group Worldwide Visuals Business Unit in attendance.

Holger Kunz, Vice President of TUV Rheinland Greater China presents TUV Rheinland Green Product Award to Eric Yu, Executive Director and General Manager of Lenovo Group Worldwide Visuals Business Unit

TUV Rheinland Green Product Mark

As the world 1st TUV Rheinland Green Mark certified monitor, Lenovo ThinkVision LT2323z VoIP monitor, inherited ThinkVision's long-term green commitment, uses up to 85 percent post consumer content and is compliant with Energy Star requirements for low power consumption in standby and off modes. Additionally, introducing the innovative green packaging technologies, this monitor adopts paper cushion, instead of the traditional plastic cushion, and is shipped in recyclable packaging that is also made from recycled materials. In the meanwhile, Lenovo cooperating with TUV Rheinland closely tracked the carbon footprint throughout 3 phases of the product lifecycle to minimize the impact on the environment.
Kunz mentioned in the opening speech, "Lenovo has been an ardent advocate of green innovation in the information technology industry. By joining efforts with TUV Rheinland in developing green product certification and being the first company awarded TUV Rheinland integrated green mark worldwide, Lenovo has not only demonstrated their commitment to the pursuit of corporate sustainable development, but also proved once again their long-standing efforts in green innovation. The cooperation, we believe, will create certain impact on the IT industry. Through our joint action, we aim to further expand Green product mark's influence in the Chinese market, and provide Green product certification to more brand name owners and downstream suppliers. Together with Lenovo, we will kick off a Green revolution in the IT industry."
"Green is part of the DNA of ThinkVision. We truly appreciate TUV Rheinland's noted reputation as the strictest international environmental standards. Through the strategic partnership with TUV Rheinland, we can benchmark our commitment towards environmental excellence. As an industry leader, Lenovo will continue investing on the innovative green technologies, pushing the edge of green performance," said Eric Yu.
TUV Rheinland's Green Product Certification is a voluntary sustainability certification that aims to award consumer products with the least impact on the environment. The Green Product Certification is based on a safety evaluation of the product against various regulatory requirements and a social Compliance Check for the product manufacturer. Additionally, it focuses on four key dimensions: including the responsible use of chemical substances, Recyclability & the usage of recycled materials, energy consumption and efficiency, and the determination of the product carbon footprint.
TUV Rheinland will issue Green product mark to the certified product, which can assist companies in demonstrating their corporate commitment and products' international competitiveness to brands and retailers. On the other hand, the mark can give end-consumers and buyers guidance in identifying green and sustainable products in the often crowded marketplace.
