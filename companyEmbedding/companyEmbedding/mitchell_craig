Publisher's Description▼▲
In the twenty-first century, Christian individuals and institutions routinely face ethical choices not imagined fifty years ago, with little ethical mooring in the surrounding culture to guide us. Thus, Christian ethics is an important field of study for the student, pastor, or concerned layperson. Unfortunately, it is also one of the most complicated of all the Christian academic disciplines, entailing numerous approaches and having roots in both philosophy and theology. Charts of Christian Ethics provides a wealth of valuable information, laid out in an accessible visual format, to help the student of ethics navigate and comprehend this complex field of study. It provides an outline for Christian ethics, explaining some of the major ideas and approaches. It is divided into five major sections:  Philosophical Foundations of Ethics (including logic, metaphysics, and epistemology)  Approaches to Ethics (metaethics, normative ethics, and applied ethics)  Biblical Foundations of Christian Ethics (hermeneutics, ethics in the Old Testament, and ethics in the New Testament)  Theological Foundations of Christian Ethics (including God, creation, man, and the church)  History of Ethics (including the premodern, modern, and postmodern eras) Containing more than 100 charts, this volume is a useful tool for classroom use, individual study, and as a handy reference.

Charts of Philosophy and Philosophers 


Mitchell, Craig Vincent (Author)	
									        	
									






Description


Philosophy and philosophers have had a profound, lasting impact on worldwide culture, history, politics, economics, and society. Philosophy has also had a significant shaping influence on religion, including Christianity. If one reads even slightly above a popular level in Christian theology or thought, one encounters a plethora of terms and ideas from philosophers throughout the ages. For those who didn't major in philosophy, this can sometimes feel like stumbling into a foggy, barely lit maze with many obstacles in the way. Following the helpful visual format of the popular ZondervanCharts series, Charts of Philosophy and Philosophers provides an in-depth survey of philosophy--its ideas, movements, history, and thinkers. Areas covered include: - Classical disciplines of philosophy - Analytic philosophy - Continental philosophy - Philosophy of religion Here is a valuable reference for anyone who wants to better understand the ideas that have shaped our world.

    This chart book provides the non-specialist with an outline of the major issues and themes in Bible prophecy 

 Description
 This chart book provides an outline of the major issues and themes in Bible prophecy. It is designed to appeal to non-specialist readers, yet in its detail and comprehensiveness it also serves the specialist well. While there are many books on prophecy, the vast majority deal with the subject from a particular perspective and tend to dismiss other views. This book seeks to be even-handed and to avoid prejudicing readers for or against particular points of view. 

The 120 charts fall into a number of groups as follows: 

An Introduction to Prophecy

Hermeneutics and Prophecy

Fulfilment of Prophecy

Prophetic Texts 

Systems of Eschatology

The Rapture and the Second Coming 

The Nation of Israel 

Teaching on the Tribulation 

The Olivet Discourse Teaching on the Millennium 

Daniel and Revelation 

Death and Afterlife

Comparative Eschatology

    A summary of the history, leadership and theological views of the major sects, cults, and religious movements in the US. 320 pages, from Zondervan.
    
        
        Philosophy and philosophers have had a profound, lasting impact on worldwide culture, history, politics, economics, and society. Philosophy has also had a significant shaping influence on religion, including Christianity. If one reads even slightly above a popular level in Christian theology or thought, one encounters a plethora of terms and ideas from philosophers throughout the ages. For those who didn't major in philosophy, this can sometimes feel like stumbling into a foggy, barely lit maze with many obstacles in the way. Following the helpful visual format of the popular ZondervanCharts series, Charts of Philosophy and Philosophers provides an in-depth survey of philosophy---its ideas, movements, history, and thinkers. Areas covered include: * Classical disciplines of philosophy * Analytic philosophy * Continental philosophy * Philosophy of religion Here is a valuable reference for anyone who wants to better understand the ideas that have shaped our world.
