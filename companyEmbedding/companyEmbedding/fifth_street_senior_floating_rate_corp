Fifth Street Finance Corp. And Fifth Street Senior Floating Rate Corp. Announce Promotion Of Steven M. Noreika To Chief Financial Officer






GlobeNewswire



Jul 10, 2015 9:51 AM EDT













 




























































 GREENWICH, CT, July 10, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fifth Street Finance Corp. (NASDAQ:FSC) ("FSC") and Fifth Street Senior Floating Rate Corp. (NASDAQ:FSFR) ("FSFR") today announced that the Boards of Directors for both FSC and FSFR have promoted Steven M. Noreika to Chief Financial Officer, replacing Richard A. Petrocelli, who will be leaving Fifth Street to pursue other opportunities effective July 10, 2015. We would like to thank Rich for his contributions during his tenure and wish him success in his future endeavors. Alexander C. Frank remains Chief Financial Officer of Fifth Street Asset Management Inc. (NASDAQ:FSAM) ("FSAM"), the parent company of FSC and FSFR's investment adviser.  Prior to his promotion, Mr. Noreika has been serving as the Chief Accounting Officer of FSAM. Mr. Noreika joined Fifth Street in September 2008 and during his tenure, he has held various finance and accounting positions, including Chief Financial Officer of FSFR from November 2013 to July 2014. Prior to joining Fifth Street, Mr. Noreika spent six years at Time Warner Inc., where he was a manager of internal reporting, and prior to that he managed audit and tax engagements at Marcum & Kliegman, LLP (now Marcum LLP). Mr. Noreika is a Certified Public Accountant and holds a B.B.A in Accounting from Pace University. He is also a holder of the Chartered Financial Analyst designation.  "Steve has been a valuable member of Fifth Street's finance and accounting team since joining in 2008, holding various important roles within the organization. I am excited to work closely with Steve in his new role and believe that FSC and FSFR will benefit from the depth of his knowledge, financial acumen and experience across the Fifth Street platform," stated Todd G. Owens, Chief Executive Officer of FSC.  "Having worked with Steve for seven years I am extremely confident that he will serve effectively as the new CFO for both FSC and FSFR, helping strengthen our infrastructure to support both entities," commented Ivelin M. Dimitrov, Chief Executive Officer of FSFR, adding, "Steve's deep financial, accounting and operational experience, combined with his knowledge of both the Fifth Street platform and comfort with financial reporting make him a natural fit for this position."

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fifth Street Senior Floating Rate Corporation Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Robyn Friedman, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.
Robyn Friedman
Thank you, Terrence. Good morning, and welcome to Fifth Street Senior Floating Rate Corp's second quarter 2017 earnings call. I am joined this morning by Bernard Berman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Steven Noreika, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Walter, Head of Institutional Products. Replay information for this call is included in our May 10, 2017 press release and is posted on the Investor Relations section of Fifth Street Senior Floating Rate Corp's website, which can be found at fsfr.fifthstreetfinance.com.

I will now turn the call over to Bernie.
Bernard Berman
Thank you, Robyn. Before turning to our quarterly results, I would like to briefly discuss the leadership transition that occurred last month. On April 5, 2017, I was appointed as CEO of FSFR following the resignation of Patrick Dalton. As you may know, I've been a partner at Fifth Street’s external advisor for over 12 years and have served as Chairman of FSFR’s Board of Directors since 2014. The leadership transition has been a smooth one and I am excited to lead FSFR as it continues to execute on its strategy to enhance shareholder value. 
For the quarter ended March 31, 2017, FSFR generated $0.17 of net investment income per share, slightly below our quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share. Net investment income per share was impacted by a one-time interest charge of $400,000 related to the downsizing of our Citibank credit facility, as well as lower revenue due to the timing of our investment activity. Despite the one time interest charge in this quarter related to downsizing the Citibank facility, we anticipate that we will save approximately $500,000 annually in unused fees through the reinvestment period. On a positive note, the March quarter was marked by credit stability and an increase in leverage back within our target range. 

Turning to our portfolio, FSFR continues to maintain a diverse portfolio of senior secured floating rate loans. As of March 31, 2017, our portfolio consisted of senior secured floating rate loans spread across 61 companies in 22 industries, with our largest investment, excluding our investment in our joint venture, accounting for 4.6% of total assets. As we outlined in prior calls, we have been working diligently to exit, restructure or improve underlying business performance at our stressed investments and maximize recoveries for our shareholders. To that end, during the March quarter, we exited our legacy investment Answers.com, a credit that had been a non-accrual, although we subsequently committed to, and retain a small portion of the DIP facility that is on accrual status. At this time, we have only one investment on PIK non-accrual, which represents 1.6% of total net investments at fair value or 2.7% at cost. 
Net asset value was relatively stable quarter over quarter, decreasing $0.03 from the prior quarter to $10.83. NAV was primarily impacted by under earning our dividend by $0.02, and was characterized by stable credit performance in our portfolio of companies. 
Turning to the broader middle market, we believe this environment continues to be challenging, despite a rebound in volumes from the fourth quarter. An increasing demand for new market entrants and private credit funds, has led to an increase in refinancings, which has resulted in significant spread tightening. As a result of this environment, we have selectively invested in credits that meet our risk adjusted return parameters, closing $83 million of investments during the March quarter. 
Another broader theme in the middle market has been the continued increase in LIBOR, with 100% of FSFR's debt portfolio in floating rate loans. We believe our portfolio is well positioned to benefit in a rising interest rate environment. As of March 31, 80% of the total debt portfolio had a LIBOR floor of 1%. Since three month LIBOR is currently at around 1.18%, LIBOR floors of 1% have been exceeded. And going forward, FSFR should experience improving net interest margins, which should result in a benefit to earnings. This benefit should increase as three month LIBOR continues to rise since over 50% of our capital structure is comprised of equity. 
Turning to our balance sheet, we are pleased to have increased the utilization of our liabilities and operated within our target range of 0.8 to 0.9 times debt to equity, ending the quarter at 087 leverage. As a reminder, in February our of Board of Directors declared a $0.19 dividend for the June quarter, payable on June 30, 2017 to shareholders of record on June 15, 2017. 
I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Steve Noreika to discuss our financial results for the quarter in greater detail.
Steven Noreika
Thank you, Bernie. We ended the second fiscal quarter of 2017 with total assets of $612.9 million, as compared to $590.2 million at December 31, 2016. Portfolio investments totaled $545.9 million at fair value and were spread across 61 companies at March 31, 2017. At the end of the March quarter, we have $48.1 million of cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash on our balance sheet. Net asset value per share was $10.83, as compared to $10.86 at the end of the December quarter. 
For the three months ended March 31, 2017, we generated total investment income of $11 million and net investment income of $5.1 million or $0.17 per share. During the second quarter of 2017, we closed $82.8 million of investments in nine new and two existing portfolio companies and funded $77.6 million across new and existing portfolio companies. We also received $48.4 in connection with full repayments and exits of seven of our investments, and an additional 424 million in connection with other pay downs and sales of investments. 

As of March 31, 2017, 87.6% of the portfolio consisted of senior secured floating rate loans. 11.3% of the portfolio consisted of investments in the subordinated notes and equity interests in FSFR Glick JV. And 1.1% consisted of equity investments in other portfolio companies. At March 31, the average size of our portfolio debt investment was $8.6 million and average portfolio company EBITDA was $66.3 million. Only one portfolio company was on PIK non-accrual status, representing 1.6% of total debt investments at fair value or 2.7% at cost. 
FSFR’s senior secured loan joint venture with the Glick Family, has $147.4 million in assets, including senior secured loans across 27 portfolio companies as of March 31. The joint venture generated $1.4 million of income during the quarter for FSFR. The weighted average yields on our debt investments, including the return on the JV, was 8.4% as of March 31, 2017 and included a cash component of 8.1%. 
We ended the second fiscal quarter of 2017 at 0.87 times debt to equity, within our targeted range of 0.8 to 0.9 times. As of March 31, we have $177.6 million dollars of notes payable outstanding related to our securitization, and $97.8 million drawn on our Citibank and East West Bank credit facilities.
I will now turn it back over to Robyn.

This Stock Has A 11.57% Yield, Sells For Less Than Book, and Insiders Have Been Buying
In this series, we look through the most recent Dividend Channel ''DividendRank'' report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months. The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both.

Fifth Street Finance Corp. and Fifth Street Senior Floating Rate Corp. Release July 2015 BDC Newsletter
JULY 15, 2015




Sale of GE Capital's Sponsor Business
As evidenced by the sale of GE Capital's sponsor finance business to the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, the landscape surrounding middle market leveraged lending continues to change.  Due to regulatory headwinds, we see a continued disintermediation of leveraged lending from the traditional banking sector, characterized by declining bank participation in middle market leveraged lending, while participation from non-bank lenders has increased year-over-year.  We believe that borrowers and sponsors favor a collaborative partnership approach, which non-bank lenders are typically able to provide through more flexible financing solutions, large hold sizes and diversified product offerings.  The non-bank lending space has become more institutionalized, gaining market share and influence.  For example, during the second quarter through mid-June, non-bank lenders captured 8.0% of left lead mandates that LCD has tracked, by volume, and 9.6% by number of loans, up from 3.4% and 6.4%, respectively, in the first quarter.
Middle Market Supply and Demand Imbalance Persists
On the macro front, an overall supply/demand imbalance continues to define the middle market as the ongoing disintermedmiation of leveraged lending from the traditional banking sector intensifies.  U.S. syndicated loan issuance increased quarter-over-quarter, mainly driven by refinancings, but when compared to the previous year, volume for the second quarter lagged behind last year's totals.  In line with the quarter-over-quarter increase in volume, since the first quarter, we have witnessed an increase in deal flow from select industry verticals such as healthcare, which is exhibiting relatively lower leverage and wider spreads, as compared to other traditional sectors.  We believe this dynamic exists due to lenders shying away from the complex reimbursement environment which characterizes these credits.  Fifth Street's established origination platform allows us to uncover such pockets of opportunity.  Our size, scale and ability to allocate across our platform positions us to maintain a steady flow of high quality loans.
Focused on Capital Preservation
As a leading middle market sponsor-backed lending platform, Fifth Street seeks to provide sponsors with both balance sheet flexibility and high-touch, value-added services.  We focus on capital preservation and maintain strict underwriting standards when deploying capital into new loans.  We feel confident in FSC and FSFR's conservative positioning, as we have continued to focus on senior secured instruments, since we believe the current risk/reward trade-off is strongest in first lien and one-stop transactions.  FSC opportunistically invests in second lien and mezzanine transactions when there are strong risk-adjusted return opportunities.  Additionally, as we continue to position the portfolios of both FSC and FSFR, we have limited our exposure to cyclical industries, including energy, consumer-driven businesses and companies with direct retail exposure.
As the economy continues to grow, we are positioning our investment vehicles for potential interest rate increases.  We believe FSC, with 74.0% floating rate assets, and FSFR, as a pure play, ~100% floating rate vehicle, are well-positioned for potential interest rate rises.  We are seeing continued pressure on LIBOR floors, with select deals decreasing LIBOR floors from 100 basis points to 75 basis points or 50 basis points.  Generally speaking, completing new deals with LIBOR floors below 100 basis points should slightly decrease the negative impact of rising interest rates up to 100 basis points.  After LIBOR rises more than 100 basis points, both FSC and FSFR should generate additional income and benefit from a rising interest rate environment.
Refocusing FSC on Core Middle Market Lending Businesses
As previously announced, FSC sold its portfolio company, Healthcare Finance Group, LLC ("HFG") to MidCap Financial.  HFG is a specialty lender providing asset-backed lending and term loan products to various segments of the healthcare industry.  FSC acquired HFG in June of 2013 and, together with management, expanded the company's suite of products and capabilities, positioning it for future growth.  Upon the sale of HFG, FSC generated approximately an 8.5% net return on its total investment.  
During FSC's recent strategic review, management decided that it was important to refocus FSC on its core lending businesses, including middle market sponsor-backed lending, aircraft and technology venture.  This decision was made because we believe that the middle market provides relatively strong opportunities and investing in its core lending businesses should allow FSC to generate higher risk-adjusted returns.
Prospective Management Fee Reduction at FSC Finalized
FSC has entered into a waiver with its investment adviser, a subsidiary of Fifth Street Asset Management Inc. (NASDAQ:FSAM) ("FSAM"), in which FSC's investment adviser has agreed to waive 1% of FSC's base management fee for increases in capital related to the issuance of new equity.  FSC's current base management fee is 2% of FSC's gross assets, excluding cash, but going forward, the fee related to the new equity raised will be 1%.  This waiver is effective until January 1, 2017 and it is the intention of FSAM to renew the waiver on an annual basis going forward.
The reduction in base management fee will benefit all shareholders equally, regardless of when they invested and was implemented to create additional operating leverage, allowing our shareholders to benefit from economies of scale as FSC grows.
FSFR Has Successfully Optimized Its Capital Structure
During the first half of 2015, we worked hard to strengthen FSFR's capital structure, closing on three different financing facilities, in order to position it for improved profitability and future growth.  FSFR was able to capitalize on an attractive capital markets environment to optimize its capital structure and lock in low-cost, long-term financing.
In January, FSFR closed on a $175.0 million credit facility provided by Citibank, which provided FSFR with the necessary leverage to reach its target leverage range of 0.8x to 0.9x debt-to-equity.  Then, in June, FSFR closed a $309.0 million debt securitization transaction, in which it issued $222.6 million of long-term secured notes to refinance its existing $200.0 million credit facility arranged by Natixis, New York Branch.  The third financing was completed in connection with FSFR Glick JV LLC ("FSFR Glick JV"), in which the joint venture entered into a $200.0 million credit facility with Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch, providing the ability to lever up to two times debt-to-equity.
By improving FSFR's capital structure, management believes that FSFR is well-positioned to continue investing in senior secured floating rate loans and take advantage of positive business trends.
Strategic Partnerships Continue to Expand
We continue to make significant progress in both funding and expanding our joint ventures at FSC and FSFR.  The ability to attract experienced institutional investors as partners is a vote of confidence in Fifth Street's origination platform, underwriting and portfolio management expertise. 
As of June 30, 2015, FSFR Glick JV, the joint venture between FSFR and entities controlled by members of the Glick Family, was approximately 45% ramped out of the total anticipated investment capacity of $300.0 million.  Consistent with our initial projections, we expect the joint venture to provide FSFR with a low-teens weighted average annualized return on investment when fully ramped.  
Subsequent to the June quarter, Senior Loan Fund JV I LLC ("SLF JV I"), the joint venture between FSC and a subsidiary of the Kemper Corporation, closed on $200.0 million of additional leverage sourced from Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch.  This additional leverage for SLF JV I should allow the joint venture to expand up to its anticipated investment capacity of $600.0 million.
We continue to have discussions with third parties about additional partnerships, as we have ample capacity to grow these and other similar joint ventures.  The joint ventures expand each BDC's investment capacity to underwrite senior secured middle market loans and provide an efficient way to finance assets that enhance returns for our shareholders.
We look forward to discussing our June quarterly results in more detail during FSC's and FSFR's respective quarterly earnings calls, which will both be held in August.
Sincerely,
The Fifth Street Team
