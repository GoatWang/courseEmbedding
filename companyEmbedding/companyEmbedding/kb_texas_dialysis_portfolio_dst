 KB EXCHANGE TRUST PURCHASES THREE MEDICAL PROPERTIES IN TEXAS AND MISSOURI - Kingsbarn Realty Capital















































 




COMPANY NEWS



























KB EXCHANGE TRUST PURCHASES THREE MEDICAL PROPERTIES IN TEXAS AND MISSOURI



Los Angeles, CA (May 9, 2017) – KB Exchange Trust ("KB") announced the acquisition of three buildings located in Texas and Missouri. All three properties are newly-constructed dialysis clinics leased to Fresenius Medical Care, totaling a combined rentable space of approximately 28,000 square feet. The properties were acquired in separate transactions for a combined purchase price of $13.5 million.



"We have had a growing demand for medical properties in Texas," stated KB Exchange Trust managing partner Jeff Pori. "Finding credit-tenant medical properties with long-term leases in place can be challenging. We have been very successful at having inventory available for our investors to close in accordance with their exchange timelines." 

        "All of the properties in this portfolio were acquired from preferred developers from whom we have previously acquired medical properties. Our consistent ability to locate and acquire these investment-grade, medical opportunities is a hallmark of our 1031 exchange program," Pori added. "Our investors expect us to have these properties available when they are ready to close and complete their exchanges."

Publicly-traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: FMS), Fresenius Medical Care is the world's largest provider of dialysis services for chronic kidney diseases. Fresenius has a $30 billion market capitalization with over 100,000 employees and a network of over 3,600 dialysis clinics in North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia-Pacific, and Africa. The top provider of dialysis treatment in the world, Fresenius Medical Care is a Global Fortune 500® Company.




KB has acquired 23 healthcare-related properties within the past three years for its various 1031 exchange related programs.

* This undertaking does not affect any limits Section 102(a) of the National Securities Markets
        Improvement Act of 1996 ("NSMIA") [Pub. L. No. 104-290, 110 Stat. 3416 (Oct. 11, 1996)] imposes on the ability of States to

        extent NSMIA permits them to do so under NSMIA's preservation of their anti-fraud authority.
