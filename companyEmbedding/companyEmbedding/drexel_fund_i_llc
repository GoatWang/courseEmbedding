Equities

In the late 1990’s, the advent of Alternative Trading Systems (ATS) and the adoption of decimalization forever changed the cash equity markets. Since that time, the equity markets have been among the most dynamic and evolutionary in the world. Dominated by revolutionary advances in technology, today’s equity markets demand a comprehensive understanding of the continually changing market structure landscape as well as the technology through which it is connected. Drexel Hamilton enjoys a unique complement often not available at a boutique broker-dealer that perfectly serves our customers – expert technologists paired with expert traders.
While technology dominates the cash equity business, Drexel Hamilton has never forgotten that this is still a “people business.” The most important connection we can make is the one we establish with our customers as we seek to understand their businesses, trading, and service requirements. We strive to serve as an extension of our customer’s interest, whether actively representing them in the market place or simply providing service into our customer in-between transactions.
The services delivered by Drexel Hamilton’s equity team of professionals includes:




Execution Services

Algorithmic & program trading
Floor brokerage
Corporate buybacks
Transition management
Pairs trading
Domestic/global equity execution
Equity option execution



Full Service Brokerage

Equity research
Domestic/global equity execution strategy
Equity option execution strategy
Chartered Market Technician (CMT)
Pre- and post-trade transaction cost analysis





Prior to buying or selling an option, investors must read a copy of the Characteristics & Risks of Standardized Options, also known as the options disclosure document (ODD). It explains the characteristics and risks of exchange traded options.  
Copies of this document may be obtained from your broker, from any exchange on which options are traded or by contacting the Options Clearing Corporation directly at 1 N. Wacker Dr., Suite 500, Chicago, IL 60606. (1-888-678-4667).
