The Scope and Authority of the Bible

Author: James Barr
Publisher: SCM
Publication Date: 2002
Pages: 154

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




The Scope and Authority of the Bible brings together seven essays that represent James Barr’s style, approach to, and outlook on contemporary biblical topics. Characterized by the freshness and openness of thought, and the iconoclasm for which he is famous, this collection serves as an ideal introduction to one of the most important issues facing the churches today, as well as to Barr’s thought as a whole.


It is accessible and fascinating to read.
—Church Times
Barr cuts a devastatingly clear path through selected controversies, saying something convincing, constructive, and often original on each.

The Semantics of Biblical Language

Author: James Barr
Publisher: SCM
Publication Date: 1983
Pages: 313

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Arguing that many Evangelicals mishandle linguistic evidence in their exegesis, James Barr analyzes in detail several common patterns that can put sound Bible interpretation out of reach. Barr’s analysis drew a good deal of criticism and was explosive in Evangelical circles. However, 20 years later, Barr’s conclusions still demand serious consideration. This book poses questions that are essential for all serious Bible students to wrestle with.






About the Author
James Barr (1924–2006) was an Old Testament scholar noted for his contributions to the study of biblical languages. His book The Semantics of the Biblical Languages remains one of the most influential books on the subject. He held professorships at the University of Edinburgh, University of Manchester, Princeton University, and Vanderbilt University. Barr is also the author of Biblical Words for Time.

About Jim Barr Chemistry has interested me since my first day of high school chemistry when Mr. Luthy ignited a large jug of methanol vapor that singed the ceiling tile leaving a discolored ring. I took an "advanced" chemistry course the subsequent year and have been immersed in the discipline ever since. I attended Freed-Hardeman University (FHU) after high school and graduated with a degree in chemistry and a minor in mathematics. My intention was to continue into pharmaceutical research, but I always had this nagging interest in physics and, at the last moment, decided to go on to graduate school to pursue a degree in chemical physics. I attended the University of Nevada, Reno, (UNR) after graduating from FHU and had the opportunity to take part in several different research projects as well as work with the Department of Energy at Sandia National Laboratory in their Combustion Research Facility. I worked with Dr. Cline at UNR and was fortunate to have great success in our projects involved in chemical dynamics and molecular control. In 2005, after graduation, I decided to return to FHU. Currently, I am finishing my Ph.D. in chemistry through the University of Memphis with research focusing on the spectral properties of nobel metal nanoparticles. I was greatly blessed while a student at FHU. The faculty were considerate and encouraging, and the Christian atmosphere was nurturing such that I can truly say that I would not be the person I am today without FHU. My desire is to continue to help provide a place of learning that will foster academic excellence as well as spiritual growth and maturity.

About Jim Barr
Jim Barr first was introduced to emu oil products in 1996 from a well known emu expert who held a blueprint for a processing emu oil. By 1999, the processing was still not in operation and experiencing challenges. After coming to an agreement with the owner, Jim Barr moved to Alabama to take over as supervisor of construction to solve these challenges. This was to be the first processing house to be built exclusively to produce emu oil products. After re-doing the floor plan and fabricating the necessary equipment to process emu oil, the company moved forward and passed USDA inspection and also obtained E. U. (European Union) approval.
While there, Jim oversaw day to day plant operations, hired all labor and purchased all supplies. At the same time, he also began to work in a public relations role with emu farmers. Later, Detria McCleery and he decided to begin Nature�s Partner to launch the highest quality emu oil and emu oil products. Her role as financial officer and marketing representative has helped propel Nature�s Partner to the forefront of their industry. As the company has grown, Jim was able to continually improve many products and develop new ones that were consistently superior to others on the market.
Jim says, "When formulating a product my first priority is to stay as completely "all natural" as possible. I have also found that combining my knowledge of Emu oil with a retired pharmacist or special formulators in product labs gives me great ideas on what to add to the oil for designing a new product or improving an existing product."
These steps have propelled Nature�s Partner and Jim and Detria�s company into expanded retail sales as well as large wholesale accounts. Jim gives talks around the country on the benefits of emu oil products and consults with other emu companies and leaders.
O.I.T. Sales & Marketing, Inc.
O.I.T. Sales & Marketing, Inc. is a sales oriented company that is dedicated to providing superior, natural products to aging baby boomers. The corporate office is in San Angelo, Texas with two sales offices in Tennessee. Mr. & Mrs. James R. Barr, residents of Tennessee and Mr. & Mrs. Sherry McCleery, residents of Texas, are the co-owners of the Corporation. O.I.T. is a Subchapter S Corporation formed in the 1990's to provide a line of natural health and beauty aides containing pure emu oil.
Consisting of approximately 20 proven products, "Nature's Partner" includes pure emu oil, all natural glucosamine cream for joint discomfort and muscle strain, coelastin skin cream, prostate cream, Woman's Balance Cream and body lotion. "Nature's Partner" was the first emu oil product line to be recognized by the American Emu Association as utilizing only certified fully reined emu oil, top grade according to AEA standards.
Initially, O.I.T. wholesaled products to independent pharmacies, natural foods stores and other independently owned businesses in the U.S. The corporation in now expanding as larger national and international firms express interest. Company executives also market products via trade shows, trade publications and infomercials.
Mr. James Barr, President is a successful businessman with 30 years' management experience. His wife, Jean is Vice-President of Communications & Administration in Eastern Division.
Mrs. Deitra McCleery, Secretary-Treasure, Corporate Office has 25 years of experience in basic accounting support services as well as ten years in marketing/sales. She plays an active role in financial management and marketing. Husband, Sherryl is Vice-President of Western Division. He develops genetic stock to provide superior emu oil for "Nature's Partner".
Extensive research indicates that the "Baby Boomers Generation" is growing older, but it doesn't want its physical appearance to reflect this natural aging process. The projected base of customers continue to grow as "boomers" search for product that inhibit the aging process, alleviate pain without the use of drugs and maintain an appearance of the illusive youthfulness while at the same time living on a fixed income.

Contributions[edit]
Statistical Analysis System (SAS)[edit]
Widely used internationally in science, government, industry, and academia, the SAS System was founded by Barr in 1966.[1] In September 1966, in Athens, Georgia, he presented the conceptual ideas of SAS to members of the Committee on Statistical Software of the University Statisticians of the Southern Experiment Stations (USSES).[2]
Barr had earlier created an analysis-of-variance modeling language inspired by the notation of statistician Maurice Kendall. He developed it in assembly language on the IBM 1410, as a graduate student at North Carolina State University from 1962 to 1963. Dr. A. Grandage, author of IBM 650 analysis-of-variance programs, advised on some of the statistical computations.[3] This was followed by a multiple regression program with a flexible input format and with algebraic transformation of variables, in 1963 to 1964. Drawing on those programs, along with his experience with structured data files, he created SAS, placing statistical procedures into a formatted file framework.[2]
Barr's experience with structured data files was gained while working on the Formatted File System, (see below). From 1966 to 1968, Barr developed the fundamental structure and language of SAS.[2]
In 1968, Barr began collaboration with others. Barr designed and implemented the programming language, data management, report writing, and systems areas of the evolving system.[4] In 1976, SAS Institute, Inc. was incorporated by Anthony J. Barr, James H. Goodnight, John P. Sall, and Jane T. Helwig, with Barr holding the largest share (40%). He sold his shares in 1979.[2]
Automated Classification of Medical Entities (ACME)[edit]
Barr created the ACME program for the National Center for Health Statistics from 1967 to 1969. ACME is a computer program that assigns one underlying cause of death based on multiple causes of death listed on the death certificate.[5]
ACME in conjunction with other components comprise the Mortality Medical Data System (MMDS). This system is used to uniformly determine underlying cause of death for all death certificates in the United States. ACME has become the de facto international standard for the automated selection of the underlying cause of death.[6] It and the other components of MMDS, or variations of them are used in many nations around the world. The system provides essential data used in calculating mortality statistics.
Automated Lumber Yield Optimization[edit]
In 1971 and 1972, Barr, along with partner Sandy Mullin designed, patented, and built the first computerized equipment to optimize the usage of lumber in the furniture industry. The device read marked flaws on a board, calculated the cross and rip cuts required for optimal board usage, and marked the cut lines on the board.[7]
In 1973, Barr-Mullin, Inc. was incorporated, and its lumber yield optimization technology remains widely used in the American wood industry.[8][9]
Linking Loader for the IBM/360[edit]
In 1968, Barr created the first non-IBM linking loader for the IBM/360. Named LDR, the loader was sponsored by American Data Processing Inc. of Raleigh, North Carolina. The Barr Loader cut typical program testing times by twenty-five percent.[10][11]
IBM did not offer the equivalent Loader for over eighteen months after the Barr Loader was commercially available.[5]
IBM Workstation Simulators[edit]
In 1971, Barr created the first non-IBM HASP terminal emulator. Marketed by the University Computing Company (UCC), the HASP emulator gave a significant performance increase over the IBM 2780 emulator he had developed for UCC in 1969. The emulators were developed on the PDP-8 minicomputer and allowed COPE terminals to communicate with the IBM/360 and IBM/370.[5]
In 1971, Barr also implemented the HASP workstation for M & M Computer Industries, Orange, California. Implemented on the Data General Nova minicomputer, the program became the Singer Corporation Remote Batch Terminal. Both Singer and UCC sold their terminal divisions to Harris Corporation, which continued to market the products.[5]
In 1983, Barr developed hardware and software for performing HASP remote job entry communication on the IBM PC. His company, Barr Systems, Inc., marketed and sold Barr HASP,[12] and went on to implement and support Bisync and SNA SDLC workstations and gateways, along with other data communications and output management products.[13]
Formatted File System (FFS)[edit]
Barr was employed with IBM Federal Systems Division at the Pentagon, Washington, D.C. from 1964 to 1966.[14] There he worked on the NIPS Formatted File System. FFS, a generalized data base management system for retrieval and report writing, was one of the first data management systems to take advantage of defined file structure for data storage and retrieval efficiency.[15]
Assigned to work with the National Military Command Center, the information processing branch of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Barr rewrote and enhanced FFS, implementing three of its five major components: retrieval, sorting, and file update. His work featured the innovation of a uniform lexical analyzer for all languages in the system with a uniform method of handling all error messages.[2]
Working with FFS introduced Barr to the potential of the defined file structure, which was to become a central concept of SAS (above).[2]

Contributions[edit]
Statistical Analysis System (SAS)[edit]
Widely used internationally in science, government, industry, and academia, the SAS System was founded by Barr in 1966.[1] In September 1966, in Athens, Georgia, he presented the conceptual ideas of SAS to members of the Committee on Statistical Software of the University Statisticians of the Southern Experiment Stations (USSES).[2]
Barr had earlier created an analysis-of-variance modeling language inspired by the notation of statistician Maurice Kendall. He developed it in assembly language on the IBM 1410, as a graduate student at North Carolina State University from 1962 to 1963. Dr. A. Grandage, author of IBM 650 analysis-of-variance programs, advised on some of the statistical computations.[3] This was followed by a multiple regression program with a flexible input format and with algebraic transformation of variables, in 1963 to 1964. Drawing on those programs, along with his experience with structured data files, he created SAS, placing statistical procedures into a formatted file framework.[2]
Barr's experience with structured data files was gained while working on the Formatted File System, (see below). From 1966 to 1968, Barr developed the fundamental structure and language of SAS.[2]
In 1968, Barr began collaboration with others. Barr designed and implemented the programming language, data management, report writing, and systems areas of the evolving system.[4] In 1976, SAS Institute, Inc. was incorporated by Anthony J. Barr, James H. Goodnight, John P. Sall, and Jane T. Helwig, with Barr holding the largest share (40%). He sold his shares in 1979.[2]
Automated Classification of Medical Entities (ACME)[edit]
Barr created the ACME program for the National Center for Health Statistics from 1967 to 1969. ACME is a computer program that assigns one underlying cause of death based on multiple causes of death listed on the death certificate.[5]
ACME in conjunction with other components comprise the Mortality Medical Data System (MMDS). This system is used to uniformly determine underlying cause of death for all death certificates in the United States. ACME has become the de facto international standard for the automated selection of the underlying cause of death.[6] It and the other components of MMDS, or variations of them are used in many nations around the world. The system provides essential data used in calculating mortality statistics.
Automated Lumber Yield Optimization[edit]
In 1971 and 1972, Barr, along with partner Sandy Mullin designed, patented, and built the first computerized equipment to optimize the usage of lumber in the furniture industry. The device read marked flaws on a board, calculated the cross and rip cuts required for optimal board usage, and marked the cut lines on the board.[7]
In 1973, Barr-Mullin, Inc. was incorporated, and its lumber yield optimization technology remains widely used in the American wood industry.[8][9]
Linking Loader for the IBM/360[edit]
In 1968, Barr created the first non-IBM linking loader for the IBM/360. Named LDR, the loader was sponsored by American Data Processing Inc. of Raleigh, North Carolina. The Barr Loader cut typical program testing times by twenty-five percent.[10][11]
IBM did not offer the equivalent Loader for over eighteen months after the Barr Loader was commercially available.[5]
IBM Workstation Simulators[edit]
In 1971, Barr created the first non-IBM HASP terminal emulator. Marketed by the University Computing Company (UCC), the HASP emulator gave a significant performance increase over the IBM 2780 emulator he had developed for UCC in 1969. The emulators were developed on the PDP-8 minicomputer and allowed COPE terminals to communicate with the IBM/360 and IBM/370.[5]
In 1971, Barr also implemented the HASP workstation for M & M Computer Industries, Orange, California. Implemented on the Data General Nova minicomputer, the program became the Singer Corporation Remote Batch Terminal. Both Singer and UCC sold their terminal divisions to Harris Corporation, which continued to market the products.[5]
In 1983, Barr developed hardware and software for performing HASP remote job entry communication on the IBM PC. His company, Barr Systems, Inc., marketed and sold Barr HASP,[12] and went on to implement and support Bisync and SNA SDLC workstations and gateways, along with other data communications and output management products.[13]
Formatted File System (FFS)[edit]
Barr was employed with IBM Federal Systems Division at the Pentagon, Washington, D.C. from 1964 to 1966.[14] There he worked on the NIPS Formatted File System. FFS, a generalized data base management system for retrieval and report writing, was one of the first data management systems to take advantage of defined file structure for data storage and retrieval efficiency.[15]
Assigned to work with the National Military Command Center, the information processing branch of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Barr rewrote and enhanced FFS, implementing three of its five major components: retrieval, sorting, and file update. His work featured the innovation of a uniform lexical analyzer for all languages in the system with a uniform method of handling all error messages.[2]
Working with FFS introduced Barr to the potential of the defined file structure, which was to become a central concept of SAS (above).[2]
