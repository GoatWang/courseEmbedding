                           This book is devoted exclusively to the budgeting process in school districts, unlike the more common generic budgeting texts.
                              As such, it allows an in-depth treatment of both conceptual and practical aspects of budgeting in a single volume. By default,
                              school business officials have had to rely on the state education accounting manual as their primary text, supplemented by
                              state department of education memoranda and data, school district budget documents and related materials, individual chapters
                              from books on school business management, and journal articles. This book remedies this situation and fulfills two purposes:
                              to be used as a textbook and as a reference book. As the former, it is intended for use in graduate courses in educational
                              administration for aspiring administrators--particularly those courses in business administration, fiscal management, and
                              school finance. It can also be used as a text in professional development for practicing administrators. As a reference book,
                              it can serve as a source of new ideas, good practices, and useful examples for school administrators. Chapter topics include
                              budget and budgeting, organization for budgeting, accounting as the language of budgeting, building the budget, budget adjustments,
                              marketing the budget, managing the budget, and use of microcomputer models in budgeting. Contains lists of tables and figures.

                              the most important resources are elements such as basic and supplemental staffing levels, staff time, funding amounts for

                           The paper reviews state categorical funding programs to serve special need populations among school age children (including
                              handicapped, educationally disadvantaged, bilingual, and vocational education students); examines the literature on costs
                              of categorical programs; and presents an alternative framework for addressing the problem. A cost based funding approach is
                              advocated which would provide equal access to educational resources across local districts serving similar student populations.
                              The model also makes provisions for systematic differences in access to resources to districts serving special populations.
                              It is explained as an approach which gives policy makers a basis to examine cost savings in trade offs among resources and
                              programs. Applications of the resource cost model are presented along with a section on the step by step process of constructing
                              a cost estimate in a hypothetical school district. A final section addresses equity and efficiency issues of the model. (Cl)

                           To help school districts estimate the present and future needs and costs of their special education programs, this manual
                              presents the Local Special Education Planning Model, an interactive computer program (with worksheets) that provides a framework
                              for using a district's own data to analyze its special education program. Part 1 of the manual discusses the model, its development,
                              and its four operating steps, which include filling out worksheets, entering the data into the computer, reviewing the output,
                              and making alternative projections. Part 2 describes how to complete the eight worksheets, which cover basic district data,
                              special education categories and instructional programs, related district services, current and anticipated student placements
                              in the instructional programs, personnel ratios, and district support services. Entering the data into the computer is explained
                              in part 3, while part 4 reviews 18 reports generated by the model that show the current and future costs, placements, personnel
                              requirements, and program and services requirements of a district's total special education program. The final part discusses
                              how to generate alternative projections. Attached to the manual are copies of the model's computer program and blank copies
                              of the eight worksheets. (Author/RW)

                           An examination of school finance reform and special education finance issues is presented in this paper. It describes a general
                              model of the educational finance system, in which state and federal general and categorical aid combines with district fiscal
                              capacity to determine educational expenditures, which in turn affect educational programs and, in consequence, educational
                              outcomes. School finance reform activities are then reviewed and the general model is used to highlight the aspects of the
                              system at which reform efforts are being targeted and to make explicit the critical assumptions of the reform proposals. Finally,
                              the special education finance subsystem is cast in terms of the educational finance model and the relationship of special
                              education finance to general school finance is investigated. Particular attention is paid to the effects of recent changes
                              in special education laws and to those areas in which additional study is needed. (Author/JEH)

                           To investigate school districts' responses to fiscal constraint, this study examined the relationship between districts' expenditures
                              per student and allocations of funds to instructional, support, and administrative costs. Budget allocations, as indicators
                              of the districts' priorities, were compared for 1978-79 and 1981-82 in 46 Oregon school districts whose fiscal situations
                              varied widely. The findings indicate that when fiscal constraint was greatest, priority was given to instruction over other
                              budget categories, and to personnel over other objects of expenditure. As constraint diminished, larger shares of budgets
                              were allocated to administration and to capital outlay. Surprisingly, however, the school districts in the sample generally
                              did not experience fiscal constraint; none of them had actual budget reductions, and both total expenditures and expenditures
                              per student grew substantially in real dollars dispite Oregon's severe recession. Finally, although the sample districts had
                              reduced the number of teachers, they had increased their total instructional staffs and decreased the student/instructional
                              personnel ratio by adding less expensive instructional aides. (Author/MCG)

                                 the costs of special education. The procedures require specification of the student population to be served; description of

                                 The paper describes a study in which detailed student and program specifications from 28 states and national sources were
                                 obtained to identify the variables that have the largest impact on costs and to show the effects of uncertainty associated

                                 special education programs and services for all school-aged handicapped children in the U.S. in 1980-81. a resource-cost model
                                 approach was selected, based on a mathematical formulation of the relationships among students, programs, resources, and decision
                                 rules involved in the special education process. Data from 26 states concerning current and expected programming practices
                                 and characteristics of the handicapped population formed the data base to operate the resource-cost model. Results showed
                                 the most likely estimate of special education costs for all school-aged handicapped children in 1980-81 to be $7.926 billion.
                                 Extremes of the high ($20 billion) and low ($4 billion) estimates indicated the critical importance of program decisions.
                                 The paper concludes with a discussion of policy implications and uses of both the resource-cost methodology and the cost estimates,
                                 together with future research questions suggested by the study. (Author/LD)

                              The measure of district wealth used by a state is a critical factor in reducing the potential extremes in available resources
                                 that may occur across districts. To be effective, the state definition of wealth should correlate closely with the local tax
                                 structure that is available to school districts to raise local revenues. Conversely, if wealth is measured improperly, state
                                 aid could be distributed in ways that create or exacerbate disparities in per pupil spending. The purpose of this study is
                                 to identify measures of wealth that are feasible for state school finance systems and examine the impact of alternative definitions
                                 of wealth on distribution of state aid to school districts and on the fiscal equity in the school finance system. Pennsylvania
                                 and its 500 school districts were used to illustrate the possible measures of wealth and to test their potential application
                                 in practice. Pennsylvania conducted a costing out study that changed the formula that was used to distribute state funding
                                 to schools. Equity measures from this study illustrate that the concept of equity based on equal spending is outdated in pa.
                                 The objective of the current system of funding in Pennsylvania is to achieve adequacy. The adequacy target established for
                                 each district has identified a figure that the state determines to be the amount it takes for districts to achieve similar
                                 results. The system does not focus on equalizing spending as much as it is focusing on equalizing outcomes. Wealth measures
                                 used in the mvpi ar now have little impact on funding in pa. The findings of this study indicate that even when relying on

                              This report reviews local tax reform and describes an approach to simulating the effects of proposed tax reform on local school
                                 districts in Pennsylvania. The microcomputer spreadsheet simulation led to the development of a model able to meet the feasibility
                                 criteria established for such a simulation model. The model was designed to input financial data from 1985 through 1987, estimate
                                 the revenues anticipated for the current year (1987-1988); and then use budgeted revenues for the following year (1988-1989),

                              As funding for special education increases, it becomes important for educational policy-makers to understand the effects caused
                                 by the distribution of monies. This paper focuses on key programmatic and management issues in the funding of special education.
                                 Four main topics are discussed: (1) the relationship between special education programs and costs, (2) primary funding formulas
                                 used for special education, (3) policy issues affected by the funding formulas, and (4) motivational effects of the various
                                 funding formulas. Also examined are the effects of the funding approach used by P.L. 94-142 (Education for All Handicapped
                                 Children Act) to allocate federal funds. (Author/LD)
