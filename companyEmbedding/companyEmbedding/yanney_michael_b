America’s Worst Board Members: Michael B. Yanney Of Level 3

March 17, 2011 11:05 am EDT




Print




Email









Tweet











 



Level 3 (NASDAQ: LVLT), by almost any measure, has been one of the worst run large American companies over the last five years. The firm lost $623 million in 2010 on revenue of $3.59 billion. Level 3’s net loss from 2006 to 2010 was $3.47 billion.
James Q. Crowe has been Chief Executive Officer of the huge ISP since August 1997 and a director since June 1993. The company’s performance has deteriorated sharply during the last five years of his tenure. Level 3 shares are down nearly 70% and its stock now trades at just above $1. Crowe was been paid $16 million by the board from 2006 to 2009. It is surprising he kept his job based on Level 3’s performance. 


Michael Yanney has been a director of Level 3 since March 1998. He has been on the board’s nominating and governance committee. Yanney was paid $208,863 in 2009, according to the Level 3 proxy.
As a senior director Yanney has clearly done nothing to improve the performance or force out CEO Crowe or Chairman Walter Scott, Jr.  Scott has been chairman since 1997 and a board member since 1964. He and Crowe have been entrenched in their positions for far too long. Yanney and the board have a responsibility to remedy that. But, over the course of 13 years, particularly the last five, Yanney hasn’t bothered.

Yanney Heritage Park Foundation History
In January 1998 the E.K. & Mary Yanney Heritage Park idea was introduced to the public. The park idea was conceived from a meeting between Michael B. Yanney, a native of Kearney, and city park officials. Based on his philanthropic values and a strong sense of community, Mr. Yanney wanted to do something special for other families who call Kearney home. The acquisition of 80-acres in southwest Kearney was made and the park was named in honor of Mr. Yanney’s parents, E.K. and Mary Yanney.
The process has been unique in that it is a donor driven park. Each park component is endowed at 20% of its cost to be put into a growth account to be used for future repair or maintenance. There has been tremendous success with the private donations and a variety of public matching grants to create park components. The park has its own Foundation and it is responsible for the development of the park. Upon completion of the park the Foundation will deed it to the City of Kearney for only the cost of ongoing maintenance.
Yanney Heritage Park has come a long way over the years. Steadily, an 80-acre cornfield has been transformed into a first-class city park with many unique features. The park has been and continues to be blessed with many generous donations and is well on its way to becoming one of the finest city parks in the Midwest.
