Interview: Keith D. Nosbusch, president, Rockwell Automation Control Systems

'Never lose focus on the customer and the need for the customer to be successful.'
 Mark T. Hoske, Editor-in-Chief
02/11/2000
Share


Keith D. Nosbusch, president Rockwell Automation Control Systems, spoke to Control Engineering at Automation Fair 99 , Dec. 9, 1999, in Long Beach, Calif. Excerpts follow.
 Q. Please discuss several things in Rockwell Automation's past that have become vital in where the company stands today and how it's positioned for the future. 
There are many areas we could discuss. I'll highlight four.
1. Forming an independent software business. This helped us focus on a very important portion of company development, mindset, and culture to succeed in the software business.
2. Deciding to open up our networks. Historically, we've had a proprietary environment, with tendency to enjoy protection from competitors. We've had to consider what customers needed, and how we could address their needs. Open networks required that we open up and compete in a different way. At the time, not everyone agreed that's how we should have proceeded. It has since proven to be a smart move with formation of Open DeviceNet Vendor Association and the ControlNet International organization, leading to the entire concept of open automation. The decision to be open, in the broader prospective, bodes well for us in the future. It's really changed the tone of what's happening in the company.
3. Splitting business with services independent of Rockwell Automation products. This helps us meet customer needs and expand the scope of services to customers any time, anywhere in the world.
4. Forming Sourcealliance.com , which provides a very strong leadership position for integrated supply of electrical commodities. Customers were seeking ability to buy from the electrical category of products from one source. As we did with the formation of DeviceNet and ControlNet organizations, we'll be the catalyst for an independent organization, but then will step away from having controlling interest. This is a forward-thinking move, without consideration to protecting the past. We think we should provide leadership in this area.
 Q. What are key factors in customers' environments today influencing how Rockwell Automation goes to market? 
There's more effort put into solving and meeting customers' business needs and problems. We're less focused on products for products' sake. Many customers don't have a large engineering staff and are looking for suppliers to provide that expertise, allowing customers to focus on core competitiveness. We have to help customers examine the total cost of ownership.
As a company, we're moving beyond acquisitions to sell across the businesses, creating solutions at higher levels in customers' companies. Mainly, we've focused on the plant floor; now it's the CEO and CFO as well. There's great value and impact resulting from integrating customer processes at multiple levels. A lot of customers are looking to consolidate their customer base and reduce costs.
 Q. Isn't it a dichotomy that customers would seek more open systems and fewer suppliers? Wouldn't a goal of embracing open systems be to have more suppliers? 
Customers want a single-point of responsibility. Openness helps create the best value proposition-having the ability to replace a vendor creates leverage. The threat is healthy. If we don't have the best product, then customers can go elsewhere. Such a structure drives costs out of customers' systems. When you drill down to what customers really want, it's a single point of response. It's like the Cold War premise of trust, but verify. To adapt, Rockwell Automation has been changing and reshaping, changing our culture, and driving to the new model.
We've initiated the process of continual growth, and, as a company, have done a very good job of it a number of times. One good example is the transition from electromechanical to solid-state to software, and the expansion into services.
We'll continue to take advantage of market changes and never lose focus on the customer and the need for the customer to be successful. We need to respond to customer needs, listen, and never be arrogant.
I'd like to think that whatever happens in this company, no one would ever get fired for helping a customer. If we take care of customers, they'll reward us. We have thousands of stories of how our people have gone to extraordinary means to care for customers.
Q. How do industrial networks fit into the open concept?
NetLinx provides common services while remaining media-independent from device through the Internet, via DeviceNet, ControlNet, and Ethernet. A common set of services can run on all of them with producer-consumer technology providing a seamless migration between. This is an important differentiation we have in the marketplace. We've seen global acceptance of our network strategy-open, using commercially available protocols. It's a great competitive advantage for customers to get at any information from anywhere in the architecture. We're not afraid of Ethernet on the factory floor. You've now seen our first Ethernet PLC, not a demo, but a robust solution for sale now.
Q. What are some other technologies or products changing how customers think about and implement automation and control solutions?
The next evolution is tying the shop floor to business systems to improve the agility of customers. The next thrust for customers and the company is in the services side, integration and asset management, helping them to do things in their facilities and on the plant floor. In addition, our control platform integrates multiple disciplines, driving out cost, and improving time to market. There are so many great technology examples. (I get in trouble when I start naming them, because someone always feels left out.) Some of many current technology examples at the show here include Manufacturing BusinessWare, RSLogix, RSLinx, the PowerFlex family of drives, and Zero-Force touch buttons.
Q. What are among the most difficult challenges for customers today? What advice or assistance can you offer?
With the accelerated pace of technology, suppliers are being asked to do more. Fewer customers are automation or technology experts, nor do they want to be experts.
We're helping customers connect to product information. Among our 'what-next' Internet efforts, Rockwell Automation has augmented its own e-business site, www.rockwellautomation.com , while orchestrating the multivendor supersite, www.sourcealliance.com .
On our site, we've added another way for customers to access the distribution channel. More than 99% of our distribution channel supports what we're doing. Continued success requires change in how we do business; we can't just ignore these changes, or they would have passed us by.We're making these changes in conjunction with our distribution channel. Local sources provide pre- and post-sale services. These changes make customers more effective in assets and inventory and they lower transaction costs.
E-commerce will play a role, but no one can predict how it's going to end up. Web sites are more than just selling. going to a site is become an experience, providing information and self-help. We're not focused on moving all business to direct Internet-based sales. We want to enable customers and the distribution channel to be more effective. This is one way to help serve customers and distributors.About Keith D. Nosbusch, president, Rockwell Automation Control Systems

Interview with Keith Nosbusch, CEO of Rockwell Automation: Manufacturers Will Not Move Back to the U.S. for Political Reasons 



Rockwell Automation Chairman and CEO Keith Nosbusch recently gave an interview to China Business News, one of the most influential business newspapers in China with a circulation of 720,000. Below is the English translation of the full article.
"American Manufacturing Reflux" and "American Reindustrialization" have become buzzwords over the past two years. The third industrial revolution represented by "3-D Printing" and "Smart Manufacturing" seems to provide an unprecedented opportunity for American reindustrialization. As the most important manufacturing base in the world, will China’s position be threatened?
In a recent interview with China Business News, Keith Nosbusch, Chairman and CEO, Rockwell Automation, commented that businesses will not pull back manufacturing facilities to the United States for political reasons. If they do move them back, they do it because of economic reasons. He added that though American politicians can do some lobbying, it only works when they can create an environment for business success. Decision-makers of large enterprises are pursuing bigger economic benefits and higher competitiveness, especially in the long term.
Last year end, Tim Cook, Apple CEO expressed that they will make big investments to rebuild their iMac production line in the U.S., which generated big concern in the industry. As a member of the Council on Competitiveness, Keith D. Nosbusch commented that "It is key for businesses to be close to their customers. For Apple, it has a big customer base in the United States, but most of its current manufacturing is done outside of the United States, so it's natural for Apple to pull some of its manufacturing back to the U.S."
"Many American businesses set up their manufacturing facilities in China not purely because China has cheap labor, but also because they believe China will be a huge consumption market," he added.
Rockwell Automation has been promoting Smart Manufacturing over the past two years. It defines Smart Manufacturing as a highly connected and knowledge-enabled industrial enterprise, where all business and operating actions are optimized to achieve substantially enhanced productivity, sustainability and economic performance.
With regard to whether Smart Manufacturing will be adopted at the same pace in the world's three biggest economies (the U.S., Europe and China), Keith said, "No matter in what regions of the world, we are still in the early phases of smart manufacturing. I believe that smart manufacturing will progress at different rates in different industries, not in different regions. Countries that face global competition or want to supply their products globally will move faster to adopt and develop Smart Manufacturing."
"China is now undergoing an economic transformation and evolving from the 'made-in-China' period. If China can be one of the first to achieve "manufacturing knowledge", it will earn a long-term competitive advantage well into the coming decades," said Tom O'Reilly, Managing Director of Rockwell Automation Greater China.

Keith D. Nosbusch, Chairman And CEO, Rockwell Automation (Photo: Business Wire)






Business Wire




Dec 3, 2015 2:53 PM EST













 




























































  Keith D. Nosbusch, chairman and CEO of Rockwell Automation, will address how scalable industrial Internet of Things (IoT) technologies enhance The Connected Enterprise, a transformational vision for higher productivity, sustainability and global competitiveness. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20151203006206/en/   Keith D. Nosbusch, Chairman and CEO, Rockwell Automation (Photo: Business Wire)   Nosbusch will deliver a keynote presentation at the third annual Internet of Things World Forum 2015 http://www.iotwf.com/ hosted by Cisco from Dec. 6-8 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The forum attracts key stakeholders and innovators in business, government, and academia who are driving adoption of the Internet of Things worldwide.  "The Connected Enterprise will drive more change in industrial automation in the next 10 years than we've seen in the past 50," said Keith D. Nosbusch, chairman and CEO, Rockwell Automation. "This transformation creates tremendous opportunities for those who take advantage of it, and great risks for those unprepared for a strategic response."  Nosbusch will explain how it is now possible to transform high volumes of real-time data from industrial operations into actionable insights that accelerate optimization of plants and supply networks. "A scalable implementation of industrial IoT technologies enhances this transformation using smart, connected assets and real-time analytics that function as an important part of an integrated control and information system," said Nosbusch.  Nosbusch's keynote will highlight applications of industrial IoT technologies in a wide spectrum of industries such as oil and gas and consumer packaged goods. A high performance architecture, built upon secure IP-based networks and complemented with contemporary technologies such as mobility, data analytics and cloud computing, is essential for industrial IoT, and also makes it possible to achieve seamless convergence between OT systems and enterprise IT systems.
