Fund Overview
The Highland iBoxx Senior Loan ETF seeks to provide investment results that, before fees and expenses, correspond generally to the price and yield performance of the Markit iBoxx Liquid Leveraged Loan Index (the “Underlying Index”).

Rules based index
Consists of approximately 100 of the largest, most liquid leveraged loans
Measured by the number of active market participants trading the security and the dollar face amount of outstanding senior loans issued
Loans eligible for inclusion in the Underlying Index are measured by type, size, liquidity, spread, credit rating and minimum time to maturity.





What’s in a Name?
Senior: Senior bank loans are debt obligations of a company and are generally paid before other creditors and equity
Secured: Secured by a first lien claim on assets of the company
Floating Rate Loans: Base rate plus a spread with a potential income stream that floats with interest rates




Opportunities in Senior Bank Loans
High Yield: Potential for high yield given coupon must compensate investors for credit risk
Lower Duration: Lower duration given floating rate nature of the assets
Diversification: Bank loans have exhibited historically low correlation to other risk assets
Transparency & Liquidity: Large-capitalized liquid loans in NASDAQ exchanged-traded ETF Structure




Bank Loans have had two negative years in the last 20 years

The performance data quoted here represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. For performance data current to the most recent quarter- and month-end, please click the Performance tab.





The Highland/iBoxx Senior Loan ETF is distributed by SEI Investments Distribution Co. (SIDCO), which is not affiliated with Highland Capital Management or any of its affiliates. Check the background of SIDCO on FINRA’s BrokerCheck. 
Carefully consider the investment objectives, risk factors, charges, and expenses of the Fund before investing. This and additional information about the Fund can be found in the full or summary prospectus, which may be obtained by calling 1-855-799-4757 or by visiting the Literature tab above. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.
1. Fee waivers are contractual and in effect through at least October 31, 2017. In the absence of current fee waivers, total return would be reduced.
2. Ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA (highest) to D (lowest). The rating categories reflected are issued by Standards and Poor’s, a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO’). The ratings used were those for the specific position or debt issuer held in the Fund as of the date of the latest quarterly fact sheet. Quality ratings reflect the credit quality of the underlying positions in the fund portfolio and not the fund itself. A fund’s portfolio and composition is subject to change.
Leveraged Loans are loans to companies that typically already have a high amount of debt and are often characterized by lower credit ratings or higher interest rates.
Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal.
The price used to calculate market returns (“Market Price”) of the Fund generally is determined using the midpoint between the bid and the ask on the primary securities exchange on which shares of the Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the Fund's NAV is calculated. The Fund's Market Price may be at, above or below its NAV.
Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns.
Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. There is no guarantee the Fund will meet its investment objectives. The risks associated with Senior Loans are similar to the risks of below investment grade securities, although Senior Loans are typically senior and secured in contrast to other below investment grade securities, which are often subordinated and unsecured. Narrowly focused funds typically exhibit higher volatility. The Fund is subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value as interest rates rise. The Fund is non-diversified, and an investment in the Fund could fluctuate in value more than an investment in a diversified fund. The Fund may invest in derivatives which are often more volatile than other investments and may magnify the Fund's gains or losses.
All registered investment companies, including the Highland Funds, are obliged to distribute portfolio gains to shareholders at year's end regardless of performance. Trading the Highland iBoxx Senior Loan ETF will also generate tax consequences and transaction expenses. The information provided is not intended to be tax advice. Tax consequences of dividend distributions may vary by individual taxpayer. There is no guarantee that dividends will be paid. To receive the distribution, you must be a registered shareholder of the ETF on the record date, and must have placed the ETF trade prior to the ex-date. Distributions are paid to shareholders on the payable date. Past distributions are not indicative of future trends. Please consult your tax professional or financial advisor for more information regarding your tax situation.

Explanation of Premium/Discount: 
Premium is when an ETF’s market price (selling or purchase price) is greater than its calculated NAV.  So when the ETF’s price is above the NAV, the ETF is said to trade at a “premium” – the ETF is trading higher than what the underlying holdings are worth.
Discount is when an ETF’s market price (selling or purchase price) is less than its calculated NAV.  So when the ETF’s price is lower than the NAV, the ETF is said to be at a “discount” – the ETF is valued less than the fund’s overall holdings.
Shareholders may pay more than net asset value when they buy Fund shares and receive less than net asset value when they sell those shares, because shares are bought and sold at current market prices.
The Premium/Discount chart demonstrates the difference between the daily market price of shares of the Fund and the Fund's net asset value (NAV). The daily market price is calculated using the Midpoint price which is the midpoint between the Ask price and the Bid price at the time the NAV is calculated (generally 4 p.m. eastern time). The vertical axis of the chart shows the premium or discount of the Midpoint price as a percentage of the NAV. The horizontal axis shows the number of trading days covered by the chart, and each bar in the chart demonstrates how many days the Fund traded within the given premium/discount range. The data presented in the chart and table above represent past performance and cannot be used to predict future results.

Investment Objective
The investment seeks long-term growth of capital and future income rather than current income.
 The fund seeks to achieve its investment objectives by investing at least 80% of its net assets under normal circumstances in equity securities, such as common and preferred stocks. It invests primarily in a limited number of large- and medium-sized companies (meaning companies with a market capitalization of $2 billion or more) that the portfolio manager believes have above-average growth histories and/or growth potential.

              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

 Daily Alts | Highland Capital Moves into Non-Traded Product Space



in In the News 


Highland Capital Management is a Dallas-based investment management firm with $19 billion in assets under management and a significant presence in the liquid alts space…[I]n late July, the firm demonstrated its commitment to integrity and transparency when it announced its compliance with the voluntary Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS). But now the liquid alts pioneer is making a move into another alternative product space – illiquid, non-traded products.
Launch of Business Development Company
Last week, Highland Capital Management announced the launch of a Business Development Company (BDC) called NextPoint Capital, Inc. The BDC structure, which was created by 1980 amendments to the Investment Act of 1940, allows publicly registered U.S. companies to act somewhat like venture capital or private equity funds by investing in small and mid-size businesses. Highland’s BDC, NextPoint Capital, will be the first BDC to have a primary focus of investing in mid-sized healthcare businesses. The firm has a target goal of raising $1.5 billion in investment capital.
Brian Mitts, CEO of NextPoint Advisors and head of business development for Highland’s alternative products, says alternatives offer a “compelling, income producing and non-correlated investment option for investors,” and that adding non-traded products to his company’s existing mix of liquid alternative funds will “offer independent advisors one of the industry’s strongest and most robust product lineups.”
Range of Alternative Funds
In addition to the award-winning Highland Floating Rate Opportunities Fund (HFRAX), Highland Capital Management’s existing suite of liquid alternative funds includes:

The Highland Energy MLP Fund (HEFAX)
The Highland Global Allocation Fund (HCOAX)
The Highland Long/Short Equity Fund (HEOAX)
The Highland Long/Short Healthcare Fund (HHCAX)
The Highland Opportunistic Credit Fund (HNRAX)

Of the funds, the Highland Energy MLP Fund has had the best absolute performance through August 25, with year-to-date returns of 18.64%, but these gains actually fall short of the category average by 0.21 percentage points. Highland’s best-performing alternatives fund, in relative terms, has been the Highland Global Allocation Fund, which sits atop its Morningstar category with year-to-date returns of 11.72%.
The Highland Floating Rate Opportunities Fund…has generated one-year returns of 8.26% through August 25, which continue to place it at the top of its Morningstar category; but its year-to-date returns have slipped to 1.61%, which place the fund in the bottom 32% of bank loan funds.
Highland Capital Management also operates a liquid alts exchange-traded fund: The Highland/iBoxx Senior Loan ETF (SNLN), which tracks the Markit iBoxx USD Liquid Leveraged Loan Index, itself a subset of the Markit iBoxx USD Leveraged Loan Index. The fund invests at least 80% of its assets in component securities of the underlying index, and has posted year-to-date returns of 2.38% through August 25.
Highland Staffing Up
As part of Highland’s expansion into non-traded products, the firm hired Jennifer Ricci as Director of National Accounts back in February, and has also added a total of thirteen wholesalers for its wire-house and independent distribution channels. These new hires include Daniel Church from Franklin Square Partners, Anthony Hazen from BlueRock Real Estate, Kevin Helwig from Ascendant Capital/KBR Capital Markets, Michael Klisares from ICON Investments, and Matthew Selman from Dividend Capital Securities.
While increased liquidity and transparency are among the primary benefits driving interest in liquid alternatives, the shift of investor assets into liquid alts may leave opportunities “further down the liquidity spectrum” for entities like BDCs. NextPoint Capital simply represents Highland’s initial BDC product, but there are more in store to be launched later this year.

Beyond Tesla: 7 stocks driving the autonomous car revolution
              
              Look at these component manufacturers rather than the car companies, says Jeff Reeves.

These 7 highly taxed companies need Congress to finally act on tax reform
              
              It wasn’t Trump’s “movement” that lifted stocks late last year, says Jeff Reeves. It was the promise of lower corporate tax rates.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks

              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar turns lower for the week following GDP report

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
