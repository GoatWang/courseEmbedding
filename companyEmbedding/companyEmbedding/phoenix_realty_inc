From Our Clients...

"Jim has been an absolute pleasure to work with. We wanted to rent out our house in Erie, but the time of year was pretty bad - right around Thanksgiving time. After talking to a couple other property management companies, it was clear that Jim and his team were head and shoulders above the other companies. Within a few days, we were surprised to hear we were under lease already! "
            – Ivan, Property Owner
"Michelle Irons was great to work with during the three years I leased out my townhouse in Longmont. She is very responsive, professional, and easy to work with. I highly recommend her and her team to anyone who needs a property manager." 
            – Melinda, Property Owner
"Phoenix Property Management seems to have struck an excellent balance in the management industry. As a tenant, Michelle and her staff are immediately responsive to emails and phone calls, responds to maintenance requests, and perhaps best of all the rent payment system is electronic and pain free." 
            – Carlotta, Resident 
"As a landlord for a property in a different state I would LOVE to have a Phoenix of my own because good, reputable property management companies are hard to come by.  Michelle successfully manages for the property owner while providing quality housing for the tenants. Whether you are a potential tenant or a property owner looking for a manager Phoenix Property Management is the right choice."
            – Resident
"Not only did we get it listed sooner than expected, the rent was much closer to what we were hoping to get (and about 10% more than other companies said they wanted to list our place for).  They’ve been extremely responsive over email, all hours of the day and days of the week. I couldn't recommend Phoenix Realty enough!"
            – Ivan L., Property Owner
"I have worked with Michelle and her group over a Phoenix Realty & Property Management since 2012. In a few words, proactive, professional, solid, and very knowledgeable about the real estate market in their territory. I have had a solid, reliable tenant with absolutely no problems since the home was first rented. I am very grateful and would recommend them in a heartbeat."
            – Kristin, Property Owner
"I have rented from Phoenix Realty for years and I have had a great experience! Maintenance issues were always handled in a timely and professional manner. Overall, I can say Phoenix is a great property management company and I have had a very positive experience!"
            – Noel, Resident
"Phoenix Realty is a really good company to work with. We rented with them for 2 years. When there were issues they were right there to fix them. Communication was excellent with them. I would recommend Phoenix Realty in the future for anybody."
            – Tammy, Resident

Owner FAQs
Answers to your common questions

How long has your property management company been in business?
Our company has been proudly serving the Front Range since 1986. In choosing a property management company, you want to make sure you go with a company that specializes in property management and has a long, proven track record. Choosing a company with strong ties to the community and local expertise will always be most beneficial for your investment.

Are you licensed?
Every member of the Phoenix Realty and Property Management, Inc. team is a licensed real estate broker and REALTOR®. The State of Colorado requires that all Property Managers maintain a valid real estate broker’s license in good standing with the Department of Regulatory Agencies (DORA) to practice property management.

What type of properties do you manage?
Phoenix Realty and Property Management, Inc. manages rental properties that include single-family homes, townhomes, condos, duplexes, triplexes, and fourplexes. If you are unsure if we manage your type of property, give us a call!

What associations do you belong to?
Phoenix Realty and Property Management, Inc. belongs to the following organizations:
 
- National Association of Residential Property Managers (NARPM)
- Denver Chapter of the National Association of Residential Property Managers
- National Association of REALTORS® (NAR)
- Colorado Association of REALTORS® (CAR)
- Boulder Area REALTOR® Association (BARA)
- Lafayette Chamber of Commerce
- Broomfield Chamber of Commerce
- Boulder Chamber of Commerce
- Better Business Bureau

How are applicants screened?
Applicants are screened through a variety of different modalities. First and foremost, a hard pull on an applicant’s credit is initiated by a qualified Phoenix Realty and Property Management, Inc. employee. The applicant’s credit score and credit history is analyzed against a strict criteria. The applicants are then run through a national criminal database, as well as a national evictions database. Additionally, applicants then have their income verified, as well as a positive rental history or proof of homeownership. For more specific criteria relating to how applicants are screened, please contact our office today!

How long of a lease do you sign?
Most lease terms normally last twelve months. Longer or shorter leases may be offered in an attempt to allow the lease term to expire in the spring and summer months, when rental activity is at its highest. This is typical of a lease that commences in a slower time of year.

Can you put the money directly into my account?
Phoenix Realty and Property Management, Inc. deposits all available rental funds into Owner accounts via direct deposit by the 15th of every month.

How do I know you won’t spend my money on large repairs without my approval?
This is the greatest fear and a legitimate concern for most owners. Per our Management Agreement, we contractually promise not to authorize repairs in excess of $500 without your approval. Ordinary maintenance and repairs of less than $300 are paid out of your account, and you will see this in your monthly statement.

If we think a repair might exceed $300, we often do our best to contact you to discuss the nature of the repairs; however, if we are unable to reach you, we may initiate repair work even if it is higher than $300, but less than $500. Additionally, as stated in the management agreement, we may authorize a repair for over $500, only if one of the following cases is present:

 - The health or safety of a tenant is an issue;
 - The property will incur damage if immediate action is not taken;
 - In instances where there is only one option to consider;
 - We would only be acting in your (the owners) best interest.

Who holds the tenant security deposit?
All security deposits are held in our deposit trust account until the end of the tenancy. At the end of the tenancy, Phoenix Realty and Property Management, Inc. will inspect the property and determine the applicability of any security deposit funds, itemizing any withdraws and returning to the tenant within the bounds of Colorado law.

Am I required to make my property available to Section 8?
Per Colorado Law, you are NOT required to make your property available to Section 8. As a company policy, Phoenix Realty and Property Management, Inc. does not accept Section 8 tenants.

Can I use a Home Warranty Company for repairs, is that ok?
We prefer that the owners do not use a Home Warranty Company to make repairs at their rental property. We have had lots of problems with home warranties.

You don’t have control over who does the work and neither do we. The home warranty provider contracts with local service companies to perform the actual inspections and repairs. You don’t get to choose, and scheduling repairs can sometimes be very difficult. Sometimes the service technician may also try to sell you unneeded services, as well as require payment at time of service, which is not a responsibility that should be placed on your tenant.

So what is a homeowner to do?
Many consumer advocates would say it’s better to “self-insure” — setting aside a reasonable sum each year to cover routine maintenance and finding reliable local contractors to do the work. However, if your appliances are relatively new and carry a manufacturer’s warranty, we will do our best to honor the warranty, but not at the expense of providing reasonable and reliable service to the tenant. Remember, happy tenants mean less tenant turnover and lower costs!

How soon can you start managing my property?
We can start the process immediately. Contact us so we can find out more about you and your property and see if we would be a good match for your wants and expectations.

Do you sell real estate too?
We most certainly do! As previously mentioned, all of our employees are licensed real estate brokers and REALTORS®. If you are interested in buying or selling a property, please let us know!

Welcome to Phoenix Realty, Inc.
 
Phoenix Realty is a full service real estate company, which performs Seller & Buyer Representation Services and Property Management. Phoenix Realty was started by  a Christian couple in Cary back in the 1980's, when   Cary was just a railroad stop with a few aged homes  and I-40 was two lane road. In 2004, Phoenix   Realty was purchased by Triangle Group Realty of Durham & Chapel Hill, run by Vincent Thai. The company continues to serve our community, representing home sellers and buyers in addition to providing local property management services to investors. Today, we serve most of Wake County (Raleigh, Wake Forest, Cary, Apex, Morrisville, Holly Springs, Fuquay Varina), Orange County (Chapel Hill, Carborro, Hillsborough), and Durham County (mainly S.W Durham and North Durham).

My agents kept saying "Drop the price, drop the price!"Using HomeLight, I quickly found an agent that was a real go-getter. Steve went above and beyond the call of duty. He sold our house higher than the listing price in only eight days.Finding a great agent made all the difference!"Sharon W.Buzzards Bay, MA"In the process of selling my house, finding the right real estate agent was the most important detail. There are many unprofessional real estate agents out there; using HomeLight to find one who was both professional and had a demonstrated history of success was invaluable. I interviewed several agents, but in the end I trusted the actual sales numbers I found on HomeLight. My HomeLight agent has a well-run team and business processes that utilize technology to its fullest: both for marketing my home and keeping me constantly informed. My home was off the market in a week."Elizabeth S.Juptier, FL"Selling our home was a big decision. It was very important to find the right agent who could get me the best price and sell it quickly. I went on the internet and found HomeLight. Filling out the online form just took a few minutes, and it didn't cost anything. I was really glad that HomeLight referred me to Dallas. He just came across as very professional. He sold my house in two and a half weeks, and I got more than I was wanting to get. It was fantastic! I couldn't have been happier."Jim W.Escondido, CA"My husband found HomeLight online. We looked at the different agents, filled out a short form, and the next thing we knew we got a call. I mean, we didn't have to do anything. They did it all. It was really simple and easy.HomeLight connected us to Ruby and we are really happy we used her. Ruby was responsive and she really did her job in terms of marketing the house. We had our first offer in five days, and it closed a month later. If we didn't have a great agent like Ruby, we would probably still have our home on the market.We were thrilled that we found Ruby on HomeLight, and that's the truth."Mara K.Wake Forest, NCWhat You Should Expect Out Of A Great Listing Agent.The top listing agents don’t just post your home for sale online for prospective home buyers to submit bids, they maximize your chances of getting the best price by performing dozens of activities that lead to selling your home. Use this checklist to ensure that your selling agent is doing their job:Analysis of pricing trends and local price per square footAutomatic posting on all major online home search sitesAdvertising in local publicationsPrepping and staging expertiseProfessional photographyCreation of marketing documents (flyers, etc.)Access and monitoring of your private lock-boxDirect mail marketing programDevelopment of virtual tour (bonus)Exclusive previews for other real estate brokersResearch on buyer motivations and capacity24-hour response turnaround time on client requestsAt least 2 open housesIn general, you should expect your real estate agent to be a world class marketer.

Find the Perfect Buyer's Agent TodayPlease enter a valid locationFind an AgentThe Biggest Financial Transaction of Your Life.You deserve your dream home. At a price that won’t give you a nightmare.For many of us, buying a home is the single biggest financial decision you will make in your life. You need a strategic advisor to walk you through the legal process, identify opportunities, and employ sophisticated negotiation tactics. An experienced buyer's agent can make this decision seamless, while placing you in the home of your dreams. Our solution at HomeLight allows you to search millions of buyer agent profiles to find the most experienced agent who will fit your needs.The HomeLight DifferenceHomeLight matches you with the top buyer's agents in your local neighborhood. We do this by analyzing over 15 million home transactions since 2009 to produce updated agent rankings based on objective data. Agents never pay us to be listed on our site, so we can be 100% unbiased.

Search for the best buyer's agent in your local neighborhood.Top Questions to Ask a Buyer’s AgentWe suggest that you interview at least 2 agents before settling on your final decision. Below are a recommended list of questions to ask any agent before engaging with them:1. What homes have you sold in the neighborhood in the last 3 months?It’s not just important to have an agent with experience in the area you want to buy, but since market conditions change frequently, you should verify that they have recent local experience as well. A knowledgeable agent will have deep comprehension of topics like available schools, health care, desirable streets, and more. 2. Is this your full-time job? Some individuals treat real estate as a side job. Often times they may not be available when you need them or have limited experience. When possible, it is best to select a full-time real estate agent to assist you with your home purchase search. 3. What are your complete real estate credentials?At a minimum, your real estate agent should have active ABR (Accredited Buyer Representatives) and CBR (Certified Buyer Representatives) licenses. Additional certifications or degrees like an MBA, JD, CFA, or CPA are a plus, as they demonstrate competence in dealing with complex transactions. 4. Will they guarantee letting you out of a contract if the relationship isn’t working?In few cases, the buyer and the real estate agent cannot coexist based on personality or philosophical differences. In these rare events, you should feel comfortable that your real estate agent will let you out of your contract immediately and allow you to pursue a relationship with another buyer's agent in the area. 5. What are your fees and how do you get paid?In most cases, real estate agent fees are paid by the seller of the home. You, as the home buyer, will most likely not have to pay anything out of pocket. It is still wise to understand what the buyer's agent’s fees are and how they expect to be paid. This will prevent any potential confusion that may arise once your transaction has successfully been completed. 6. Are you an exclusive buyer's agent?There are generally three types of buyer's agents: non-exclusive, designated, and exclusive. Your best bet typically is to work with an exclusive buyer's agent, as they will be prevented from taking on seller’s listings, therefore reducing any chance for a conflict of interest. 7. Can you give me references I can contact of your last 3-5 home purchases?All good buyer's agents should be more than willing to provide contact information of the last 5 individuals who they assisted in purchasing a home. If an agent hesitates in providing this information, then approach the relationship with caution. Actual Customer Testimonials"Before finding HomeLight, we were lost and had no clue how to find a trustworthy agent. Now we are at ease, and the buying process is simple."Edward G.Santa Monica, CA"My Realtor was great and knew exactly what he was doing. I won't recommend anyone else but him. Many, many thanks HomeLight!"Neha C.San Francisco, CAMore TestimonialsWhat You Should Expect Out Of A Great Buyer's Agent.The top buyer's agents don’t just bring you to homes you could have already found on top home search websites, they maximize your chances of finding the perfect home while staying within your desired budget. Use this checklist to ensure that your buying agent is doing their job:Brings recent knowledge and experience to help you navigate local market characteristicsActs as an evangelist and strategic advisor for you through the home buying processPrepares all required documentation and written offersProvides contacts with high quality home inspectors, title companies and other home services professionalsReviews various financing optionsActively negotiates pricing on behalf of buyerHelps ensure the loan closes successfullyReady to maximize your chance of getting the best prices from ideal buyer's agents?Search for the best buyer's agentFind an agent near you.Search for an AgentFind Top Real Estate Agents in All Major Cities Across the USAtlantaAustinBostonColumbiaDallasDenverFort LauderdaleHoustonLos AngelesMiamiNew YorkPortlandSan DiegoSan FranciscoSarasotaSeattleResourcesFor SellersFor BuyersHome Value EstimatorFor ProfessionalsSign In / Sign UpCity DirectoryAgent DirectoryAgent Help CenterCompanyHow it worksAboutTestimonialsCareersBlogPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceFollow UsFacebookTwitterGoogle+PinterestRSSHomelight has an A+ rating with the Better Business BureauThe HomeLight Methodology - How We Find the Best Real Estate Agents




The HomeLight MethodologyHow we find the best real estate agents1. Starting with dataWe believe that when considering one of the biggest financial transactions of your life, you should have 100% transparency in order to make the optimal choice -- something more scientific than a referral from a friend or a sign on a park bench.HomeLight is the leading resource for finding objective agent performance data online. Our team of data scientists from MIT, Harvard, and Stanford has spent years collecting, normalizing and summarizing historical data across millions of transactions. With this unique data set, we apply statistical data analysis and machine learning methods to predict who will bring the most experience, expertise and negotiating power to your home transaction. The result: a list of the best agents personalized to your needs.HomeLight Data PlatformOver 18 million transactions,2 millions agents & 200,000 brokerages analyzed2. Gathering your inputWith your input on the following categories we're able to better understand your requirements and challenges. Each piece of data provided allows us to match you with agents precisely suited for your needs. We use these inputs in the following ways:LocationUsing spatial IP and geo-distance analysis, we can target real estate agents that have hyperlocal expertise within your city, neighborhood, and even those that know your street.Buy or SellThere can be vast difference between a good listing agent and a good buyer’s agent (and very few are experts at both). We can filter agents by their historical expertise, buying or selling.Property TypeWork required to stage a home in a city is completely different than that needed to sell an empty lot. Our transactional data allows us to identify agents’ expertise in your exact type of property.PriceAn agent familiar with your price range is a must. Luxury real estate agents can create exclusive showcase & selling opportunities. While agents that specialize in first-time home buyers can secure the home of your dreams on a budget.Agent TypeHiring an agent is both an important financial decision and an extremely personal one. For some, having an agent who can spend a lot of time fostering the relationship is crucial. Others just want a tough negotiator, who can sell their home fast and for the most money.3. HomeLight Matching EngineThe HomeLight matching engine analyzes over 18 million transactions and 2 million agents. There are two primary components to our machine learning algorithm:Relevance Analysis Ranking: Evaluates dozens of variables to find agents who have successfully advised clients similar to you.Real Performance Ranking: Utilizes Bayesian statistical models to predict which agent will get the best results for you.The final result is an objective list of the best agents across all of the major brokerages in your neighborhood. You can choose to meet with as many of these agents as needed.Top Agent4. Your Personalized Agent RecommendationsOnce you’ve received your matches, you may view an agent's expertise and experience in detail. We have compiled a list of agent performance data that cannot be found elsewhere online including:Agent ranking across different variables and versus other local agentsGeographic expertise and mapping of transaction dataRecent listings this agent has completedEducational background and agent biosQualitative customer reviews by individuals who have interacted with this agentAgent transaction volume by yearHomeLight's definition of success is when you complete your home transaction at the price you want with an agent you deeply trust.We have a team of dedicated real estate concierges with 50+ years of experience to ensure you truly find the best agent.
