Joseph P. Sullivan
Joe is a defense attorney with extensive experience litigating product liability, toxic tort, asbestos, complex litigation, mass tort, transportation, insurance and general liability claims. His recent representative matters include defending a catastrophic injury case involving a double amputation from a recycling baler, a wrongful death case resulting from maintenance on a street cleaning truck and a breach of warranty action involving fires on two tractor trailers.
Joe has been involved in the defense of a wide variety of toxic tort cases for 20 years, including single plaintiff and multi-plaintiff claims arising from alleged exposure to asbestos, mold, benzene, PCBs, and other hazardous substances. He has taken asbestos cases to trial in Illinois, Pennsylvania, Texas and Michigan and has over 15 verdicts successfully defending his clients. Joe has also represented energy companies, premises owners, real estate professionals, construction companies and manufacturers of friction material, wire and cable, packing and gaskets, heat treatment equipment and component part manufacturers.
Joe’s case work includes obtaining a defense verdict in a consolidated asbestos cases involving five plaintiffs in one of the first asbestos cases tried in Delaware County, Pennsylvania. In another consolidated two-plaintiff case in Philadelphia, he won a directed defense verdict against one plaintiff and, after two weeks of trial, a defense verdict against the remaining plaintiff. In an Illinois mesothelioma case, Joe successfully argued a motion to bar the plaintiff’s medical expert testimony in regards to his client, which resulted in the case against the client being dismissed due to lack of causation evidence. In addition, he successfully represented his clients in an appeal to the Eighth Circuit in a product liability matter regarding a medical device; the court upheld the doctrine that an entity supplying a non-defective raw material or a non-defective component part is not strictly liable for defects in the final product over which it had no control.

Joseph P. Sullivan
Joe is a defense attorney with extensive experience litigating product liability, toxic tort, asbestos, complex litigation, mass tort, transportation, insurance and general liability claims. His recent representative matters include defending a catastrophic injury case involving a double amputation from a recycling baler, a wrongful death case resulting from maintenance on a street cleaning truck and a breach of warranty action involving fires on two tractor trailers.
Joe has been involved in the defense of a wide variety of toxic tort cases for 20 years, including single plaintiff and multi-plaintiff claims arising from alleged exposure to asbestos, mold, benzene, PCBs, and other hazardous substances. He has taken asbestos cases to trial in Illinois, Pennsylvania, Texas and Michigan and has over 15 verdicts successfully defending his clients. Joe has also represented energy companies, premises owners, real estate professionals, construction companies and manufacturers of friction material, wire and cable, packing and gaskets, heat treatment equipment and component part manufacturers.
Joe’s case work includes obtaining a defense verdict in a consolidated asbestos cases involving five plaintiffs in one of the first asbestos cases tried in Delaware County, Pennsylvania. In another consolidated two-plaintiff case in Philadelphia, he won a directed defense verdict against one plaintiff and, after two weeks of trial, a defense verdict against the remaining plaintiff. In an Illinois mesothelioma case, Joe successfully argued a motion to bar the plaintiff’s medical expert testimony in regards to his client, which resulted in the case against the client being dismissed due to lack of causation evidence. In addition, he successfully represented his clients in an appeal to the Eighth Circuit in a product liability matter regarding a medical device; the court upheld the doctrine that an entity supplying a non-defective raw material or a non-defective component part is not strictly liable for defects in the final product over which it had no control.

Records and turntables Still got a thing for vinyl? It s OK. We get that. Satisfy that old-school itch and shop for records in a variety of categories or choose a bundled collection from select popular artists, both old and new. Then spin those RPMs just like you used to because some things should never go out of style. If you should need a record player to go with that vinyl, you can combine old and new technologies with a turntable that includes: an AM/FM radioa cassette playera CD player USB and Bluetooth technology An added USB connection let s you convert vinyl to digital media or Bluetooth technology will let you stream music from other, more modern devices   all with precisely the style you're going for. Throw it back with a vintage record player look or grab a unit that mimics the turntables in a trendy club. Mobile music Of course, you can also take the more modern-day approach and listen to your music on any mobile device, including iPads and tablets. Save the storage space around your house or in your car and go digital. A 16-gigabyte device can hold roughly 3,500 songs. That s a lot of music to listen to   conveniently. And if you want to bump it up to 64 gigs, you re looking at 15,000 songs. Now that s an impressive music collection. Give the gift of music Music makes a fantastic gift any time of the year, so consider making a wish list of albums you'd love and encouraging your family and friends to do the same. Or, simply give them an electronic gift card. iTunes e-gifts are incredibly thoughtful and handy and come in a variety of denominations, from $10 to $100. These unique codes are provided via email and are perfect for anyone who likes apps, games, music, movies, television shows, books and more. They can be used in the App Store, or with iTunes, iBooks   even toward an Apple Music membership, if desired. Google Play gift codes also provide access to the latest entertainment   whether it s music, movies, TV, books, magazines, apps or games. Let that special someone enjoy their favorite songs, flicks and more on any sized screen across Android, iOS and the web. There s also a Microsoft Groove Music pass, which provides instant access to millions of songs. Your music, your way With so many options, it has never been easier to listen to your favorite music.

Get your purchases fast with our free two-day shipping programThere's so much convenience when it comes to online shopping. It's easy to find exactly what you're looking for all in one place when you shop with Walmart online. Plus, you can see all the items that you want to purchase and know immediately whether they're in stock or not. However, two issues that arise   that you don't deal with when you're shopping in store   is that you sometimes have to wait several days to get your purchases or pay a higher additional fee to get your purchases shipped faster. However, thanks to Walmart, you don t have to deal with either problem. We offer free two-day shipping on millions of the items that we sell, and it's all available to you without joining a membership club or paying extra fees for the privilege. Combine this with our low prices, every day, on everything, and you can get the things you want quickly at prices that fit your budget.How Walmart's free two-day shipping worksWhen you're looking at our website to find the types of items that you're interested in purchasing, the first step is to look for the logo that says 2-Day Shipping on the product page. Many of these items will also state Free store pickup or Free store pickup today below the free shipping information. If you see these words on the product page for your item, you have the additional option to pick the item up for free at your chosen Walmart location or receive it at your designated location for free as long as you spend $35 or more. If your purchase is less than $35, you can upgrade to free shipping for $5.99.On the left-hand side of all the pages on our website, you'll see a section that section labeled Shipping & Pickup. Beneath that, you'll find the option for 2-Day Shipping. Click the radio button next to 2-Day Shipping and the page will reload, displaying only items that are available for free two-day shipping. As long as you place your order by 2 p.m., you can expect delivery in two business days. This means that, if you order your item after 2 p.m. on a Friday, you won't receive it until the following Wednesday. However, if you order it on Tuesday before 2 p.m., you can expect to get it by the following Friday. Keep in mind that weekends and holidays don't count as business days for shipping. Also, be sure to note that the 2 p.m. cutoff time is relative to the time zone where we're shipping your item from, not the time zone from where you're ordering it.Other shipping optionsRemember that any item that's marked with 2-Day Shipping on its page is also eligible for free shipping on qualifying purchase amounts. Most of these items are also eligible for in-store pickup   many of them that same day   even if you order after 2 p.m. If you select an item that's not eligible for our free two-day shipping program, there are many others that are eligible for free three- to five-day shipping. Again, this free shipping is only for purchases of $35 or more. Items that are part of this shipping promotion include Marketplace and freight items, but shipping costs are based on location on a case-by case basis for these products.If you're ordering an item that we're not shipping to you   but one of our trusted partners is   it's possible that they might offer free shipping too. However, it might not be for a specific time frame. To verify, check the shipping information found on the product page, located below the item's price.What you should know about the free two-day shipping programHere's some additional information about Walmart's free two-day shipping program:Residents of Hawaii and Alaska aren't eligible for the free 2-Day Shipping program; it's only available in the contiguous United StatesRecipients who have their packages sent to these locations   AA, AE, AK, AP, AS, FM, GU, HI, MP, PK, PW and VI or any APO or FPO in the continental U.S.   will receive free three- to five-day shipping for their items on purchases of more than $35.
