Efficient Advisors - Smart Investing Simplified




























Our History








Efficient Advisors was founded in 2009 to support advisors seeking to offer their clients the prudence of passive, structured investing based on academic discipline. Rather than claiming to possess market-beating expertise, we focus on deploying cost-efficient, globally-diversified asset allocation which we believe forms the basis for long-term investment success.
We aim to offer advisors a collaborative culture based on a core philosophy of integrity, honesty and open communication.


We now deliver our prudent investment solutions by partnering with over 100 financial advisors nationwide. Our advisors share our investment philosophy and commitment to high-touch client service allowing us to support investors across the country and to manage over $1 billion in assets.	                      
Our mission is straightforward: utilize the power of academic research as our guiding principle in engineering low-cost, globally diversified portfolios that are designed to capture market rates of return. Then, work closely with our advisors by providing ongoing education and support as they implement these strategies with their clients. 



                Efficient Advisors is a registered investment adviser. Information presented is for informational purposes only. It should not be considered specific investment advice, does not take into consideration your specific situation, and does not intend to make an offer or solicitation for the sale or purchase of any securities or investment strategies. Investments involve risk and unless otherwise stated, are not guaranteed.

Smart 401k. Investing made simple.








Our Retirement Plan Program helps 401k participants and plan sponsors avoid the common temptation to pick "winning" stocks or rely on a fund manager's past performance to provide future returns. 


		                                        Our low-cost passively indexed portfolios coupled with ongoing participant education helps employees navigate crucial investment decisions.
Efficient Advisors acts as an Independent Investment Manager as defined by ERISA section 3(38) and specifically accepts its official fiduciary status and discretion- in writing. Under this delegation, our firm invests and manages the plan assets as the prudent investment expert on behalf of the plan sponsor.	                        
Advisors utilizing our Smart 401k portfolios also have access to an array of tools and resources.
