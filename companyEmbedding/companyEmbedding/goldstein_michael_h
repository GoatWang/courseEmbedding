Map ViewTips & AdviceDo wound care centers require a referral from a doctor?This depends on the facility. Patients should call to find out if they'll need a referral from their physician prior to making an appointment.What types of treatments do wound care centers offer?Aside from hyperbaric oxygen treatment, most wound care centers offer:

Debridement: The removal of dead skin and tissue surrounding the wound. This can be done surgically, using a whirlpool bath, syringes, enzymes that dissolve the tissue, or wet dressings that dry on the wound and absorb the dead tissue.
Dressing: Wrapping the wound in a protective film, gauze, gel, or foam.
Compression stockings: Tight-fitted fabric sheaths that encourage blood flow.
Artificial skin: A covering that is applied to the wound for several days as it heals.
Ultrasound: The use of sound waves to promote healing.

He helped my whole family get together. He was a true blessing for us through the whole extensive immigration process. He is extremely knowledgeable, unbelievably patient and tactful with people and he has an amazing personality. Mr. Weinman deserves not all the 6 rating stars but 7 and I will be very specific with you, as I have been in the position of a person who reads tons of reviews looking for a good lawyer. Lets start with the fact that before hiring Mr. Weinman I personally met with about 15 lawyers, some of them even recommended by friends. The problem was that I wasnt happy with any of them. I worked for 18 years as a Human resource specialist and I have the training to recognize the people that can get the job done. Frankly spoken, some of the lawyers I met at that time were very convincing but I was also very well-prepared for my appointments with them and at the end they didnt seem to me either very competent or honest enough or something else was missing. Then, I was browsing online, reading different reviews and I found Mr. Weinman. There were several nice reviews and I decided to try with an initial appointment. Yet when you open the door you see that his office is organized in a manner that is only possible for someone confident, knowledgeable and honest. The next pleasant surprise was that he doesnt make you wait and he doesnt need to, as he gains immediately the clients respect with his positive and honest approach and his extensive knowledge. We discussed L1 visa, H1 visa, E1 and E2 and I decided to hire him right on the spot. 18 months later, I am so happy with my decision because he helped my mother, then my father and then my best friend. 3 out of 3 absolutely successful cases. Two of them I know were extremely difficult. Thank you, Mr. Weinman, you are a true blessing for me and my family! And for those of you who took the time to read my review, I wish you just a little good luck because I know now that you will be in the hands of a great lawyer.Raphael Kellman MD - Thyroid SpecialistAaron K. ratedI have seen so many doctors - for so many illnesses - for so many years that I was resigning myself to a lifetime of drugs, disease and decline. I felt like I would never be truly well again; that the best I would ever be able to do is control symptoms and cope the best I could. The doctors I had seen (and I’d seen my share of them) could never really offer me answers. All they could do is order a test or prescribe something. And whatever they prescribed just masked the symptoms – it never got to what was the real problem. I knew I was on the wrong path but didn’t know how to explain it and didn’t know how to find another path. Until I found Dr Kellman.Dr Kellman is an entirely different kind of physician. It’s not just that he is a good listener and truly cares – though he is, and he does. It’s that he sees the underlying patterns to disease in ways other doctors seem to miss. His insights run deeper and his medical/scientific knowledge is broader than any doctor I have ever encountered. Simply put, Dr Kellman is in a class of his own. Not only is he more capable and knowledgeable than anyone I’d ever come across, he is also philosophically unique in that he approaches the patient with a goal of wellness, not just of treating disease. Combine this mind-set with cutting edge medicine and you have someone that transforms lives.   It’s been 2 months, and the results have been dramatic. Dr Kellman has gotten to the bottom of my health issues where so many other physicians failed. I am stronger, healthier and more alive than I have been in many years. It’s hard to put into words just how unique Dr Kellman is, or how much he has changed my life. The term “Miracle-worker” seems cliché, but it’s no exaggeration. He also has a ton of really good information on his website. If you don’t want to treat the disease, but instead want to be truly well, you really should see this amazing man. have always been an optimist. I believe life can be better. Now, thanks to Dr Kellman, mine is.Law Office of Ganesh N. Viswanathan, EsqMaria R. ratedI am a woman from the Caribbean Island and even though I have been living here for a number of years, I have had very little interaction with the court systems and litigation. A person who is from the same Islands, married me a decade and half ago, and we have a child. After many years into the marriage, I was not even aware he went ahead and filed for divorce. Over the years, he has accumulated a lot of savings in pension plans and retirement funds and he is quite smart in understanding how the legal systems work. I was not aware of any of his assets; one day, he filed for a divorce and then pretended as if nothing happened. He never served on me directly, but, was devising a way to fool me by not serving but going ahead and obtaining a default order, with no disclosure and no distribution to me. I was naive but something in my mind was telling me something was not alright, because, my neighbors told me somebody like a process server came to my home in my absence. I went and checked the Court and to my horror I found out my husband filed a divorce action against me more than a year ago; this is the time, when I somehow came into contact Mr. Viswanathan's Office and his Office did a brilliant job in bringing into light everything that happened right on my back and explained everything to me. My Law Office immediately moved the Court and in detail put forth in the papers before the Court everything that happened. Now, my case proceeding very well far beyond my expectations. I shall be entitled to a share in his assets; further, I am going to be entitled to a good spousal support and a child support. I did not even imagine that I would be entitled to a penny from my husband. All because of the great investigative legal work carried out by Mr. Viswanathan and his excellent team. I am now so happy because of their great work. My husband whom I meet every week, is sulking and the nature of his talk completely changed - for the betterPhilip J. Miller, MD, FACSIndi P. ratedBy the time I Found myself in Dr. Miller's office, I had wanted a nose job for over a decade.  I was miserable and depressed.  I hated my nose for so long, and it was the only thing I saw when I looked in the mirror.  For years, I fantasized about getting it done, but I was too scared I would look "fake."  I was scared I wouldn't recognize myself when I looked in the mirror, or that my friends and family would say, "what did you do to your face?" or worse--they wouldn't even recognize me at all.  Despite all these fears, I researched for weeks, looking for the "top cosmetic surgeons" and the "best facial surgeons," etc. until I narrowed it down to a handful of prestigious, renowned doctors--Dr. Philip Miller being one of them, of course.  I set up consultations with all of them, but Dr. Miller was the first and only one I went to.  Within just 30 minutes of the initial consult, I felt at ease.  Dr. Miller and his staff assured me that: 1) it didn't matter what anyone else thought.  What mattered was that I was happy with my nose, and 2) and more importantly--Dr. Miller is an artist who specializes in bringing harmony to the face and giving his patients a natural looking nose.  In that appointment, he also recommended I get a chin implant to create harmony in my facial proportions, and I am SO glad I did.  After the healing process, I felt FINALLY ALIVE, FINALLY MYSELF, AND FINALLY BEAUTIFUL. I felt like the face in the mirror was the one that had been there all along just dying to come out.  I did NOT feel fake or unnatural.  It felt like he found the nose I was meant to have and created a harmonious face I could feel proud of and grateful for.  Since my procedure, I am a NEW woman. My life and world have opened up with so many possibilities.  I have confidence and I feel feminine and powerful.  I couldn't possibly recommend Dr. Miller more.  He will change your life.The Law Office of Lance Fletcherkurt-22nyc ratedStop looking around the Internet and just read.  I just got a new job and my coworkers took me out for a celebration. We went out for drinks and to make matters worse, I started drinking shots.  Big mistake because I had several. (I'm done with shots from this point on)  I got into a fight - apparently - I don't remember the details but I woke up in a cell with cuts and bruises. I got charged with assault for hitting a guy and pushing him to the ground and resisting arrest and I thought my life was over because you can't get a good job with a record. I was scared, frustrated, confused, and I started looking around for a good lawyer to take my case. I came across Lance Fletcher's website and it looked pretty good.  You never know if that means it's gonna be a good lawyer so I called him for a consultation.  When I went to see him, I was a nervous reck and couldn't sleep.  I didn't want to lose my job or go to jail.  During the consultation, we discussed similar cases he's had like mine.  Turns out he's a former prosecutor and he really knew what he was talkin about. After I saw him, I had the best nights sleep since the arrest. He looked me in the eye and explained how he was going to keep my record clean and fight the case.  Most of the lawyers I spoke to just wanted money right away but Mr. fletcher was more interested in me and the case.  He took the time to meet and discuss the details. On the first court date, he filed a motion to dismiss. He got a copy of the medical records, saw that the other guy wasn't really hurt, and got the DA to drop the criminal charges.  I had to do a brief anger class but I avoided jail and no criminal record. I got to keep my job and I can't thank him enough. One thing - I wish I saw him sooner because my family tried to set me up with a lawyer but that guy didn't know what he was talking about and had me pretty scared.  Philip J. Miller, MD, FACShazel_harbin ratedDr. Miller did my Rhinoplasty and Fat Injections under the eyes a month ago.  It was a pretty nice experience, I mean I met with Dr. Miller a few times and he addressed my concerns, the staff  was pretty helpful.  I kept going back and forth as far as what I wanted to get done and they were very accommodating.  I cancelled twice and kept rescheduling and it was such a very nice experience.  I like the fact that he was and Ear Nose and Throat Specialist.  I researched where he’s initially studied and then after looking at some of the photos online it just looks very natural and I wanted a natural look and I didn't want people to be able to tell that I had it done. After reviewing his portfolio online and meeting him, I went to a couple of different doctors and this was a better experience, he seems to know what he was talking about.  He assured me that it would look more natural, it's going to just enhance the other features on my face and that's exactly what I was looking to hear.  It's only been a month, so already I can see some sort of improvement.  There's still some swelling and stuff, but it takes a year for this thing to heal.  I mean the profile of my face looks a lot better and my face just looks a lot, I don't know what the right word is, it just looks a lot softer, you know.  I don't have my nose overbearing on my face anymore.   I've been having surgeries for not elective, but required surgeries since I was a baby and a doctor with nice bedside manner and stuff is hard to find and he definitely has that.  Turk, Hugh M, JD1984perry ratedThere was little to no response (not even taking two minutes to send a follow-up email or telephone call) to my many inquiries for help with my case from one of the lawyers and his secretary of this firm. The wheels of justice may move at a very slow pace yet apparently something else was going on here; undoubtedly, they are preoccupied with larger concerns. However, if certain people within this office are unable, unwilling or uninterested in assisting the one who is inexperienced in legal matters (perhaps with unrealistic expectations, yet unfortunately forced into a legal circumstance though small in scope), then simply say so. But please do not ignore an individual for months--especially after promising to help. Initially, you had given hope to this expunged "criminal" and after he pleaded again and again for assistance some action was finally taken. Now, it appears it is all over. The abusive, unchecked and condescending authorities have won. The incurring frustration, seemingly endless wait, as well as the expensive fees were paid by this innocent victim. And despite the adversities and disappointments he will go on, wishing well of authorities, legal professionals and, most of all, hoping to be safeguarded from both professions since he is simply a law-abiding citizen, who probably needs to forget the injustice committed against him, and only wants to make his way in this world. With malice toward none, may there be mutual respect, honesty and compassion among all peoples and our various ways of life.Law Offices of Lauren Goldberg, PLLCEli B. ratedI had lost all hope that I would get through my horrible 5 year of back pay situation at Work, religion discrimination and long harassment; after other lawyers had turned me down and said I had no Case!    From the initial meeting, Lauren Goldberg were responsive to my calls, questions and concerns.

Robert Rozbruch MD.Yesenia N. ratedI consider dr. Rozbruch to be my lifesaver and my mother's as well. I sincerely credit him with saving me from a wheelchair at the tender age of 27 and discovering a congenital knocked kneed deformity "Genu Valgum" that was undiagnosed for the majority of my life that I never thought that could be corrected.

Did You Know?Physicians and surgeons help to keep people - from infants to the elderly - as healthy as possible. These individuals provide diagnoses and treatments for a wide variety of ailments, and preventative care and early detection for more serious illnesses. Whether you love or hate going to the doctor, the fact is your physician is there to listen to your health concerns, take preventative measures against diseases and advise you on your options for staying in tip-top shape.In 2013, there were more than 1 million doctors of medicine in the U.S., over 854,000 of which were active. Additionally, in 2012, there were about 18,000 active general surgeons in the country. It's important to know which type of physician or surgeon you need, how to choose the best one, and account for other considerations in order to stay healthy.Different Types of PhysiciansPatients can choose from a wide variety of physicians depending on doctor specialty and what problems they are experiencing. Here are a few of the most common types of physicians that you may see in your lifetime:General Practitioner
Your GP is the doctor that you go to for regular checkups, vaccines and to identify health issues. GPs can treat many different illnesses and injuries, from the common cold to a broken arm. If your health requires a second opinion or expert care, the GP will refer you to a specialist who has the skills to focus in on the issue.Cardiologist
Heart attacks and heart disease are some of the most common afflictions seen across the country, making cardiologists important to your long-term health. These physicians specialize in studying and treating the heart and related diseases.Dentist
Other than a GP, the dentist is likely the most common physician you'll ever see. These professionals work with the human mouth, ensuring that your teeth and gum health are up to par. Patients typically go to the dentist twice a year.Dermatologist
Dermatologists are focused on skin-related issues and diseases, from skin cancers, to acute acne, eczema, psoriasis, and general cosmetic concerns like aging and scars. Most will also perform annual or semi-annual mole checks to screen for any signs of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer.ENT
If you have a number of sinus infections or have had your tonsils taken out, you've likely seen an ENT specialist. ENTs handle ailments related to the ear, nose and throat, often related to taking out tonsils and treating hearing issues.OB/GYN
For many women, their gynecologist and obstetrician are the same person. These professionals work with the female reproductive system to focus on reproductive health, fertility issues, prenatal care, options for new and expectant mothers, neonatal care and childbirth. OB/GYNs can also help in the early detection of breast or cervical cancer.Choosing a PhysicianThere are obviously a number of physicians that you can choose from, but how do you know if they're the best choice for you? Here are a few considerations to help you pick a physician:Look at Your Insurance
Before you get down to the details, you need to verify which doctors are covered by your insurance and whether they are in or out of your carrier's network. Rates may be cheaper if the doc is in network – a doctor can be covered by your insurance but not necessarily in network. Out of network is typically more expensive. Doctors often add and drop plans, so it's important to ensure that your options are compatible with your insurance plan. Doing your homework will help you avoid unexpected expenses. Check for Board Certification
Your physician should be certified through the American Board of Medical Specialties. Doctors must earn a medical degree from a qualified school, complete three to seven years of residency training, be licensed by a state medical board and pass one or more ABMS exams to be certified.Examine the Reviews
Reviews of a doctor can reveal a lot about what your experience may be like. People may grade on staff friendliness, availability and effectiveness of treatment. Looking at these evaluations and getting recommendations from family and friends can direct you toward a physician for your needs.Choosing a SurgeonSurgeons can literally hold your life in their hands, and it's important to find the best one that can put you at ease and treat you effectivelyCompatibility Factor
You need to feel comfortable with your surgeon. It's important to communicate your concerns and that your surgeon can respond adequately. Surgeons should be willing to go over the details of your procedure and answer any questions that you may have. They must take the time to discuss and address your worries.Expertise Level
If you're going in for surgery, you want someone that knows what they're doing and has a high success rate. Ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it. This will give you peace of mind that you're in capable hands.Understanding Your InsuranceYour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have. You may have insurance through employment, your spouse, your parents if you're under 26, or the marketplace if the previous options don't apply to you. It's important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what you'll need to pay for.Your insurance will have a deductible, which is the amount that you're responsible to pay for covered medical expenses. Some plans have coinsurances, where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill, and insurance will cover the rest. Co-pays state a flat rate for certain services, like paying $20 when you visit your GP or a $100 co-pay for an emergency room visit. Once you reach your out-of-pocket maximum, which will differ if you're an individual or within a family plan, your insurance may pay for 100 percent of covered medical expenses for the rest of the plan year.If you plan to go to the doctor, need medication or have been recommended for surgery, call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers. You can choose the best doctor for your needs, understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expenses.Setting Your AppointmentMost doctors require a phone call for an appointment, although some may provide online scheduling as well. Be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment, and to bring it with you to the actual appointment. They need the ID numbers to verify your coverage, and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you don't have to show it again unless your insurance changes.When you call, let them know if you're a new patient, as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit. Tell them the reason for your visit, such as your symptoms if you're feeling sick. It's also important to inform them if you have Medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit, like current medications or medical records.From here, the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you. During your call, it's important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit. This information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect. Your appointment may progress faster as a result, and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for you.RisksDoctors see a number of patients in a day, sometimes in 15-minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand. This can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations, and they can end up missing certain problem indicators. While some problems, like a cold or flu, can be diagnosed in this time, more complex ailments require attention, which takes up time. Reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demand.Surgery has some more dire risks attached to it, so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure. If a patient has a reaction to anesthesia, it can cause very serious complications, but this is an uncommon occurrence. Blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery, often caused by inactivity during recovery. Infections, numbness, scarring, swelling and death are all possible, but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery you're undergoing. Talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potential.AftercareSurgery affects people in different ways, but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia, you'll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have. The nurse will tell you how the procedure went, what effect it will have on your condition, what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal. If you start feeling pain, the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse. When possible, it's also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs. This can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot. Some surgeries are outpatient procedures, where people are released the same day. For major surgeries, patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home. Discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bring.Recovery and Follow-upYour recovery time and follow-up expectations will vary depending on your procedure. For example, you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out, but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heart-valve surgery. Your surgeon will give you a list of things that you'll need to do during this time, including what medications to take and when you'll be able to get back to work and other activities.Every surgery will have a follow-up call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health. If you have a major operation, like heart surgery, it's important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal. Visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected. These appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on.
