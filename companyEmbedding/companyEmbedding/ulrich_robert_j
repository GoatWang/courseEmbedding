Biography[edit]
Ulrich was born in 1944, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the son of a 3M executive. He graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1967, and moved quickly into the retailing business. He began his career with Dayton Hudson Corporation (which would become Target Corporation in 2000). Until 1981, Ulrich held a series of positions overseeing merchandising for Dayton Hudson, including overseeing merchandising for Dayton's Department Stores. In 1981, he moved to overseeing the operations of Dayton's subsidiary, Diamond's Department Stores.[1] He currently resides in the Twin Cities Metro Area.
Building Target[edit]
In 1984, Ulrich became president of the Target Stores group within Dayton Hudson, and he began leading significant growth for the division. In 1987, he was promoted to chairman and chief executive officer of the Target Stores group. By 1992, the number of Target Stores had doubled during Ulrich's tenure, to just over 500, with just shy of fifty more opening each year.
In 1994, Kenneth Macke retired as chairman and chief executive of Target's parent company, Dayton Hudson Corporation, and Ulrich succeeded him in the position. Dayton Hudson had grown to encompass several store chains, including Dayton's, Hudson's, Mervyn's, and Marshall Field's, in addition to Target.
Over time, Target began to far eclipse the success of the other Dayton Hudson stores, and on January 13, 2000, Dayton Hudson took the name Target Corporation. Ulrich sold the other store groups, including Mervyn's and Marshall Field's, and focused on promoting the Target brand.[2]
Today[edit]
Ulrich retired from Target in 2009. In April 2010 Ulrich founded the Musical Instrument Museum (MIM) in Phoenix where he continues to serve as Board Chairman. In addition to that role, Ulrich serves on the boards of 3M, the University of St. Thomas, and the Minneapolis Institute of Arts.
Achievements[edit]
Bob Ulrich was awarded "CEO of the Year 2007" by Chief Executive Magazine

Robert Michael Urich (December 19, 1946 – April 16, 2002) was an American film, television and stage actor and television producer. Over the course of his 30-year career, he starred in a record 15 television series.[1]
Urich began his career in television in the early 1970s. After guest stints and roles in short-lived television series, he won a co starring role in the action/crime drama series S.W.A.T. in 1975. In 1976, he landed the role of Dan Tanna in the crime drama series Vega$. It aired on ABC from 1978 to 1981, and earned him two Golden Globe Award nominations. In addition to his work in television, he also starred in several feature films, including Magnum Force (1973), The Ice Pirates (1984), and Turk 182 (1985). From 1985 to 1988, he portrayed the title role in the detective television series Spenser: For Hire, based on Robert B. Parker's popular series of mystery novels. In 1988, he began hosting the documentary series National Geographic Explorer. He won a CableACE Award for his work on the series. He was also awarded a Golden Boot Award for his work in Western television series and films.
In 1996, Urich starred in The Lazarus Man. It was canceled shortly after he announced that he was diagnosed with synovial sarcoma, a rare cancer, in July 1996. He sought treatment for his illness while continuing his career and also worked to raise money for cancer research. He was declared cancer free in 1998 and returned to television in the UPN series, Love Boat: The Next Wave. In 2000, he made his Broadway debut as Billy Flynn in the musical Chicago. His last role was in the NBC sitcom Emeril in 2001, but in fall that year, his cancer returned. He died of synovial sarcoma in Thousand Oaks, California, in 2002 at the age of 55.

Early life[edit]
Urich was born in Toronto, Ohio, the son of John Paul and Cecilia Monica Urich.[2] He was of Rusyn and Slovak extraction and raised Byzantine Catholic [3] and Roman Catholic.[4] Urich attended Florida State University on a football scholarship, and was a member of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. In 1968, he earned a bachelor's degree in Radio and Television Communications. He went on to Michigan State University after working in Ohio to earn a master's degree in Broadcast Research and Management. He then worked as a salesman in Chicago at WGN-TV. He later worked as a weatherman.[5]
Career[edit]
After appearing in a production of The Rainmaker with Burt Reynolds, Urich decided to pursue acting full-time after Reynolds encouraged him to move to Los Angeles.[6]
1970s-1980s[edit]

Urich made his television debut in a guest starring role in The F.B.I., in 1972. The following year, he won a lead role in Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice. It was an adaptation of the 1969 film of the same name. It struggled in the ratings and was canceled after six episodes. He made his film debut later that same year opposite Clint Eastwood in the Dirty Harry film Magnum Force playing a vigilante motorcycle-patrol police officer. In 1975, Urich was cast in the action/crime drama series S.W.A.T.. According to the executive producer Aaron Spelling, Burt Reynolds convinced Spelling to allow Urich to read for the part. Spelling was impressed with his reading and cast him in the role of "Officer Jim Street".[7] A mid-season replacement, it earned high enough ratings to warrant a second season. However, it was canceled in 1976 due to its violent content.[8]
Urich's next role was on the sitcom Soap as Peter the Tennis Player in 1977. That same year he was cast as Paul Thurston, a good-looking, ego driven talk show host in the Bewitched spin-off series Tabitha, starring Lisa Hartman. Its rating were initially strong, but schedule changes caused ratings to drop and it was canceled in 1978 after 13 episodes.[9] Shortly after, he was cast in another Aaron Spelling produced series Vega$. He portrayed the series' lead character, Dan Tanna, a private detective who solves crimes in Las Vegas. It was a hit for ABC and he received two Golden Globe Award nominations for his work on it. By the third season, however, he had grown tired of the role and complained about the declining quality of the writing. Ratings had also declined and it was canceled in 1981. Shortly after, he signed with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and decided to focus on his film career. His first film for them was Endangered Species (1982), a science fiction one directed by Alan Rudolph.[10]
Shortly after filming Endangered Species, Urich signed on to star in another series Gavilan. He starred as the title character who was a former CIA agent turned oceanographer. It was canceled after seven episodes. In 1984, he starred in two more films The Ice Pirates, and Wes Craven's Invitation to Hell. The following year, Urich co-starred in Turk 182. It was a box office failure and he was nominated for Golden Raspberry Award. In 1985, Urich returned to episodic television as the title character in Spenser: For Hire. It was another hit for Urich and aired for three seasons. He reprised the role in several television films after it was canceled: Spenser: Ceremony (1993), Spenser: Pale Kings and Princes (1994), Spenser: The Judas Goat (1994), and Spenser: A Savage Place (1995). In 1988, he began hosting the documentary series National Geographic Explorer. He won a CableACE Award for his work on the series. In 1989, he portrayed Jake Spoon, in the acclaimed television miniseries Lonesome Dove, a role for which he received many positive reviews.
1990s–2000s[edit]
In the 1990s, Urich mainly appeared in television films and several short-lived television series. From 1990 to 1991, he starred in the sitcom American Dreamer" and the TV movie "((83 Hours 'Til Dawn))." The following year, he starred in ''Crossroads, a drama series that aired on ABC for ten episodes. In 1993, he and Faye Dunaway starred in the sitcom It Had to Be You. It was critically panned and canceled after four episodes. In 1995, he narrated an extremely rare one-night showing of a Disney television documentary called "Alien Encounters: From New Tomorrowland". It has never been shown again. In 1996, he starred in the TNT western series The Lazarus Man. It earned strong enough ratings to be picked up for a second season but shortly after it was renewed, he announced he had been diagnosed with synovial sarcoma. Its production company, Castle Rock Entertainment, opted to cancel it due to that.[11] In 1999, he commented on their choice to do so, "There's really a law against what they did. They found out I had cancer, and they just canceled the show. They didn't ask the doctors if I could work. They didn't ask if I could go back to work."[12] In 2000, he sued them for breach of contract.[13] The lawsuit was later settled with both parties agreeing not to publicly disclose the terms of the settlement.[14] While undergoing cancer treatments, Urich hosted the medical documentary series Vital Signs in 1997 and the PBS series Boatworks.[15] After a year of treatment, he was declared cancer-free and returned to television in 1998 as Captain Jim Kennedy III in Love Boat: The Next Wave. It aired on UPN for two seasons. In 2000, he made his Broadway debut as Billy Flynn in the musical Chicago.[16] and also was in the North American tour of the musical, in 1999 and in 2000.[17][18][19] The next year, he costarred in Emeril, a sitcom starring celebrity chef Emeril Lagasse. While it was critically panned, he received good notices for his work on it. It would be his last role in a television series. Urich's final television film, Night of the Wolf, aired on Animal Planet the night before his death.[14]
Personal life[edit]
Marriages and children[edit]
Urich's first marriage was to actress Barbara Rucker in 1968. They divorced in 1974. He married actress Heather Menzies in 1975. They adopted three children, Ryan, Emily, and Allison. They remained married until his death in 2002.[4]
Illness and death[edit]
In July 1996, Urich announced he had been diagnosed with synovial sarcoma, a rare form of cancer that attacks soft tissue. He continued working while undergoing treatment for his illness and also became an advocate for finding a cure for cancer. He won an award from the John Wayne Cancer Institute and the Gilda Radner Courage Award for his work raising cancer awareness.[12] He and Menzies also founded the Urich Fund for the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center to raise funds for cancer research. He also donated the $125,000 he won when he appeared on an episode of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.[14] He was declared cancer free in 1998. That same year, he was named the national spokesperson for the American Cancer Society.[5]
In November 2001, Urich revealed in an interview that his doctors had discovered lumps in his body but "a wonder drug had cleared them up".[14] The week before his death, he was hospitalized at Los Robles Hospital & Medical Center in Thousand Oaks for breathing problems. He died there on April 16, 2002.[20][21] His funeral mass was offered on April 19 at St. Charles Borromeo Church in North Hollywood.[5] He was cremated and his ashes were buried on the grounds of his family's vacation home in Prince Edward County, Ontario, Canada. A monument was placed in the West Lake Church of Christ Cemetery, which is located near the family's vacation home.
Legacy[edit]
Before his death, Urich and Menzies helped to raise money for the Eccles Performing Arts Centers at the Park City High School in Park City, Utah. After his death, the school established the Robert Urich Scholarship fund in his honor.[22] In addition, Urich and Menzies established the Robert and Heather Urich Fund for Sarcoma Research at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center. She has also battled cancer and is an ovarian cancer survivor. Menzies continues to work for the center.
Urich's hometown of Toronto, Ohio, named the Robert Urich Interchange in his honor. It connects the town to Ohio State Route 7. For his contribution to the television industry, Urich has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 7083 Hollywood Blvd.[1] Until Usher was added, he was the only person with a surname starting with the letter U on there.[23][24][25]

Urich began his career in television in the early 1970s. After guest stints and roles in short-lived television series, he won a co starring role in the action/crime drama series S.W.A.T. in 1975. In 1976, he landed the role of Dan Tanna in the crime drama series Vega$. It aired on ABC from 1978 to 1981, and earned him two Golden Globe Award nominations. In addition to his work in television, he also starred in several feature films, including Magnum Force (1973), The Ice Pirates (1984), and Turk 182 (1985). From 1985 to 1988, he portrayed the title role in the detective television series Spenser: For Hire, based on Robert B. Parker's popular series of mystery novels.

Early life[edit]
Urich was born in Toronto, Ohio, the son of John Paul and Cecilia Monica Urich.[2] He was of Rusyn and Slovak extraction and raised Byzantine Catholic [3] and Roman Catholic.[4] Urich attended Florida State University on a football scholarship, and was a member of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. In 1968, he earned a bachelor's degree in Radio and Television Communications. He went on to Michigan State University after working in Ohio to earn a master's degree in Broadcast Research and Management. He then worked as a salesman in Chicago at WGN-TV. He later worked as a weatherman.[5]
Career[edit]
After appearing in a production of The Rainmaker with Burt Reynolds, Urich decided to pursue acting full-time after Reynolds encouraged him to move to Los Angeles.[6]
1970s-1980s[edit]

Urich made his television debut in a guest starring role in The F.B.I., in 1972. The following year, he won a lead role in Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice. It was an adaptation of the 1969 film of the same name. It struggled in the ratings and was canceled after six episodes. He made his film debut later that same year opposite Clint Eastwood in the Dirty Harry film Magnum Force playing a vigilante motorcycle-patrol police officer. In 1975, Urich was cast in the action/crime drama series S.W.A.T.. According to the executive producer Aaron Spelling, Burt Reynolds convinced Spelling to allow Urich to read for the part. Spelling was impressed with his reading and cast him in the role of "Officer Jim Street".[7] A mid-season replacement, it earned high enough ratings to warrant a second season. However, it was canceled in 1976 due to its violent content.[8]
Urich's next role was on the sitcom Soap as Peter the Tennis Player in 1977. That same year he was cast as Paul Thurston, a good-looking, ego driven talk show host in the Bewitched spin-off series Tabitha, starring Lisa Hartman. Its rating were initially strong, but schedule changes caused ratings to drop and it was canceled in 1978 after 13 episodes.[9] Shortly after, he was cast in another Aaron Spelling produced series Vega$. He portrayed the series' lead character, Dan Tanna, a private detective who solves crimes in Las Vegas. It was a hit for ABC and he received two Golden Globe Award nominations for his work on it. By the third season, however, he had grown tired of the role and complained about the declining quality of the writing. Ratings had also declined and it was canceled in 1981. Shortly after, he signed with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and decided to focus on his film career. His first film for them was Endangered Species (1982), a science fiction one directed by Alan Rudolph.[10]
Shortly after filming Endangered Species, Urich signed on to star in another series Gavilan. He starred as the title character who was a former CIA agent turned oceanographer. It was canceled after seven episodes. In 1984, he starred in two more films The Ice Pirates, and Wes Craven's Invitation to Hell. The following year, Urich co-starred in Turk 182. It was a box office failure and he was nominated for Golden Raspberry Award. In 1985, Urich returned to episodic television as the title character in Spenser: For Hire. It was another hit for Urich and aired for three seasons. He reprised the role in several television films after it was canceled: Spenser: Ceremony (1993), Spenser: Pale Kings and Princes (1994), Spenser: The Judas Goat (1994), and Spenser: A Savage Place (1995). In 1988, he began hosting the documentary series National Geographic Explorer. He won a CableACE Award for his work on the series. In 1989, he portrayed Jake Spoon, in the acclaimed television miniseries Lonesome Dove, a role for which he received many positive reviews.
1990s–2000s[edit]
In the 1990s, Urich mainly appeared in television films and several short-lived television series. From 1990 to 1991, he starred in the sitcom American Dreamer" and the TV movie "((83 Hours 'Til Dawn))." The following year, he starred in ''Crossroads, a drama series that aired on ABC for ten episodes. In 1993, he and Faye Dunaway starred in the sitcom It Had to Be You. It was critically panned and canceled after four episodes. In 1995, he narrated an extremely rare one-night showing of a Disney television documentary called "Alien Encounters: From New Tomorrowland". It has never been shown again. In 1996, he starred in the TNT western series The Lazarus Man. It earned strong enough ratings to be picked up for a second season but shortly after it was renewed, he announced he had been diagnosed with synovial sarcoma. Its production company, Castle Rock Entertainment, opted to cancel it due to that.[11] In 1999, he commented on their choice to do so, "There's really a law against what they did. They found out I had cancer, and they just canceled the show. They didn't ask the doctors if I could work. They didn't ask if I could go back to work."[12] In 2000, he sued them for breach of contract.[13] The lawsuit was later settled with both parties agreeing not to publicly disclose the terms of the settlement.[14] While undergoing cancer treatments, Urich hosted the medical documentary series Vital Signs in 1997 and the PBS series Boatworks.[15] After a year of treatment, he was declared cancer-free and returned to television in 1998 as Captain Jim Kennedy III in Love Boat: The Next Wave. It aired on UPN for two seasons. In 2000, he made his Broadway debut as Billy Flynn in the musical Chicago.[16] and also was in the North American tour of the musical, in 1999 and in 2000.[17][18][19] The next year, he costarred in Emeril, a sitcom starring celebrity chef Emeril Lagasse. While it was critically panned, he received good notices for his work on it. It would be his last role in a television series. Urich's final television film, Night of the Wolf, aired on Animal Planet the night before his death.[14]
Personal life[edit]
Marriages and children[edit]
Urich's first marriage was to actress Barbara Rucker in 1968. They divorced in 1974. He married actress Heather Menzies in 1975. They adopted three children, Ryan, Emily, and Allison. They remained married until his death in 2002.[4]
Illness and death[edit]
In July 1996, Urich announced he had been diagnosed with synovial sarcoma, a rare form of cancer that attacks soft tissue. He continued working while undergoing treatment for his illness and also became an advocate for finding a cure for cancer. He won an award from the John Wayne Cancer Institute and the Gilda Radner Courage Award for his work raising cancer awareness.[12] He and Menzies also founded the Urich Fund for the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center to raise funds for cancer research. He also donated the $125,000 he won when he appeared on an episode of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.[14] He was declared cancer free in 1998. That same year, he was named the national spokesperson for the American Cancer Society.[5]
In November 2001, Urich revealed in an interview that his doctors had discovered lumps in his body but "a wonder drug had cleared them up".[14] The week before his death, he was hospitalized at Los Robles Hospital & Medical Center in Thousand Oaks for breathing problems. He died there on April 16, 2002.[20][21] His funeral mass was offered on April 19 at St. Charles Borromeo Church in North Hollywood.[5] He was cremated and his ashes were buried on the grounds of his family's vacation home in Prince Edward County, Ontario, Canada. A monument was placed in the West Lake Church of Christ Cemetery, which is located near the family's vacation home.
Legacy[edit]
Before his death, Urich and Menzies helped to raise money for the Eccles Performing Arts Centers at the Park City High School in Park City, Utah. After his death, the school established the Robert Urich Scholarship fund in his honor.[22] In addition, Urich and Menzies established the Robert and Heather Urich Fund for Sarcoma Research at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center. She has also battled cancer and is an ovarian cancer survivor. Menzies continues to work for the center.
Urich's hometown of Toronto, Ohio, named the Robert Urich Interchange in his honor. It connects the town to Ohio State Route 7. For his contribution to the television industry, Urich has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 7083 Hollywood Blvd.[1] Until Usher was added, he was the only person with a surname starting with the letter U on there.[23][24][25]

Urich made his television debut in a guest starring role in The F.B.I., in 1972. The following year, he won a lead role in Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice. It was an adaptation of the 1969 film of the same name. It struggled in the ratings and was canceled after six episodes.

He portrayed the series' lead character, Dan Tanna, a private detective who solves crimes in Las Vegas. It was a hit for ABC and he received two Golden Globe Award nominations for his work on it. By the third season, however, he had grown tired of the role and complained about the declining quality of the writing. Ratings had also declined and it was canceled in 1981. Shortly after, he signed with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and decided to focus on his film career. His first film for them was Endangered Species (1982), a science fiction one directed by Alan Rudolph.[10]
Shortly after filming Endangered Species, Urich signed on to star in another series Gavilan. He starred as the title character who was a former CIA agent turned oceanographer. It was canceled after seven episodes. In 1984, he starred in two more films The Ice Pirates, and Wes Craven's Invitation to Hell. The following year, Urich co-starred in Turk 182. It was a box office failure and he was nominated for Golden Raspberry Award. In 1985, Urich returned to episodic television as the title character in Spenser: For Hire. It was another hit for Urich and aired for three seasons. He reprised the role in several television films after it was canceled: Spenser: Ceremony (1993), Spenser: Pale Kings and Princes (1994), Spenser: The Judas Goat (1994), and Spenser: A Savage Place (1995). In 1988, he began hosting the documentary series National Geographic Explorer. He won a CableACE Award for his work on the series. In 1989, he portrayed Jake Spoon, in the acclaimed television miniseries Lonesome Dove, a role for which he received many positive reviews.
1990s–2000s[edit]
In the 1990s, Urich mainly appeared in television films and several short-lived television series. From 1990 to 1991, he starred in the sitcom American Dreamer" and the TV movie "((83 Hours 'Til Dawn))." The following year, he starred in ''Crossroads, a drama series that aired on ABC for ten episodes. In 1993, he and Faye Dunaway starred in the sitcom It Had to Be You. It was critically panned and canceled after four episodes. In 1995, he narrated an extremely rare one-night showing of a Disney television documentary called "Alien Encounters: From New Tomorrowland". It has never been shown again. In 1996, he starred in the TNT western series The Lazarus Man. It earned strong enough ratings to be picked up for a second season but shortly after it was renewed, he announced he had been diagnosed with synovial sarcoma. Its production company, Castle Rock Entertainment, opted to cancel it due to that.[11] In 1999, he commented on their choice to do so, "There's really a law against what they did. They found out I had cancer, and they just canceled the show. They didn't ask the doctors if I could work. They didn't ask if I could go back to work."[12] In 2000, he sued them for breach of contract.[13] The lawsuit was later settled with both parties agreeing not to publicly disclose the terms of the settlement.[14] While undergoing cancer treatments, Urich hosted the medical documentary series Vital Signs in 1997 and the PBS series Boatworks.[15] After a year of treatment, he was declared cancer-free and returned to television in 1998 as Captain Jim Kennedy III in Love Boat: The Next Wave. It aired on UPN for two seasons. In 2000, he made his Broadway debut as Billy Flynn in the musical Chicago.[16] and also was in the North American tour of the musical, in 1999 and in 2000.[17][18][19] The next year, he costarred in Emeril, a sitcom starring celebrity chef Emeril Lagasse. While it was critically panned, he received good notices for his work on it. It would be his last role in a television series. Urich's final television film, Night of the Wolf, aired on Animal Planet the night before his death.[14]
Personal life[edit]
Marriages and children[edit]
Urich's first marriage was to actress Barbara Rucker in 1968. They divorced in 1974. He married actress Heather Menzies in 1975. They adopted three children, Ryan, Emily, and Allison. They remained married until his death in 2002.[4]
Illness and death[edit]
In July 1996, Urich announced he had been diagnosed with synovial sarcoma, a rare form of cancer that attacks soft tissue. He continued working while undergoing treatment for his illness and also became an advocate for finding a cure for cancer. He won an award from the John Wayne Cancer Institute and the Gilda Radner Courage Award for his work raising cancer awareness.[12] He and Menzies also founded the Urich Fund for the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center to raise funds for cancer research. He also donated the $125,000 he won when he appeared on an episode of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.[14] He was declared cancer free in 1998. That same year, he was named the national spokesperson for the American Cancer Society.[5]
In November 2001, Urich revealed in an interview that his doctors had discovered lumps in his body but "a wonder drug had cleared them up".[14] The week before his death, he was hospitalized at Los Robles Hospital & Medical Center in Thousand Oaks for breathing problems. He died there on April 16, 2002.[20][21] His funeral mass was offered on April 19 at St. Charles Borromeo Church in North Hollywood.[5] He was cremated and his ashes were buried on the grounds of his family's vacation home in Prince Edward County, Ontario, Canada. A monument was placed in the West Lake Church of Christ Cemetery, which is located near the family's vacation home.
Legacy[edit]
Before his death, Urich and Menzies helped to raise money for the Eccles Performing Arts Centers at the Park City High School in Park City, Utah. After his death, the school established the Robert Urich Scholarship fund in his honor.[22] In addition, Urich and Menzies established the Robert and Heather Urich Fund for Sarcoma Research at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center. She has also battled cancer and is an ovarian cancer survivor. Menzies continues to work for the center.
Urich's hometown of Toronto, Ohio, named the Robert Urich Interchange in his honor. It connects the town to Ohio State Route 7. For his contribution to the television industry, Urich has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 7083 Hollywood Blvd.[1] Until Usher was added, he was the only person with a surname starting with the letter U on there.[23][24][25]

Urich made his television debut in a guest starring role in The F.B.I., in 1972. The following year, he won a lead role in Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice. It was an adaptation of the 1969 film of the same name. It struggled in the ratings and was canceled after six episodes. He made his film debut later that same year opposite Clint Eastwood in the Dirty Harry film Magnum Force playing a vigilante motorcycle-patrol police officer. In 1975, Urich was cast in the action/crime drama series S.W.A.T.. According to the executive producer Aaron Spelling, Burt Reynolds convinced Spelling to allow Urich to read for the part. Spelling was impressed with his reading and cast him in the role of "Officer Jim Street".[7] A mid-season replacement, it earned high enough ratings to warrant a second season. However, it was canceled in 1976 due to its violent content.[8]
Urich's next role was on the sitcom Soap as Peter the Tennis Player in 1977. That same year he was cast as Paul Thurston, a good-looking, ego driven talk show host in the Bewitched spin-off series Tabitha, starring Lisa Hartman. Its rating were initially strong, but schedule changes caused ratings to drop and it was canceled in 1978 after 13 episodes.[9] Shortly after, he was cast in another Aaron Spelling produced series Vega$. He portrayed the series' lead character, Dan Tanna, a private detective who solves crimes in Las Vegas. It was a hit for ABC and he received two Golden Globe Award nominations for his work on it. By the third season, however, he had grown tired of the role and complained about the declining quality of the writing. Ratings had also declined and it was canceled in 1981. Shortly after, he signed with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and decided to focus on his film career. His first film for them was Endangered Species (1982), a science fiction one directed by Alan Rudolph.[10]
Shortly after filming Endangered Species, Urich signed on to star in another series Gavilan. He starred as the title character who was a former CIA agent turned oceanographer. It was canceled after seven episodes. In 1984, he starred in two more films The Ice Pirates, and Wes Craven's Invitation to Hell. The following year, Urich co-starred in Turk 182. It was a box office failure and he was nominated for Golden Raspberry Award. In 1985, Urich returned to episodic television as the title character in Spenser: For Hire. It was another hit for Urich and aired for three seasons. He reprised the role in several television films after it was canceled: Spenser: Ceremony (1993), Spenser: Pale Kings and Princes (1994), Spenser: The Judas Goat (1994), and Spenser: A Savage Place (1995). In 1988, he began hosting the documentary series National Geographic Explorer. He won a CableACE Award for his work on the series. In 1989, he portrayed Jake Spoon, in the acclaimed television miniseries Lonesome Dove, a role for which he received many positive reviews.
1990s–2000s[edit]
In the 1990s, Urich mainly appeared in television films and several short-lived television series. From 1990 to 1991, he starred in the sitcom American Dreamer" and the TV movie "((83 Hours 'Til Dawn))." The following year, he starred in ''Crossroads, a drama series that aired on ABC for ten episodes. In 1993, he and Faye Dunaway starred in the sitcom It Had to Be You. It was critically panned and canceled after four episodes. In 1995, he narrated an extremely rare one-night showing of a Disney television documentary called "Alien Encounters: From New Tomorrowland". It has never been shown again. In 1996, he starred in the TNT western series The Lazarus Man. It earned strong enough ratings to be picked up for a second season but shortly after it was renewed, he announced he had been diagnosed with synovial sarcoma. Its production company, Castle Rock Entertainment, opted to cancel it due to that.[11] In 1999, he commented on their choice to do so, "There's really a law against what they did. They found out I had cancer, and they just canceled the show. They didn't ask the doctors if I could work. They didn't ask if I could go back to work."[12] In 2000, he sued them for breach of contract.[13] The lawsuit was later settled with both parties agreeing not to publicly disclose the terms of the settlement.[14] While undergoing cancer treatments, Urich hosted the medical documentary series Vital Signs in 1997 and the PBS series Boatworks.[15] After a year of treatment, he was declared cancer-free and returned to television in 1998 as Captain Jim Kennedy III in Love Boat: The Next Wave. It aired on UPN for two seasons. In 2000, he made his Broadway debut as Billy Flynn in the musical Chicago.[16] and also was in the North American tour of the musical, in 1999 and in 2000.[17][18][19] The next year, he costarred in Emeril, a sitcom starring celebrity chef Emeril Lagasse. While it was critically panned, he received good notices for his work on it. It would be his last role in a television series. Urich's final television film, Night of the Wolf, aired on Animal Planet the night before his death.[14]
Personal life[edit]
Marriages and children[edit]
Urich's first marriage was to actress Barbara Rucker in 1968. They divorced in 1974. He married actress Heather Menzies in 1975. They adopted three children, Ryan, Emily, and Allison. They remained married until his death in 2002.[4]
Illness and death[edit]
In July 1996, Urich announced he had been diagnosed with synovial sarcoma, a rare form of cancer that attacks soft tissue. He continued working while undergoing treatment for his illness and also became an advocate for finding a cure for cancer. He won an award from the John Wayne Cancer Institute and the Gilda Radner Courage Award for his work raising cancer awareness.[12] He and Menzies also founded the Urich Fund for the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center to raise funds for cancer research. He also donated the $125,000 he won when he appeared on an episode of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.[14] He was declared cancer free in 1998. That same year, he was named the national spokesperson for the American Cancer Society.[5]
In November 2001, Urich revealed in an interview that his doctors had discovered lumps in his body but "a wonder drug had cleared them up".[14] The week before his death, he was hospitalized at Los Robles Hospital & Medical Center in Thousand Oaks for breathing problems. He died there on April 16, 2002.[20][21] His funeral mass was offered on April 19 at St. Charles Borromeo Church in North Hollywood.[5] He was cremated and his ashes were buried on the grounds of his family's vacation home in Prince Edward County, Ontario, Canada. A monument was placed in the West Lake Church of Christ Cemetery, which is located near the family's vacation home.
Legacy[edit]
Before his death, Urich and Menzies helped to raise money for the Eccles Performing Arts Centers at the Park City High School in Park City, Utah. After his death, the school established the Robert Urich Scholarship fund in his honor.[22] In addition, Urich and Menzies established the Robert and Heather Urich Fund for Sarcoma Research at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center. She has also battled cancer and is an ovarian cancer survivor. Menzies continues to work for the center.
Urich's hometown of Toronto, Ohio, named the Robert Urich Interchange in his honor. It connects the town to Ohio State Route 7. For his contribution to the television industry, Urich has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 7083 Hollywood Blvd.[1] Until Usher was added, he was the only person with a surname starting with the letter U on there.[23][24][25]

Robert Michael Urich (December 19, 1946 – April 16, 2002) was an American film, television and stage actor and television producer. Over the course of his 30-year career, he starred in a record 15 television series.[1]
Urich began his career in television in the early 1970s. After guest stints and roles in short-lived television series, he won a co starring role in the action/crime drama series S.W.A.T. in 1975. In 1976, he landed the role of Dan Tanna in the crime drama series Vega$. It aired on ABC from 1978 to 1981, and earned him two Golden Globe Award nominations. In addition to his work in television, he also starred in several feature films, including Magnum Force (1973), The Ice Pirates (1984), and Turk 182 (1985). From 1985 to 1988, he portrayed the title role in the detective television series Spenser: For Hire, based on Robert B. Parker's popular series of mystery novels. In 1988, he began hosting the documentary series National Geographic Explorer. He won a CableACE Award for his work on the series. He was also awarded a Golden Boot Award for his work in Western television series and films.
In 1996, Urich starred in The Lazarus Man. It was canceled shortly after he announced that he was diagnosed with synovial sarcoma, a rare cancer, in July 1996. He sought treatment for his illness while continuing his career and also worked to raise money for cancer research. He was declared cancer free in 1998 and returned to television in the UPN series, Love Boat: The Next Wave. In 2000, he made his Broadway debut as Billy Flynn in the musical Chicago.

Early life[edit]
Urich was born in Toronto, Ohio, the son of John Paul and Cecilia Monica Urich.[2] He was of Rusyn and Slovak extraction and raised Byzantine Catholic [3] and Roman Catholic.[4] Urich attended Florida State University on a football scholarship, and was a member of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. In 1968, he earned a bachelor's degree in Radio and Television Communications. He went on to Michigan State University after working in Ohio to earn a master's degree in Broadcast Research and Management. He then worked as a salesman in Chicago at WGN-TV. He later worked as a weatherman.[5]
Career[edit]
After appearing in a production of The Rainmaker with Burt Reynolds, Urich decided to pursue acting full-time after Reynolds encouraged him to move to Los Angeles.[6]
1970s-1980s[edit]

Urich made his television debut in a guest starring role in The F.B.I., in 1972. The following year, he won a lead role in Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice. It was an adaptation of the 1969 film of the same name. It struggled in the ratings and was canceled after six episodes. He made his film debut later that same year opposite Clint Eastwood in the Dirty Harry film Magnum Force playing a vigilante motorcycle-patrol police officer. In 1975, Urich was cast in the action/crime drama series S.W.A.T.. According to the executive producer Aaron Spelling, Burt Reynolds convinced Spelling to allow Urich to read for the part. Spelling was impressed with his reading and cast him in the role of "Officer Jim Street".[7] A mid-season replacement, it earned high enough ratings to warrant a second season. However, it was canceled in 1976 due to its violent content.[8]
Urich's next role was on the sitcom Soap as Peter the Tennis Player in 1977. That same year he was cast as Paul Thurston, a good-looking, ego driven talk show host in the Bewitched spin-off series Tabitha, starring Lisa Hartman. Its rating were initially strong, but schedule changes caused ratings to drop and it was canceled in 1978 after 13 episodes.[9] Shortly after, he was cast in another Aaron Spelling produced series Vega$. He portrayed the series' lead character, Dan Tanna, a private detective who solves crimes in Las Vegas. It was a hit for ABC and he received two Golden Globe Award nominations for his work on it. By the third season, however, he had grown tired of the role and complained about the declining quality of the writing. Ratings had also declined and it was canceled in 1981. Shortly after, he signed with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and decided to focus on his film career. His first film for them was Endangered Species (1982), a science fiction one directed by Alan Rudolph.[10]
Shortly after filming Endangered Species, Urich signed on to star in another series Gavilan. He starred as the title character who was a former CIA agent turned oceanographer. It was canceled after seven episodes. In 1984, he starred in two more films The Ice Pirates, and Wes Craven's Invitation to Hell. The following year, Urich co-starred in Turk 182. It was a box office failure and he was nominated for Golden Raspberry Award. In 1985, Urich returned to episodic television as the title character in Spenser: For Hire. It was another hit for Urich and aired for three seasons. He reprised the role in several television films after it was canceled: Spenser: Ceremony (1993), Spenser: Pale Kings and Princes (1994), Spenser: The Judas Goat (1994), and Spenser: A Savage Place (1995). In 1988, he began hosting the documentary series National Geographic Explorer. He won a CableACE Award for his work on the series. In 1989, he portrayed Jake Spoon, in the acclaimed television miniseries Lonesome Dove, a role for which he received many positive reviews.
1990s–2000s[edit]
In the 1990s, Urich mainly appeared in television films and several short-lived television series. From 1990 to 1991, he starred in the sitcom American Dreamer" and the TV movie "((83 Hours 'Til Dawn))." The following year, he starred in ''Crossroads, a drama series that aired on ABC for ten episodes. In 1993, he and Faye Dunaway starred in the sitcom It Had to Be You. It was critically panned and canceled after four episodes. In 1995, he narrated an extremely rare one-night showing of a Disney television documentary called "Alien Encounters: From New Tomorrowland". It has never been shown again. In 1996, he starred in the TNT western series The Lazarus Man. It earned strong enough ratings to be picked up for a second season but shortly after it was renewed, he announced he had been diagnosed with synovial sarcoma. Its production company, Castle Rock Entertainment, opted to cancel it due to that.[11] In 1999, he commented on their choice to do so, "There's really a law against what they did. They found out I had cancer, and they just canceled the show. They didn't ask the doctors if I could work. They didn't ask if I could go back to work."[12] In 2000, he sued them for breach of contract.[13] The lawsuit was later settled with both parties agreeing not to publicly disclose the terms of the settlement.[14] While undergoing cancer treatments, Urich hosted the medical documentary series Vital Signs in 1997 and the PBS series Boatworks.[15] After a year of treatment, he was declared cancer-free and returned to television in 1998 as Captain Jim Kennedy III in Love Boat: The Next Wave. It aired on UPN for two seasons. In 2000, he made his Broadway debut as Billy Flynn in the musical Chicago.[16] and also was in the North American tour of the musical, in 1999 and in 2000.[17][18][19] The next year, he costarred in Emeril, a sitcom starring celebrity chef Emeril Lagasse. While it was critically panned, he received good notices for his work on it. It would be his last role in a television series. Urich's final television film, Night of the Wolf, aired on Animal Planet the night before his death.[14]
Personal life[edit]
Marriages and children[edit]
Urich's first marriage was to actress Barbara Rucker in 1968. They divorced in 1974. He married actress Heather Menzies in 1975. They adopted three children, Ryan, Emily, and Allison. They remained married until his death in 2002.[4]
Illness and death[edit]
In July 1996, Urich announced he had been diagnosed with synovial sarcoma, a rare form of cancer that attacks soft tissue. He continued working while undergoing treatment for his illness and also became an advocate for finding a cure for cancer. He won an award from the John Wayne Cancer Institute and the Gilda Radner Courage Award for his work raising cancer awareness.[12] He and Menzies also founded the Urich Fund for the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center to raise funds for cancer research. He also donated the $125,000 he won when he appeared on an episode of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.[14] He was declared cancer free in 1998. That same year, he was named the national spokesperson for the American Cancer Society.[5]
In November 2001, Urich revealed in an interview that his doctors had discovered lumps in his body but "a wonder drug had cleared them up".[14] The week before his death, he was hospitalized at Los Robles Hospital & Medical Center in Thousand Oaks for breathing problems. He died there on April 16, 2002.[20][21] His funeral mass was offered on April 19 at St. Charles Borromeo Church in North Hollywood.[5] He was cremated and his ashes were buried on the grounds of his family's vacation home in Prince Edward County, Ontario, Canada. A monument was placed in the West Lake Church of Christ Cemetery, which is located near the family's vacation home.
Legacy[edit]
Before his death, Urich and Menzies helped to raise money for the Eccles Performing Arts Centers at the Park City High School in Park City, Utah. After his death, the school established the Robert Urich Scholarship fund in his honor.[22] In addition, Urich and Menzies established the Robert and Heather Urich Fund for Sarcoma Research at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center. She has also battled cancer and is an ovarian cancer survivor. Menzies continues to work for the center.
Urich's hometown of Toronto, Ohio, named the Robert Urich Interchange in his honor. It connects the town to Ohio State Route 7. For his contribution to the television industry, Urich has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 7083 Hollywood Blvd.[1] Until Usher was added, he was the only person with a surname starting with the letter U on there.[23][24][25]

Robert Michael Urich (December 19, 1946 – April 16, 2002) was an American film, television and stage actor and television producer. Over the course of his 30-year career, he starred in a record 15 television series.[1]
Urich began his career in television in the early 1970s. After guest stints and roles in short-lived television series, he won a co starring role in the action/crime drama series S.W.A.T. in 1975. In 1976, he landed the role of Dan Tanna in the crime drama series Vega$. It aired on ABC from 1978 to 1981, and earned him two Golden Globe Award nominations. In addition to his work in television, he also starred in several feature films, including Magnum Force (1973), The Ice Pirates (1984), and Turk 182 (1985). From 1985 to 1988, he portrayed the title role in the detective television series Spenser: For Hire, based on Robert B. Parker's popular series of mystery novels. In 1988, he began hosting the documentary series National Geographic Explorer. He won a CableACE Award for his work on the series. He was also awarded a Golden Boot Award for his work in Western television series and films.
In 1996, Urich starred in The Lazarus Man. It was canceled shortly after he announced that he was diagnosed with synovial sarcoma, a rare cancer, in July 1996. He sought treatment for his illness while continuing his career and also worked to raise money for cancer research. He was declared cancer free in 1998 and returned to television in the UPN series, Love Boat: The Next Wave. In 2000, he made his Broadway debut as Billy Flynn in the musical Chicago. His last role was in the NBC sitcom Emeril in 2001, but in fall that year, his cancer returned. He died of synovial sarcoma in Thousand Oaks, California, in 2002 at the age of 55.

Early life[edit]
Urich was born in Toronto, Ohio, the son of John Paul and Cecilia Monica Urich.[2] He was of Rusyn and Slovak extraction and raised Byzantine Catholic [3] and Roman Catholic.[4] Urich attended Florida State University on a football scholarship, and was a member of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. In 1968, he earned a bachelor's degree in Radio and Television Communications. He went on to Michigan State University after working in Ohio to earn a master's degree in Broadcast Research and Management. He then worked as a salesman in Chicago at WGN-TV. He later worked as a weatherman.[5]
Career[edit]
After appearing in a production of The Rainmaker with Burt Reynolds, Urich decided to pursue acting full-time after Reynolds encouraged him to move to Los Angeles.[6]
1970s-1980s[edit]

Urich made his television debut in a guest starring role in The F.B.I., in 1972. The following year, he won a lead role in Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice. It was an adaptation of the 1969 film of the same name. It struggled in the ratings and was canceled after six episodes. He made his film debut later that same year opposite Clint Eastwood in the Dirty Harry film Magnum Force playing a vigilante motorcycle-patrol police officer. In 1975, Urich was cast in the action/crime drama series S.W.A.T.. According to the executive producer Aaron Spelling, Burt Reynolds convinced Spelling to allow Urich to read for the part. Spelling was impressed with his reading and cast him in the role of "Officer Jim Street".[7] A mid-season replacement, it earned high enough ratings to warrant a second season. However, it was canceled in 1976 due to its violent content.[8]
Urich's next role was on the sitcom Soap as Peter the Tennis Player in 1977. That same year he was cast as Paul Thurston, a good-looking, ego driven talk show host in the Bewitched spin-off series Tabitha, starring Lisa Hartman. Its rating were initially strong, but schedule changes caused ratings to drop and it was canceled in 1978 after 13 episodes.[9] Shortly after, he was cast in another Aaron Spelling produced series Vega$. He portrayed the series' lead character, Dan Tanna, a private detective who solves crimes in Las Vegas. It was a hit for ABC and he received two Golden Globe Award nominations for his work on it. By the third season, however, he had grown tired of the role and complained about the declining quality of the writing. Ratings had also declined and it was canceled in 1981. Shortly after, he signed with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and decided to focus on his film career. His first film for them was Endangered Species (1982), a science fiction one directed by Alan Rudolph.[10]
Shortly after filming Endangered Species, Urich signed on to star in another series Gavilan. He starred as the title character who was a former CIA agent turned oceanographer. It was canceled after seven episodes. In 1984, he starred in two more films The Ice Pirates, and Wes Craven's Invitation to Hell. The following year, Urich co-starred in Turk 182. It was a box office failure and he was nominated for Golden Raspberry Award. In 1985, Urich returned to episodic television as the title character in Spenser: For Hire. It was another hit for Urich and aired for three seasons. He reprised the role in several television films after it was canceled: Spenser: Ceremony (1993), Spenser: Pale Kings and Princes (1994), Spenser: The Judas Goat (1994), and Spenser: A Savage Place (1995). In 1988, he began hosting the documentary series National Geographic Explorer. He won a CableACE Award for his work on the series. In 1989, he portrayed Jake Spoon, in the acclaimed television miniseries Lonesome Dove, a role for which he received many positive reviews.
1990s–2000s[edit]
In the 1990s, Urich mainly appeared in television films and several short-lived television series. From 1990 to 1991, he starred in the sitcom American Dreamer" and the TV movie "((83 Hours 'Til Dawn))." The following year, he starred in ''Crossroads, a drama series that aired on ABC for ten episodes. In 1993, he and Faye Dunaway starred in the sitcom It Had to Be You. It was critically panned and canceled after four episodes. In 1995, he narrated an extremely rare one-night showing of a Disney television documentary called "Alien Encounters: From New Tomorrowland". It has never been shown again. In 1996, he starred in the TNT western series The Lazarus Man. It earned strong enough ratings to be picked up for a second season but shortly after it was renewed, he announced he had been diagnosed with synovial sarcoma. Its production company, Castle Rock Entertainment, opted to cancel it due to that.[11] In 1999, he commented on their choice to do so, "There's really a law against what they did. They found out I had cancer, and they just canceled the show. They didn't ask the doctors if I could work. They didn't ask if I could go back to work."[12] In 2000, he sued them for breach of contract.[13] The lawsuit was later settled with both parties agreeing not to publicly disclose the terms of the settlement.[14] While undergoing cancer treatments, Urich hosted the medical documentary series Vital Signs in 1997 and the PBS series Boatworks.[15] After a year of treatment, he was declared cancer-free and returned to television in 1998 as Captain Jim Kennedy III in Love Boat: The Next Wave. It aired on UPN for two seasons. In 2000, he made his Broadway debut as Billy Flynn in the musical Chicago.[16] and also was in the North American tour of the musical, in 1999 and in 2000.[17][18][19] The next year, he costarred in Emeril, a sitcom starring celebrity chef Emeril Lagasse. While it was critically panned, he received good notices for his work on it. It would be his last role in a television series. Urich's final television film, Night of the Wolf, aired on Animal Planet the night before his death.[14]
Personal life[edit]
Marriages and children[edit]
Urich's first marriage was to actress Barbara Rucker in 1968. They divorced in 1974. He married actress Heather Menzies in 1975. They adopted three children, Ryan, Emily, and Allison. They remained married until his death in 2002.[4]
Illness and death[edit]
In July 1996, Urich announced he had been diagnosed with synovial sarcoma, a rare form of cancer that attacks soft tissue. He continued working while undergoing treatment for his illness and also became an advocate for finding a cure for cancer. He won an award from the John Wayne Cancer Institute and the Gilda Radner Courage Award for his work raising cancer awareness.[12] He and Menzies also founded the Urich Fund for the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center to raise funds for cancer research. He also donated the $125,000 he won when he appeared on an episode of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.[14] He was declared cancer free in 1998. That same year, he was named the national spokesperson for the American Cancer Society.[5]
In November 2001, Urich revealed in an interview that his doctors had discovered lumps in his body but "a wonder drug had cleared them up".[14] The week before his death, he was hospitalized at Los Robles Hospital & Medical Center in Thousand Oaks for breathing problems. He died there on April 16, 2002.[20][21] His funeral mass was offered on April 19 at St. Charles Borromeo Church in North Hollywood.[5] He was cremated and his ashes were buried on the grounds of his family's vacation home in Prince Edward County, Ontario, Canada. A monument was placed in the West Lake Church of Christ Cemetery, which is located near the family's vacation home.
Legacy[edit]
Before his death, Urich and Menzies helped to raise money for the Eccles Performing Arts Centers at the Park City High School in Park City, Utah. After his death, the school established the Robert Urich Scholarship fund in his honor.[22] In addition, Urich and Menzies established the Robert and Heather Urich Fund for Sarcoma Research at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center. She has also battled cancer and is an ovarian cancer survivor. Menzies continues to work for the center.
Urich's hometown of Toronto, Ohio, named the Robert Urich Interchange in his honor. It connects the town to Ohio State Route 7. For his contribution to the television industry, Urich has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 7083 Hollywood Blvd.[1] Until Usher was added, he was the only person with a surname starting with the letter U on there.[23][24][25]

Robert Michael Urich (December 19, 1946 – April 16, 2002) was an American film, television and stage actor and television producer. Over the course of his 30-year career, he starred in a record 15 television series.[1]
Urich began his career in television in the early 1970s. After guest stints and roles in short-lived television series, he won a co starring role in the action/crime drama series S.W.A.T. in 1975. In 1976, he landed the role of Dan Tanna in the crime drama series Vega$. It aired on ABC from 1978 to 1981, and earned him two Golden Globe Award nominations. In addition to his work in television, he also starred in several feature films, including Magnum Force (1973), The Ice Pirates (1984), and Turk 182 (1985). From 1985 to 1988, he portrayed the title role in the detective television series Spenser: For Hire, based on Robert B. Parker's popular series of mystery novels. In 1988, he began hosting the documentary series National Geographic Explorer. He won a CableACE Award for his work on the series. He was also awarded a Golden Boot Award for his work in Western television series and films.
In 1996, Urich starred in The Lazarus Man. It was canceled shortly after he announced that he was diagnosed with synovial sarcoma, a rare cancer, in July 1996. He sought treatment for his illness while continuing his career and also worked to raise money for cancer research. He was declared cancer free in 1998 and returned to television in the UPN series, Love Boat: The Next Wave. In 2000, he made his Broadway debut as Billy Flynn in the musical Chicago. His last role was in the NBC sitcom Emeril in 2001, but in fall that year, his cancer returned. He died of synovial sarcoma in Thousand Oaks, California, in 2002 at the age of 55.

Early life[edit]
Urich was born in Toronto, Ohio, the son of John Paul and Cecilia Monica Urich.[2] He was of Rusyn and Slovak extraction and raised Byzantine Catholic [3] and Roman Catholic.[4] Urich attended Florida State University on a football scholarship, and was a member of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. In 1968, he earned a bachelor's degree in Radio and Television Communications. He went on to Michigan State University after working in Ohio to earn a master's degree in Broadcast Research and Management. He then worked as a salesman in Chicago at WGN-TV. He later worked as a weatherman.[5]
Career[edit]
After appearing in a production of The Rainmaker with Burt Reynolds, Urich decided to pursue acting full-time after Reynolds encouraged him to move to Los Angeles.[6]
1970s-1980s[edit]

Urich made his television debut in a guest starring role in The F.B.I., in 1972. The following year, he won a lead role in Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice. It was an adaptation of the 1969 film of the same name. It struggled in the ratings and was canceled after six episodes. He made his film debut later that same year opposite Clint Eastwood in the Dirty Harry film Magnum Force playing a vigilante motorcycle-patrol police officer. In 1975, Urich was cast in the action/crime drama series S.W.A.T.. According to the executive producer Aaron Spelling, Burt Reynolds convinced Spelling to allow Urich to read for the part. Spelling was impressed with his reading and cast him in the role of "Officer Jim Street".[7] A mid-season replacement, it earned high enough ratings to warrant a second season. However, it was canceled in 1976 due to its violent content.[8]
Urich's next role was on the sitcom Soap as Peter the Tennis Player in 1977. That same year he was cast as Paul Thurston, a good-looking, ego driven talk show host in the Bewitched spin-off series Tabitha, starring Lisa Hartman. Its rating were initially strong, but schedule changes caused ratings to drop and it was canceled in 1978 after 13 episodes.[9] Shortly after, he was cast in another Aaron Spelling produced series Vega$. He portrayed the series' lead character, Dan Tanna, a private detective who solves crimes in Las Vegas. It was a hit for ABC and he received two Golden Globe Award nominations for his work on it. By the third season, however, he had grown tired of the role and complained about the declining quality of the writing. Ratings had also declined and it was canceled in 1981. Shortly after, he signed with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and decided to focus on his film career. His first film for them was Endangered Species (1982), a science fiction one directed by Alan Rudolph.[10]
Shortly after filming Endangered Species, Urich signed on to star in another series Gavilan. He starred as the title character who was a former CIA agent turned oceanographer. It was canceled after seven episodes. In 1984, he starred in two more films The Ice Pirates, and Wes Craven's Invitation to Hell. The following year, Urich co-starred in Turk 182. It was a box office failure and he was nominated for Golden Raspberry Award. In 1985, Urich returned to episodic television as the title character in Spenser: For Hire. It was another hit for Urich and aired for three seasons. He reprised the role in several television films after it was canceled: Spenser: Ceremony (1993), Spenser: Pale Kings and Princes (1994), Spenser: The Judas Goat (1994), and Spenser: A Savage Place (1995). In 1988, he began hosting the documentary series National Geographic Explorer. He won a CableACE Award for his work on the series. In 1989, he portrayed Jake Spoon, in the acclaimed television miniseries Lonesome Dove, a role for which he received many positive reviews.
1990s–2000s[edit]
In the 1990s, Urich mainly appeared in television films and several short-lived television series. From 1990 to 1991, he starred in the sitcom American Dreamer" and the TV movie "((83 Hours 'Til Dawn))." The following year, he starred in ''Crossroads, a drama series that aired on ABC for ten episodes. In 1993, he and Faye Dunaway starred in the sitcom It Had to Be You. It was critically panned and canceled after four episodes. In 1995, he narrated an extremely rare one-night showing of a Disney television documentary called "Alien Encounters: From New Tomorrowland". It has never been shown again. In 1996, he starred in the TNT western series The Lazarus Man. It earned strong enough ratings to be picked up for a second season but shortly after it was renewed, he announced he had been diagnosed with synovial sarcoma. Its production company, Castle Rock Entertainment, opted to cancel it due to that.[11] In 1999, he commented on their choice to do so, "There's really a law against what they did. They found out I had cancer, and they just canceled the show. They didn't ask the doctors if I could work. They didn't ask if I could go back to work."[12] In 2000, he sued them for breach of contract.[13] The lawsuit was later settled with both parties agreeing not to publicly disclose the terms of the settlement.[14] While undergoing cancer treatments, Urich hosted the medical documentary series Vital Signs in 1997 and the PBS series Boatworks.[15] After a year of treatment, he was declared cancer-free and returned to television in 1998 as Captain Jim Kennedy III in Love Boat: The Next Wave. It aired on UPN for two seasons. In 2000, he made his Broadway debut as Billy Flynn in the musical Chicago.[16] and also was in the North American tour of the musical, in 1999 and in 2000.[17][18][19] The next year, he costarred in Emeril, a sitcom starring celebrity chef Emeril Lagasse. While it was critically panned, he received good notices for his work on it. It would be his last role in a television series. Urich's final television film, Night of the Wolf, aired on Animal Planet the night before his death.[14]
Personal life[edit]
Marriages and children[edit]
Urich's first marriage was to actress Barbara Rucker in 1968. They divorced in 1974. He married actress Heather Menzies in 1975. They adopted three children, Ryan, Emily, and Allison. They remained married until his death in 2002.[4]
Illness and death[edit]
In July 1996, Urich announced he had been diagnosed with synovial sarcoma, a rare form of cancer that attacks soft tissue. He continued working while undergoing treatment for his illness and also became an advocate for finding a cure for cancer. He won an award from the John Wayne Cancer Institute and the Gilda Radner Courage Award for his work raising cancer awareness.[12] He and Menzies also founded the Urich Fund for the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center to raise funds for cancer research. He also donated the $125,000 he won when he appeared on an episode of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.[14] He was declared cancer free in 1998. That same year, he was named the national spokesperson for the American Cancer Society.[5]
In November 2001, Urich revealed in an interview that his doctors had discovered lumps in his body but "a wonder drug had cleared them up".[14] The week before his death, he was hospitalized at Los Robles Hospital & Medical Center in Thousand Oaks for breathing problems. He died there on April 16, 2002.[20][21] His funeral mass was offered on April 19 at St. Charles Borromeo Church in North Hollywood.[5] He was cremated and his ashes were buried on the grounds of his family's vacation home in Prince Edward County, Ontario, Canada. A monument was placed in the West Lake Church of Christ Cemetery, which is located near the family's vacation home.
Legacy[edit]
Before his death, Urich and Menzies helped to raise money for the Eccles Performing Arts Centers at the Park City High School in Park City, Utah. After his death, the school established the Robert Urich Scholarship fund in his honor.[22] In addition, Urich and Menzies established the Robert and Heather Urich Fund for Sarcoma Research at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center. She has also battled cancer and is an ovarian cancer survivor. Menzies continues to work for the center.
Urich's hometown of Toronto, Ohio, named the Robert Urich Interchange in his honor. It connects the town to Ohio State Route 7. For his contribution to the television industry, Urich has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 7083 Hollywood Blvd.[1] Until Usher was added, he was the only person with a surname starting with the letter U on there.[23][24][25]

      ■ In the bleak discount-retailing landscape littered with the ruins
      of countless low-price chains that found survival impossible in the era of
      Wal-Mart, Target Stores managed not only to survive but to prosper. The
      chain's success had to be credited in large part to the genius of
      Robert Ulrich, the chairman and chief executive officer of the parent
      Target Corporation for more than a decade. While Bradlees, Caldor,
      Montgomery Ward, and others fell by the wayside and once-mighty Kmart was
      forced to reorganize under Chapter 11, Ulrich found a way for Target to
      distinguish itself from the rest of the pack. Most importantly for
      Target's shareholders, Ulrich managed not just to keep Target
      alfoat but to generate impressive growth in sales and profits.
    

      One measure of Ulrich's success, of course, was his compensation,
      which for both 2001 and 2002 was declared the highest in the U.S.
      retailing industry by 
      
        Home Textiles Today
      
      . The magazine reported on January 30, 2004, that Ulrich's 2002
      pay—including salary, bonus, and stock options—totaled $18.2
      million, up just over 20 percent from the $15.1 million of the year
      before. A distant second on the magazine's list of 2002's
      top-paid retailing executives was Lawrence Montgomery, the CEO of
      Kohl's, who pulled in a total of $12.2 million; Lee Scott,
      Ulrich's counterpart at Wal-Mart, was paid a total of $4.4 million.
    

      MANY BELIEVED ULRICH COULD CHALLENGE WAL-MART
    

      Although talk of Target mounting a serious challenge to Wal-Mart's
      supremacy in the discount market may have elicited derisive chuckles in
      some circles, there were those who thought that if it could be done at
      all, Ulrich was the man to make it happen. After several years of pressure
      from Wall Street, Ulrich announced in March 2004 that Target Corporation
      was putting its Marshall Field's and Mervyn's divisions on
      the auction block. Both divisions operated department stores, the earnings
      of which accounted for less than 15 percent of Target Corporation's
      total annual revenue.
    

      Marshal Cohen, the chief analyst at NPD Group, the market-information
      company based in Port Washington, New York, told Janet Moore of the 
      
        Minneapolis Star Tribune
      
       that the evolution of a leaner, meaner Target suggested that Wal-Mart
      might have been in for "a rude awakening" (March 11, 2004).
      Cohen predicted that Target was going to "aggressively pursue the
      Wal-Mart customer." On the other hand, the retailing analyst Eric
      Beder of Northeast Securities in New York seemed skeptical that Target
      would fare well in a head-to-head battle with Wal-Mart. Beder said that in
      contrast to management's portrayal of the company, "People
      are going to be a little surprised maybe when they clean off all these
      negatives to see that the Target chain is not exactly that consistent
      growth vehicle" (March 11, 2004).
    

      The son of a 3M executive, Robert J. Ulrich was born in Minneapolis,
      Minnesota, in 1944. He grew up in and around the Twin Cities and after
      high school enrolled at the University of Minnesota, from which he earned
      his bachelor's degree in 1967. Fresh out of college Ulrich joined a
      merchandising trainee program at Dayton Corporation, the Minneapolis-based
      operator of the upscale Dayton's department stores. After
      completing training, he advanced through the company's
      merchandising ranks in a series of positions of increasing responsibility.
      Posts held by Ulrich included sales manager, buyer, group manager, and
      divisional merchandise manager. In 1969, two years after Ulrich joined
      Dayton, the company merged with the Detroit-based J.L. Hudson Company to
      form Dayton Hudson Corporation. Like Dayton's, Hudson's
      department stores catered to a more affluent market.
    

      CONTINUES TO CLIMB LADDER AT DAYTON HUDSON
    

      By 1976 Ulrich had earned himself a vice presidency and the post of
      general-merchandise manager for the Dayton's division of Dayton
      Hudson. Two years later, after completing an executive training program at
      Stanford University, he was promoted to senior vice president for stores.
      In 1981 Ulrich was named president and chief executive officer of
      Diamond's Department Stores, another division of Dayton Hudson that
      was later sold to Dillard's. In early 1984 he became one of three
      presidents at Dayton Hudson. While his two copresidents were each
      responsible for regional groups of stores, Ulrich was charged with
      overseeing merchandising, marketing, and distribution for the entire
      chain. Later that same year Ulrich was named president of Dayton
      Hudson's Target Stores division, a chain of discount retail outlets
      that by the mid-1980s was generating annual revenues of more than $3
      billion, making it the company's largest operating division.
    

      In 1962, five years before Ulrich joined the company, Dayton's had
      opened its first Target store in Roseville, Minnesota. The Target outlets
      were Dayton's response to what it saw as a growing demand for
      brand-name goods at discounted prices in a convenient shopping
      environment. By the time Ulrich assumed Target's presidency in
      1984, the chain had grown to 216 stores and was already being widely
      described as an upscale discounter, differentiating it from the other
      leading retail discounters such as Wal-Mart and Kmart. Further
      distinguishing Target from discount competitors was its early decision to
      refer to shoppers as "guests." Much of the chain's
      future growth and profitability would be predicated on just such
      distinctions. Under the direction of Ulrich, who in 1987 was named
      chairman and CEO of the Target division, Target stores more than doubled
      in number, growing to a total of 506 by November 1992. By the end of 1993
      that number had grown to 554.
    

      One of the first innovations in the Target franchise during
      Ulrich's tenure was the introduction of the Greatland store.
      Sensing a strong consumer appetite for larger stores, in the fall of 1990
      the upscale discount chain opened its first Target Greatland store in the
      Minneapolis suburb of Apple Valley; others soon followed. The Greatland
      stores differed from other Targets in size: they were typically 20 to 50
      percent larger than traditional outlets. The average Target Greatland
      covered roughly 150,000 square feet, more than three football fields.
      About half of the increased area was used for the display of additional
      merchandise, with the remaining half used to create a feel of greater
      spaciousness, allowing wider aisles, a larger restaurant, and more open
      areas.
    

      ULRICH FACES OFF AGAINST WAL-MART
    

      In the spring of 1993 a classic David-versus-Goliath confrontation came to
      a boil when Ulrich fired back at Wal-Mart in response to marketing tactics
      he considered unfair. Wal-Mart ran a series of ads misrepresenting Target
      prices in markets served by both chains; Ulrich then launched a
      counteroffensive with ads headlined, "This never would have
      happened if Sam Walton were alive." (Sam Walton, the founder of the
      larger chain, had died in April 1992.) Of Wal-Mart's ad campaign,
      Ulrich told 
      
        Women's Wear Daily
      
      , "I believe customers are being misled by Wal-Mart's
      inaccurate price comparisons" (March 25, 1993). Target contended
      that in some cases Wal-Mart had offered price comparisons on products not
      even available at the smaller chain.
    

      With Target contributing an increasingly large proportion of Dayton
      Hudson's total revenues, it came as little surprise when in 1994
      Ulrich was named to succeed the outgoing Kenneth Macke as chairman and CEO
      of Dayton Hudson Corporation. Commenting on the differences between the
      marketing styles of Macke and Ulrich, a Twin Cities retailing consultant
      familiar with both executives made an interesting observation when
      speaking to Aron Kahn of the 
      
        St. Paul Pioneer Press
      
      : "If they were at a lemonade stand that was running into
      competition, Macke would try to get the customers in by charging three
      cents instead of five, and Ulrich would try to get them in with two
      varieties of lemonade" (April 14, 1994).
    

      By the time Ulrich took over the reins of the parent company, Dayton
      Hudson was operating not only the Dayton, Hudson, and Target outlets but
      also Mervyn's department stores, acquired in 1979, and Marshall
      Field's, purchased in 1990. As had been the case for more than a
      decade, the Target stores continued to contribute the biggest share of
      Dayton Hudson earnings. In the mid-1990s Ulrich introduced SuperTarget,
      his answer to the giant retailing centers that had been launched earlier
      by Wal-Mart and Kmart. These supercenters blended the discounters'
      regular displays of general merchandise with the food and grocery
      offerings of a full-service supermarket.
    

      Target's first supercenter, with 195,000 square feet of retailing
      space, opened in Omaha, Nebraska, and was soon followed by others in the
      Midwest.
    

      TARGET MARKETS "A HIP IMAGE"
    

      By the late 1990s Ulrich's campaign to carve out a special niche
      for Target was winning praise from such distinguished American business
      publications as 
      
        Forbes
      
       and 
      
        Fortune
      
      , both of which profiled Target in lengthy articles during the first half
      of 1999. Michelle Conlin, writing in the January 11, 1999, issue of 
      
        Forbes
      
      , observed that the chain's stores had managed "to market a
      hip image despite their discount prices." Some of Target's
      success could be credited to the interchange of information between Dayton
      Hudson's department stores and its discount chain. Of
      Target's success in attracting higher-income consumers to its
      stores, Ulrich told Conlin, "Our research shows that the higher the
      income, the better educated, the more the guests like to shop our
      stores" (January 11, 1999).
    

      In her profile of Target in the May 24, 1999, issue of 
      
        Fortune
      
      , Shelly Branch wrote, "The image of Target stores has gradually
      been transformed from typical discount chain to a hip store where even the
      rich and trendy can save money." Keeping the upscale discounter
      abreast of changing fashion trends and consumer tastes was a 22-member
      trend-merchandising team, the only such advisory panel of its kind in the
      discount business. Members of the team—affectionately called
      "Targeteers" by the Target designer Michael
      Graves—tracked trends, visiting stores around the globe, and tried
      wherever possible to anticipate the directions in which consumer tastes
      were headed. Ulrich told Branch, "We're constantly
      challenging our people to reinvent. Our guests have started to say,
      'Hey, it's a lot more clever to shop at Target than it used
      to be'" (May 24, 1999).
    

      A critical element in Ulrich's campaign to expand the Target
      franchise was the chain's edgy marketing campaign. Reporting on a
      February address to the 2003 Retail Advertising Conference by Michael
      Francis, Target's senior vice president of marketing, Lisa
      Bertagnoli of 
      
        Women's Wear Daily
      
       described the chain's multilevel strategy to generate buzz for its
      stores and merchandise. The typical Target customer, according to company
      demographics, was about 44 years of age and had a household income of
      $54,000. Of its core constituency, 80 percent had attended college, 41
      percent had children, and 80 percent were female. Target's goal was
      to retain its core consumer base while increasing business with younger
      customers. According to Bertagnoli, Francis told the National Retail
      Federation–sponsored conference that the discounter's future
      lay in the hands of trendsetters in terms of "style, haircuts,
      tattoos, body piercing—you name it" (February 10, 2003).
    

      TARGET'S BULL'S-EYE NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED
    

      Target's efforts to make its bull's-eye trademark
      recognizable around the country got a solid vote of confidence in a
      brand-awareness poll conducted in 2002. Poll results showed that 96
      percent of all Americans recognized and associated the red-and-white
      bull's-eye logo with Target, a higher level of recognition than the
      Ralph Lauren Polo pony or even the Nike swoosh. When the good news was
      delivered to Ulrich, as Francis reported at the conference, the Target CEO
      tasked his marketing chief to track down the remaining 4 percent of the
      populace and find out what the company was doing wrong. "And he
      wasn't kidding," Francis assured his audience (February 10,
      2003).
    

      Reflecting Target's dominant role in the financial fortunes of
      Dayton Hudson Corporation, on January 13, 2000, Ulrich announced that the
      company's name henceforth would be Target Corporation. At the time
      of the name change Target Stores accounted for a little over 75 percent of
      the corporation's total revenue. In announcing the name change,
      according to an Associated Press report, Ulrich said, "Target
      Corporation is a more appropriate name for the company and is also a more
      widely recognized brand name" (January 13, 2000). A year later
      Target consolidated its department store holdings, folding its Dayton and
      Hudson department stores into the Marshall Field's division. This
      reorganization left the company with three main retail divisions: Target,
      Mervyn's, and Marshall Field's.
    

      As more and more price-savvy Americans turned to the socalled discounters
      to fill their consumer needs in the latter half of the 1990s, the
      contributions of Target's department-store
      brands—Mervyn's and Marshall Field's—to the
      corporation's bottom line shrank; Mervyn's in particular
      fell upon hard times. According to Janet Moore of the 
      
        Minneapolis Star Tribune
      
      , in a 1998 presentation to security analysts Ulrich laid out an ultimatum
      for Mervyn's: he warned that the corporation "would pursue
      alternative ways to generate shareholder value" if the
      department-store chain failed to improve same-store sales over the
      following 12 to 18 months (March 11, 2004). Mervyn's failed to
      deliver, but Ulrich was reluctant to act, perhaps because of the
      intelligence the department stores offered Target Stores on changing
      consumer trends. But in early 2004 he could no longer ignore the decline
      in the department stores' fortunes and announced that both
      Mervyn's and Marshall Field's would be put up for sale.
    

      DEPARTMENT STORES' SHARE OF PROFITS SHRINKS
    

      As of early March 2004, according to the 
      
        Minneapolis Star Tribune
      
      , Mervyn's had a total of 266 stores and 29,000 employees. In
      fiscal 2003 it had managed to post a pretax profit of $160 million on
      sales of $3.6 billion, down from the pretax
       profit of $238 million in fiscal 2002. Marshall Field's, with 62
      stores and 25,000 employees, reported a pretax profit of $107 million on
      revenue of $2.6 billion in fiscal 2003, off sharply from its fiscal 2002
      profit of $135 million. In contrast, Target Stores in fiscal 2003 earned
      almost $3.5 billion before taxes, up significantly from the nearly $3.1
      billion of fiscal 2002. Revenues per square foot at Target outlets edged
      up to $282 in fiscal 2003 from $278 the previous year, while revenues per
      square foot were down at both Mervyn's ($165, down from $178) and
      Marshall Field's ($178, down from $180) during the same period.
      Some security analysts speculated that Target Corporation's stock
      would be likely to rise if it succeeded in selling off its
      department-store brands, allowing it to focus exclusively on its
      successful Target franchise.
    

      Spelling out his vision for Target Stores in the short-term future, Ulrich
      projected in the company's 2003 annual report that the discount
      chain would add 95 to 100 new stores in 2004, for a net increase of 80 to
      85 stores after taking into consideration closings and relocations. Ulrich
      also promised that Target's new store design, scheduled to be
      introduced in 2004, would be "more pleasant and inviting and
      promote our goal of being the preferred shopping destination for our
      guests" ("On Target: Full Speed Ahead").
    

      Ulrich was not without his critics. His high level of compensation
      predictably drew fire from union workers protesting what they considered
      unfair treatment at the hands of Target management. At Target's
      annual shareholders meeting in May 2003, labor organizers handed out
      leaflets contrasting Ulrich's $19.2 million compensation package
      with the reduced pay, benefits, and hours of store employees. At about the
      same time Ulrich was sharply criticized by Corporate Library, one of the
      country's leading shareholder-advocacy groups, according to a
      report by Neal St. Anthony in the 
      
        Minneapolis Star Tribune
      
      . Corporate Library gave Target's CEO low marks for slipping out of
      the company's annual meeting without answering a single question
      from shareholders.
    

      Ulrich, who was divorced, lived in a lavish home in the Minneapolis suburb
      of Edina. He had two grown children, Curt and Jacqueline. A member of the
      Committee to Encourage Corporate Philanthropy, Ulrich worked hard to see
      that Target made a positive contribution to the communities in which it
      operated. One of the corporation's pet causes was education, as
      exemplified by its Take Charge of Education program, which was launched in
      1997. Under the program each week the company gave $2 million back to
      communities across America. According to the company's Web site,
      "portions of these funds are dedicated to specific education
      programs and initiatives, created by Target, to directly improve funding
      for schools and opportunities for students" ("Community
      Giving: Take Charge of Education"). Ulrich also served on the board
      of the National Retail Federation and in early 2001 received the
      federation's Gold Medal Award.
