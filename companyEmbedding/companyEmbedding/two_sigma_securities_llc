GREENWICH, Conn. and NEW YORK, May 9, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Two Sigma Securities, LLC (TSS), the market-making affiliate of Two Sigma Investments, LP has reached an agreement to acquire the U.S. options-market-making business of Timber Hill, a subsidiary of Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ GS: IBKR), the companies announced today. This transaction positions TSS to become a top-tier market-maker across both options and equities. By adding Timber Hill's options business, TSS's market-making offering will span over 7,000 U.S. equity securities and options on 1,300 underlying securities, executing over 300 million shares and one million options contracts per day. 








TSS expects to integrate Timber Hill's system into its platform over the coming months, and the transaction is expected to close in September upon receiving required regulatory approvals.
Through combining Two Sigma's technology and quantitative capabilities and Timber Hill's options expertise, TSS clients will now have access to a unified, best-in-class provider. Additionally, the broader options-trading community will continue to benefit from a strong competitive landscape as Timber Hill maintains and extends its ability to provide liquidity across the U.S. exchanges. 
Simon Yates, CEO of TSS, said, "Through this transaction, TSS will integrate Timber Hill's highly complementary platform to form a full-service, large-scale market-maker across equities and options on exchanges and for wholesale retail clients. We look forward to welcoming Timber Hill's employees into our organization. We will also be actively engaging with the exchanges, other market participants and regulators to be part of the dialogue around growing a healthy options industry."
Thomas Peterffy, founder of Timber Hill said, "Interactive Brokers' brokerage business has grown at a very rapid pace. This success is substantially due to our expertise in building first-rate execution technology, which we acquired over our forty years as market makers, leading the way from open outcry floor trading to today's electronic markets. As we are turning our entire attention to our brokerage business, we are gratified that under able management by Two Sigma our software modules will continue to provide liquidity in the U.S. options markets."
TSS plans to open an office in Connecticut to accommodate Timber Hill's current team. This team will operate alongside TSS's existing operations in SoHo. 
Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P. is acting as financial advisor and Sidley Austin LLP is providing legal advice to Two Sigma. Interactive Brokers was advised by Dechert LLP.
Two Sigma Securities, LLCTwo Sigma Securities, LLC is a broker-dealer registered with the SEC, a member of the major U.S. equity exchanges and a registered market maker in over 7,000 U.S. exchange listed equities. Backed by a high-performance, proprietary platform, the firm facilitates the execution of more than 300 million shares per day. Two Sigma Securities, LLC is the market making subsidiary of Two Sigma Investments, LP and is a member of FINRA and SIPC.

Many TS-ers have ideas for new projects, but limited ways to explore them. Others have valuable insight to bring to projects, but might not know about all that's going on across the company. Enter Spark. It’s our internal open-source platform where people can share and collaborate on ideas. It all comes together in Spark Day, where selected ideas are presented to the entire firm. Starting this year, the people behind the audience favorite will win sabbatical time to bring their vision to life.

Data Clinic
How do we help non-profits use data to their advantage? When they need to ask for donations to fund a project, is it more effective to ask for more or less money than they actually need?

Open Source
At Two Sigma, we use Open Source Software, and we’re passionate about giving back to the programming community. That’s why we shared the code to Beaker, our notebook-style development environment that lets researchers in different fields interact with their data and build models more efficiently. We think of Beaker as the Universal Translator for Data Scientists. We hope you enjoy it as much as we do. You’ll find more information on it here.

Gaming
It’s needless to say we love games, but it's worth repeating. There are games to play all over our offices, from ping pong, to shuffleboard, to Connect 6 to everything in between. Of course there’s also chess, and we’ve had a fair share of chess champions come visit us. And we host a lot of gaming events, including game nights where we play Agricola, Dominion, Roborally, Solarquest, and much more. We pride ourselves on being competitive but not combative.

Mobility
We want to help everyone here grow and get better. And as our company gets bigger, the opportunities for growth multiply. To make sure everyone finds the work that’s best for them, we’ve created an Internal Opportunities site. It lets people find new openings in the company and follow-up on the ones they like. And if you’d like to pursue another opportunity, but aren’t sure where to start, our recruitment team is always here to help.

Music
Our music studio is a great place to step away, whether you’re a musician or a fan, and we've got many of both. We have a drum kit; percussion kit; keyboard; electric and acoustic guitars and other string instruments; amps; speakers; mixers; production software; and a karaoke machine. We've even got two turntables and some microphones. Want to come and just jam? Far out. Want to record and mix your own tracks? Have at it. Want to just gather around the piano and sing carols? Joy to the world.

Culture of learning
Teaching and learning are woven into everything we do. We encourage everyone to contribute – by teaching classes, leading study groups or brown-bag lunch talks, writing for our internal blog, screening movies, or sharing their knowledge another way. We frequently host guest speakers who are world leaders in their field. And we even have a team, called Organizational & People Development, whose mission is to identify learning needs in our company and develop programs that meet them.

Good times

Good times
We throw great parties – because we like to celebrate our successes, and well, because we just like parties. Our annual summer outing, where TS-ers and their families spend a day soaking up the sun at some secret location, is a perennial favorite. Another is our annual holiday party, whose venues have included space shuttles and submarines. Other fiestas include New Sigma, where we welcome all new hires, and Birthday Snacks Day, when dessert is served to everyone to honor that month’s birthdays.

About | Two Sigma














































About
More than 1,100 people who believe the scientific method is the best way to approach investing. Ideas backed up with information. And improved by iteration. That’s Two Sigma.
We’re not your typical investment manager. We follow principles of technology and innovation as much as principles of investment management. Fields like machine learning and distributed computing guide us. Since 2001, we’ve searched for ways that these kinds of technologies can make us better at what we do. We never stop researching and developing.
In the process, we work to help real people. Through our investors, we support the retirements of millions around the world. And we help fund breakthrough research, education and a wide range of charities and foundations.

He went on to lead customer relationship management at Amazon.com, directing Amazon’s renowned personalization, community, and targeted marketing features and technology.  He also led critical efforts to make Amazon’s customer technology more scalable.
A lifelong math enthusiast, John won a silver medal for the United States in the 27th International Mathematics Olympiad. He earned a B.S. in Mathematics (with distinction) and a M.S. in Statistics from Stanford University. John currently serves on the Board of Directors of the Hamilton Insurance Group.
