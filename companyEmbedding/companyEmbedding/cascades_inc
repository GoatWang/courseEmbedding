History[edit]
The Lemaire family founded the Drummond Pulp & Fibre company in 1957 which is involved in the recovery of household and industrial waste.
In 1964, Antonio Lemaire and his sons officially ventured into the production of paper made from recycled fibres when they took over a disaffected mill in Kingsey Falls,(Quebec), owned by the Dominion Paper Co.. Papier Cascades Inc. was born of that transaction.
In 1971, Cascades began its expansion in Kingsey Falls with the creation of Cascades Forma-Pak, its first moulded-pulp mill to use 100% recycled fibres. The event marked the beginning of a veritable paper-making corporation in a small town in the center of Québec from 1972 to 1977: the successive start-up of Papier Kingsey Falls (multi-layer board), Cascades Industries (tissue paper), Plastiques Cascades and Cascades Conversion.
In 1976, the Lemaire brothers "brought their skill and knowledge" outside Kingsey Falls for the first time with the start-up of the containerboard mill Papier Cascades in Cabano (Québec). This was the beginning of a great adventure that would bring Cascades all over the world.
In 1983 Cascades' shares began trading on the Montreal Stock Exchange. That same year, its entry into the United States began with the start-up of Cascades Industries Inc. in Rockingham, North Carolina. In Québec, Cascades began producing kraft paper in East Angus and acquired a boxboard plant in Joncquière the following year.
In 1985, the company made its entry into Europe with the acquisition of a boxboard plant in La Rochette, France. This new expansion took shape in 1986 with the creation of Cascades S.A. and the acquisition of another French boxboard mill in Blendecques. From 1987 to 1989, other mills located in Sweden and Belgium became part of the Cascades Group as well: Djupafors AB in Sweden and Kartonfabriek van Duffel NV in Belgium. The Belgian mill was renamed Cascades Duffel NV but ceased its production in 1993 after heavy losses and then was immediately transformed into a cutting center for the other European mills of the group. Declared definitively closed in the accounts of 1997, it was reconverted in 2002 by the ex-President of the Board of Cascades, Laurent Lemaire, to a so-called internal commercial agency, under the name with slightly modified orthography of Cascade Duffel NV, and having only one unit of establishment called Korton Fabrick van Ouffel, located at the exact address of the old mill Kartonfabriek van Duffel which was resold by Cascades to another company in 1998. This so-called agency (before different fiscal controles ...), without collaborator working in Belgium, was implied at the time of exports of cartonboard out of Europe, in particular those in transit by the port of Antwerp (according to Boards of directors of Cascades SA of June 28, 2002 and Nov 3, 2003). Since 2009, M. Stephane Thiollier and M. Vincent Lestringant (despite he died in... 2005) are not anymore Members of the Board of Cascades Duffel NV. Both have been replaced in May 2009 by M. Jean Goulet (General Manager of Cascades SAS / France) and by M. Zaki Haned (Investor Relations Manager at Reno De Medici). But if Cascades Duffel NV was "liquidated" with immediate effect the 28/12/2011, the "story" seems not finished yet......
(see also the 4 last "external links" below...)
Expansion[edit]
The 80's decade played out in a spirit of innovation with the creation of a Research and Development Center in 1985 in Kingsey Falls. The facility became the largest private Canadian Research and Development Center in the pulp and paper industry.
On the eve of the nineties decade, Cascades became daring when it created Cascades Énergie. This subsidiary controlled a brand new cogeneration plant powered by natural gas, the first in Canada, and whose mandate was to provide the energy required by all the Cascades mills in Kingsey Falls. The success of this project enabled Cascades to invest further in the prospective energy sector with the acquisition of Boralex in 1995. Today, Boralex's shares are traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange in which Cascades holds a 34% interest.
Cascades Énergie paved the way for a series of acquisitions in which Cascades' activities were largely diversified. The purchase of Rolland and Paperboard Industries Corporation in 1992, Perkins Papers in 1995, Provincial Papers in 1997 and, that same year, the creation of Norampac in partnership with Domtar, led to the restructuring of Cascades into five distinct corporate groups whose operations were focused as much in the sector of specialized packaging as in those of containerboard, tissue paper, fine papers and boxboard.
On an international level, Cascades' expansion continued in Europe with the acquisition of the boxboard mill in Arnsberg (Germany) in 1997 and the start-up of a sheeting operation in Wednesbury (England) in 1998.
Upon entering the new millennium, the scope of the tissue paper sector grew in 2001 with the acquisition of the mills in Pennsylvania and in Wisconsin. Two years later, the group sustained its momentum and set up shop in Alberta, in New York, in Arizona, in Oregon and in Tennessee. In 2004, the boxboard sector stood out with the acquisition of Dopaco Inc., a leader in the packaging products sector destined for the quick service restaurant industry. Not to be left out, Norampac proceeded with the implementation, between 2001 and 2006, of several ultra-modern corrugated cardboard mills in Canada and in the United States.
In 2004, Cascades created in Europe four new companies in Luxembourg (Cascades Luxembourg Sarl, Norampac Luxembourg Sarl, Cascades Hungary Ltd Luxembourg Branch and Norampac Ltd Luxembourg Branch). Beginning of 2010 Cascades Canada Inc Luxembourg Branch was created, and with the closure of Cascade(s) Duffel NV in Belgium, the closure of Norampac Ltd Luxembourg Branch and the existing Pulp & Paper Cascades NV (become BV ?) in the Netherlands, that carries to four the number of companies in service in 2012 into the Benelux without any co-worker who works on it(Norampac Luxembourg Sarl was closed in September 2008 by incorporation into Cascades Luxembourg Sarl (new capital February 2012: USD 64 933 600,00 ) and beginning of February 2012, Cascades Canada Inc Luxemburg Branch changed her name to Cascades Canada ULC Luxembourg Branch.
Challenges[edit]
An appreciating Canadian dollar, an increase in energy prices and the cost of fibre, fierce competition: the 2000s also provided challenges for Cascades, which forced it to implement a significant rationalization plan. This process resulted in, the closure of mills in Thunder Bay, Montréal, Red Rock, Pickering, Buffalo and Boissy le Chatel. In 2005, the company proceeded with the sale of its fine papers (Cascades Resources) and its tissue paper (Wood Wyant) distribution assets.
With the purchase of Domtar's shares in Norampac in 2006 and the merger of its European boxboard operations with Reno de Medici in 2007, Cascade has consolidated its position as a leader in the containerboard and boxboard sectors.
In 2008, North-American boxboard activities were integrated into Norampac's cartonboard activities. In addition to creating synergy, this integration allowed better sharing of technology and led to the creation of a larger packaging group to meet the needs of clients in Canada and the United States.
In 2011, Cascades named Mario Plourde Chief Operating Officer, enabling Alain Lemaire, President and Chief Executive Officer, to devote more time to the strategic vision of the company. Also in 2011, Cascades sold Dopaco Inc., its paper cup and carton converting business for the quick-service restaurant and foodservice industries, to Reynolds Group Holdings Limited. Net proceeds from the transaction will mainly be used to pay down Cascades' debt.
In keeping with its origins but definitely being forward-looking, Cascades is banking on its products that contain a high percentage of recycled fibres to distinguish itself from the competition, while remaining committed to the principles of sustainable development that is so dear to its corporate philosophy. Cascades also demonstrates that it understands that only innovation and the marketing of environmentally sound products will guarantee its future success.
In October 2008, Cascades was named one of "Canada's Top 100 Employers" by Mediacorp Canada Inc., and was featured in Maclean's newsmagazine.[2]
The company is not related to American paper company Boise Cascade.
Cascades is a member of the Forest Products Association of Canada.

In 2008, North-American boxboard activities were integrated into Norampac's cartonboard activities. In addition to creating synergy, this integration allowed better sharing of technology and led to the creation of a larger packaging group to meet the needs of clients in Canada and the United States.
In 2011, Cascades named Mario Plourde Chief Operating Officer, enabling Alain Lemaire, President and Chief Executive Officer, to devote more time to the strategic vision of the company. Also in 2011, Cascades sold Dopaco Inc., its paper cup and carton converting business for the quick-service restaurant and foodservice industries, to Reynolds Group Holdings Limited. Net proceeds from the transaction will mainly be used to pay down Cascades' debt.
In keeping with its origins but definitely being forward-looking, Cascades is banking on its products that contain a high percentage of recycled fibres to distinguish itself from the competition, while remaining committed to the principles of sustainable development that is so dear to its corporate philosophy. Cascades also demonstrates that it understands that only innovation and the marketing of environmentally sound products will guarantee its future success.
In October 2008, Cascades was named one of "Canada's Top 100 Employers" by Mediacorp Canada Inc., and was featured in Maclean's newsmagazine.[2]
The company is not related to American paper company Boise Cascade.
Cascades is a member of the Forest Products Association of Canada.

History[edit]
The Lemaire family founded the Drummond Pulp & Fibre company in 1957 which is involved in the recovery of household and industrial waste.
In 1964, Antonio Lemaire and his sons officially ventured into the production of paper made from recycled fibres when they took over a disaffected mill in Kingsey Falls,(Quebec), owned by the Dominion Paper Co.. Papier Cascades Inc. was born of that transaction.
In 1971, Cascades began its expansion in Kingsey Falls with the creation of Cascades Forma-Pak, its first moulded-pulp mill to use 100% recycled fibres. The event marked the beginning of a veritable paper-making corporation in a small town in the center of Québec from 1972 to 1977: the successive start-up of Papier Kingsey Falls (multi-layer board), Cascades Industries (tissue paper), Plastiques Cascades and Cascades Conversion.
In 1976, the Lemaire brothers "brought their skill and knowledge" outside Kingsey Falls for the first time with the start-up of the containerboard mill Papier Cascades in Cabano (Québec). This was the beginning of a great adventure that would bring Cascades all over the world.
In 1983 Cascades' shares began trading on the Montreal Stock Exchange. That same year, its entry into the United States began with the start-up of Cascades Industries Inc. in Rockingham, North Carolina. In Québec, Cascades began producing kraft paper in East Angus and acquired a boxboard plant in Joncquière the following year.
In 1985, the company made its entry into Europe with the acquisition of a boxboard plant in La Rochette, France. This new expansion took shape in 1986 with the creation of Cascades S.A. and the acquisition of another French boxboard mill in Blendecques. From 1987 to 1989, other mills located in Sweden and Belgium became part of the Cascades Group as well: Djupafors AB in Sweden and Kartonfabriek van Duffel NV in Belgium. The Belgian mill was renamed Cascades Duffel NV but ceased its production in 1993 after heavy losses and then was immediately transformed into a cutting center for the other European mills of the group. Declared definitively closed in the accounts of 1997, it was reconverted in 2002 by the ex-President of the Board of Cascades, Laurent Lemaire, to a so-called internal commercial agency, under the name with slightly modified orthography of Cascade Duffel NV, and having only one unit of establishment called Korton Fabrick van Ouffel, located at the exact address of the old mill Kartonfabriek van Duffel which was resold by Cascades to another company in 1998. This so-called agency (before different fiscal controles ...), without collaborator working in Belgium, was implied at the time of exports of cartonboard out of Europe, in particular those in transit by the port of Antwerp (according to Boards of directors of Cascades SA of June 28, 2002 and Nov 3, 2003). Since 2009, M. Stephane Thiollier and M. Vincent Lestringant (despite he died in... 2005) are not anymore Members of the Board of Cascades Duffel NV. Both have been replaced in May 2009 by M. Jean Goulet (General Manager of Cascades SAS / France) and by M. Zaki Haned (Investor Relations Manager at Reno De Medici). But if Cascades Duffel NV was "liquidated" with immediate effect the 28/12/2011, the "story" seems not finished yet......

Expansion[edit]
The 80's decade played out in a spirit of innovation with the creation of a Research and Development Center in 1985 in Kingsey Falls. The facility became the largest private Canadian Research and Development Center in the pulp and paper industry.
On the eve of the nineties decade, Cascades became daring when it created Cascades Énergie. This subsidiary controlled a brand new cogeneration plant powered by natural gas, the first in Canada, and whose mandate was to provide the energy required by all the Cascades mills in Kingsey Falls. The success of this project enabled Cascades to invest further in the prospective energy sector with the acquisition of Boralex in 1995. Today, Boralex's shares are traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange in which Cascades holds a 34% interest.
Cascades Énergie paved the way for a series of acquisitions in which Cascades' activities were largely diversified. The purchase of Rolland and Paperboard Industries Corporation in 1992, Perkins Papers in 1995, Provincial Papers in 1997 and, that same year, the creation of Norampac in partnership with Domtar, led to the restructuring of Cascades into five distinct corporate groups whose operations were focused as much in the sector of specialized packaging as in those of containerboard, tissue paper, fine papers and boxboard.
On an international level, Cascades' expansion continued in Europe with the acquisition of the boxboard mill in Arnsberg (Germany) in 1997 and the start-up of a sheeting operation in Wednesbury (England) in 1998.
Upon entering the new millennium, the scope of the tissue paper sector grew in 2001 with the acquisition of the mills in Pennsylvania and in Wisconsin. Two years later, the group sustained its momentum and set up shop in Alberta, in New York, in Arizona, in Oregon and in Tennessee. In 2004, the boxboard sector stood out with the acquisition of Dopaco Inc., a leader in the packaging products sector destined for the quick service restaurant industry. Not to be left out, Norampac proceeded with the implementation, between 2001 and 2006, of several ultra-modern corrugated cardboard mills in Canada and in the United States.
In 2004, Cascades created in Europe four new companies in Luxembourg (Cascades Luxembourg Sarl, Norampac Luxembourg Sarl, Cascades Hungary Ltd Luxembourg Branch and Norampac Ltd Luxembourg Branch). Beginning of 2010 Cascades Canada Inc Luxembourg Branch was created, and with the closure of Cascade(s) Duffel NV in Belgium, the closure of Norampac Ltd Luxembourg Branch and the existing Pulp & Paper Cascades NV (become BV ?) in the Netherlands, that carries to four the number of companies in service in 2012 into the Benelux without any co-worker who works on it(Norampac Luxembourg Sarl was closed in September 2008 by incorporation into Cascades Luxembourg Sarl (new capital February 2012: USD 64 933 600,00 ) and beginning of February 2012, Cascades Canada Inc Luxemburg Branch changed her name to Cascades Canada ULC Luxembourg Branch.
Challenges[edit]
An appreciating Canadian dollar, an increase in energy prices and the cost of fibre, fierce competition: the 2000s also provided challenges for Cascades, which forced it to implement a significant rationalization plan. This process resulted in, the closure of mills in Thunder Bay, Montréal, Red Rock, Pickering, Buffalo and Boissy le Chatel. In 2005, the company proceeded with the sale of its fine papers (Cascades Resources) and its tissue paper (Wood Wyant) distribution assets.
With the purchase of Domtar's shares in Norampac in 2006 and the merger of its European boxboard operations with Reno de Medici in 2007, Cascade has consolidated its position as a leader in the containerboard and boxboard sectors.
In 2008, North-American boxboard activities were integrated into Norampac's cartonboard activities. In addition to creating synergy, this integration allowed better sharing of technology and led to the creation of a larger packaging group to meet the needs of clients in Canada and the United States.

Cascades also demonstrates that it understands that only innovation and the marketing of environmentally sound products will guarantee its future success.

Cascades is a member of the Forest Products Association of Canada.

                                Fire Causes Temporary Shut Down Of Greenpac And Norampac Niagara Falls Containerboard Mills
            


            September 24, 2014
        




Cascades has announced the temporary shutdown of the Greenpac and Norampac Niagara Falls containerboard mills following a fire that occurred on Saturday September 20, 2014, in the old corrugated containers (OCC) stock piles located outside of the mills. Both mills were quickly evacuated with no injuries to personnel. The causes of the fire are currently unknown, but local authorities are investigating to determine the potential causes of this event.

                                Worm bin composting system
            


            December 10, 2008
        






















Worm Factory and Worm Box composting systems utilize Red Wiggler worms and an upward migration concept to power their operation. This is a tackable, multi-tray composting worm bin system whereby worms start by eating kitchen and paper scraps in the lowest tray. When food in the lower tray is exhausted, the worms migrate upward to find the next food source, effectively separating worms from finished compost. Single trays and up to five-tray models are available.

                                Worm bin composting system
            


            August 19, 2008
        






















Worm composting is a highly efficient way to convert kitchen scraps, junk mail and cardboard into nutrient-rich compost for gardens. The Worm Factory and the Worm Box both utilize Red Wiggler worms and an upward migration concept to power their operation. This is a tack-able, multi-tray composting worm bin system whereby worms start by eating kitchen and paper scraps in the lowest tray. When food in the lower tray is exhausted, the worms migrate upward to find the next food source. By allowing worms to migrate upward, this system effectively separates worms from finished compost, which is then ready for plants and gardens. Gravity also pulls water down through the system, dragging nutrient-rich particles with it. This liquid fertilizer (“worm tea”) gathers in the collection tray where it is easily drained using a spigot. Plus, a ventilation lid allows proper ventilation for year round, odour free production, which makes these com-posters ideal for indoor or outdoor use.

                                Oxo-degradable containers
            


            December 19, 2007
        






















Bioxo is a line of containers made from totally oxo-degradable polystyrene foam. Bioxo containers are specifically designed to degrade within three years, unlike traditional polystyrene foam containers which can require several hundred years to degrade. Bioxo is the result of the addition of TDPA (Totally Degradable Plastic Additives), developed by the Vancouver-based firm, Environmental Technologies Inc. (EPI). TDPA technology is designed to speed up the oxidation/biodegradation process by fractioning large molecules in plastic into smaller, more easily degraded molecules. Additives are mixed into basic plastic resins at the time of manufacture to give them specific degradation properties, without compromising safety or utility.

Innovative solutions for your outdoor adventures.

Our Brands



1327 products across 96 distinct categories 




For 45 years, the MSR brand has stood for cutting-edge backcountry-gear engineering. Our passionate fusion of mountaineering and engineering has led to a succession of groundbreaking products—from stoves, tents and snowshoes to cookware and water filters—that have revolutionized the outdoor industry. That’s why MSR gear has been taken on expeditions around the world, standing up, time and time again, to some of the most demanding situations imaginable.  




MSR Global Health is a leading innovator and manufacturer of low-cost, field-proven technologies to improve access to basic human needs for people living in low-resource settings around the globe. 




Since we invented the very first self-inflating camping mattress in 1972, Therm-a-Rest has been committed to creating the finest portable outdoor comfort solutions for every kind of adventure. Our product offerings represent the leading edge of innovation across mattresses, sleeping bags, cots, pillows, hammocks, seating and more, with the majority of it still made in Seattle, USA, where it all began over 40 years ago. However you enjoy the outdoors, having Therm-a-Rest comfort along for the ride makes it better.  




Ask any Platypus. They’ll tell you that staying hydrated can mean the difference between an average day and an unforgettable day. That’s why we developed the original collapsible, taste- and BPA-free hydration systems—for people living life to its fullest. Our complete line of reservoirs, bottles, water filters and accessories are performance-tested to ensure the highest quality, offering exceptional versatility and the rare opportunity to Taste Freedom.  




You can depend on SealLine portable bags, packs, cases and accessories to keep your gear protected anywhere—from the urban jungle to farthest reaches of the globe. SealLine products are made of the highest-quality waterproof fabrics, and our proprietary RF-welding skills are unmatched in the industry. The result is unquestionable gear protection to help you survive the world’s most challenging environments  




When you need to dry off quickly, PackTowl has you covered. Light, packable and highly absorbent, our PackTowl towels wring dry and are ready to go again quickly. Originally developed to liberate backpackers, kayakers and travelers from carrying around a heavy, wet towel, our PackTowl products are superabsorbent and soft to the touch. They offer you the performance you need for an active lifestyle. Simply wring it, reuse it and get on with your adventure.  





Cascade Designs, Inc. began over 40 years ago with the simple idea of providing a more comfortable night outdoors. Since then, we have grown to become the parent company of some of the most respected brands in the outdoor industry. Though much has changed with this success, our recipe for achieving it has not. We believe that manufacturing the majority of our gear in our U.S. and European facilities is an essential element in maintaining quality, and that by striving to exceed our customers’ expectations of service, we will be successful for many years to come.

Cascades is a company that produces, converts, and markets packaging and tissue products composed mainly of recycled fibres. Cascades employs more than 11,000 people in more than 100 operating units in North America and Europe. It was founded in 1964.

History[edit]
The Lemaire family founded the Drummond Pulp & Fibre company in 1957 which is involved in the recovery of household and industrial waste.
In 1964, Antonio Lemaire and his sons officially ventured into the production of paper made from recycled fibres when they took over a disaffected mill in Kingsey Falls,(Quebec), owned by the Dominion Paper Co.. Papier Cascades Inc. was born of that transaction.
In 1971, Cascades began its expansion in Kingsey Falls with the creation of Cascades Forma-Pak, its first moulded-pulp mill to use 100% recycled fibres. The event marked the beginning of a veritable paper-making corporation in a small town in the center of Québec from 1972 to 1977: the successive start-up of Papier Kingsey Falls (multi-layer board), Cascades Industries (tissue paper), Plastiques Cascades and Cascades Conversion.
In 1976, the Lemaire brothers "brought their skill and knowledge" outside Kingsey Falls for the first time with the start-up of the containerboard mill Papier Cascades in Cabano (Québec). This was the beginning of a great adventure that would bring Cascades all over the world.
In 1983 Cascades' shares began trading on the Montreal Stock Exchange. That same year, its entry into the United States began with the start-up of Cascades Industries Inc. in Rockingham, North Carolina. In Québec, Cascades began producing kraft paper in East Angus and acquired a boxboard plant in Joncquière the following year.
In 1985, the company made its entry into Europe with the acquisition of a boxboard plant in La Rochette, France. This new expansion took shape in 1986 with the creation of Cascades S.A. and the acquisition of another French boxboard mill in Blendecques. From 1987 to 1989, other mills located in Sweden and Belgium became part of the Cascades Group as well: Djupafors AB in Sweden and Kartonfabriek van Duffel NV in Belgium. The Belgian mill was renamed Cascades Duffel NV but ceased its production in 1993 after heavy losses and then was immediately transformed into a cutting center for the other European mills of the group. Declared definitively closed in the accounts of 1997, it was reconverted in 2002 by the ex-President of the Board of Cascades, Laurent Lemaire, to a so-called internal commercial agency, under the name with slightly modified orthography of Cascade Duffel NV, and having only one unit of establishment called Korton Fabrick van Ouffel, located at the exact address of the old mill Kartonfabriek van Duffel which was resold by Cascades to another company in 1998. This so-called agency (before different fiscal controles ...), without collaborator working in Belgium, was implied at the time of exports of cartonboard out of Europe, in particular those in transit by the port of Antwerp (according to Boards of directors of Cascades SA of June 28, 2002 and Nov 3, 2003). Since 2009, M. Stephane Thiollier and M. Vincent Lestringant (despite he died in... 2005) are not anymore Members of the Board of Cascades Duffel NV. Both have been replaced in May 2009 by M. Jean Goulet (General Manager of Cascades SAS / France) and by M. Zaki Haned (Investor Relations Manager at Reno De Medici). But if Cascades Duffel NV was "liquidated" with immediate effect the 28/12/2011, the "story" seems not finished yet......
(see also the 4 last "external links" below...)
Expansion[edit]
The 80's decade played out in a spirit of innovation with the creation of a Research and Development Center in 1985 in Kingsey Falls. The facility became the largest private Canadian Research and Development Center in the pulp and paper industry.
On the eve of the nineties decade, Cascades became daring when it created Cascades Énergie. This subsidiary controlled a brand new cogeneration plant powered by natural gas, the first in Canada, and whose mandate was to provide the energy required by all the Cascades mills in Kingsey Falls. The success of this project enabled Cascades to invest further in the prospective energy sector with the acquisition of Boralex in 1995. Today, Boralex's shares are traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange in which Cascades holds a 34% interest.
Cascades Énergie paved the way for a series of acquisitions in which Cascades' activities were largely diversified. The purchase of Rolland and Paperboard Industries Corporation in 1992, Perkins Papers in 1995, Provincial Papers in 1997 and, that same year, the creation of Norampac in partnership with Domtar, led to the restructuring of Cascades into five distinct corporate groups whose operations were focused as much in the sector of specialized packaging as in those of containerboard, tissue paper, fine papers and boxboard.
On an international level, Cascades' expansion continued in Europe with the acquisition of the boxboard mill in Arnsberg (Germany) in 1997 and the start-up of a sheeting operation in Wednesbury (England) in 1998.
Upon entering the new millennium, the scope of the tissue paper sector grew in 2001 with the acquisition of the mills in Pennsylvania and in Wisconsin. Two years later, the group sustained its momentum and set up shop in Alberta, in New York, in Arizona, in Oregon and in Tennessee. In 2004, the boxboard sector stood out with the acquisition of Dopaco Inc., a leader in the packaging products sector destined for the quick service restaurant industry. Not to be left out, Norampac proceeded with the implementation, between 2001 and 2006, of several ultra-modern corrugated cardboard mills in Canada and in the United States.
In 2004, Cascades created in Europe four new companies in Luxembourg (Cascades Luxembourg Sarl, Norampac Luxembourg Sarl, Cascades Hungary Ltd Luxembourg Branch and Norampac Ltd Luxembourg Branch). Beginning of 2010 Cascades Canada Inc Luxembourg Branch was created, and with the closure of Cascade(s) Duffel NV in Belgium, the closure of Norampac Ltd Luxembourg Branch and the existing Pulp & Paper Cascades NV (become BV ?) in the Netherlands, that carries to four the number of companies in service in 2012 into the Benelux without any co-worker who works on it(Norampac Luxembourg Sarl was closed in September 2008 by incorporation into Cascades Luxembourg Sarl (new capital February 2012: USD 64 933 600,00 ) and beginning of February 2012, Cascades Canada Inc Luxemburg Branch changed her name to Cascades Canada ULC Luxembourg Branch.
Challenges[edit]
An appreciating Canadian dollar, an increase in energy prices and the cost of fibre, fierce competition: the 2000s also provided challenges for Cascades, which forced it to implement a significant rationalization plan. This process resulted in, the closure of mills in Thunder Bay, Montréal, Red Rock, Pickering, Buffalo and Boissy le Chatel. In 2005, the company proceeded with the sale of its fine papers (Cascades Resources) and its tissue paper (Wood Wyant) distribution assets.
With the purchase of Domtar's shares in Norampac in 2006 and the merger of its European boxboard operations with Reno de Medici in 2007, Cascade has consolidated its position as a leader in the containerboard and boxboard sectors.
In 2008, North-American boxboard activities were integrated into Norampac's cartonboard activities. In addition to creating synergy, this integration allowed better sharing of technology and led to the creation of a larger packaging group to meet the needs of clients in Canada and the United States.
In 2011, Cascades named Mario Plourde Chief Operating Officer, enabling Alain Lemaire, President and Chief Executive Officer, to devote more time to the strategic vision of the company. Also in 2011, Cascades sold Dopaco Inc., its paper cup and carton converting business for the quick-service restaurant and foodservice industries, to Reynolds Group Holdings Limited. Net proceeds from the transaction will mainly be used to pay down Cascades' debt.
In keeping with its origins but definitely being forward-looking, Cascades is banking on its products that contain a high percentage of recycled fibres to distinguish itself from the competition, while remaining committed to the principles of sustainable development that is so dear to its corporate philosophy. Cascades also demonstrates that it understands that only innovation and the marketing of environmentally sound products will guarantee its future success.
In October 2008, Cascades was named one of "Canada's Top 100 Employers" by Mediacorp Canada Inc., and was featured in Maclean's newsmagazine.[2]
The company is not related to American paper company Boise Cascade.
Cascades is a member of the Forest Products Association of Canada.

History[edit]
The Lemaire family founded the Drummond Pulp & Fibre company in 1957 which is involved in the recovery of household and industrial waste.
In 1964, Antonio Lemaire and his sons officially ventured into the production of paper made from recycled fibres when they took over a disaffected mill in Kingsey Falls,(Quebec), owned by the Dominion Paper Co.. Papier Cascades Inc. was born of that transaction.
In 1971, Cascades began its expansion in Kingsey Falls with the creation of Cascades Forma-Pak, its first moulded-pulp mill to use 100% recycled fibres. The event marked the beginning of a veritable paper-making corporation in a small town in the center of Québec from 1972 to 1977: the successive start-up of Papier Kingsey Falls (multi-layer board), Cascades Industries (tissue paper), Plastiques Cascades and Cascades Conversion.
In 1976, the Lemaire brothers "brought their skill and knowledge" outside Kingsey Falls for the first time with the start-up of the containerboard mill Papier Cascades in Cabano (Québec). This was the beginning of a great adventure that would bring Cascades all over the world.
In 1983 Cascades' shares began trading on the Montreal Stock Exchange. That same year, its entry into the United States began with the start-up of Cascades Industries Inc. in Rockingham, North Carolina. In Québec, Cascades began producing kraft paper in East Angus and acquired a boxboard plant in Joncquière the following year.
In 1985, the company made its entry into Europe with the acquisition of a boxboard plant in La Rochette, France. This new expansion took shape in 1986 with the creation of Cascades S.A. and the acquisition of another French boxboard mill in Blendecques. From 1987 to 1989, other mills located in Sweden and Belgium became part of the Cascades Group as well: Djupafors AB in Sweden and Kartonfabriek van Duffel NV in Belgium. The Belgian mill was renamed Cascades Duffel NV but ceased its production in 1993 after heavy losses and then was immediately transformed into a cutting center for the other European mills of the group. Declared definitively closed in the accounts of 1997, it was reconverted in 2002 by the ex-President of the Board of Cascades, Laurent Lemaire, to a so-called internal commercial agency, under the name with slightly modified orthography of Cascade Duffel NV, and having only one unit of establishment called Korton Fabrick van Ouffel, located at the exact address of the old mill Kartonfabriek van Duffel which was resold by Cascades to another company in 1998. This so-called agency (before different fiscal controles ...), without collaborator working in Belgium, was implied at the time of exports of cartonboard out of Europe, in particular those in transit by the port of Antwerp (according to Boards of directors of Cascades SA of June 28, 2002 and Nov 3, 2003). Since 2009, M. Stephane Thiollier and M. Vincent Lestringant (despite he died in... 2005) are not anymore Members of the Board of Cascades Duffel NV. Both have been replaced in May 2009 by M. Jean Goulet (General Manager of Cascades SAS / France) and by M. Zaki Haned (Investor Relations Manager at Reno De Medici). But if Cascades Duffel NV was "liquidated" with immediate effect the 28/12/2011, the "story" seems not finished yet......

Expansion[edit]
The 80's decade played out in a spirit of innovation with the creation of a Research and Development Center in 1985 in Kingsey Falls. The facility became the largest private Canadian Research and Development Center in the pulp and paper industry.
On the eve of the nineties decade, Cascades became daring when it created Cascades Énergie. This subsidiary controlled a brand new cogeneration plant powered by natural gas, the first in Canada, and whose mandate was to provide the energy required by all the Cascades mills in Kingsey Falls. The success of this project enabled Cascades to invest further in the prospective energy sector with the acquisition of Boralex in 1995. Today, Boralex's shares are traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange in which Cascades holds a 34% interest.
Cascades Énergie paved the way for a series of acquisitions in which Cascades' activities were largely diversified. The purchase of Rolland and Paperboard Industries Corporation in 1992, Perkins Papers in 1995, Provincial Papers in 1997 and, that same year, the creation of Norampac in partnership with Domtar, led to the restructuring of Cascades into five distinct corporate groups whose operations were focused as much in the sector of specialized packaging as in those of containerboard, tissue paper, fine papers and boxboard.
On an international level, Cascades' expansion continued in Europe with the acquisition of the boxboard mill in Arnsberg (Germany) in 1997 and the start-up of a sheeting operation in Wednesbury (England) in 1998.
Upon entering the new millennium, the scope of the tissue paper sector grew in 2001 with the acquisition of the mills in Pennsylvania and in Wisconsin. Two years later, the group sustained its momentum and set up shop in Alberta, in New York, in Arizona, in Oregon and in Tennessee. In 2004, the boxboard sector stood out with the acquisition of Dopaco Inc., a leader in the packaging products sector destined for the quick service restaurant industry. Not to be left out, Norampac proceeded with the implementation, between 2001 and 2006, of several ultra-modern corrugated cardboard mills in Canada and in the United States.
In 2004, Cascades created in Europe four new companies in Luxembourg (Cascades Luxembourg Sarl, Norampac Luxembourg Sarl, Cascades Hungary Ltd Luxembourg Branch and Norampac Ltd Luxembourg Branch). Beginning of 2010 Cascades Canada Inc Luxembourg Branch was created, and with the closure of Cascade(s) Duffel NV in Belgium, the closure of Norampac Ltd Luxembourg Branch and the existing Pulp & Paper Cascades NV (become BV ?) in the Netherlands, that carries to four the number of companies in service in 2012 into the Benelux without any co-worker who works on it(Norampac Luxembourg Sarl was closed in September 2008 by incorporation into Cascades Luxembourg Sarl (new capital February 2012: USD 64 933 600,00 ) and beginning of February 2012, Cascades Canada Inc Luxemburg Branch changed her name to Cascades Canada ULC Luxembourg Branch.
Challenges[edit]
An appreciating Canadian dollar, an increase in energy prices and the cost of fibre, fierce competition: the 2000s also provided challenges for Cascades, which forced it to implement a significant rationalization plan. This process resulted in, the closure of mills in Thunder Bay, Montréal, Red Rock, Pickering, Buffalo and Boissy le Chatel. In 2005, the company proceeded with the sale of its fine papers (Cascades Resources) and its tissue paper (Wood Wyant) distribution assets.
With the purchase of Domtar's shares in Norampac in 2006 and the merger of its European boxboard operations with Reno de Medici in 2007, Cascade has consolidated its position as a leader in the containerboard and boxboard sectors.
In 2008, North-American boxboard activities were integrated into Norampac's cartonboard activities. In addition to creating synergy, this integration allowed better sharing of technology and led to the creation of a larger packaging group to meet the needs of clients in Canada and the United States.
In 2011, Cascades named Mario Plourde Chief Operating Officer, enabling Alain Lemaire, President and Chief Executive Officer, to devote more time to the strategic vision of the company. Also in 2011, Cascades sold Dopaco Inc., its paper cup and carton converting business for the quick-service restaurant and foodservice industries, to Reynolds Group Holdings Limited. Net proceeds from the transaction will mainly be used to pay down Cascades' debt.
In keeping with its origins but definitely being forward-looking, Cascades is banking on its products that contain a high percentage of recycled fibres to distinguish itself from the competition, while remaining committed to the principles of sustainable development that is so dear to its corporate philosophy. Cascades also demonstrates that it understands that only innovation and the marketing of environmentally sound products will guarantee its future success.
In October 2008, Cascades was named one of "Canada's Top 100 Employers" by Mediacorp Canada Inc., and was featured in Maclean's newsmagazine.[2]
The company is not related to American paper company Boise Cascade.
Cascades is a member of the Forest Products Association of Canada.

Declared definitively closed in the accounts of 1997, it was reconverted in 2002 by the ex-President of the Board of Cascades, Laurent Lemaire, to a so-called internal commercial agency, under the name with slightly modified orthography of Cascade Duffel NV, and having only one unit of establishment called Korton Fabrick van Ouffel, located at the exact address of the old mill Kartonfabriek van Duffel which was resold by Cascades to another company in 1998. This so-called agency (before different fiscal controles ...), without collaborator working in Belgium, was implied at the time of exports of cartonboard out of Europe, in particular those in transit by the port of Antwerp (according to Boards of directors of Cascades SA of June 28, 2002 and Nov 3, 2003). Since 2009, M. Stephane Thiollier and M. Vincent Lestringant (despite he died in... 2005) are not anymore Members of the Board of Cascades Duffel NV. Both have been replaced in May 2009 by M. Jean Goulet (General Manager of Cascades SAS / France) and by M. Zaki Haned (Investor Relations Manager at Reno De Medici). But if Cascades Duffel NV was "liquidated" with immediate effect the 28/12/2011, the "story" seems not finished yet......

Expansion[edit]
The 80's decade played out in a spirit of innovation with the creation of a Research and Development Center in 1985 in Kingsey Falls. The facility became the largest private Canadian Research and Development Center in the pulp and paper industry.
On the eve of the nineties decade, Cascades became daring when it created Cascades Énergie. This subsidiary controlled a brand new cogeneration plant powered by natural gas, the first in Canada, and whose mandate was to provide the energy required by all the Cascades mills in Kingsey Falls. The success of this project enabled Cascades to invest further in the prospective energy sector with the acquisition of Boralex in 1995. Today, Boralex's shares are traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange in which Cascades holds a 34% interest.
Cascades Énergie paved the way for a series of acquisitions in which Cascades' activities were largely diversified. The purchase of Rolland and Paperboard Industries Corporation in 1992, Perkins Papers in 1995, Provincial Papers in 1997 and, that same year, the creation of Norampac in partnership with Domtar, led to the restructuring of Cascades into five distinct corporate groups whose operations were focused as much in the sector of specialized packaging as in those of containerboard, tissue paper, fine papers and boxboard.
On an international level, Cascades' expansion continued in Europe with the acquisition of the boxboard mill in Arnsberg (Germany) in 1997 and the start-up of a sheeting operation in Wednesbury (England) in 1998.
Upon entering the new millennium, the scope of the tissue paper sector grew in 2001 with the acquisition of the mills in Pennsylvania and in Wisconsin. Two years later, the group sustained its momentum and set up shop in Alberta, in New York, in Arizona, in Oregon and in Tennessee. In 2004, the boxboard sector stood out with the acquisition of Dopaco Inc., a leader in the packaging products sector destined for the quick service restaurant industry. Not to be left out, Norampac proceeded with the implementation, between 2001 and 2006, of several ultra-modern corrugated cardboard mills in Canada and in the United States.
In 2004, Cascades created in Europe four new companies in Luxembourg (Cascades Luxembourg Sarl, Norampac Luxembourg Sarl, Cascades Hungary Ltd Luxembourg Branch and Norampac Ltd Luxembourg Branch). Beginning of 2010 Cascades Canada Inc Luxembourg Branch was created, and with the closure of Cascade(s) Duffel NV in Belgium, the closure of Norampac Ltd Luxembourg Branch and the existing Pulp & Paper Cascades NV (become BV ?) in the Netherlands, that carries to four the number of companies in service in 2012 into the Benelux without any co-worker who works on it(Norampac Luxembourg Sarl was closed in September 2008 by incorporation into Cascades Luxembourg Sarl (new capital February 2012: USD 64 933 600,00 ) and beginning of February 2012, Cascades Canada Inc Luxemburg Branch changed her name to Cascades Canada ULC Luxembourg Branch.
Challenges[edit]
An appreciating Canadian dollar, an increase in energy prices and the cost of fibre, fierce competition: the 2000s also provided challenges for Cascades, which forced it to implement a significant rationalization plan. This process resulted in, the closure of mills in Thunder Bay, Montréal, Red Rock, Pickering, Buffalo and Boissy le Chatel. In 2005, the company proceeded with the sale of its fine papers (Cascades Resources) and its tissue paper (Wood Wyant) distribution assets.
With the purchase of Domtar's shares in Norampac in 2006 and the merger of its European boxboard operations with Reno de Medici in 2007, Cascade has consolidated its position as a leader in the containerboard and boxboard sectors.
In 2008, North-American boxboard activities were integrated into Norampac's cartonboard activities. In addition to creating synergy, this integration allowed better sharing of technology and led to the creation of a larger packaging group to meet the needs of clients in Canada and the United States.
In 2011, Cascades named Mario Plourde Chief Operating Officer, enabling Alain Lemaire, President and Chief Executive Officer, to devote more time to the strategic vision of the company. Also in 2011, Cascades sold Dopaco Inc., its paper cup and carton converting business for the quick-service restaurant and foodservice industries, to Reynolds Group Holdings Limited. Net proceeds from the transaction will mainly be used to pay down Cascades' debt.
In keeping with its origins but definitely being forward-looking, Cascades is banking on its products that contain a high percentage of recycled fibres to distinguish itself from the competition, while remaining committed to the principles of sustainable development that is so dear to its corporate philosophy. Cascades also demonstrates that it understands that only innovation and the marketing of environmentally sound products will guarantee its future success.
In October 2008, Cascades was named one of "Canada's Top 100 Employers" by Mediacorp Canada Inc., and was featured in Maclean's newsmagazine.[2]
The company is not related to American paper company Boise Cascade.
Cascades is a member of the Forest Products Association of Canada.
