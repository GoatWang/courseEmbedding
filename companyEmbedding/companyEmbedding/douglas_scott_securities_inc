Mr. Mann was also deeply involved with the West Black Bay (3 years) where Gulf Oil (the operator) was forced to drill several wells on the joint property adding 2 to 3 million barrels of oil to field reserves.

He is a 1955 graduate of the University of Oklahoma with a Bachelor of Science degree in Geology and received a Master of Science degree in Geology from the same institution in 1957.

                                    Over 17 billion TP tubes are used each year. That's enough to fill the Empire State Building, twice. How many of those belong to your household? Answer two quick questions to see how many TP tubes you'll eliminate by tossing the tube for good.

WHY TOSS THE TUBE FOR GOOD?
                                

Enough TP tubes are used each year to fill the Empire State Building, twice. With Scott® Tube-Free Toilet Paper, you can get premium softness without the wasteful tube.
