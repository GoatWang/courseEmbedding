The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Ask a lot of questions now, so you won't have unexpected answers later.Find a home design professional on Houzz. Narrow down your search by type of professional and location.

				Rumpl incorporates decades of proven technologies developed for the outdoor industry into our products. The materials have been tested and proven in harsh environments, yet specifically selected for comfort and durability. We believe the blanket you use everyday deserves the same attention to detail as a sleeping bag you might use 10 times a year. The end result is a premium and versatile blanket that can be used anywhere you go... or when you don't go anywhere.

Planning a spa makeover for your bathroom? Creating a luxurious bath retreat can be as simple as buying some new bath linens, soft fluffy towels and bath accessories. Whether or not you have the budget for a brand-new tub, there is plenty you can do to refresh your bathroom visually and make it more functional. Here are some related professionals and vendors to complement the work of bedding & bath: Home Stagers, Kitchen & Bath Designers, Interior Designers & Decorators, Furniture & Accessories.One of the most common problems in bathrooms is lack of storage space. Buying a bathroom vanity at your local building supply store may be the answer, but for more challenging storage solutions, you’ll want to contact a San Francisco, CA bedding and bath manufacturer or retailer that specializes in custom storage options and unique bathroom furniture and accessories.From heated towel bars to shower curtains, use the Houzz Professionals listings to find San Francisco, CA bedding and bath retailers with budget-friendly bathware and modern bath accessories. Some bathroom remodelers specialize in affordable equipment like grab bars, safety tubs and showers and other bathroom accessories designed for those with different physical needs. Does your bathroom need converting or upgrading for special needs?Is it time to wake up your master bedroom with some new bed linens? Since that very first white sale in Philadelphia’s John Wanamaker and Co. department store in 1878, January has always been a good month to buy bed linens. Those looking for hand-crafted custom bedding and draperies can find a San Francisco, CA company that makes and sells quality bed products. Many bed and bath retail outlets sell a smaller selection of exclusive brands. Professional Categories in San Francisco

GREATEST BLANKET OF ALL TIME 

Curtis 
						on
						Jun 09, 2016



I got the throw size for my girlfriend and the twin size for myself and I must say, this blanket has come in handy so many times! We use it at the beach, in our hammocks, on the couch, as an added blanket on the bed and even camping under the stars in Joshua Tree! I was in Joshua Tree for 1 night (probably only got down to 60 degrees at night) but I only needed this blanket and it kept me warm all night even without the rain fly on my tent. I can only imagine how awesome a Queen or Kind size would be. My life would be complete with one of those bad boys!











GREAT BLANKET! GREAT GREAT!

I had the jam puffy in throw size, and as soon as I saw this released I bought it. It's the only blanket I sleep with on my bed now. No sheet or anything. The fact the material stays cool is a huge plus for me, I tend to sleep hot and it's frustrating because I love to be warm, but also not wake up sweating like a whore in church. This blanket is phenomenal and exceeded my expectations. I'll take it everywhere.

HIGH PERFORMANCE    BLANKETSUsing Materials Designed for the Outdoor Industry


Rumpl incorporates decades of proven technologies developed for the outdoor industry into our products. The materials have been tested and proven in harsh environments, yet specifically selected for comfort and durability. We believe the blanket you use everyday deserves the same attention to detail as a sleeping bag you might use 10 times a year. The end result is a premium and versatile blanket that can be used anywhere you go... ...or when you don't go anywhere.
