Investments in bonds and other debt securities will change in value based on changes in interest rates. If rates rise, the value of these investments generally drops.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Diversification does not guarantee investment returns and does not eliminate the risk of loss.
Bonds are subject to interest rate risks. Bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise.
The price of equity securities may rise or fall because of changes in the broad market or changes in a company's financial condition, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Equity securities are subject to "stock market risk" meaning that stock prices in general may decline over short or extended periods of time.
International investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility. Changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the U.S. can raise or lower returns. Also, some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the United States and other nations. Investments in emerging markets can be more volatile.
Real estate investments may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry, sector or geographical sector. Real estate investments may be subject to risks including, but not limited to, declines in the value of real estate, risks related to general and economic conditions, changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower.
Investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities, particularly if the instruments involve leverage. The value of commodity-linked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements, commodity index volatility, changes in interest rates, or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity, such as drought, floods, weather, livestock disease, embargoes, tariffs and international economic, political and regulatory developments. Use of leveraged commodity-linked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but, at the same time, creates the possibility for greater loss. 
Derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses that significantly exceed the original investment. The use of derivatives may not be successful, resulting in investment losses, and the cost of such strategies may reduce investment returns.
There is no guarantee that the use of long and short positions will succeed in limiting an investor's exposure to domestic stock market movements, capitalization, sector swings or other risk factors. Investing using long and short selling strategies may have higher portfolio turnover rates. Short selling involves certain risks, including additional costs associated with covering short positions and a possibility of unlimited loss on certain short sale positions.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its affiliates do not provide tax advice. Accordingly, any discussion of U.S. tax matters contained herein (including any attachments) is not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used, in connection with the promotion, marketing or recommendation by anyone unaffiliated with JPMorgan Chase & Co. of any of the matters addressed herein or for the purpose of avoiding U.S. tax-related penalties.

DON’T LET YOUR CLIENTS' MONEY RUN OUT

Your clients are living longer, and many of them haven't saved enough. Use our Principles for Successful Long-Term Investing to talk to them about this reality, and to help them be prepared.
ACCESS ALL 7 PRINCIPLES







 














We are living longer

Thanks to advances in medicine and healthier lifestyles, people who are 65 today have a very good chance of reaching ages 80 or 90. A 65-year-old couple might be surprised to learn that at least one of them has a 48% probability of living another 25 years and needing investments to last until age 90.

	 

Many of us have not saved enough

Studies reveal that individuals do not feel adequately prepared for retirement. Investors should start early by saving more, investing with discipline and having a plan for their future.

			Tax-Exempt Municipal Debt Funds
			


		About Tax-Exempt Municipal Debt

		Tax-exempt municipal bonds are debt issued by a state, city, or other municipality for general governmental needs or to finance special
		projects. These municipal bonds pay interest that is free from regular federal income tax, and state-specific bonds can provide residents
		of those states with income free from state and, in some cases, local income taxes as well.* Tax-exempt municipal bonds can be an
		advantageous alternative to taxable investments, particularly for investors in higher tax brackets. To make a fair comparison between
		a tax-free investment like a municipal bond and a taxable investment, one should adjust the tax-free investment's yield to account
		for money saved in regular federal, and sometimes state, income tax.
	

* Interest on out-of-state bonds and dividends paid by national funds may be subject to state and local taxes. Income may also be
			subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax.



				About Nuveen Tax-Exempt Municipal Debt Closed-End Funds

				Nuveen offers several national tax-exempt municipal bond closed-end funds, and as well as state-specific funds focusing 15 different states. Municipal Closed-End
				Funds can potentially help you balance your desire for income and growth by:

Meeting current expenses with monthly tax-free income;
Potentially realizing attractive, long-term, after-tax total returns;
Diversifying your income portfolio;
Reducing the amount of your investment income subject to taxes.

				You can see you would need to earn much more from a taxable investment to match a municipal bond's after-tax yield. For instance,
				if your fund is yielding 5.00% tax-free and your tax rate is
				28%, you would need a taxable investment to yield 6.94% to match the same after-tax cash flow. 
			

This chart is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to reflect past or predict future performance 
				for any particular investment. They do not take into account the effects of the federal alternative minimum tax (AMT) 
				or capital gains taxes.  This information is general in nature and should not be considered tax advice.  
				Nuveen is not a tax advisor and investors should consult with a qualified tax consultant as to their particular 
				situation.






						Investor Profile

						Are these CEFs right for you?

						The features and investment objectives of these funds might be especially appealing to investors seeking:


							Potential for attractive, monthly tax-free income

							Diversification of a portfolio otherwise comprised of taxable fixed-income
							and equity securities

							Reduction of the amount of investment income subject to taxes.


						What are potential risks?


							Municipal bond fund income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will
							be subject to capital gains tax.

							Municipal bonds are subject to interest rate risk, or the risk
							that the bonds will decline in value because of changes in market interest rates.

							Municipal bonds are also subject to call risk, and credit risk.

The performance quoted represents past performance, which is no indication of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted. Returns shown at net asset value have all distributions reinvested. If a sales charge had been deducted, the results would have been lower. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that shares, on any given day or when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Therefore, there can be no assurance of future results.

						Expense Ratioas of 06/30/2017











Expense ratio details, Click here.

The net expense ratio takes into account contractual fee waivers/expense reimbursements that currently are scheduled to remain in place through 02/28/2018. For periods when fees and expenses were waived and/or reimbursed, the Fund benefited by not bearing such expenses.  Without such fee waivers/reimbursements, performance would have been lower.

Returns with sales charges reflect a maximum sales charge of 5.75%.





The performance quoted represents past performance, which is no indication of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted. Returns shown include the reinvestment of all distributions. Returns shown at net asset value do not reflect the current maximum sales charge, had the sales charge been included, returns would have been lower. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that shares, on any given day or when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Therefore, there can be no assurance of future results.

Market Capitalization Breakdown - Morningstar separates stock portfolio holdings into five market-capitalization groups: Giant, Large, Mid, Small, and Micro. Of the 5000 largest domestic stocks in their equities database, the top 1% are categorized as Giant, the next 4% are Large, the next 15% are Mid, the next 30% are Small, and the remaining 50% are Micro. Stocks outside of the largest 5000 are also classified as Micro.




 
Weighted Average Market Cap - The average market capitalization of all companies held in the portfolio with each company weighted according to its percent held in the portfolio. The result is based upon a weighted average of the securities held in the fund.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                




P/B Ratio - A ratio that helps determine whether a stock is undervalued or overvalued. It is calculated by dividing a stock's price per share by its book value per share. The result is based upon a weighted average of the securities held in the fund.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               





P/E Ratio - Is the weighted average of each holding's P/E ratio (price of a stock divided by its earnings per share). The result is based upon a weighted average of the securities held in the fund.                                                                                                                                  




Portfolio Turnover - This is a measure of the Fund’s trading activity which is computed by taking the lesser of purchases or sales divided by average monthly market value, excluding short-term investments.

The total base return displayed for the Fund does not capture daily cash flow and trading activity and therefore is subject to reasonable variance from the Fund's actual return. Please refer to Lord Abbett International Core Equity Fund Performance Results for the Fund's longer-term returns. The Fund is actively managed and portfolio characteristics, such as individual holdings and sector weightings, may change significantly over time.

About Wilshire Attribution
The Wilshire Atlas Variance Analysis tool provides a methodology for explaining the difference in performance between a portfolio and its benchmark, based on the decomposition of returns. The user specifies the portfolio, index, link frequency, sector and weighting. The weighting can be shown as beginning, average or end weights and is used for display purposes only. 
Average Weight (Portfolio): This is the average weight of each group in the portfolio. Alternatively, the weight at the end of the reporting period, or on average across the reporting period, may be selected.
Base Return (Portfolio): This is the weighted average holding period return for the securities in each group. This weighted average is calculated for each link period using beginning weights and then the resulting values are linked together to calculate the displayed value.
Average Weight (Benchmark): This is the average weight of each group in the benchmark. Alternatively, the weight at the end of the reporting period, or on average across the reporting period, may be selected.
Base Return (Benchmark): This is the weighted average holding period return for the benchmark securities in each group. This weighted average is calculated for each link period using beginning weights, then the resulting values are linked together to calculate the displayed value.
Stock Selection Variance: This is the success of selection decisions within each group versus the benchmark. It is calculated for each link period using the following equation: Stock Selection Variance = WP,G * (RP,G - RB,G), where WP,G = Weight of the group in the portfolio, RP,G = Return of the group in the portfolio, RB,G = Return of the group in the benchmark.
Group Weighting Variance: This is the result of weighting decisions in each group versus the benchmark. It is calculated for each link period using the following equation: Group Weighting Variance = (WP,G – WB,G) * (RB,G – RB,T), where WP,G = Weight of the group in the portfolio, WB,G = Weight of the group in the benchmark, RB,G = Return of the group in the benchmark, RB,T = Overall return of the benchmark.
Total Variance: This is the sum of group weighting and stock selection variances. This represents the amount of total variance that is explained by the selection and allocation decisions for each group.
Wilshire generated returns are calculated gross of fees based on end of day prices and do not capture intraday cash flow, price changes or trading activity, and therefore are subject to some variance from Lord Abbett returns. In addition, Wilshire and Lord Abbett may use different pricing sources and methodologies.
Not Classified securities represent those securities which have not been assigned an official GICS Direct classification. GICS Direct, a joint product of Standard & Poor’s and MSCI, provides industry classifications for more than 40,000 companies and over 45,000 securities. Not Classified securities may include, but are not limited to: Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), pink sheet-listed issues, pre-IPO placements, private placements, secondary issues, open-end funds, closed-end funds, and non-operating establishments.
Under certain circumstances, Lord Abbett may elect to have Wilshire map an ETF holding to the relevant characteristics represented by that ETF’s underlying index in order to reflect the exposure and performance contributed by the ETF to the overall portfolio. When this option is selected, Wilshire will remove the ETF from the Not Classified category and instead allocate the ETF’s exposures across the relevant attributes based on the composition of the ETF’s underlying index.

For Sales Charge Reductions and Waivers Click here.



SALES CHARGE REDUCTIONS AND WAIVERS
Please inform the fund company or your financial intermediary at the time of your purchase of fund shares if you believe you qualify for a reduced front-end sales charge.
Reducing Your Class A Share Front-End Sales Charge
 You may purchase Class A shares at a discount if you qualify under the circumstances outlined below. To receive a reduced front-end sales charge, you must let the fund or your financial intermediary know at the time of your purchase of fund shares that you believe you qualify for a discount. If you or a related party have holdings of eligible funds (as defined below) in other accounts with your financial intermediary or with other financial intermediaries that may be combined with your current purchases in determining the sales charge as described below, you must inform a fund or your financial intermediary. You may be asked to provide supporting account statements or other information to allow us or your financial intermediary to verify your eligibility for a discount. If you or your financial intermediary do not notify a fund or provide the requested information, you may not receive the reduced sales charge for which you otherwise qualify. Class A shares may be purchased at a discount if you qualify under either of the following conditions:

Rights of Accumulation - A purchaser may combine the value of Class A, B, C, F, and P shares of any eligible fund currently owned with a new purchase of Class A shares of any eligible fund in order to reduce the sales charge on the new purchase. Class I, R2, and R3 share holdings may not be combined for these purposes.
To the extent that your financial intermediary is able to do so, the value of Class A, B, C, F, and P shares of eligible funds determined for the purpose of reducing the sales charge of a new purchase under the Rights of Accumulation will be calculated at the higher of: 1) the aggregate current maximum offering price of your existing Class A, B, C, F, and P shares of eligible funds or 2) the aggregate amount you invested in such shares (including dividend reinvestments but excluding capital appreciation) less any withdrawals. You should retain any information and account records necessary to substantiate the historical amounts you and any related purchasers have invested in eligible funds. You must inform a fund and/or your financial intermediary at the time of purchase if you believe your purchase qualifies for a reduced sales charge; you may be requested to provide documentation of your holdings in order to verify your eligibility. If you do not do so, you may not receive all sales charge reductions for which you are eligible.

Letter of Intention — In order to reduce your Class A front-end sales charge, a purchaser may combine purchases of Class A, B, C, F, and P shares of any eligible fund the purchaser intends to make over the next 13 months in determining the applicable sales charge. The 13-month Letter of Intention period commences on the day that the Letter of Intention is received by a fund, and the purchaser must tell a fund that later purchases are subject to the Letter of Intention. Purchases submitted prior to the date the Letter of Intention is received by a fund are not counted toward the sales charge reduction. Current holdings under Rights of Accumulation may be included in a Letter of Intention in order to reduce the sales charge for purchases during the 13-month period covered by the Letter of Intention. Shares purchased through reinvestment of dividends or distributions are not included. Class I, R2, and R3 share holdings may not be combined for these purposes. Class A shares valued at 5% of the amount of intended purchases are escrowed and may be redeemed to cover the additional sales charges payable if the intended purchases under the Letter of Intention is not completed. The Letter of Intention is neither a binding obligation on you to buy nor on a fund to sell any or all of an intended purchase amount.

Purchaser — A purchaser includes: 1) an individual; 2) an individual, his or her spouse, and children under the age of 21; 3) retirement and benefit plans, including a 401(k) plan, profit-sharing plan, money purchase plan, defined benefit plan, and 457(b) plan sponsored by a governmental entity, nonprofit organization, school district, or church to which employer contributions are made, as well as SIMPLE IRA plans and SEP-IRA plans; or 4) a trustee or other fiduciary purchasing shares for a single trust, estate, or single fiduciary account. An individual may include under item (1) his or her holdings in eligible funds as described above in IRAs, as a sole participant of a retirement and benefit plan sponsored by the individual's business, and as a participant in a 403(b) plan to which only pretax salary deferrals are made. An individual and his or her spouse may include under item (2) their holdings in IRAs, and as the sole participants in retirement and benefit plans sponsored by a business owned by either or both of them. A retirement and benefit plan under item (3) includes all qualified retirement and benefit plans of a single employer and its consolidated subsidiaries, and all qualified retirement and benefit plans of multiple employers registered in the name of a single bank trustee.
Eligible fund — An eligible fund is any Lord Abbett-sponsored fund except for (1) each portfolio of Lord Abbett Series Fund, Inc., (2) Lord Abbett U.S. Government & Government Sponsored Enterprises Money Market Fund, Inc. ("Money Market Fund") (except for holdings in Money Market Fund, which are attributable to any shares exchanged from the Lord Abbett-sponsored funds), and (3) any other fund the shares of which are not available to the investor at the time of the transaction due to a limitation on the offering of a fund's shares.
Front-end Sales Charge Waivers
 Class A shares may be purchased without a front-end sales charge under any of the following conditions:

purchases of $1 million or more (may be subject to a CDSC);
purchases by retirement and benefit plans with at least 100 eligible employees (may be subject to a CDSC);
purchases for retirement and benefit plans made through financial intermediaries that perform participant recordkeeping or other administrative services for the plans and that have entered into special arrangements with a fund and/or Lord Abbett Distributor specifically for such purchases (may be subject to a CDSC);
purchases made by or on behalf of financial intermediaries for clients that pay the financial intermediaries fees in connection with fee-based advisory program, provided that the financial intermediaries or their trading agents have entered into special arrangements with a fund and/or Lord Abbett Distributor specifically for such purchases; and
certain other types of investors may qualify to purchase Class A share without a front-end sales charge as described in the Statement of Additional Information (SAI).

The net expense ratio takes into account contractual fee waivers/expense reimbursements that currently are scheduled to remain in place through 02/28/2018. For periods when fees and expenses were waived and/or reimbursed, the Fund benefited by not bearing such expenses.  Without such fee waivers/reimbursements, performance would have been lower.

Minimum initial investment varies depending on the class of shares you buy and the type of account. IRAs, SIMPLEs, and SEP accounts with payroll deductions have no minimums. Please see Fund prospectuses for additional information.      
                    






1
12-Month Dividend Yield is a financial ratio that shows how much a mutual fund pays out in dividends each year relative to its value with maximum sales charges and without sales charges. The fund’s dividend yield is calculated by dividing the fund’s income distributions over the previous year by the fund’s current value with maximum sales charges and without sales charges.
 




2
The 30-Day Standardized Yield represents net investment income earned by a fund over a 30-day period. It is expressed as an annual percentage rate using a method of calculation adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Yields for other share classes will vary.
 




3
The Fund’s Dividend Yield and 12-Month Dividend Yield are shown with and without sales charges and with maximum sales charges. The Fund’s Subsidized Dividend yield takes into account any fee waiver or expense limitation arrangements, if any. Without such fee waivers or expense limitation arrangements, the Fund’s dividend yield would have been lower. Information regarding any fee waivers or expense limitation arrangements applicable to the Fund is provided with the Fund’s expense ratio information.
 




4
The Fund’s Unsubsidized Dividend yield is shown without sales charges and with maximum sales charges. The Fund’s unsubsidized dividend yield reflects what the yield would have been without the effect of fee waivers or expense limitation arrangements.
 
 




5
The 30-day Standardized Subsidized yield reflects fee waivers in effect. Without such fee waivers, yields would be reduced.  
 




6
The 30-day Standardized Unsubsidized yield does not reflect fee waivers.




 
IMPORTANT INFORMATION
 




A Note about Risk: The value of investments in equity securities will fluctuate in response to general economic conditions and to changes in the prospects of particular companies and/or sectors in the economy.  The foreign securities in which the Fund primarily invests generally pose greater risks than domestic securities, including greater price fluctuations and higher transaction costs.  Foreign investments also may be affected by changes in currency rates or currency controls.  With respect to certain foreign countries, there is a possibility of nationalization, expropriation or confiscatory taxation, imposition of withholding or other taxes, and political or social instability that could affect investments in those countries. These risks can be greater in the case of emerging country securities. A company's dividend payments may vary over time, and there is no guarantee that a company will pay a dividend at all. The market may fail to recognize the intrinsic value of particular value or dividend-paying stocks the Fund may hold. In addition to large company stocks, the Fund may invest in mid- and small-sized stocks, which tend to be more volatile and may be less able to weather economic shifts or other adverse developments.  The Fund is subject to the risks associated with derivatives, which may be different from and greater than the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other investments. These factors can affect Fund performance. 




 
Performance data quoted is historical. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance quoted. The investment return and principal value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate so that shares, on any given day or when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. To obtain performance data current to the most recent quarter-end, go to quarter ending performance on our Website or call Lord Abbett at (888) 522-2388.
 



Class A  Except as noted below, returns with sales charges reflect a maximum sales charge of 5.75% for equity funds, 2.25% for all tax-free income funds, fixed income funds and multi-asset class funds. There are also ongoing 12b-1 service fees (and, in certain cases, distribution fees).
Class A Shares purchased subject to a front-end sales charge have no contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC). However, certain purchases of Class A shares made without a front-end sales charge may be subject to a CDSC of 1% if the shares are redeemed before the first day of the month in which the one year anniversary of the purchase falls. The CDSC is not reflected in the performance with maximum sales charge.



With Sales Charge - Returns with sales charges reflect applicable fees and expenses and include all distributions reinvested.
 
 




Without Sales Charge - Returns shown are without sales charges and have all distributions reinvested. If a sales charge had been deducted, the results would have been lower.
 




Returns shown at less than a year reflect aggregate total returns.
 




Double-Digit Returns - instances of high double-digit returns were achieved primarily during favorable market conditions and may not be sustainable over time.   
 






MSCI makes no express or implied warranties or representations and shall have no liability whatsoever with respect to any MSCI data contained herein. The MSCI data may not be further redistributed or used as a basis for other indices or any securities or financial products. This report is not approved, reviewed or produced by MSCI.




Indexes reflect total return, unless otherwise specified, with all dividends reinvested. Indexes are unmanaged, do not reflect the deduction of fees or expenses, and are not available for direct investment.
 
 
















Lipper Category Average - Peer group averages are based on universes of funds with the same investment objectives. The average return for the peer group is based on the returns of each individual fund within the group for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
 




Fund Expense Ratio Detail: Reflects expenses for the Fund's fiscal year-end and is subject to change. Fund expenses may fluctuate with market volatility. A substantial reduction in Fund assets (since its most recently completed fiscal year), whether caused by market conditions or significant redemptions or both, will likely cause total operating expenses (as a percentage of Fund assets) to become higher than those shown.




 
Lipper Category Average Expense Ratio reflects the average net expenses of Class A shares of all funds with in the peer group based on Lipper data available.
 




The Fund's portfolio is actively managed and portfolio characteristics, such as individual holdings and sector weightings may change significantly over time. The portfolio data is for information only. It does not constitute a recommendation or an offer for a particular security or fund, nor should it be taken as a solicitation or recommendation to buy or sell securities or other investments.  
 




Dividends and Capital Gains: The information presented in this section is intended for general information and is not intended to be relied upon and should not be relied upon, as financial, legal or tax advice for any particular investor.

						Expense Ratioas of 06/30/2017











Expense ratio details, Click here.

The net expense is based on estimates for the current fiscal year and takes into account contractual fee waivers/expense reimbursements that currently are scheduled to remain in place through 02/28/2018.  For periods when fees and expenses were waived and/or reimbursed, the Fund benefited by not bearing such expenses.  Without such fee waivers/reimbursements, performance would have been lower.

The performance quoted represents past performance, which is no indication of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted. Returns shown include the reinvestment of all distributions. Returns shown at net asset value do not reflect the current maximum sales charge, had the sales charge been included, returns would have been lower. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that shares, on any given day or when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Therefore, there can be no assurance of future results.

For Sales Charge Reductions and Waivers Click here.





SALES CHARGE REDUCTIONS AND WAIVERS
Please inform the fund company or your financial intermediary at the time of your purchase of fund shares if you believe you qualify for a reduced front-end sales charge.
Reducing Your Class A Share Front-End Sales Charge
 You may purchase Class A shares at a discount if you qualify under the circumstances outlined below. To receive a reduced front-end sales charge, you must let the fund or your financial intermediary know at the time of your purchase of fund shares that you believe you qualify for a discount. If you or a related party have holdings of eligible funds (as defined below) in other accounts with your financial intermediary or with other financial intermediaries that may be combined with your current purchases in determining the sales charge as described below, you must inform a fund or your financial intermediary. You may be asked to provide supporting account statements or other information to allow us or your financial intermediary to verify your eligibility for a discount. If you or your financial intermediary do not notify a fund or provide the requested information, you may not receive the reduced sales charge for which you otherwise qualify. Class A shares may be purchased at a discount if you qualify under either of the following conditions:

Rights of Accumulation - A purchaser may combine the value of Class A, B, C, F, and P shares of any eligible fund currently owned with a new purchase of Class A shares of any eligible fund in order to reduce the sales charge on the new purchase. Class I, R2, and R3 share holdings may not be combined for these purposes.
To the extent that your financial intermediary is able to do so, the value of Class A, B, C, F, and P shares of eligible funds determined for the purpose of reducing the sales charge of a new purchase under the Rights of Accumulation will be calculated at the higher of: 1) the aggregate current maximum offering price of your existing Class A, B, C, F, and P shares of eligible funds or 2) the aggregate amount you invested in such shares (including dividend reinvestments but excluding capital appreciation) less any withdrawals. You should retain any information and account records necessary to substantiate the historical amounts you and any related purchasers have invested in eligible funds. You must inform a fund and/or your financial intermediary at the time of purchase if you believe your purchase qualifies for a reduced sales charge; you may be requested to provide documentation of your holdings in order to verify your eligibility. If you do not do so, you may not receive all sales charge reductions for which you are eligible.

Letter of Intention — In order to reduce your Class A front-end sales charge, a purchaser may combine purchases of Class A, B, C, F, and P shares of any eligible fund the purchaser intends to make over the next 13 months in determining the applicable sales charge. The 13-month Letter of Intention period commences on the day that the Letter of Intention is received by a fund, and the purchaser must tell a fund that later purchases are subject to the Letter of Intention. Purchases submitted prior to the date the Letter of Intention is received by a fund are not counted toward the sales charge reduction. Current holdings under Rights of Accumulation may be included in a Letter of Intention in order to reduce the sales charge for purchases during the 13-month period covered by the Letter of Intention. Shares purchased through reinvestment of dividends or distributions are not included. Class I, R2, and R3 share holdings may not be combined for these purposes. Class A shares valued at 5% of the amount of intended purchases are escrowed and may be redeemed to cover the additional sales charges payable if the intended purchases under the Letter of Intention is not completed. The Letter of Intention is neither a binding obligation on you to buy nor on a fund to sell any or all of an intended purchase amount.

Purchaser — A purchaser includes: 1) an individual; 2) an individual, his or her spouse, and children under the age of 21; 3) retirement and benefit plans, including a 401(k) plan, profit-sharing plan, money purchase plan, defined benefit plan, and 457(b) plan sponsored by a governmental entity, nonprofit organization, school district, or church to which employer contributions are made, as well as SIMPLE IRA plans and SEP-IRA plans; or 4) a trustee or other fiduciary purchasing shares for a single trust, estate, or single fiduciary account. An individual may include under item (1) his or her holdings in eligible funds as described above in IRAs, as a sole participant of a retirement and benefit plan sponsored by the individual's business, and as a participant in a 403(b) plan to which only pretax salary deferrals are made. An individual and his or her spouse may include under item (2) their holdings in IRAs, and as the sole participants in retirement and benefit plans sponsored by a business owned by either or both of them. A retirement and benefit plan under item (3) includes all qualified retirement and benefit plans of a single employer and its consolidated subsidiaries, and all qualified retirement and benefit plans of multiple employers registered in the name of a single bank trustee.
Eligible fund — An eligible fund is any Lord Abbett-sponsored fund except for (1) each portfolio of Lord Abbett Series Fund, Inc., (2) Lord Abbett U.S. Government & Government Sponsored Enterprises Money Market Fund, Inc. ("Money Market Fund") (except for holdings in Money Market Fund, which are attributable to any shares exchanged from the Lord Abbett-sponsored funds), and (3) any other fund the shares of which are not available to the investor at the time of the transaction due to a limitation on the offering of a fund's shares.
Front-end Sales Charge Waivers
 Class A shares may be purchased without a front-end sales charge under any of the following conditions:

purchases of $1 million or more (may be subject to a CDSC);
purchases by retirement and benefit plans with at least 100 eligible employees (may be subject to a CDSC);
purchases for retirement and benefit plans made through financial intermediaries that perform participant recordkeeping or other administrative services for the plans and that have entered into special arrangements with a fund and/or Lord Abbett Distributor specifically for such purchases (may be subject to a CDSC);
purchases made by or on behalf of financial intermediaries for clients that pay the financial intermediaries fees in connection with fee-based advisory program, provided that the financial intermediaries or their trading agents have entered into special arrangements with a fund and/or Lord Abbett Distributor specifically for such purchases; and
certain other types of investors may qualify to purchase Class A share without a front-end sales charge as described in the Statement of Additional Information (SAI).

Expense ratio details, Click here.

The net expense is based on estimates for the current fiscal year and takes into account contractual fee waivers/expense reimbursements that currently are scheduled to remain in place through 02/28/2018.  For periods when fees and expenses were waived and/or reimbursed, the Fund benefited by not bearing such expenses.  Without such fee waivers/reimbursements, performance would have been lower.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION
 




headingView Disclosure




New Fund Risk: The Fund is newly organized. There can be no assurance that the Fund will reach or maintain a sufficient asset size to effectively implement its investing strategy.







headingView Disclosure




A Note about Risk: The value of investments in equity securities will fluctuate in response to general economic conditions and to changes in the prospects of particular companies and/or sectors in the economy. The foreign securities in which the Fund primarily invests generally pose greater risks than domestic securities, including greater price fluctuations and higher transaction costs. Foreign investments also may be affected by changes in currency rates or currency controls. With respect to certain foreign countries, there is a possibility of nationalization, expropriation or confiscatory taxation, imposition of withholding or other taxes, and political or social instability that could affect investments in those countries. These risks can be greater in the case of emerging country securities. Investments in either growth or value stocks may shift in and out of favor for long periods of time, depending on market and economic conditions. The Fund is subject to the risks associated with derivatives, which may be different from and greater than the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other investments. The Fund may invest in exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), investments in ETFs are subject to a variety of risks, including the risks associated with a direct investment in the underlying securities that the ETF holds. 







 
Performance data quoted is historical. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance quoted. The investment return and principal value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate so that shares, on any given day or when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. To obtain performance data current to the most recent quarter-end, go to quarter ending performance on our Website or call Lord Abbett at (888) 522-2388.
 



Class A  Except as noted below, returns with sales charges reflect a maximum sales charge of 5.75% for equity funds, 2.25% for all tax-free income funds, fixed income funds and multi-asset class funds. There are also ongoing 12b-1 service fees (and, in certain cases, distribution fees).
Class A Shares purchased subject to a front-end sales charge have no contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC). However, certain purchases of Class A shares made without a front-end sales charge may be subject to a CDSC of 1% if the shares are redeemed before the first day of the month in which the one year anniversary of the purchase falls. The CDSC is not reflected in the performance with maximum sales charge.



With Sales Charge - Returns with sales charges reflect applicable fees and expenses and include all distributions reinvested.
 
 




Without Sales Charge - Returns shown are without sales charges and have all distributions reinvested. If a sales charge had been deducted, the results would have been lower.
 




Returns shown at less than a year reflect aggregate total returns.
 




Double-Digit Returns - instances of high double-digit returns were achieved primarily during favorable market conditions and may not be sustainable over time.

A substantial reduction in Fund assets (since its most recently completed fiscal year), whether caused by market conditions or significant redemptions or both, will likely cause total operating expenses (as a percentage of Fund assets) to become higher than those shown.

Commentary

As of June 30, 2017

	Quarter in review


		The JPMorgan Municipal Income Fund (I Class Shares) underperformed its benchmark, the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. 1-15 Year Blend (1-17) Municipal Bond Index, for the quarter ended June 30, 2017.

		The Fund’s overweight to the outperforming Housing and IDR/PCR (industrial revenue/pollution control revenue) sectors helped as these sectors returned 1.91% and 1.95% in the index.

		The Fund’s significant overweight to the broad Revenue sectors versus the broad GO (general obligation) sector helped; revenue bonds outperformed GOs by 29 basis points (bps) in the index.

		An underweight to short-duration Prerefunded bonds contributed as this sector underperformed by 109 bps in the index.

		The Fund’s slightly shorter duration (4.6 years versus 4.9 years) hurt as rates mostly declined across the curve; yields rose 4 bps in two years, fell 20 bps in five years and 26 bps in 10 years and 30 years.

		In the index, Transportation and Hospital sectors outperformed the broad index by 20 and 28 bps, so our underweight hindered performance.

		An overweight to short relative duration AAA-rated bonds hurt. This rating bucket underperformed the broad index by 14 bps.


	Looking ahead


		We expect the Federal Reserve to raise rates in September and begin paring its balance sheet. Ten-year Treasury rates are expected to end the year at between 2.5% - 3.0%.  

		Fund flows have been positive and demand for separately managed accounts, especially in the short end, has been strong.

		Muni bond supply is down from last year and estimated at $325-$350 billion for the year. The uptick in new money issuance should continue for the balance of the year as state and local governments make needed investments in aging infrastructure, which had been de-prioritized since the recession.

Disclaimer1Please refer to the prospectus for additional information about cut-off times. Total return assumes reinvestment of income. The Fund's adviser and/or its affiliates have contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses to the extent Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, dividend and interest expenses related to short sales, interest, taxes, expenses related to litigation and potential litigation and extraordinary expenses) exceed 0.70% for A Shares, 1.25% for C Shares and 0.45% for I Shares of the average daily net assets. The Fund may invest in one or more money market funds advised by the adviser or its affiliates (affiliated money market funds). The Fund's adviser has contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses in an amount sufficient to offset the fees and expenses of the affiliated money market funds incurred by the Fund because of the Fund's investment in such money market funds. This waiver is in effect through 10/31/2018 for A Shares, 10/31/2018 for C Shares and 10/31/2018 for I Shares, at which time the adviser and/or its affiliates will determine whether to renew or revise it. The difference between net and gross fees includes all applicable fee waivers and expense reimbursements. The quoted performance of the Fund includes performance of a predecessor fund/share class prior to the Fund's commencement of operations. Please refer to the current prospectus for further information.  Mutual funds have fees that reduce their performance: indexes do not. You cannot invest directly in an index. The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. 1-15 Year Blend (1-17) Municipal Bond Index represents the performance of municipal bonds with maturities from 1 to 17 years. The performance of the Lipper Intermediate Municipal Debt Funds Index includes expenses associated with a mutual fund, such as investment management fees. These expenses are not identical to the expenses charged by the Fund. Total return figures (for the fund and any index quoted) assume payment of fees and reinvestment of dividends (after the highest applicable foreign withholding tax) and distributions. Without fee waivers, fund returns would have been lower. Due to rounding, some values may not total 100%. Â©2017, American Bankers Association, CUSIP Database provided by the Standard & Poor's CUSIP Service Bureau, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. All rights reserved.The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10- year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.Rankings do not take sales loads into account.The following risks could cause the fund to lose money or perform more poorly than other investments. For more complete risk information, see the prospectus. Investments in bonds and other debt securities will change in value based on changes in interest rates. If rates rise, the value of these investments generally drops. Some investors may be subject to the Federal Alternative Minimum Tax and to certain state and local taxes.Total return assumes reinvestment of income. The top 10 holdings listed reflect only the Fund's long-term investments. Short-term investments are excluded. Holdings are subject to change. The holdings listed should not be considered recommendations to purchase or sell a particular security. Each individual security is calculated as a percentage of the aggregate market value of the securities held in the Fund and does not include the use of derivative positions, where applicable. Duration: Measures price sensitivity of fixed income securities to interest rate changes. Average Life: The length of time the principal of a debt issue is expected to be outstanding.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Diversification does not guarantee investment returns and does not eliminate the risk of loss.
Bonds are subject to interest rate risks. Bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise.
The price of equity securities may rise or fall because of changes in the broad market or changes in a company's financial condition, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Equity securities are subject to "stock market risk" meaning that stock prices in general may decline over short or extended periods of time.
International investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility. Changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the U.S. can raise or lower returns. Also, some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the United States and other nations. Investments in emerging markets can be more volatile.
Real estate investments may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry, sector or geographical sector. Real estate investments may be subject to risks including, but not limited to, declines in the value of real estate, risks related to general and economic conditions, changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower.
Investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities, particularly if the instruments involve leverage. The value of commodity-linked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements, commodity index volatility, changes in interest rates, or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity, such as drought, floods, weather, livestock disease, embargoes, tariffs and international economic, political and regulatory developments. Use of leveraged commodity-linked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but, at the same time, creates the possibility for greater loss. 
Derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses that significantly exceed the original investment. The use of derivatives may not be successful, resulting in investment losses, and the cost of such strategies may reduce investment returns.
There is no guarantee that the use of long and short positions will succeed in limiting an investor's exposure to domestic stock market movements, capitalization, sector swings or other risk factors. Investing using long and short selling strategies may have higher portfolio turnover rates. Short selling involves certain risks, including additional costs associated with covering short positions and a possibility of unlimited loss on certain short sale positions.

			Tax-Exempt Municipal Debt Funds
			


		About Tax-Exempt Municipal Debt

		Tax-exempt municipal bonds are debt issued by a state, city, or other municipality for general governmental needs or to finance special
		projects. These municipal bonds pay interest that is free from regular federal income tax, and state-specific bonds can provide residents
		of those states with income free from state and, in some cases, local income taxes as well.* Tax-exempt municipal bonds can be an
		advantageous alternative to taxable investments, particularly for investors in higher tax brackets. To make a fair comparison between
		a tax-free investment like a municipal bond and a taxable investment, one should adjust the tax-free investment's yield to account
		for money saved in regular federal, and sometimes state, income tax.
	

* Interest on out-of-state bonds and dividends paid by national funds may be subject to state and local taxes. Income may also be
			subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax.



				About Nuveen Tax-Exempt Municipal Debt Closed-End Funds

				You can see you would need to earn much more from a taxable investment to match a municipal bond's after-tax yield. For instance,
				if your fund is yielding 5.00% tax-free and your tax rate is
				28%, you would need a taxable investment to yield 6.94% to match the same after-tax cash flow. 
			

This chart is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to reflect past or predict future performance 
				for any particular investment. They do not take into account the effects of the federal alternative minimum tax (AMT) 
				or capital gains taxes.  This information is general in nature and should not be considered tax advice.  
				Nuveen is not a tax advisor and investors should consult with a qualified tax consultant as to their particular 
				situation.






						Investor Profile

							and equity securities

						What are potential risks?

							that the bonds will decline in value because of changes in market interest rates.

							Municipal bonds are also subject to call risk, and credit risk.
