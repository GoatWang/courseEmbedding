1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield Level Selector annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Annuities




Building a brighter future begins with knowing what you’ll have in retirement. Annuities can help you grow and protect what you’ve saved.

And because one size doesn’t fit all, Brighthouse Financial annuities are flexible enough to meet your unique saving and investing goals.

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield Level Selector annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Life Insurance




There’s more to life insurance than taking care of loved ones if you pass away. 

Life insurance can also be an essential part of a financial plan. In addition to helping to protect loved ones financially with a death benefit, some products can grow money on a tax-advantaged basis that can be used during one’s lifetime. The ability to meet more than one need makes life insurance a product that adds valuable flexibility to any portfolio.

Talk to your financial professional if you think life insurance might be right for you.















                                Our easy-to-use tool can help guide you to start the conversation around life insurance with your financial professional. 
 

















Types of Life Insurance





Permanent Life Insurance
Provides coverage that lasts a lifetime and can build cash value that can be used while living. 



Term Life Insurance
Provides coverage for a specific length of time and provides the most payout for the money, but does not build cash value.

















Permanent Life Insurance
Permanent life insurance is designed to provide coverage for life. Many permanent life insurance products also have a feature called cash value. This cash value can grow over time through interest credits, market returns, or dividends, providing money that can be used for a variety of needs.  

Permanent life insurance products include: Universal Life, Indexed Universal Life, Whole Life, and Variable Universal Life.







Premier Accumulator Universal Life
Can grow cash value quickly and allows faster access to your money when you need it.

.


















Term Life Insurance
Term life insurance covers you for a fixed number of years, such as 1, 5, 10, 20, or 30 and pays a death benefit if you pass away during the covered time period. Most term insurance policies offer a level premium, death benefit, and the ability to convert to a permanent policy if your needs change. You can also choose coverage for current needs and add optional riders for future needs.







Guaranteed Level Term
Available in coverage amounts of $1 million or more, with premiums guaranteed to stay the same throughout the level premium period.

Brighthouse Financial, an operating segment of MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET), announced on March 6, 2017 that it is now offering its suite of life insurance and annuity products under the Brighthouse Financial brand. 
*Data as of March 31, 2017. Assets under management refers to general account investments and separate account assets.

Ratings as of May 2017. Operating entities collectively rated include Brighthouse Life Insurance Company (BLIC), NELICO, and Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY (BLNY); note, Moody’s and Fitch do not rate BLNY.
A.M. Best’s Financial Strength Rating is an independent opinion of an insurer’s financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. A Financial Strength Rating is not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and does not address any other risk, including, but not limited to, an insurer’s claims-payment policies or procedures; the ability of the insurer to dispute or deny claims payment on grounds of misrepresentation or fraud; or any specific liability contractually borne by the policy or contract holder. A Financial Strength Rating is not a recommendation to purchase, hold, or terminate any insurance policy, contract or any other financial obligation issued by an insurer, nor does it address the suitability of any particular policy or contract, for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.ambest.com.
Fitch’s Insurer Financial Strength Rating provides an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization. The Insurer Financial Strength Rating is assigned to the insurance company’s policyholder obligations, including assumed reinsurance obligations and contract holder obligations, such as guaranteed investment contracts. Ratings explanations can be found at www.fitchratings.com.
Moody’s Insurance Financial Strength Rating is an opinion of the ability of an insurance company to pay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations and also reflect the expected financial loss suffered in the event of default. Specific obligations are considered unrated unless they are individually rated because the standing of a particular insurance obligation would depend on an assessment of its relative standing under those laws governing both the obligation and the insurance company. Ratings explanations can be found at www.moodys.com.
S&P Global Insurer Financial Strength Rating is a forward-looking opinion about the financial security characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. This opinion is not specific to any particular policy or contract, nor does it address the suitability of a particular policy or contract for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.standardandpoors.com.

The preceding Fee Table and Examples help you understand the costs and

include expenses and charges of the Separate Account as well as the Funds. The  
Examples assume that current waivers and reimbursements of Fund expenses will   
remain in effect for the periods shown. These waivers and reimbursements,       
however, may be terminated at any time, unless otherwise stated. The Examples   
also reflect the $40 contract maintenance charge as 0.0279% of average assets.  

  THE EXAMPLES SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A REPRESENTATION OF PAST OR FUTURE
EXPENSES OR ANNUAL RATES OF RETURN OF ANY FUND. ACTUAL EXPENSES AND ANNUAL RATES
OF RETURN MAY BE MORE OR LESS THAN THOSE ASSUMED FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE

(a) Expenses for these Funds are estimated.                           

 (b) Roszel Advisors, LLC and MLIG Variable Insurance Trust have entered
         into an expense limitation agreement whereby Roszel Advisors has agreed
to reimburse each Fund to the extent total operating expenses 
         (excluding interest, taxes, brokerage commissions, expenses in the form
       of fees paid to Trust service providers by brokers in connection with
directed brokerage arrangements, other expenditures that are  
capitalized in accordance with generally accepted accounting  
  principles, and other extraordinary expenses not incurred in the
       ordinary course of each Fund's business) exceed the following limits:
 1.15% for Roszel/Lord Abbett Mid Cap Value Portfolio; 1.15% for
        Roszel/Seligman Mid Cap Growth Portfolio; 1.15% for Roszel/PIMCO Small
      Cap Value Portfolio; and 1.25% for Roszel/JP Morgan Small Cap Growth
         Portfolio. Any such reimbursement is subject to potential recoupment by
Roszel Advisors within three years.                           

(c) Pacific Investment Management Company LLC ("PIMCO") has agreed to 
      reduce total annual operating expenses to the extent that they would
 exceed 0.65% of average daily net assets, due to organizational
     expenses and the payment by the Fund of its pro rata portion of the
       PIMCO Trust's Trustees' fees. Any such waiver is subject to potential
   future reimbursement within three years from the date the fee was
waived.

        INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES

   Below we list the investment objectives and strategies for the new Funds.
There is no guarantee that any Fund will be able to meet its investment         
objective.                                                                      

PIMCO TRUST 

     PIMCO Trust is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an
open-end management investment company. Pacific Investment Management Company   
("PIMCO"), located at 840 Newport Center Drive, Suite 300 Newport Beach,        
California 92660, serves as the investment adviser to the Total Return          
Portfolio. PIMCO is a wholly owned subsidiary partnership of PIMCO Advisors,    
L.P. As the investment adviser, PIMCO is paid fees by the Fund for its services.

  As of July 1, 2002, Administrative Class shares of one of its portfolios
are available through Account A. The investment objective and certain investment
policies of this Fund are described below.                                      

TOTAL RETURN PORTFOLIO.  This Fund seeks to maximize total return,    
consistent with preservation of capital and prudent investment management. Under
normal circumstances, the Fund invests at least 65% of its assets in a          
diversified portfolio of fixed income instruments of varying maturities. The    
average portfolio duration normally varies within a three-to six-year time frame
based on PIMCO's forecast for interest rates.                                   

MLIG TRUST 

     The MLIG Trust is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as
an open-end management investment company. Roszel Advisors, LLC ("Roszel        
Advisors") is the investment manager of MLIG Trust and each of its portfolios.  
As investment manager, Roszel Advisors is responsible for overall management of 
the MLIG Trust and for retaining subadvisers to manage the assets of each       
portfolio according to its investment objective and strategies. The subadviser  
for each portfolio is listed below.                                             

    Roszel Advisors and each subadviser is registered as an investment adviser
under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Roszel Advisors is an indirect       
subsidiary of Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. Roszel Advisors' principal business     
address is 7 Roszel Road, Princeton, New Jersey 08540. As the investment        
manager, it is paid fees by the Funds for its services. Roszel Advisors pays all
subadvisory fees, not the Fund.                                                 

    As of July 1, 2002, shares of five of the portfolios of the MLIG Trust are
available through Account A. The investment objectives and certain investment   
policies of these Funds are described below.                                    

Roszel/Lord Abbett Mid Cap Value Portfolio seeks long-term capital    
appreciation. The Fund pursues its investment objective by investing primarily  
in mid capitalization equity securities (generally, those with capitalizations  
between $500 million and $10 billion) that the adviser believes are undervalued 
by the market. The adviser emphasizes qualitative analysis of companies and     
seeks to identify those whose securities have the potential for significant     
market appreciation due to growing recognition or anticipation of improvement in
their financial results. The subadviser for the Fund is Lord, Abbett & Co.      

Roszel/Seligman Mid Cap Growth Portfolio seeks long-term capital      
appreciation. The Fund pursues its investment objective by investing primarily  
in mid capitalization equity securities of companies that the adviser believes  
have a potential for high earnings growth rates. The adviser's approach is to   
screen companies using both quantitative and qualitative analysis. The adviser  
first screens companies for past growth in sales and earnings, as well as a     
strong balance sheet. The Fund may, from time to time, invest in a variety of   
income-bearing securities. The subadviser for the Fund is J. & W. Seligman & Co.
Incorporated.

Roszel/PIMCO Small Cap Value Portfolio seeks long-term capital        
appreciation. The Fund pursues its investment objective by investing primarily  
in small capitalization equity securities that the adviser believes are         
undervalued by the market. The adviser screens small capitalization stocks to   
identify around 500 that it believes are undervalued. The screening is done     
using traditional quantitative factors evaluated both on a relative basis       
(compared to securities of issuers in the same industry) and on an "absolute"   
basis (compared to the overall market). The adviser then narrows its field using
further quantitative analysis of factors such as price momentum (i.e., changes  
in stock price relative to changes in overall market prices) and earnings       
momentum (i.e., changes in analyst's earnings-per-share estimates) relative to  
dividend yields and liquidity and selects from among them, those that pay       
dividends. The adviser generally tries to maintain about 100 stocks in equal    
amounts in the Fund without having more than 10% of total assets in securities  
of issuers in a single industry. The subadvisers for the Fund are PIMCO Advisory
Services Holdings LLC and NFJ Investment Group L.P.                             

Roszel/JP Morgan Small Cap Growth Portfolio seeks long-term capital   
appreciation. The Fund pursues its investment objective by investing primarily  
in small capitalization equity securities that the adviser believes have a      
potential for high earnings growth rates. The Fund generally holds securities   
with market capitalizations within the capitalization range of its performance  
benchmark, the S&P 600 Barra Growth Index. The adviser focuses on small         
capitalization securities of issuers with strong earnings prospects that are    
increasing their market share. The adviser emphasizes companies with            
accelerating revenue growth, sustainable earnings trends, a strong management   
team and attractive profitability characteristics. Qualitative factors that the 
adviser looks for include dominant market share, proprietary technology, new    
product cycle, barriers to entry and modest financial leverage. The Fund is more
broadly diversified than many of its peers and maintains investments in all     
sectors of its performance benchmark. The subadviser for the Fund is J.P. Morgan
Fleming Asset Management (USA) Inc.

ML Investor Choice.Addition of TA Barrow Hanley Dividend Focused Fund2 Class & Ticker Initial & Service Not Applicable TRANSAMERICA BARROW HANLEY DIVIDEND FOCUSED VP (FORMERLY, TRANSAMERICA BLACKROCK LARGE CAP VALUE VP) Summary Prospectus May 1, 2013 This summary prospectus is designed to provide shareholders with key portfolio information in a clear and concise format. Before you invest, you may want to review the portfolio s prospectus, which contains more information about the portfolio and its risks. You can find the portfolio s prospectus and other information about the portfolio, including the portfolio s statement of additional information and most recent reports to shareholders, online at  You can also get this information at no cost by calling or by sending an  request to or from your financial professional. The portfolio s prospectus, dated May 1, 2013, and statement of additional information, dated May 1, 2013, as supplemented from time to time, and the independent registered public accounting firm s report and financial statements in the portfolio s annual report to shareholders, dated December 31, 2012, are incorporated by reference into this summary prospectus. Investment Objective: Seeks total return gained from the combination of dividend yield, growth of dividends and capital appreciation. Fees and Expenses: This table describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold portfolio shares, but it does not reflect any charges that are, or may be, imposed under your variable life insurance policy or variable annuity contract. If such charges were reflected, fees would be higher. Shareholder Fees (fees paid directly from your investment) Class of Shares Initial Service Maximum sales charge (load) imposed on purchases (as a percentage of offering price) None None Maximum deferred sales charge (load) (as a percentage of purchase price or redemption proceeds, whichever is lower) None None Annual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment) Class of Shares Initial Service Management fees a 0.64% 0.64% Distribution and service (12b-1) fees 0.00% 0.25% Other expenses 0.07% 0.07% Total annual fund operating expenses 0.71% 0.96% a Management fees have been restated to reflect a reduction in advisory fees. Example: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the portfolio with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the portfolio for the time periods indicated and then redeem all shares at the end of those periods. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the portfolio s operating expenses remain the same. The Example does not reflect charges that are, or may be, imposed under your variable life insurance policy or variable annuity contract. If such charges were reflected, costs would be higher. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be: Share Class 1 year 3 years 5 years 10 years Initial $73 $259 $462 $1,047 Service $98 $306 $531 $1,178 Portfolio Turnover: The portfolio pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or turns over its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs. These costs, which are not reflected in annual portfolio operating expenses or in the Example, affect the portfolio s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the portfolio turnover rate for the portfolio was 107% of the average value of its portfolio. 13 Principal Investment Strategies: The portfolio s sub-adviser, Barrow, Hanley, Mewhinney & Strauss, LLC (the sub-adviser ), deploys an active, strategy that seeks large and middle capitalization U.S.-listed stocks, including American Depositary Receipts ( ADRs ), which make up a portfolio that generally exhibits the following value characteristics: price/earnings and price/book ratios at or below the market (S&P 500 Index) and dividend yields at or above the market. In addition, the sub-adviser considers stocks for the portfolio that not only currently pay a dividend, but also have a consecutive 25-year history of paying cash dividends. The sub-adviser also seeks stocks that have long established histories of dividend increases in an effort to ensure that the growth of the dividend stream of the portfolio s holdings will be greater than that of the market as a whole. The sub-adviser utilizes a conservative orientation based on the belief that above-average returns can be achieved while taking below-average risks. The sub-adviser s investment approach is based on an underlying philosophy that securities markets are inefficient and that these inefficiencies can be favorably exploited through adherence to a value-oriented investment process dedicated to individual stock selection on a bottom-up basis. Accordingly, the sub-adviser constructs a portfolio of individual stocks, selected on a bottom-up basis, using fundamental analysis. The sub-adviser seeks to identify companies that are undervalued and temporarily out-of-favor for reasons it can identify and understand. The sub-adviser does not attempt to time the market or rotate in and out of broad market sectors, as it believes that it is difficult, if not impossible, to add incremental value on a consistent basis by market timing. The portfolio will generally consist of 35 to 45 stocks with position sizes of 1% to 5% (8% maximum position weighting). Annual portfolio turnover is anticipated to be less than 25%. If a stock held in the portfolio omits its dividend, the portfolio is not required to immediately sell the stock, but the portfolio will not purchase any stock that does not have a 25-year record of paying cash dividends. The sub-adviser employs a fully invested strategy. Therefore, under normal market conditions, cash and cash equivalents are generally less than 5% of the portfolio s assets. Under adverse or unstable market, economic or political conditions, the portfolio may take temporary defensive positions in cash and short-term debt securities without limit. During periods of defensive investing, it will be more difficult for the portfolio to achieve its objective. Principal Risks: Risk is inherent in all investing. Many factors affect the portfolio s performance. There is no assurance the portfolio will meet its investment objective. The value of your investment in the portfolio, as well as the amount of return you receive on your investment, may fluctuate significantly. You may lose part or all of your investment in the portfolio or your investment may not perform as well as other similar investments. The following is a summary description of principal risks (in alphabetical order) of investing in the portfolio. You may lose money if you invest in this portfolio. Cash Management and Defensive Investing The value of investments held by the portfolio for cash management or defensive investing purposes can fluctuate. Like other fixed income securities, cash and cash equivalent securities are subject to risk, including market, interest rate and credit risk. If the portfolio holds cash uninvested, the portfolio will be subject to the credit risk of the depository institution holding the cash, it will not earn income on the cash and the portfolio s yield will go down. To the extent that the portfolio s assets are used for cash management or defensive investing purposes, it may not achieve its objective. Depositary Receipts Depositary receipts may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market. Any distributions paid to the holders of depositary receipts are usually subject to a fee charged by the depositary. Holders of depositary receipts may have limited voting rights, and investment restrictions in certain countries may adversely impact the value of depositary receipts because such restrictions may limit the ability to convert equity shares into depositary receipts and vice versa. Such restrictions may cause equity shares of the underlying issuer to trade at a discount or premium to the market price of the depositary receipts. Equity Securities Equity securities represent an ownership interest in an issuer, rank junior in a company s capital structure and consequently may entail greater risk of loss than debt securities. Equity securities include common and preferred stocks. Stock markets are volatile. The price of equity securities fluctuates based on changes in a company s financial condition and overall market and economic conditions. If the market prices of the equity securities owned by the portfolio fall, the value of your investment in the portfolio will decline. Expenses Your actual costs of investing in the portfolio may be higher than the expenses shown in this prospectus for a variety of reasons. For example, expense ratios may be higher than those shown if overall net assets decrease. Net assets are more likely to decrease and portfolio expense ratios are more likely to increase when markets are volatile. 24 Focused Investing To the extent the portfolio invests in one or more countries, regions, sectors or industries, or in a limited number of issuers, the portfolio will be more susceptible to negative events affecting those countries, regions, sectors, industries or issuers. Local events, such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters may disrupt a country s or region s securities markets. Geographic risk is especially high in emerging markets. Foreign Investments Investing in securities of foreign issuers or issuers with significant exposure to foreign markets involves additional risk. Foreign countries may have markets that are less liquid, less regulated and more volatile than U.S. markets. The value of the portfolio s investments may decline because of factors affecting the particular issuer as well as foreign markets and issuers generally, such as unfavorable government actions, political or financial instability or other adverse economic or political developments. Lack of information and weaker accounting standards also may affect the value of these securities. Liquidity Some securities held by the portfolio may be difficult to sell, or illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Illiquid securities may also be difficult to value. If the portfolio is forced to sell an illiquid asset to meet redemption requests or other cash needs, the portfolio may be forced to sell at a loss. Manager The sub-adviser to the portfolio actively manages the portfolio s investments. Consequently, the portfolio is subject to the risk that the methods and analyses employed by the sub-adviser may not produce the desired results. This could cause the portfolio to lose value or its results to lag relevant benchmarks or other funds with similar objectives. Market The market prices of the portfolio s securities may go down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably, due to general market conditions, such as real or perceived adverse economic or political conditions, inflation, changes in interest rates or currency rates, lack of liquidity in the markets or adverse investor sentiment. Adverse market conditions may be prolonged and may not have the same impact on all types of securities. Market prices of securities also may go down due to events or conditions that affect particular sectors, industries or issuers. When market prices fall, the value of your investment will go down. The portfolio may experience a substantial or complete loss on any individual security. The financial crisis that began in 2008 has caused a significant decline in the value and liquidity of many securities of issuers worldwide. Some governmental and non-governmental issuers (notably in Europe) have defaulted on, or been forced to restructure, their debts, and many other issuers have faced difficulties obtaining credit. These market conditions may continue, worsen or spread, including in the U.S., Europe and beyond. In response to the financial crisis, the U.S. and other governments and the Federal Reserve and certain foreign central banks have taken steps to support financial markets. The withdrawal of this support, failure of efforts in response to the crisis, or investor perception that these efforts are not succeeding could negatively affect financial markets generally as well as the value and liquidity of certain securities. High public debt in the U.S. and other countries creates ongoing systemic and market risks and policymaking uncertainty. In addition, policy and legislative changes in the U.S. and in other countries are affecting many aspects of financial regulation. The impact of these changes, and the practical implications for market participants, may not be fully known for some time. Medium-Capitalization Companies The portfolio will be exposed to additional risks as a result of its investments in the securities of medium capitalization companies. Investing in medium capitalization companies involves greater risk than is customarily associated with more established companies. The prices of securities of medium capitalization companies generally are more volatile and are more likely to be adversely affected by changes in earnings results and investor expectations or poor economic or market conditions. Securities of medium capitalization companies may underperform larger capitalization companies, may be harder to sell at times and at prices the portfolio managers believe appropriate and may offer greater potential for losses. Portfolio Selection The value of your investment may decrease if the sub-adviser s judgment about the quality, relative yield, value or market trends affecting a particular security or issuer, industry, sector, region or market segment, or about the economy or interest rates is incorrect. Valuation The sales price the portfolio could receive for any particular portfolio investment may differ from the portfolio s valuation of the investment, particularly for securities that trade in thin or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology. Value Investing The prices of securities the sub-adviser believes are undervalued may not appreciate as anticipated or may go down. Value stocks as a group may be out of favor and underperform the overall equity market for a long period of time, for example, while the market favors growth stocks. Performance: The bar chart and the table below provide some indication of the risks of investing in the portfolio. The bar chart shows how the portfolio s performance has varied from year to year. The table shows how the portfolio s average annual total returns for different periods compare to the returns of a broad measure of market performance. The performance calculations do not reflect any charges that are, or may be, imposed under your variable life insurance policy or variable annuity 35 contract. If such charges were reflected, performance would be lower. Absent any limitation of the portfolio s expenses, total returns would be lower. In the 10 Years or Since Inception column of the table, returns are shown for ten years or since inception of the class, whichever is less. Index returns are for ten years. As with all mutual funds, past performance is not a prediction of future results. Updated performance information is available on our website at  or by calling Annual Total Returns (calendar years ended December 31) - Initial Class 29.78% 18.34% 15.94% 16.92% 4.64% 13.99% 10.44% 2.66% 11.80% % Quarter Ended Return Best Quarter: 06/30/ % Worst Quarter: 09/30/ % Average Annual Total Returns (periods ended December 31, 2012) 1 Year 5 Years 10 Years or Since Inception Inception Date Initial Class 11.80% -0.91% 7.60% 05/01/1996 Service Class 11.47% -1.16% 7.40% 05/01/2003 Russell 1000 Value Index (reflects no deduction for fees, expenses or taxes) 17.51% 0.59% 7.38% Management: Investment Adviser: Transamerica Asset Management, Inc. Sub-Adviser: Barrow, Hanley, Mewhinney & Strauss, LLC Portfolio Managers: Ray Nixon, Jr., Portfolio Manager since 2013 Brian Quinn, CFA, Portfolio Manager since 2013 Lewis Ropp, Portfolio Manager since 2013 Purchase and Sale of Portfolio Shares: Shares of the portfolio may only be purchased or redeemed through variable life insurance policies and variable annuity contracts offered by the separate accounts of participating life insurance companies. Please refer to the corresponding prospectus of the policy or annuity contract that you have chosen for more information about the terms of the offering. Shares of the portfolio may also be sold to the asset allocation portfolios and to other funds of funds. The portfolio does not have any initial or subsequent investment minimums. However, your insurance company may impose investment minimums. The portfolio does not intend to pay any 12b-1 fees on Initial Class shares through May 1, The maximum 12b-1 fee on Initial Class shares is 0.15%. The portfolio reserves the right to pay such fees after that date. Tax Information: Distributions made by the portfolio to an insurance company separate account, and exchanges and redemptions of portfolio shares made by the separate account, ordinarily do not cause the owners of insurance policies and annuity contracts invested in the separate account to recognize income or gain for federal income tax purposes. Please refer to the corresponding prospectus of the policy or annuity contract that you have chosen for more information regarding the tax consequences of your investment. 46 Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries: If you purchase the portfolio through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank or insurance company), the portfolio and/or its affiliates may pay the intermediary for the sale of portfolio shares and related services. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the portfolio over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary s website for more information. SPST0513BHDF 5

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield Level Selector annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield Level Selector annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Life Insurance




There’s more to life insurance than taking care of loved ones if you pass away. 

Life insurance can also be an essential part of a financial plan. In addition to helping to protect loved ones financially with a death benefit, some products can grow money on a tax-advantaged basis that can be used during one’s lifetime. The ability to meet more than one need makes life insurance a product that adds valuable flexibility to any portfolio.

Talk to your financial professional if you think life insurance might be right for you.















                                Our easy-to-use tool can help guide you to start the conversation around life insurance with your financial professional. 
 

















Types of Life Insurance





Permanent Life Insurance
Provides coverage that lasts a lifetime and can build cash value that can be used while living. 



Term Life Insurance
Provides coverage for a specific length of time and provides the most payout for the money, but does not build cash value.

















Permanent Life Insurance
Permanent life insurance is designed to provide coverage for life. Many permanent life insurance products also have a feature called cash value. This cash value can grow over time through interest credits, market returns, or dividends, providing money that can be used for a variety of needs.  

Permanent life insurance products include: Universal Life, Indexed Universal Life, Whole Life, and Variable Universal Life.







Premier Accumulator Universal Life
Can grow cash value quickly and allows faster access to your money when you need it.

.


















Term Life Insurance
Term life insurance covers you for a fixed number of years, such as 1, 5, 10, 20, or 30 and pays a death benefit if you pass away during the covered time period. Most term insurance policies offer a level premium, death benefit, and the ability to convert to a permanent policy if your needs change. You can also choose coverage for current needs and add optional riders for future needs.







Guaranteed Level Term
Available in coverage amounts of $1 million or more, with premiums guaranteed to stay the same throughout the level premium period.

Brighthouse Financial, an operating segment of MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET), announced on March 6, 2017 that it is now offering its suite of life insurance and annuity products under the Brighthouse Financial brand. 
*Data as of March 31, 2017. Assets under management refers to general account investments and separate account assets.

Ratings as of May 2017. Operating entities collectively rated include Brighthouse Life Insurance Company (BLIC), NELICO, and Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY (BLNY); note, Moody’s and Fitch do not rate BLNY.
A.M. Best’s Financial Strength Rating is an independent opinion of an insurer’s financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. A Financial Strength Rating is not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and does not address any other risk, including, but not limited to, an insurer’s claims-payment policies or procedures; the ability of the insurer to dispute or deny claims payment on grounds of misrepresentation or fraud; or any specific liability contractually borne by the policy or contract holder. A Financial Strength Rating is not a recommendation to purchase, hold, or terminate any insurance policy, contract or any other financial obligation issued by an insurer, nor does it address the suitability of any particular policy or contract, for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.ambest.com.
Fitch’s Insurer Financial Strength Rating provides an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization. The Insurer Financial Strength Rating is assigned to the insurance company’s policyholder obligations, including assumed reinsurance obligations and contract holder obligations, such as guaranteed investment contracts. Ratings explanations can be found at www.fitchratings.com.
Moody’s Insurance Financial Strength Rating is an opinion of the ability of an insurance company to pay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations and also reflect the expected financial loss suffered in the event of default. Specific obligations are considered unrated unless they are individually rated because the standing of a particular insurance obligation would depend on an assessment of its relative standing under those laws governing both the obligation and the insurance company. Ratings explanations can be found at www.moodys.com.
S&P Global Insurer Financial Strength Rating is a forward-looking opinion about the financial security characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. This opinion is not specific to any particular policy or contract, nor does it address the suitability of a particular policy or contract for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.standardandpoors.com.

More Information about Annuities





What exactly is an Annuity?

                        An annuity is an investment product that provides safe, tax-deferred growth of your
                        retirement nest egg. Annuities are considered low-risk, and can provide guaranteed, monthly
                        income when
                        you retire. There are many types of annuities with varying features & benefits. These include:
                        fixed,
                        variable, immediate, deferred & hybrid. We strongly suggest you consult with a financial
                        professional to
                        help you understand the various types of annuities before you purchase.
                    








Is an Annuity Right for You?

                        Annuities are NOT a good fit for everyone. Annuities are designed for people looking for
                        guaranteed, monthly income when they retire - they are NOT a high-risk / high-return investment.
                        They are considered to be in the mainstream of conservative retirement planning - over $225
                        billion in annuities have been purchased in the past 12 months alone!
                    








What are your Next Steps?

                        The first thing to do is to see if an annuity fits your specific profile and financial
                        situation. This "fit" is based on the amount of retirement savings you currently have, how old
                        you are, and the State you live in. Simply fill in the information above and our system will
                        generate a free, tailor-made Annuity Report that will include annuity rate quotes from A+ rated
                        companies in your area.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
