How It Works



Reduce Falls

Reduce Costs

	The CareView System allows for close observation of high-risk patients from multiple locations, in order to reduce sitter costs and manage staffing resources more  efficiently.



Optimize Nursing Resources

	The CareView Connect® mobile application provides patient monitoring and vital communication tools from an existing Wi-Fi Android or iOS device.

Testimonials







Since we have installed the CareView System our patient falls are at an all year low and have improved by over 75% in the first three months. CareView is our magic wand!
Bernadette Burns, RN Director of Risk Management Midwest Regional Medical Center







Since we started the CareView System at CMMC our fall rate has decreased tremendously. It is exciting to me that we at CMMC are doing everything we can to keep our patients safe.  We strive daily to get our percentage up and cover as many patients as we can. The system is great!
Renee Stirkens, RN  Nurse Director  Central Mississippi Medical Center







Happy to say 4MC has had zero falls for the month of January. We've had no falls since December 5th. Pretty much unheard of for this unit, and we haven't gone live yet!
Rachel Bruce-Carothers, RN, MSN, CCRN Nurse Manager Providence







Physicians Regional Healthcare System strives to stay on the forefront of medical technology, Patient falls in hospitals are a national problem and we found the CareView System as an innovative way to increase patient safety for those deemed at risk to fall.
Todd Lupton Chief Executive Officer Physicians Regional Healthcare System










See Us in Action












 Getting Started. 

Who We Are

There are no up-front costs to use the CareView Clinical Safety System.  There is a simple monthly fee per bed and all training, installation and support is included.

Implementation and installation is easy. The CareView System operates over your hospital’s existing coaxial network and VPN, and we work with your plant operations team to fit the equipment into rooms.

Patient privacy is always a concern when using cameras in a clinical setting. The CareView System is HIPAA-compliant and secure. It does not record any video images and includes consent processes and privacy options.


Typical Network Requirements

The CareView Clinical Safety System is very flexible and can be setup in a number of ways in order to satisfy hospital or system security and operational networking requirements. 

Generally, CareView is a closed system with interfaces to the hospital infrastructure for:


Internet access (dedicated access- business class of T1 or VPN, B2B VPN)

VLAN to allow nurse station monitors to connect to CareView servers

Access on the same VLAN for the hospital’s HL7 engine to route messages to the CareView server

WiFi access should you be using the CareView Connect mobile device or SitterView tablet

Implementation typically includes a simple one-way ADT feed from the Hospital’s HL7

CareView Communications, Inc. To Demonstrate New And Updated Products At The HIMSS Convention






Business Wire




Feb 20, 2014 8:00 AM EST













 




























































  CareView Communications, Inc. ("CareView" or the "Company") (OTCQB: CRVW), an information technology provider to the healthcare industry, announced its plans today to demonstrate its new and updated product line at Booth #1290 at the Health Information and Management Systems Society convention to be held at the Orange County Convention Center in Orlando, Florida on February 24 – 26, 2014.  Guests to CareView's booth will find interactive displays to show how its NurseView ® video monitoring and Virtual Bed Rails ® work together to help hospital staff prevent patient falls while monitoring patients remotely. CareView will be exhibiting its fall prevention portfolio highlighting NurseView, Virtual Bed Rails and Virtual Chair Rails™; its SitterView™ application designed to reduce sitter costs; its GuestView™ patient entertainment and educational services module; and its recently introduced CareView Connect™ that allows hospital staff to easily and effectively view, communicate with and manage patients in real-time from an integrated hand-held mobile device.  Sandra McRee, CareView's Chief Operating Officer, stated: "I have worked in the healthcare industry for 35 years and CareView is the only company I have found that can improve patient safety and satisfaction while reducing hospital costs. Reported results we received from CareView-driven facilities proves the positive benefits of our product line each day as these facilities strive to provide top quality care to their patients. We are eager to showcase our full product line at the upcoming HIMSS show as we believe our products and services are essential components for hospitals to successfully provide the high level of patient safety and care that they desire."  CareView will also showcase the latest version of its BedView™ patient bed availability application. In a single screen shot, BedView provides an accurate and up-to-the-minute view of a hospital's census and patient flow. BedView quickly matches patient bed requests to appropriate available beds based on criteria such as bed type needed, gender and charge nurse prioritization. BedView integrates with existing pager systems to notify staff of pending patient moves, cleaning needs and special requests related to patients who need to be isolated due to infectious conditions. Hospitals can streamline the patient admission and discharge process with BedView's throughput and delay metrics. The latest version of BedView even provides information on observation patients by giving nurse managers and hospital staff the ability to track length of stay and to appropriately prioritize care.

Careers

	 










 Getting Started. 

Who We Are

There are no up-front costs to use the CareView Clinical Safety System.  There is a simple monthly fee per bed and all training, installation and support is included.

Implementation and installation is easy. The CareView System operates over your hospital’s existing coaxial network and VPN, and we work with your plant operations team to fit the equipment into rooms.

Patient privacy is always a concern when using cameras in a clinical setting. The CareView System is HIPAA-compliant and secure. It does not record any video images and includes consent processes and privacy options.


Typical Network Requirements

The CareView Clinical Safety System is very flexible and can be setup in a number of ways in order to satisfy hospital or system security and operational networking requirements. 

Generally, CareView is a closed system with interfaces to the hospital infrastructure for:


Internet access (dedicated access- business class of T1 or VPN, B2B VPN)

VLAN to allow nurse station monitors to connect to CareView servers

Access on the same VLAN for the hospital’s HL7 engine to route messages to the CareView server

WiFi access should you be using the CareView Connect mobile device or SitterView tablet

Implementation typically includes a simple one-way ADT feed from the Hospital’s HL7

CareView Communications, Inc. Obtains Private Cable Operator License | Business Wire
























































CareView Communications, Inc. Obtains Private Cable Operator License






March 08, 2017 06:45 AM Eastern Standard Time



LEWISVILLE, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--CareView Communications, Inc. ("CareView" or the "Company") 
      (OTCQB:CRVW), an information technology provider to the healthcare 
      industry, executed an agreement with Dish Network, LLC, a Colorado 
      company, (NASDAQ:DISH), to become a Private Cable Operator (PCO). This 
      agreement will enable CareView to provide television network services 
      via Dish Network as part of its full suite of products and services 
      offered through its CareView System®.
    


      As a PCO, CareView will have greater flexibility and less overhead than 
      cable operators or public utility companies and can pass savings along 
      to its customers. This bulk programming will provide a low cost viewing 
      package that can be delivered to each room within assisted living 
      centers, nursing homes and hospitals.
    

      "Our intention is to include television services via Dish Network to 
      residents in skilled nursing and assisted living centers as a part of 
      our bundled service offering which will provide greater flexibility for 
      the facility and more viewing options for their patients," stated Steven 
      Johnson, Chief Executive Officer and President of CareView 
      Communications. "This represents a continuation of our present bundled 
      services philosophy. It offers an additional way for facilities to cut 
      costs and add additional revenue."
    

      CareView installs its equipment in healthcare facilities at no charge, 
      thereafter generating revenue from subscriptions to its suite of 
      products and services that are priced as a bundled service. As 
      CareView's tiered pricing structure is based on the volume commitment by 
      each customer, it intends to include television services via Dish 
      Network to skilled nursing and assisted living centers as part of the 
      bundled service offering to allow customers access to the full suite of 
      CareView services.
    

      The Company's CareView System® provides a full complement of 
      clinical and patient monitoring services for a variety of healthcare 
      facilities. It also provides an entertainment suite of services to 
      increase patient satisfaction scores and enhance the overall image of 
      the facility including first-run, on-demand movies, Internet access and 
      the ability to visit with family and friends through video conferencing.

 Getting Started. 

Who We Are

There are no up-front costs to use the CareView Clinical Safety System.  There is a simple monthly fee per bed and all training, installation and support is included.

Implementation and installation is easy. The CareView System operates over your hospital’s existing coaxial network and VPN, and we work with your plant operations team to fit the equipment into rooms.

Patient privacy is always a concern when using cameras in a clinical setting. The CareView System is HIPAA-compliant and secure. It does not record any video images and includes consent processes and privacy options.


Typical Network Requirements

The CareView Clinical Safety System is very flexible and can be setup in a number of ways in order to satisfy hospital or system security and operational networking requirements. 

Generally, CareView is a closed system with interfaces to the hospital infrastructure for:


Internet access (dedicated access- business class of T1 or VPN, B2B VPN)

VLAN to allow nurse station monitors to connect to CareView servers

Access on the same VLAN for the hospital’s HL7 engine to route messages to the CareView server

WiFi access should you be using the CareView Connect mobile device or SitterView tablet

Implementation typically includes a simple one-way ADT feed from the Hospital’s HL7
