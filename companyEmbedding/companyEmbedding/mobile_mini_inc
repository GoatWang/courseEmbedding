	About Mobile Mini



Founded in 1983, Mobile Mini is the world's leading provider of portable storage solutions through our lease fleet of over 213,000 portable storage and portable office units. We went public in 1994 and now trade on NASDAQ under the symbol MINI. We are part of the Russell 2000® and 3000® Indexes and the S&P Small Cap Index.
We offer our customers a wide range of portable storage and office products in varying lengths and widths with an assortment of differentiated features such as our proprietary security systems, multiple door options, and 100 different configuration options. Our customers can either rent or buy our products, but most prefer to rent due to the short-term nature of their needs. We market, service, and distribute our products through a network of company-owned branch locations in the U.S., Canada and the UK with more than 1,500 dedicated employees. While we do have a national presence, we believe it is important to service our customers at the local level.
Each of our branch locations can effectively service an entire city and are staffed with a local manager, salespeople, field service personnel, drivers, and rental inventory. Our portable units provide storage and office space solutions to approximately 84,000 customers including large and small retailers, construction companies, medical centers, schools, utilities, distributors, the U.S. military, hotels, restaurants, entertainment complexes, and households. Our customers use our products for many temporary storage and office applications including excess inventory storage, seasonal merchandise, record storage, remodeling and construction, warehouse and office expansion, sports and recreational equipment, sales offices, in-plant offices, security guards, sporting events, and much more.
Our customers make their rental buying decisions based on convenience (delivered to their site, access contents anytime, etc.), security of unit, size of unit, door configurations, price, ease of access, delivery availability, customer service, condition of fleet, and reputation. We believe we have the most secure, best maintained and largest selection of storage units in our industry. We have successfully grown Mobile Mini because of our consistent attention to a number of key marketing, sales, operational, and customer service drivers. These include internal growth focus by increasing market awareness, product differentiation, local customer service, sales emphasis, employee retention, promotion from within, and geographic expansion.
We continue to implement new initiatives through our Lean Six Sigma program and increased efforts to become a green company. We take pride in the convenience, customer service, and high-security products that we offer our customers. We are very proud that our customers have rated Mobile Mini with a Best in Class Customer Loyalty Net Promoter Score. We are constantly looking for ways to improve our service and exceed expectations. We do this by investing in our most valuable resource, our employees. We provide training and growth opportunities for our people and a work environment that fosters teamwork and accountability. Many of our managers began working for Mobile Mini as branch salespeople or branch operational positions.

The IT department at Mobile Mini focuses on the development and deployment of business process improvements and core business applications. This follows a significant draw down in IT spend and focus on cost cutting measures through 2009-2010 due to prevailing business and economic conditions. The Director of Information Technology oversees the company's network and data center infrastructure, and directs units focused on developing the company's Cognos-based business intelligence platform. Additional IT staff support Mobile Mini's telecommunications environment.

Mobile Mini is focused on application integration, as well as deploying new master data management and storage solutions supporting its data warehousing platform. The company uses a disparate array of applications with separate database environments (SalesForce for its sales operations, SQL for its call records, Kronos for their employee database, and other applications for its quoting and pricing platforms), and hopes to integrate these onto a consolidated Cognos BI platform, as well as combine its SalesForce and quoting systems to improve the overall business processes. Supporting its data warehouse will be a new infrastructure deployment, centered on blade servers (virtualized with VMware).

History[edit]
Mobile Mini, or Mobile Mini Storage Systems as it was first called, was founded in 1983, and start by selling storage containers to construction companies and manufacturers.
By 1986, the company expanded into markets outside Phoenix, but still in the Southwest. Due to a shortage of cargo storage containers available, Mobile Mini started manufacturing containers in Phoenix. The early 1990s also saw the development of Mobile Mini's patented “bi-cam locking system.” As manufacturing facilities grew to accommodate new product lines and innovations, a larger facilities was created, and Mobile Mini started building modular classrooms for the Arizona and New Mexico markets. In addition to these innovations and changes, Mobile Mini experienced huge growth into Texas, including Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio, along with completing acquisitions in 1998, in Las Vegas and Oklahoma City.[citation needed]
The 2000s continued to experience phenomenal growth by diversifying the customer base and offering a wider product line.[citation needed] The next evolution locking system, the patented Tri-Cam Locking System, provided customers with the best security in the moving and storage industry.[citation needed] International expansion occurred in 2004 with the acquisition of Royal Wolf in the UK and the subsequent launch of the Mobile Mini Uk website, www.mobilemini.co.uk. In 2008, the company experienced a transformational merger with The Mobile Storage Group, giving Mobile Mini a combined portable storage and office rental fleet of more than 274,000 units.[citation needed]
In November 2014, Mobile Mini expanded its product line by purchasing Evergreen Tank Solutions for $405 million in cash. ETS was a leader in liquid and specialty containment solutions. With a fleet of tanks, truck, pumps, and filters, Evergreen was a solid acquisition with a similar business model.[citation needed]
In Spring 2015, Mobile Mini announced the decision to divest 9,400 wood mobile offices in a sale to Acton Mobile. The divestiture allows Mobile Mini to focus the core storage and containment products.[citation needed] Mobile Mini did keep its secure, ground level, office products.[citation needed]
February 2017, Mobile Mini announced the uniting of all divisions under the Mobile Mini brand. The storage and ground level office piece will be branded Mobile Mini Storage Solutions, while the specialty containment pieces made up of Evergreen Tank and Water Movers will be called Mobile Mini Tank + Pump Solutions. The over-arching brand will be Mobile Mini solutions. This change allows the 30+ years of goodwill earned by Mobile Mini to be utilized in the geographic growth of the tanks and pump product line.
