Charles Robert Geer Jr. June 26, 1945 - May 5, 2012 WASHINGTON, D.C. - Charles R. Geer, a longtime Washington, D.C., photographer, died on May 5, 2012, after a brief illness. During his career, he photographed noted dignitaries, such as Presidents Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, and George Bush; global leaders such as Margaret Thatcher and Clare Booth Luce; numerous U.S. Senators and Congressman; and celebrities, such as William Buckley, Arnold Palmer, and Henry Winkler (The Fonz). His clients included both national and international organizations, and his photos have appeared in Newsweek, New York Times, Washingtonian magazine, and other publications. He was 66. Charley was born in Waterbury, Conn., the oldest son of Dr. Charles and Mary Alice Geer and the grandson of Dr. George Independence and Jennie (Merrill) Geer. He grew up in Portland and spent summers at Higgins Beach in Scarborough. He graduated from Cheverus High School and Marquette University in Milwaukee. Charley began his career as a reporter/photographer for the Catholic Herald Citizen, Wisconsin's second largest newspaper. He was legislative director of the Wisconsin State Assembly Democratic Caucus, director of the Ford Foundation's Legislative Improvement Program in Minnesota, and the official photographer for the Minnesota Senate and United States Senate. He launched his own business, Chas Geer Photography, in 1979.  He is survived by his wife, Shirley Geer of Arlington, Va.; his brother, Dr. Mark Geer of Wellesley, Mass., his sister, Nancy Geer of South Portland; his brother- in-law, Thomas Killinger of Southington, Conn.; and four nephews and nieces. A memorial service will be held at 11 a.m. on Saturday, May 19, at the Breakers Inn, Higgins Beach, Scarborough. The burial is private. In lieu of flowers, contributions in Charley's memory can be made to: Leukemia Research Foundation 3520 Lake Ave., Suite #202 Wilmette, Illinois 60091-1064 Remembering Charley Geer We remember with sorrow those whom death has taken from our midst... In the glistening surf at sunrise on a Maine morning... We will remember him. In the silent aperture between the camera click and the inspired image... We will remember him. In the bouquet of a well-aged, Gevrey Chambertin burgundy... We will remember him. In the jubilation of his third hole-in-one... We will remember him. In the voice of a true friend, a loving husband, and a joyful spirit... We will remember him. He is now a part of us, as we remember him. Charles Robert Geer Jr.
