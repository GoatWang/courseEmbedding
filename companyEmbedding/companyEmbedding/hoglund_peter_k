                                Peter K. Hoglund ’48                  










By Princeton Alumni WeeklyPublished in the October 8, 2014 Issue








SEND A LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Pete was born in Bronxville, N.Y., Jan. 13, 1927, and died in Palo Alto, Calif., March 23, 2014.
He grew up in Europe, graduated from the Cranbrook School in Michigan, and, after serving a year in the Navy, graduated from Princeton in 1948. He majored in mechanical engineering and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Frank Wile ’47, Ed Wasson ’47, and Gene Harbeck were his roommates and lifelong friends. Other Hoglund Princetonians include brother William ’56; Pete’s son, Tom ’77; and granddaughter Erika ’14.
After graduation, Pete began a lifelong career with General Motors, first with the Electro-Motive Division in La Grange, Ill., then with the Euclid Division in Cleveland. He also held other management and executive assignments, including seven years with Euclid in Scotland, with Opel in Germany, opening up business for GM in China, and lastly with Electro-Motive, as division head and a corporate vice president.   His father and brother were both directors and senior officers of GM.
Pete married Janet Allen in 1952. The Hoglunds retired first to Hilton Head, S.C., but then established homes in Carmel, Calif., and Jackson Hole, Wyo., to be closer to grandchildren and the Tetons. Janet died in 2010. Pete is survived by his sons, William and Thomas; five grandchildren; and a great-grandson.
