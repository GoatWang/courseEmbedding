No Knowledge End-to-End Encryption







































Secure-by-Default Products

We built our products from the ground up with end-to-end encryption because we believe:


You shouldn't have to blindly trust your vendors.
When you have something worth protecting, privacy is everything.
Your data is yours, and should always be in your control.
Encryption should not sacrifice usability.

TRUST & NO KNOWLEDGE PRIVACY
SpiderOak has been building products on the principle of No Knowledge for over ten years. No Knowledge means we know nothing about the encrypted data you store on our servers. This unique design means nothing leaves your computer until after it is encrypted and is never decrypted until it is unlocked with your password on your computer. It's not just "end to end encryption;" it's a No Knowledge System.
PRIVACY USING STRONG ENCRYPTION
Cryptographic protections are a requirement for every byte of your data you send across a network, and we have been implementing strong encryption for years.

Your Password is hashed with multi-round and salted PBKDF2. PBKDF2 uses SHA-256 with over 16000 rounds, and a 32 byte Salt of random data.
Your Keys are unlocked with your password. Created with AES-256 in CFB mode and HMAC-SHA-256.
Your Data is encrypted with a new key for each file, folder, and version of your files. This allows us to backup multiple versions of the same file for historical retrieval and recovery.
Your Traffic is all encrypted over TLS/SSL. All network traffic is also protected by Certificate Pinning to prevent Man-in-the-Middle attacks.

CONTROL
With a distributed workforce and individuals having multiple machines, you need to ensure every file is backed up, every time. SpiderOak specializes in empowering business to have complete control over their data.


The Management Console is a one-stop hub for granular management of users and enforcing policy. Provision and manage accounts, set group policies and permissions, and gain oversight into your environment.


To enable an easy deployment we integrate with management tools, and enable remote policy configuration and provisioning; complete with Active Directory and LDAP integration.


Our Cloud or Yours, whether you are looking for SaaS solution, or want to host your own on-premises SpiderOak server, our team will help find the right strategy for you. SpiderOak's servers are a fully ACID compliant, use a redundant clustering file system, and handle redundant files to optimize traffic and storage.


USABILITY
The only way to get complete adoption is with a service that "just works" and "works everywhere", which is why SpiderOak specializes in creating solutions that take the pain out of encryption software, regardless of the operating system.


Our apps are truly cross platform, so that you can access your data from anywhere.


You can share files and folders easily via our password protected ShareRooms, to make collaboration and distribution trivial.


Feel free to "set and forget" the SpiderOak backup client, so your files are backed up automatically from boot to power-off.

4.0 out of 5 starsSecure and workableBydalerabyon August 23, 2013I had some issues when I first installed it and the fine manual isn't so fine and needs to be rewritten.  I wanted a more secure version of Dropbox for the purposes of sharing/backup of certain files.  I didn't care about backing up my home directory.  Anything I need backed up I can put into the Spideroak hive where I can access it on any one of my other computers.  The hive is analogous to the Dropbox, but apparently anything in the hive also has to be backed up, which uses up twice the space.  I like that it works with Linux, Windows & various Apple OS's.  I really like that it encrypts the data such that not even Spideroak's administrators can decrypt the files.  I also like the fact that it seems to be able to handle encryption and decryption of a variety of file formats.  So... rewrite the fine manual such that it really is a fine manual, eliminate the backup feature and just offer the hive, improve customer service a bit and you got a five star winner.

3.0 out of 5 starsGreat Service, but App FreezesByD. M. Seeleyon February 17, 2015I like Spider Oak as a sync app on my PCs, but the android version has issues. Trends to freeze, doesn't want to close when you're done. Needs work.

Password-less design. Unparalleled privacy.Get Started for FreeNo credit card required.“All content (including file attachments) is end-to-end encrypted so that even SpiderOak can’t read it. Easy to use and visually appealing.”Motherboard“If an attacker were to gain access to every corner of SpiderOak's corporate systems, it wouldn't let them read the conversations of the firm's customers. If you want to enjoy the benefits of collaboration apps and don’t want to give up on your privacy, you might want to consider (Semaphor).”The Daily Dot“Slack, Hipchat and other collaboration tools are the cool kids these days. And while they do a lot well...there's something missing that can cost you your business. Privacy. Let's just say (Semaphor) is like Slack, but WAAAAY more secure.”Inc“One nice feature of Semaphor that Slack doesn't have: the ability for individuals to pay their own way.”TechDirtProductivity, Meet Privacy & Usability.Privacy isn’t the only perk of Semaphor. Whether you are busy working on a project, organizing an event, or creating a discussion around a special topic, use Semaphor to help. Get started by creating as many Teams and Channels as you want. Then invite your friends, family, or coworkers. Start communicating and collaborating securely.

About SpiderOak























































Creating a secure-by-default world

We started building No Knowledge, secure-by-default software products 11 years ago to give you a choice in the marketplace. Just as you have the keys to your house, we believe you alone should have the keys to your data, whether at home
                        or work.
Our Vision
We envision a world where privacy is the default and end-to-end encryption is the standard, both online and in all of the technologies we use. Individuals and businesses should have full control over their data, who sees it, and when.
                        Security, privacy, convenience, and usability can become synonymous.
Our Mission
We aim to show individuals and businesses that they can 1) maintain sole ownership/viewership of their most important data, conversations, trade secrets, and intellectual property with No Knowledge  secure-by-default products, 2) while still having an enjoyable user experience, and 3) improve their productivity, efficiency, and communication without having to compromise their security
                        in the cloud.
Read the SpiderOak BlogSee what others say about us










The SpiderOak Team
We started SpiderOak in 2006 because we feel that everyone should be able to operate in complete confidence online and in the cloud, without fear of prying eyes or malicious actors. Our computers and phones should not make us vulnerable, but
                    instead be safe extensions and expressions of ourselves and our work.
We stake our reputation on our No Knowledge, end-to-end encrypted architecture, and the belief that privacy is the best security.

Veteran systems developer with 25 years of experience building robust and scalable distributed systems. Believes working online should be as private as meeting in person.
